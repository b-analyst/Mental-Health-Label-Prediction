'Cyclothymia or cyclothymic disorder is a mental illness which causes people to experience mood swings which, in turn, affect their ability to carry out everyday tasks. Cyclothymia is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. The changes in mood that people experience are beyond what most people regard as the normal ups and downs of everyday life. The person's mood may change from feeling depressed to feeling very happy and energetic. However, these changes in mood are not extreme enough, nor do they last long enough, to qualify for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.'

Bipolar UK | Home
Cyclothymia

Individuals experience mood swings but at a much lower level. Symptoms must last for a period of at least two years, with no period longer than two months in which there has been a stable state and no mixed episodes. Although individuals diagnosed with cyclothymia are on the bipolar spectrum, the relative mildness of the mood swings means you are not diagnosed with bipolar. However cyclothymia can develop into bipolar."

2,Hi all I've been recently diagnosed with eupd and bipolar and ADHD as you can imagine a bit of a shock I've been experiencing psychosis as just came to speak to people in the same situation
3,"ever feel like you're part of a production?
being watched and recorded?
i do all the time.
i guess it could be worse.
it's not even paranoia.
it's just a thing that happens to me a lot.
delusional i guess."
4,"I find I am looking for the pat on the back type of validation for all the mini accomplishments I get up to.  I live alone and feel like people want there to be substance before I reach out to them.  This is just a self imposed perspective, to a degree I don't adhere to it.  
I created a company website and it includes a blog as a lifestyle consultant. I reached out to a dozen people to ask for feedback and only 10:1 type of non reply to response came back. 
Often times I feel the craving to attention seek. It's not loneliness, I was just over at a good friends and sharing with them. It's attention seeking, wanting the pat on the back by acquaintances and strangers. 
I clicked refresh on my gmail several times an hour all day. I am left feeling the void. In this instance it seems rational that the people I reached out to for the website feedback are not going to engage promptly. But my craving and attention seeking demand I have is not rational. 

I have bipolar and am extremes of moods, extremes of attention seeking. 

Does anyone else have tips for releasing pent up attention seeking?  I try to practice patience, but that is so difficult and really barely treating the symptom not the source.  Speaking out on this forum is a form of release - do you think it is healthy?  Should I be more guarded to continue to try and suffocate public feedback desires.. I feel like staying in my bubble and only reaching the eyes/ears of my close friends and family is not healthy either.  There is a different tone and mannerism when speaking to the general public, and I think it helps to broaden my personality by not staying shut up in my bubble."

7,"i got into a disagreement with my best friend who is bipolar and went off their meds cold turkey. there was still an issue we needed to resolve, but they told me they didn't want to talk to me about it anymore for their mental health, and when i explained that i still need to they got so angry at me they ended our friendship. i was SO confused they ended the friendship over something so small. is this normal behavior for a bipolar person? did they really mean they want to end things?"

9,"I've been suffering from excessive thirst and dry mouth, and having to pee every 45 minutes for several years from my lithium side effects.
I had to drink about 6 gallons of water a day and it was torture.
recently about two months ago, i had the idea that i wasn't getting enough salt, and i tried this brand of salt i use
""redmond real salt"" it's a pink salt from utah. but himalayan pink salt may work as well.
it seems to make a difference what type i use. 
 because i've tried celtic sea salt too and that didn't work very well.

but anyways i mixed 1/4 tsp of the redmond real salt with a glass of water and stirred it up till it dissolved and i drank it and my dry mouth and excessive thirst symptoms went away! i've also stopped craving pickles and salty food as much, i used to eat a ton of pickles!
so the amount of salt in my diet hasn't become excessive. i sweat a lot too i work out everyday i need it.
i also took a fasting lipids blood test 2 weeks later and everything was ok my doctors said.
it's been a HUGE relief not having to constantly guzzle and pee all day, it can't be healthy..

I've read that lithium competes with the absorption of electrolytes in the body and lithium can cause hyponatremia (low blood sodium(salt))
and that's real bad. and if you have too low of sodium in your body lithium levels can also become very toxic.

I've noticed it only takes 4 or 5 dashes from a salt shaker in a cup of water to help me get rid of those symptoms
I've read about a study where people that drank some salty water needed less water because the body retains more water and hydrates better when they did that. 
This might help, just thought i should share this...

i'm not a doctor, consult your doctor, anything you do is at your own risk, always do your own research. :)"
10,"Hi everyone!
So I'm bipolar 2 and recently came off lithium. The initial plan was for me to start on lamotrigine but because the tapering caused depression and insomnia, I was put on quetiapine (300 mg) instead to help with sleep, which helps a little. I am still mildly depressed, but that's OK, I had that on lithium as well. I now sleep a few hours instead of hardly any, so that's improved too. But it's still not good. I also experience irritability and anger that I didn't have on lithium. 

I feel I'm in a mixed sort of state with restlessness, irritability, anger and insomnia, paired with mild depression. It's horrible. 

So now my pdoc advised Depakote.
Are there people on here who use it? Does it help with sleep and irritability/anger?
More specifically, is anyone on quetiapine AND Depakote, and how does that combo work for you? Do you have side effects?

Thanks so much."
11,"just curious what meds everyone takes for bipolar. im diagnosed as bipolar II with mixed episodes. my meds are:
lithium 750mg
abilify 10mg
seroquel 300mg
adderall so i can stay awake
i have been taking these meds at various doses for the past 15 years. ive been episode free about 5 years. lots of side effects though, i am prediabetic and have descreased kidney function which doc says are caused by the meds but that the benefits outweigh the risks."
12,"bipolar is a tricky thing because we get depressed over and over and over forever. so we have to get good at adapting to it. one of the tricks is to recognize that when it comes you have to let go of all the things high (or even normal) levels of serotonin allows you to do:

-more energy
-more power
-more intelligence
-more self esteem
-more pleasure

so with low serotonin you have to be willing to let go of all those things and the abilities and accomplishments that come from them.

with depression you have to be willing to be more tired, more stupid, more sluggish, more weak, more slow, more lazy, more pain, etc... and the lowered ability to do external things your used to doing

the faster you let all that go and make peace with it the better off you will be. because then you get your integrity back, your not mad with yourself and life for not having those things.

its just like if someone goes to prison. they better make peace with having less real quick. otherwise they are just going to suffer more."
13,"I've just watched Into The Wild on Amazon Prime.  A bit long but worth a watch to see how someone might isolate him/herself to deal with a traumatic childhood (although nothing compared to a lot of us!) and other people's expectations of you. And a man on a learning curve (who has a lot to learn bless him).  His last words are ""Happiness is only real when shared.""  I'm just thinking of all the times I've been manic, and bought stuff I don't need and don't use, and I think he's right.  Most of us have been isolated for the last year and I am just wondering what other people's experiences are and what they think of this idea?  With the loss of loved ones, the loss of our freedom and the loss of choice about what we can do with our lives, where does that leave us spiritually and as individuals in the crazy place we are occupying right now?"
14,"I had a psychotic episode 11 years back but that was due to stress and a lot going on. At this point, I was diagnosed with undifferentiated sz and then schizoaffective.

Ten years and no psychosis, the psychiatrist decided it was ok to take me off the antipsychotic and put me on a mood stabaliser instead. The mood stabaliser gave me side effects so I had to come off it. I was still struggling with anxiety so they put me on Sertraline alone. I had a really bad psychosis which landed me in hospital after this. The psychiatrist believes it's a mood disorder which I assume means bipolar.

All I remember from it is I was struggling to make sense of what time it was, I spent a lot on books, and I wasn't sleeping properly. I was also very irritable. And thinking people could hear my thoughts. All this happened during psychosis though. I even tried to run away thinking I was getting on a train to America to save the world or something stupid."
15,"Once I got a look at my chart and noticed the histronic features added there.
After reading up on it, I thought it was a mistake.  How could I be these things? (HPD) Histronic Personality Disorder has some socially troubling aspects.
I have since learned that a lot of the features in the array of other disorders overlap on bipolar disorder.  In that, I may not have the disorder but the symptoms can show up.
Upon reading the HPD symptoms I could relate to some, just as I can in other disorders, especially during mania.  It was a good thing to learn and had less stigma attached the label."

I assumed the extra hair in the shower was just because I wasn’t bothering to brush my hair or washing it as regularly, so more noticeable when I did.

20,"Hi forum, 

Hope you are all having a good evening. 

I'm proud of what the progress that I have made this past year. After finally coming to terms with my condition, seeking out help, rough patches, trial and error with meds; I finally feel that I am in a good place in life. I've set myself goals and have taken steps to achieve them

However, I'm having doubts as to whether I will be able to sustain this progress to bring things full-circle. Recently, a very good friend of mine passed away which affected me very deeply. And through the process of grief, I fell out of routine, fell back into some old habits and drinking a little too much etc. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that he is gone. 

Nevertheless, I cannot shake the feeling that my efforts are redundant and in vain. These niggling doubts that I am having are slowly eating away at me and are discouraging me from pushing forward. I would not say that I am depressed, as my mood is well controlled by medication; but I am down. Maybe its grief, maybe anixety. I am going to go see a psychologist to tackle these issues. I know that these problems take long to get better; but my motivation needs to get better fast. 

Any advise or encouragement will be greatly appreciated. 

-H"
21,"Hi all,
My husband of 17 years had a severe manic episode 4 months ago that resulted in him hopping on a plane with nothing but the clothes on his back and ending up on the streets of a city far away. After a few weeks he reached out to me and we have been intermittently talking by phone but he hasn't given me his exact location until very recently; now he is living/camping on a friend's piece of land. He doesn't exhibit many of the signs of mania anymore but is still adamant that he is divorcing me and not coming back home. He wants to come for a visit to take care of some things and to pack up his car and ship it to his new location. 
I have been waiting for 4 long months for him to get to the point of coming home but this isn't what I expected; I wanted him to come home and rebuild his life with me and my support. He insists he is not ""mentally ill"" and that it was his decision to get on the plane and ""start a new life"". He refuses treatment of any kind; wont' even talk to a professional because ""there's nothing wrong with me"". 
I am not excited about his visit at all. At this point I don't even want him here making me feel sad and scared and awkward in my own home. Not only am I now dealing with the trauma of him disappearing and having an episode and all that went along with it, now I am dealing with the trauma and grief of a divorce that I don't want.
He wants to act like we are buddies and nothing is wrong and that we are amicably splitting up. Its infuriating . I mean, wouldn't you want to talk and work it out after 17 years? We haven't even gone to ONE counseling session. He just wants to come pack some things and take care of logistics, ship his car down there. That to me says he's not even thinking about reconsidering his choice to stay there so whats the point? Don't even come then! He says he wants to talk to me about what happened in person though, not by phone. I fear he will try to just sweep everything under the carpet as is his pattern but I won't allow it because this condition impacts me as well as him.
How should I approach this situation? Be gentle with him and just wait until he is ready to talk about it or allow him to act like everything is cool and avoid the topic? I was thinking I could schedule an apt with a marriage counselor and if he is willing to go under the guise of ""help us figure out how to move forward with divorce"" and see what comes out during the session. If he says no I will cancel it.
Suggestions? Seriously, if he doesn't have me in his life there will be NOBODY there for him next time an episode happens."
22,"Husband has had a stressful year and takes lamotrigine 100mg but couple of days ago hes gone manic and won't take his medication. He even went to the doctor and got zoplicone but refuses to take it. What do I do hes pushing his family away. Hes driving everywhere, drinking alcohol, very bad mood swings, hyper, 100 different jobs and not finishing them, shopping sprees and not sleeping maybe 2 hours a day. He was diagnosed in 2018 so that's the last time he had a episode. Its draining me and I gave 2 small kids and working while he is stopped going work and spending all his last wages and out all day all night. It lasted 4 months last time I think he stopped taking his medication. I can't even talk to him as worried he going to go crazy at me and il make it worse. I know that's hes not him but it makes me so angry whst he does and says but I have to remember his brain is taken over. Any easy tips on bringing his mania down and how long does it take."
23,"Trigger warning ⚠ drinking

Does anyone else self medicate with alcohol? It started a few months ago. It was 2-3 drinks 1-2 nights a week. The last two weeks it’s been 2-4 drinks for 3-4 days. Sometimes it’s day drinking. Sometimes it’s at night. I’m a SAHM with a Velcro baby. I can’t get anything done during the day without them screaming when I put them down. I’m so exhausted mentally, physically, emotionally, etc. My baby is not in danger. I’m just finding it impossible to cope with a screaming baby and a disaster of a house."
24,"Sorry In advance because I am manic right now and my thoughts are everywhere and this is my first post here. I’m 25F and have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and social anxiety. I haven’t been able to go places on my own for about 2 years and have been constantly depressed for 2 years along with periods of rage. I now have paranoia that I’ve never had before, I feel like all of my neighbors can hear me inside of my apartment and feel like they’re listening to my conversations. When I go places I feel like everyone is making fun of me or knows that I’m mentally ill. I constantly feel like people have ill intentions and are out to get me. My fiancé and I moved out of our hometown almost a year ago and I’ve been spiraling ever since because my parents were my support system. I have been really dependent on him and when he goes out with friends or by himself I get really paranoid and feel upset with him and it’s not fair to him. I feel like he is going to leave me for someone who has their shit together. He is growing more impatient and less supportive, calling me names And telling me I’m useless right now. I went through a really bad manic phase and quit my job. I’ve been suicidal, I don’t think I would ever actually do it but I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to the possibility of actually doing it. I feel like I’m drowning and I’m now going into these fits of rage that I’m having trouble controlling. I don’t want to go into the hospital but I’m not sure what to do. I am also a mom so it is important that I get it together so my child can have the mom that they deserve and don’t grow up with trauma because of me. I used to take kolonopin for my anxiety and I was able to function but I made the decision to stop taking it almost a year ago because I was worried about long term effects because I had been taking it for 2-3 years. I currently take 100mg of lamotrigine. It helps but it makes me really unproductive and feel slow most days. I skip days so I can get things done ie. cleaning, calling to make appointments etc. I try not to self diagnose but Sometimes I feel like I may suffer from bpd also, but at the same time I can be a hypochondriac and worry too much about health. 
anyways I’m not functioning like an adult right now and not really able to care for myself. At what point did you guys consider checking into the mental hospital? What did you do on your situation and what was the outcome? I’m on the verge of losing everything and NEED to be able to take care of myself so I can be a good mother. I just want to be able to go enjoy things in life again, function independently and give my child the life they deserve. Please be kind.

Also hearing your mental health success stories would be appreciated"
25,"if a bipolar person is hyper irritable during a hypomanic episode, is it normal that they get incredibly drained by having to have serious / vulnerable conversations? this happened with me and my friend, and they told me they couldn't talk about it anymore because it was bad for their mental health to talk about it, then i pushed that because i felt it still needed to be addressed and they got really angry at me. i now understand why it was so bad to push in the context of their having bipolar, but i didn't know anything about it at the time. any insight?"

28,"Hello, 

I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder after having a complete psychological breakdown that included intense paranoia. I have started Serequel daily. I also have Gabapentin for panic attacks on an as needed basis. I have been doing research and trying to wrap my head around the diagnosis. I am thankful to have an actual diagnosis and treatment available to help feel better, but I have had a really rough couple of days. I started a log that tracks my diet, mental thoughts, physical symptoms, events that could be possible triggers and things I did to try and improve my mental state. I did this in an effort to share with my new therapist in an effort to find a pattern and ways to better help myself. Today I had a feeling that no one around me really understands what it is like to live this way and their attempts to normalize and relate by saying ""we all have those days"" or offer up possible reasons for my mind state today just irritated me. I know they are trying to help and I know they love me. They are doing their best just like me, but I thought joining a forum with people who TRULY understand may be beneficial for me. This post has two purposes. First to say hello and second to find out if anyone has any recommendations for self care while in a depressive episode, and recommendations for a person newly diagnosed. I am just looking for come comfort and support during one of the hardest times of my life. I know my therapist will help with coping skills, but right now I feel very lost and alone."

I've been on the trileptal for a few days and noticed that I feel very drugged which is OK but I also notice that I'm having some vision issues. Not horrible but just kind of dizziness and also just kind of blurriness or like I'm starting to black out - just fuzziness. I have read about the eye movement and a few times thought I was experiencing that but it hasn't been bad and is not all the time.

Has anyone else experienced the vision issues with this medicine? Can it be a long term problem if you stay on it and it's causing you issues? Will my body get used to this and the vision problems go away? Any help is appreciated, thanks."
31,"Hi All-

I am a 47 year old male with bipolar II and extreme social anxiety.  I have been out of work for a year and a half and just started a job last week.  There is an extreme amount of pressure from family that I succeed at this job.  I had massive anxiety attacks on my first days of the job but still was able to barely function.  The last half of the first week was better than the beginning.  I was just starting to make connections with other co-workers and my boss tells everyone that we aren't allowed to talk about ""non-work"" topics which is killing me because I need to make real connections with my co-workers.  Anyway I am scared shitless about performing well on the job.  My memory is terrible so I have to right everything down.  I am constantly comparing myself to others there who have been there for years and telling myself that I should know more even though its my first week.  I mentally beat myself all day long and it is exhausting.  I am just scared that I can never hold down a job long term.  It makes me think I will be homeless somebody or terribly poor.  Looking for support from the group.  Thanks!"
32,"Hey I’m new here and I just wanted to share some thoughts and maybe get some mild feedback.
I’ve seen a handful of doctors and all of them seem to think that some different medications and the person before is going to work to reduce my mania episodes that occur daily. I do believe that in certain circumstances people should be medicated and if you found a medication that works for you then that’s great I’m happy for you. But I have not.
I typically wake up in the first 5 to 6 hours of my day are absolute garbage, I feel like crap emotionally, depressed, don’t feel like participating in much at work… And then at about lunchtime which is 11 o’clock for me, it really starts to change and flips complete 180… Introduce manic episode… So I found that eating well (for me lots of meat protein and veggies) and eating regularly every 2 to 3 hours helps me feel nourished and gives me a little kick of energy and I’ve also found that when I get home from work and I’m feeling this way if I go out to my gym and pump some iron that I can usually burn off some of that energy or that heightened sense of craziness, But then there’s the part of me also that has challenges not drinking alcohol on a daily basis and I found that alcohol helps everything but only temporarily. I have this thought in my head that if I can get to a certain way certain body fat in a certain physique that I will finally learn to love myself which I do not in the least right now.

anybody got advice on what works for them without medication?

As a closing thought I should probably add that every day driving home from work I feel like a crazy man and I get extreme satisfaction driving 100+ miles an hour on the back roads 20 miles to my house passing cars with no regard to safety. I know it’s not safe and my wife thinksThat’s how I’m “gonna go” but I’m not scared. And it feeds me mentally like I can’t believe"

Iv realized for much of my life its been bouncing between these 2. In between that on a daily basis my mood can change super fast, Ill be super happy and social to all of a sudden being passive aggressive and wanting to be alone and hating people even though nothing bad has happened. However sometimes I feel nothing, im just there but not really. Throughout the day my emotions are very rocky from feeling great to feeling worthless. My dad was diagnosed bipolar 1 (maybe its genetic?)"
34,"I’m interested to know how many years you had symptoms before being diagnosed bipolar. What finally happened before the diagnosis? I think I had symptoms, mostly depression when I was in high school, but wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar until I was in my 40s. I was working the night shift for several years which I think set off the mania which led into a years long depression and was finally diagnosed. In the end I’m glad I was diagnosed bipolar so I could get on the right medication."

So I'm guessing my symptoms were psychosomatic caused by what was going on in my brain?
I can't find any literature on it.

anyway, in one of these manic episodes, he started to develop a kind of tourette - he cant help himself not to say „u-pup-up” in the midlle of the sentence ori even when he kept his mouth shut. After some hours he started to accompaniate those sounds with uncontrolled convulsive movements of his left arm. 
has anyone with bipolar experienced this kind of pseudotourette manifestation?

44,"I'm learning as much as I can about BP. 
My brother had a severe form and took his life.
As for me, I have experienced 1 depression which resolved over a few weeks.  In 2002.
Almost 20 years later, I had a severe depression under lockdown , with Psychosis and a suicide attempt. 

I knew and still know my brother's disorder. I lived with him for 20 years. 
So, during lockdown, towards the end of my stay, I began to exercise. I mean , really exercise. I was drug resistant but they kept pumping me. 
I began to sweat out the depression. Began to feel GREAT. I felt balanced and I felt well. 
It was lifting. 
Amazingly, and co-incidentally, I had been put on Lithium as a last resort. 
To my surprise, I was given a BP diagnosis. I asked what type. They didn't say. 
They said it was because I took to Lithium so well! 
I couldn't believe it, but I didn't care at the time , as I was well ! Who cares, I'll take anything. 
No periods of Hypomania or mania. No ups and downs. Just a couple of depressions ( admittedly the second was major. But I know that Lockdown created the conditions for major instability. 

Anyway, they said "" you might have had a Manic episode and never noticed ""
Well, I can tell you. . I'm married with kids and k how my wife 12 years and in all that time - no mania, even on a minor level. 
As I said , on Lthium and it takes its toll. A lot of people swear by it as a life changer. Man, it is robbing me of my emotions. Good for mania. And depression. 
Only thing it does for me , is helps me sleep. 
 
But I have problems with this "" maybe it's not BP disorder, but we will label you ""and treat accordingly.
I would describe myself as at risk for BP disorder. But at 42 years of age to suddenly get this diagnosis, is inaccurate. One psych describe me as "" at risk "" for BP.
I just wanna get some opinions. 

Is there anyone out there who has no history of BP but ends up with a diagnosis of BP?"
45,"I have set everything in motion with regards to hopefully going back to work with a bipolar 2 diagnosis, which I understood I was being treated for.  I asked for clarification/confirmation from my Care Coordinator for the purposes of moving forward with getting back to work under a protected characteristic, with the support that comes with that.  She has just emailed me to say that the Psychiatrist has given me a diagnosis of Cyclothymia.  After googling, this seems a bit like bipolar lite?  Honestly, I feel a bit upset.  Had just got my head around what I thought was my diagnosis and now feel my experiences have been minimised.  Will this make a difference to the support I’ll get trying to get back to work?  It seems from Google that it isn’t serious enough to qualify for benefits anyway, so I’ll have to anyway.  Does anyone have any experience of similar or words of wisdom?"
46,"Did anybody experience any negatives when tapering off Lithium?
Did it cause sleep problems when you tapered it? If so, how long?"
47,"I finally got to see my psychiatrist and talk about what’s on my mind. She prescribed sertlaline. I now have started taking it, well one dose so far but I hate feeling anxious and on the edge so I’ll give it a try, it has helped in the past but I can’t remember how exactly, maybe someone has any experience with it?

My lithium carbonate blood levels dropped too low due to little eating... and of course I started experiencing mood swings again and whenever I have a depressive episode I feel like I'm going to kill someone I hear these voices and I can't live normally I don't even notice how I start planning already and then I feel like I'm going crazy... I told my psychiatrist about this he said I need medication correction and need to register to clinic. And I tried but I can't now because there's no available times this month so I'll be able only next month so what do I do until then..i already experienced such thoughts before and I almost killed someone but ended up trying to kill myself..please someone. Thank you.
50,"Dear forum,

Therapy has been something that I have been wanting to do for a while now. Aside from my bipolar, I also suffer from anxiety and certain patterns of negative thinking. I also suffered from panic attacks in the past. My medication works great for controlling my mood swings, but has little to no effect on my general background level of anxiety. I'm not keen on taking anxiety meds such as Valium because they are addictive and harmful in the long run or antidepressants such as Prozac because they can destablise bipolar. In any case, I don't thinking more medication is the answer, since no medication has shown to treat Generalised Anxiety Disorder.

As such, last week I had an initial consulation with a psychotherpist. I am currently very strapped for cash, so this therapy was part of a programme to provide low cost psychotherapy for low-income people. I think its great that they are running such as scheme, but it also means that I might not get the best treatment possible. The psychologist that assessed me was only a trainee. She was a nice enough lady and gave me some decent advice, however, I could tell that she wasn't massively experienced. Of course its hard to judge from just one session, especially since it was only an initial consultation where she mostly just sat back, listened and tried to identify the key problems rather than a full blow therapy session where we actually address these problems. Nevertheless, I do have some reservations.

What are some of your experiences with therapy? Do you find it helpful? Does it complement the rest of your treatment well? What are some of the key areas I ought to focus when tackling anxiety in therapy?"
51,"All my consistency is ruined due to my episodes. I try to commit to things to better my future (saving money, making and keeping friends, taking medication, eating healthy, taking care of myself, having hobbies, therapy etc) but then it all gets lost in the cycle. I can't keep doing this it's literally ruining me and everything I have. I want to go to school and have a career and have a home and a family but i just feel so hopeless. Even when I'm so motivated through mania or even just naturally occuring motivation (which is very very sadly rare) either life throws something new right in my face and knocks me on my ass again or the depressive episode kicks in and i decompose for a month and fuck it all up. I'm so tired of this everything just gets lost in my head and in the cycle and i don't even know what to do. I have no friends since i think everyone hates me so i just go quiet until they stop talking to me. sometimes ill message them in my manic episodes but I've realized thats probably exhausting for them for me to ghost them so i just let it fall off these days. My family relations are screwed. I don't have a car or transportation of my own. I try to take my meds and then a manic episode will come and i'll decide im cured and i dont need them and stop. And i actually always believe it no matter how many times i've reminded myself that it's in my head and I DO need themand that i do this every fucking time. then the depressive phase comes around and im like well i stopped taking them so whats the point in starting them up again? and i just keepgoing onandonand onand i just want it to stop. im so tired of this and i have no one who understands me. literally not a single soul. im not even being overdramatic right now, I'm 18 and I have no one. I sit in my room and stare at the wall at night. No hobby I have is fun anymore. When I'm manic i just write lists. I write lists and lists and lists and stay up all nighton my phone and i post random stuff online that i dont really have a reason to post and i'll text people i havent texted in months andthen its all empty again. idk what to do how do i bemore consistent it just all gets ruined"

55,"I didn't know where to put this, as there doesn't seem to be an anger management forum, which may be for the best. lol

Anyhow, I have a... Had, a friend from my childhood who, over the past few years, has turned into an absolute monster. I know the significance of what I'm saying there, and I don't use that term ""monster"" lightly. He and I are no longer friends, obviously. And haven't spoken a word to one another since early last year.

A bit of background info: he and I went to school together. He was truly once an amazing person. He helped me though my high school years to not commit suicide. I owe him for that, even still. He was 18 when his mother got his little sister taken away by DHS, so he moved in with me and my family and we had temporary custody of her. Over the next two years, he and my mother butted heads more and more, and it eventually resulted in an explosive night where he took off in the car she had bought him after he assaulted her. Police couldn't find him, so we dropped it, just wanting to leave well enough alone.

I come back in contact with him last year, only to find out that his dad had died and he had picked up some heavy drug use. He also was now in a different state living with his girlfriend at the time. Some time later, I find out that he had verbally, physically, and sexually abused her and also roped her into drug use after they moved together.

Like an idiot, I decided to contact his now ex-girlfriend and try to figure out why he was acting different. She starts opening up slowly over time and that's how I found all this out. I honestly had trouble believing it all, so I confronted him and he admitted to it all. I blocked him and that was that.

Still to this day I get angry thinking about the injustice of it all, and to compound that I haven't seen his ex on FB since January and I'm worried about that, cause my friend is dangerous, for reasons I'd rather not get not right now. I need to, for my own sake, just freakin' drop it. To figure out why I can't seem to. Something! If I unblock him it'll get ugly, and he knows where I live still. Ugh..."

58,"Hi,

After being hospitalised twice in 2020 due to mania/psychosis I am now trying to be really mindful of my moods. 

I had been in a depressive phase from late Oct last year. This week I feel my mood has really lifted. I want to think it is the depression lifting but it feels maybe 'too much' for just this - very energetic, racing head, lots of plans and ideas, words and phrases I'm hearing linking to song lyrics (which I know definitely happens in mania for me), not feeling tired despite my sleep being very poor for a good few weeks.

Can depression switch to possible start of mania so suddenly? Feel like other times I've had a bit of a gap between lows and highs.

On one hand this feels so great after a few months of feeling so depressed but equally I don't want it to run if it is going to end up in full manic episode/psychosis again."

60,"I need help.



My boyfriend just broke up with me.



We were incredibly happy until a couple weeks ago, when in a bad week caused by stress, depression and anxiety I told him he was taking too long to reply to my messages (we are LDR). It was so dumb, I was overreacting and I wish I hadn’t done it, but my moods were all over the place. He was shocked when I told him but didn’t see the problem, still he started replying faster because according to him he was scared I’d get mad again. Knowing this hurt my feelings and we ended up fighting. He said some pretty hurtful things but didn’t seem to realise. We made up but he wasn’t changing his behaviour, which FOR SOME REASON triggered my anxiety. It’s not something that’s normal for me as I’ve never cared about this type of things, but I was having an incredibly bad week and my intrusive thoughts decided to act up. I told him a few times that if he didn’t feel like he could change then we could just be friends, which he avoided until our final fight (all within the same week) when he told me that we should do it. The truth is I only told him this because my then anxious brain was convinced he was falling out of love, but it still broke my heart when he just agreed by saying we should be friends for now at least.

I was still anxious and hurt so I told him I wouldn’t want to try again, which was a lie. 



Quick note: my ex suffers from bipolar and OCD. He has his routines and rituals and can get distracted by them very easily, which is what stirred my anxiety when I was in one of my lows. He currently receives therapy and takes medication to sleep. 



We’ve talked about it more because I’m struggling to understand his reasons, and these is what he said. He said that he didn’t want the fights to keep going and he didn’t see himself changing anytime soon (he means his time management, which I haven’t told him but is something I can get used to) as when we dated he was hypomanic and therefore felt more social and found it easier to stay in touch with people. He told me he was scared of having another depressive episode as he wasn’t hypomanic anymore. He also said that me asking him to reply faster led him to feel pressured and that his avoidant, protective and anxious traits blew the whole situation out of proportion and made him hide in his shell. He says these made him feel numb and that he didn’t understand his thoughts or feelings, but he was convinced changing his time management was something he couldn’t overcome and therefore we couldn’t be together. He told me once that his romantic feelings for me weren’t there anymore, and then he admitted that this was an exaggeration out of panic because he didn’t know how to explain what he felt. He said that the pressure made him realise we were going a bit too fast (although we already knew this but we were willing to work through it as we were in love) and that he thought the best would be to take a step back and rethink everything. That it’s not like his feelings for me were just gone, and that not all of them were. He keeps mentioning he feels anxious and numb, but does this mean there is a chance he could still love me but the numbness and his obsessive thoughts (as he calls them) make him believe otherwise?



It’s my first time dealing with a situation like this and the truth is that I am completely heartbroken. We had a beautiful, healthy and supportive relationship. Literally the happiest I’ve ever been with someone. I feel like he’s just too good to let go of so easily and I desperately want him back. I fell for him knowing he was/is bipolar and my feelings haven’t changed. We’ve always listened to each other and were very open about our mental health, but now that this is happening I need to know if there’s any hope we can still be together or if I should just give up. I want to ask him, but I don’t want to overwhelm him or make him feel pressured. I want to understand and I want to be supportive, even if it means I have to be more patient that I would normally be. If there is any hope for us I’m willing to wait and give him space, but if there isn’t I am gonna have to pull away for my own mental health. He has made it clear that we should still be friends and doesn’t want us to stop talking, but when I ask about his feelings he says he’s numb and confused so I am full of questions. These questions are killing me and I’m struggling a lot because my overly working brain keeps coming up with all these theories and thoughts and feelings. Could it be possible that this is a temporary result of his avoidant traits towards conflict (note: he doesn’t have an avoidant attachment style just some traits)? Could his bipolar have something to do with this? He’s always said that isolating himself has been a coping mechanism and that made him lose people. Could it be possible that the numbness and confusion will clear away with time and he’ll realise he still loves me? People tell me that he may have just been infatuated and that he may have wanted to break up from before, but I know that’s not the case. I’m a 100% sure in fact. This is all a result of a really bad and tense week, but is that enough to end his feelings for me forever? Please help me, and please don’t think I’m trying to pin it all on his mental health as I really don’t want to be insensitive. It’s just my first time falling for someone with bipolar and I just want to understand. Should I talk to him about it (again) now or give him time? What if giving him time kills any feeling he may (hopefully) still have for me? Or if I give him time and overthink all this while he actually doesn’t feel anything.



We’re now talking as friends btw."
61,I wonder will I feel anything today or will it be another grey day. Flashes of causing myself pain. Each day they get a little stronger. I can't stay motivated long enough to get help. All of my friends have given up on me and I don't blame them. I exist to provide for my kids but I'm slowly crumbling apart and someday nothing will be left.

63,"I had to admit my 12 yo old after something very bad happened to her about 4 weeks ago. Of course, I wasn't told about it until 2 days after we put her in the hospital. She had become so unstable by the time we put her in she was.litterally fighting for her life for about 8 days. We were so discouraged at her making no progress to this point. The last 2 nights she said she is starting to feel a tiny bit of hope and feel differently than she had in the past year. We've been struggling to make very little progress until now. I'm so encouraged to her hope in her voice.  She's not crying constantly or pissed off at the world. She had also been misdiagnosed initially with severe depressive disorder when in fact she's bipolar like her mom and 3 sisters. Anyway, thank you for letting me share my glimmer of hope with you all. I know I rambled, but I need to share this for someone I feel.  Just be patient. It's a long process to come back to being functional again. It had our entire family very distraught. But that's slowly fading."

Well I had yet another fight with him. I came home from work. I work in retail. And apparently I smelled like perfume. I don’t wear any myself. I couldn’t smell a thing on me. He ordered me to take a shower immediate when we got inside. And when I tried to explain that yes we do sell perfume, and people are trying tester there and so on. He didn’t believe me, sayd thinks two minutes and get your lies straight and then tell me the lies.
When I tried to continue with the story that I work with girls and we have in the back bunch of old testers and it was valentines day and someone may have put perfume on, I don’t know. I really don’t know how I smelled. Never have I before smelled after work. He sayd if I don’t shut up right now he’s gonna get dressed and go outside. So I stopped saying anything.
and now I don’t know what to do. I already have strong anxiety and I know I’m not well,I’m not happybut I am happy with him, I never ever wanna be without him.
I’m just so hurt and confused. I’m hurt that he’s hurting himself by believing what he comes up in his head. I’m hurt that this hurts me. 
what advice anyone has? Anything?
Hopefully you had good weekend."

68,"Hi all,

I'm new here and I've never done anything like this but I figured maybe someone out there is struggling with the same thing and can help. I'd like to provide some background as to what led up to my hospitalization and my journey after. I hope you'll have the patience to read through all of it. 

About a year and a half ago I was in my last semester at college. I was reading and watching a lot of mind expanding content, including documentary series about nature and religion and how everything is interconnected. I was taking a course called Psychedelic Anthropology where we were reading and discussing topics like consciousness and the psyche, neuroscience, spirituality, and the advantages of using psychedelic plants mindfully and intentionally. I was also taking a Movement course in which I was learning how to become embodied and listen to my body as well as my final seminar in Film Making. (I promise this all is important) At the time I was on Effexor for depression and was smoking a lot of weed. 

One night I couldn't sleep and I had the urge to return to a screenplay I was writing. I stayed up all night researching and finishing it. Throughout the next few days, I continued to get increasingly more and more euphoric and deeper into a state of psychosis. In this state I was experiencing what I called a spiritual awakening. Everything was significant and synchronistic. I felt the universe within me and me within it. I embodied God and had such a strong vision for unity amongst all people, especially my family. 

There's so many details I could go into, but perhaps they're not important. What is important is that this experience was so powerful and beautiful and sacred to me. However, I was very public about it- posting on social media, reaching out to family and friends, professors, and employers. I even got int front of two of my classes and ranted about my spiritual awakening and how we could all come together to put on a music festival/ form something called art church. It wasn't until I was on my kitchen floor seemingly ""giving birth"" and claiming to be the second coming of Christ that my friends called my Mom and my therapist and we all decided it was time to go to the hospital. 

While I was in the hospital I was still experiencing these intense synchronicities and experiencing myself as Christ. Every person and word being said, every painting, every picture, every song was somehow a reassurance of what was happening in my head. As if there was a very thin veil separating my internal experience and the external world around me. 

I was in an agreeable, happy, excited state until the doctor came in to speak to me. The moment I looked into his eyes I flipped and became very aggressive and tried to attack him as I believed him to be the Devil who was trying to end the world. I have never in my life been aggressive or over taken by anger. I was restrained, sedated, and locked in a room. I believed myself to have ""lost the game"" and that the forces of evil defeated me and the world was to end. The moment before I went unconscious from what I now understand was the Haldol, I experienced the universe coming to a single point. I was everything and nothing all at once. 

I was released after a week, but despite being on heavy antipsychotics I was still experiencing these synchronicities in everything- songs, books, billboards, conversations happening around me. What once was so comforting, reassurance that everything is interconnected and that God exists in all things and within me, now terrified me. In the following weeks after my hospitalization the intensity of the synchronicities decreased and somehow I finished school, continued to work, and live on my own. 

After working with multiple psychiatrists and trying multiple medications, now almost two years later I am on 125mg of Lamotrigine and stable. I haven't had another manic episode and only experienced one deep depressive episode around the 1 year anniversary of my hospitalization. I've spent this time trying to understand my experience both from a scientific, Western, medicinal point of view and a mystical, spiritual, Eastern philosophy point of view. 

I still see these synchronicities all the time. In a different way than before though. It's hard to explain, but I believe everything to be happening for a reason and that sometimes the movies I'm watching or the music I'm listening to or the conversations I'm having are exactly what I need to hear. I so easily find lessons and insight in everything. 

These synchronicities bring me comfort sometimes and sometimes they terrify me. I'm terrified that I'm losing touch with reality and that I'm going to go into psychosis again. I do believe that God exists within all things, including myself but I'm terrified to embody my own Divinity. I feel like I can't move past this.  I'm ashamed of having been so public about it all and I feel so misunderstood by those around me. I've never read about or met anyone who has had quite the same circumstance as mine. Sometimes I wonder if I am Bipolar or if it really was a Spiritual Awakening, perhaps both. 

Any reflections, questions, or insight would be so much appreciated!

69,"ECT was a lifesaver for me, many years ago, but it really did a job on my memory. And I have a lot of problems with my sense of direction, I can even get lost in someone’s house! I don’t know if that’s due to the ECT or the meds or just me."
70,"What was your experience?

I have been diagnosed with a mood disorder which I assume points to bipolar with psychotic features because I experienced psychosis two times over the past 11 years (2010 and end of 2020).

The second time it happened I was on sertraline without a mood stabaliser and a few weeks in I went into full blown psychosis and needed to be hospitalised. The doctor said it was because of the sertraline.

I know this might not matter, but I really feel I don't have a mood disorder but another psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. I do remember spending money, having lots of thoughts and ideas, trying to run away to America, etc but most of my time in hospital is blank. I just don't remember 90% of what I did.

I believe my boyfriend is bipolar but does not was to seek help.

He is consistently feeling anxiety and stressed and is over drinking to feel better. He also appears to have delusions of people sabotaging his life. When he’s really upset he tends to try to contact my family or friends so that they can “confirm” the truth. This of course has my whole family freaked out.

I want him to seek help but of course I don’t want to force him or do something against his will. Can you suggest anything that maybe you’ve done to convince others to seek help or how did you seek help for yourself or what did someone do for you to convince you to seek help....

But, I'm with a new guy now who has a bipolar brother (he actually suspected it before my psych did!) and so he's had years of dealing with it and has been the most awesomest guy on the planet! We are getting married this June (well, tried to last June but... COVID). 

I am on medication which is working well. And I am trying to start my own business on top of working a full time job where I am traveling to work each day (my guy and I work together), all while raising my 9 year old daughter who has ADHD and anxiety herself. We're just one big happy squirrel chasing emotional basketcase family! (groans in exhaustion)"
75,I been dealing with Bi-Polar type 1 and PTSD with delayed expression. I been wanting to go back to college for a career. Yet I have been told that most of the careers I would not be able to have due to my diagnosis. I been so confused and numb by how I am 31 year and have not had a job too many well since I only had a janitorial job until the virus happened and I had to move farther away from my job . is there any work I would be able to work towards a goal with being diagnosed with no polar type 1? I always have been interested in Cyber Crime Investigator .
76,Is there anything that helps with concentration? I can't make it through a book to save my soul. I seem to have a limit of an hour or so before I switch off. Attempts over a few days and then I give up trying because it just won't happen.
77,"I might have an opportunity to to try Spravato (for those who don't know, it's basically slightly altered ketamine administered as a nasal spray in your doctors office). My psychiatrist suggested it as a possibility for me, and we are weeding through the insurance red tape now. I found (very serendipitously!) ANOTHER psychiatrist that administers Spravato at his office who is literally about 4 blocks away from my normal psychiatrist. I'm leaning towards this as a posibility should all the cards fall into place. Has ANYBODY here tried it? At all? Know someone who has? How was your reaction? Terrible? What was it like? Was it worth it? And ultimately, did it really help? : / 

-Elle"
78,"I do not start my first therapy session for another two weeks, but my moods have been significantly worse in the last few months. I have dealt with my mental issues on my own for the last ten years, but I finally sought treatment and therapy last month after seeing that little progress has been made in all that time.
I took a series of screening tools through my University, and found that I have generalized anxiety and symptoms consistent with depression. However, results also found that my behaviors are positive with bipolar disorder. Upon these results, I took several screenings on bipolar disorder and keep getting positive matches, up to 86% through one of the tools.

I will wait until my therapy session to talk more about it and see if these findings are accurate. I have found myself in severe highs and lows, sometimes simultaneously, and this has been a pattern continuing for quite a few years, but I am noticing the pattern getting more significant lately. I will feel overly confident and independent, but then a small, likely irrelevant thing will trigger me based on past traumatic events, and I sink into a feeling of hopelessness where my thoughts swirl my head and won't settle down. Then with time, I'm back into the confident stage after a period of feeling emotionally numb following my pessimistic episode.

Upon dealing with my mental stress and past events that have triggered my stress (bullying, manipulation, harassment), my support from family has not been super validating, which is why I decided to seek counseling on my own. In every situation, I am told that I need to forgive and forget what has happened to me, and to be the bigger person. This has not helped me in that I continued to be harassed and my anxiety has gotten worse, leading to my emotions being triggered by very small occurrences that might not matter to other people, including family.

Last night, I experienced a major episode when a family friend who had caused me emotional distress was invited over to my home. When I said hello and was met with little greeting, including an uncomfortable smile, I was weirdly set off. I escaped to my bedroom and uncontrollably cried, recalling what I had experienced months before with that person. I am currently living with a sibling, who witnessed the experience I had gone through and dislikes the way I was treated.

In an attempt to be calmed and seek help, I contacted my mother. I explained that I was not mentally prepared to be with this person and was triggered by the response I received from them. Her first response was that she did not understand why this situation was still a big deal to me and told me I was being dramatic. While my reaction seemed unwarranted from such a small instance, my mind went to flashbacks and I couldn't help but feel distressed. My mother also told me that I need to ""get over it"" at least 3-4 times, that what happened was 6 months ago, and that I need to stop telling my sibling how I feel about the situation as my ""negativity is affecting [my sibling's] perception of [the person].""

After the call, I received a text from my father, who said only this to me: ""Drop it. It's over. No one cares."" The uncontrollable sobbing and deep, heaving breaths resumed. I had always been afraid to tell my parents about my problems with bullying and trauma in the past for fear that they would not care or do much to help me. This led to resorting to self-harm and acting ""out of character"" in the past, of course neither of them know of my destructive behaviors. That statement basically solidified that I was right in that they don't care about my emotional distress, and that I just need to forgive whoever did me wrong and move on without accepting my true feelings. I wish it were that easy, and it's not for lack of trying multiple times over the span of a decade among different people.

I wonder if what I am going through will even be considered more so if I have an official diagnosis. I am sick of not being listened to or validated, and all day I have actively avoided my parents. I worry, though, that this counters exactly what they told me last night. ""I shouldn't hold a grudge;"" ""I need to get over it"" and not let it bother me, when I am severely bothered by the disregard for my mental health and minimal likelihood of getting better if what's happening is not addressed, rather than keep sweeping my problems under the rug, as I have been raised to do.

My distress lasted into the morning, but it has begun to fade away and now I am in the emotionally numb stage, hoping to get back into the optimistic stage. Although now I feel nervous, knowing I'm bound to plunge back into distress again at some point.

Anything helps. Thank you."
79,"My situation at the moment is one of mind shattering normality and perhaps mild depression. I miss my moments and periods of constructive inspiration. Many of those were actually very functional and beneficial to my work and those around me. 

After a relatively recent relapse ,with full blown mania, psychosis and such severe depression afterwards that I developed something called pseudo-dementia (which fortunately resolved itself after treatment), I am now ""well controlled"" again.

The problem is that all that I feel now is a numbness to the world, slight depression and non-stop anxiety. Apart from the anxiety, the world could blow up around me and I could not care less.

My psychiatrist is not willing to change my medication combination, because of the severity of my relapses (plus the catastrophic collateral damage assosciated with each relapse) and because the pseudo-dementia was a warning sign of damage to the hippocampus during my relapses.

To make things worse is that I resigned (24h notice) on impulse from work during my relapse and am now without work and alone 95% of the time.

I also have schizotypal personality disorder, so it is very difficult for me to form lasting bonds with other people. This form of communication is what works best for me, but because of the STPD I do not get beyond the first attempt at communication on non-mental-health social forums.

Can anyone relate? If so, how do you cope? Does anyone have any advice?"
80,"hey! i hope this fits into what this forum is for, i've never posted on here but i'm feeling very lost and i could use any insight / advice there is if people on here know more about bipolar disorder than i do!
so my best friend is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and went off their mood stabilizers cold turkey about 4 months ago, 3 months before they dumped me. basically, they had the idea of us moving to a different state together, where we'd know no one and have no job prospects or anything. it was a very sudden idea but as soon as they had it they were 100% ""let's start looking for places and move in 2 months."" in retrospect i highly suspect they were manic, but i didn't know much about bipolar disorder and didn't think much of them having it. i told them i wanted to think it over first, but every time we'd talk they wanted to research apartments immediately and wanted an answer immediately and would get frustrated when i wouldn't match that energy. eventually, they said they didn't want to make plans anymore because we had different wants, and assured me it wasn't a big deal even though they were giving verbal indications that they were upset about it, and the energy between us was very off. we had a few conversations about this, and none of them went well because i'd get anxious and repeat myself and they'd get really irritated at that and get visibly impatient. eventually, they told me they were setting a boundary that they didn't wanna talk about it anymore, i thought this was negotiable because the issue clearly wasn't resolved and it would've been fair of them to let me talk about it if i still felt the need to. so i communicated this, and they told me i needed to respect their boundary and were very firm that they couldn't talk about it anymore because it ""made them treat me like shit"" and it was draining to them. it turned into an argument and they told me not to contact them for a while, then a week later they send me a long text telling me they don't wanna be friends anymore because me crossing their boundary made them feel unimportant and we were sucking the energy from each other each time we'd miscommunicate. i am crushed and hurt and find them dumping me over a text very unfair and unlike them. i get that i shouldn't have pushed so hard, but i feel a lot of their reactions were more irritable than the situation called for, and i'm SHOCKED they dumped me over a text. we were the best of friends and this seems so abrupt and dismissive of the level of our friendship. i'm heartbroken and confused and any insight on this in context of them having bipolar disorder would be much appreciated! i've read that people with the disorder can get hyper-irritated at things at a disproportionate level, and sometimes they'll abruptly dump their friends then regret it when their state changes. also, if anyone has any insight on what happens if someone goes off their meds cold turkey that would be much appreciated."

I am on mirtazapine and am in the process of upping my quetiapine.
I am hoping to just hear other people's experiences and try and process my diagnosis."
84,"Anyone have any tips / insight on how to not take it personally when someone with bipolar says very personally hurtful things to you? My best friend said some very mean things to me while they were irritable and they were very unfair and harsh and things I was already insecure about. It was also relating to an idea that they had while manic that I didn't agree with, and I know it's common for people with bipolar to get hyper irritated when people don't go along with their manic ideas, so maybe that's why they lashed out. Is this common?"

87,"Hi all

I have felt suicidal since my first psychotic episode. It was very public and killed my career.

I’m tired of feeling low, ashamed and feelings of self hate. I want to be happy again. I really do but can’t see a way out.

Any tips would be welcome because as of right now suicide feels like the only option. I think of my family and how it would upset them. I have no quality of life anymore. I feel like a burden and failure to my loved ones.

Don’t know who to talk to or what to do. I’m have been looking at ways to take my life.

Anyone else feel like this after an episode? if so, when did things get better?

I can no longer cope."

89,"Hi everyone,
I was hoping to find some advice.

I am 32 and have been struggling with heavy depression in spells for the past 5 years, which has been getting worse and worse. I have had no reason to be, amazing girlfriend,family and friends - a very lucky man.

At the end of 2019 I had a really bad patch of extreme mood swings - no sleep , and I was given antidepressants which made me feel sick and worse but told to stick with them so I did.

I started having absent seizures at the beginning of January 2020 and I had to leave my job in March because I couldn’t cope. I lost my license for 12 months and I was put on levitracem for the seizures.

I started my own company 2 weeks later, just before Covid hit and we went into lockdown.
No work and no money.

I was still facing terrible mood swings and heavy depression.

I took myself to hospital in April 2020 as I was extremely manic and spent 5 days in there and didn’t sleep. I still wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar.

I eventually had to go to a private psychiatrist in July 2020 who diagnosed me with Bipolar passing the examination by 100%. I was given Aripiprazole which didn’t agree with me and made me feel sick and more depressed. I was told to go back after 4 weeks to review the medication but I couldn’t afford the follow up meeting. So I kept using it for 3 months until I couldn’t use it anymore and went back to hospital in September.
I was referred to a neuro specialist who changed my mood stabiliser to Limotrogine.
I have been waiting 7 months for my follow up in March, to be reviewed and monitored properly. As I’m still feeling very depressed and erratic.

There have been major delays in treatments the past year because of Covid which I have appreciated and been patient with.

I have been with my girlfriend for 3 years but I have deteriorated dramatically physically and mentally over the past year and a half.
I have had deep depression, unable to drive because of my absent seizures, no work because of Covid and I’ve put a lot of weight on. In between this I lost my job and my close uncle died of cancer.

My girlfriend has broken up with me because she says we want different things. 

She doesn’t understand bipolar, depression at all. And her words are I have no drive, motivation, I’m fat.

I have never been Horrible to her and always supported her with everything.
No arguments, shouting, horrible things being said.
I haven’t felt sorry for myself and I have tried to stay positive Through the past year and half.

when she split up with me by phone , I refused to meet her the next day to talk about it and sent her a nice email wishing her the best . I have cut all contact and not spoken to her for a week.

I am obviously really upset because I love her and hurt that she can’t see I’m unwell and in the process of getting better.

I am exhausted by everything and don’t feel I should be having to explain my situation to someone that should love me.

I feel I shouldn’t chase her or beg her but leave her to get on with what she’s got to do.

I don’t want to put my burden on her, and I want to focus on getting better.

Am I doing the right thing ?  Or shall I try and get her back ?"
90,"Hi all.

This is sort of a weird question but for a bit of context, my work doesn't have definite work hours so sometimes it takes until 1am or even 4-5am if there's a lot to be done.

I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and was prescribed seroquel and the sedating effects of the meds never really left even after months of use.

My problem is, I usually take the med once I think work is done but sometimes, my supervisor suddenly calls for something after I've taken it. I don't usually get to answer because I'm knocked out at this point then I just say sorry the next day and reason out that ""I have medicine that makes me sleepy.""

He never really asked what sort of medication it is but I just want to be ready with an answer if ever it comes up again. So my question is, what sort of med can I ""mask"" seroquel as since I don't want my workmates to know about my mental health problems. Is there anything like maintenance meds that also cause drowsiness?"
91,"I can't seem to get ride of this depression. I'm a complete misery around my family just want to be left alone. I'm on 300mg quitiapine. 

I thought it was supposed to help depression. I wish my mania would return. Getting hold of nhs psychiatrist is vertically impossible at mo. Are there better meds for bipolar depression?"
92,"Anyone have it? I never used to have it but as my Bipolar progressed over the last six years or so, this 'thing' appeared to grow with it. Suddenly I didn't want to be around people, speak to people, be in situations where I might have to speak to people. It has grown into an almost uncontrollable beast to the point where it is stopping me from doing most things that involve situations in which I might end up having to speak with people.
I don't know if this is a part of the Bipolar, an adjunct to it, or a reaction to it in the sense that maybe if someone speaks to me for long enough or sees me over a long enough period of time, they'll see this thing peeking out from underneath called Bipolar. Maybe I'm even trying to save them from me? Maybe I've just got nothing to say? Maybe I find most people too boring and predictable? I really don't know.
I find it all really baffling how, in the space of just six short years, I went from socially okay, (not brilliant, but okay) to pretty inept. The problem is I also now rarely want to be around people because I'm so easily irritated by them, so it's not just a choice to make things easier, it's also a 'need' to not get ticked off by yet another thing. Irritability is a big problem for me.
Experiences or thoughts?"
93,"Hello all,
My wife has a diagnosis of classic bipolar 1. However, I'm trying to figure out what her sister has. We are pretty sure she has some mental illness. My wife thinks she is bipolar also, but she doesn't fully fit the usual criteria. She has had multiple episodes which fall into the classic manic criteria (both euphoric and dysphoric) and also mixed mania. But she has never really had what I would consider a depressive episode. The closest would be her mixed manic episodes where she would have moments of extreme emotional anxiety and sadness sprinkled in with her intense mania. At first, my wife and I dismissed the first two big episodes as postpartum psychosis since they happened after each of her kids were born. But then she had another huge episode in 2019 which was mostly due to overwork and work stress. Hence we can't blame that one on postpartum. When she comes down from these manic episodes, there is a time of melancholy as she reflects on what happens. But it is brief and then she wants to move on from it like it never happened. She never enters any kind of real depression. Her baseline is very emotional/social/friendly but a bit narcissistic and with a bit of a temper. In her manic episodes, this gets amplified 1000x. When doing some research, I found a bit of information about ""unipolar mania"" which seems to fit the bill. But the data on it is minimal as it is not commonly diagnosed. Just wondering if my sister-in-law does indeed get unipolar mania or if it could be something else. She is in denial that she has any real mental issues other than lack of ""anger management"" and some ptsd from past trauma. Even hinting that she may have a mental illness will set her off so she definitely will not go to a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation."
94,"Hello all,
Anyone taking Depakote/Epival DR tablets? My wife is currently prescribed 1000mg of Depakote DR (aka Epival in Canada). Her psychiatrist has told her to take it all at once before bed. I have always read that Depakote DR (this is NOT the extended release ER tabs) dosage is commonly split up into 2 or 3 smaller doses throughout the day. In the past her previous psychiatrist had told her to take half at night and half in the morning. I mentioned this to her current psychiatrist and she said that it is perfectly fine for my wife to take it all at once at night. I'm curious what others think and what others who are taking it are doing. I had also posted this question awhile back in the meds section but didn't get a lot of replies so I'm hoping more people see it here.

Thanks"
95,"I wonder what people make of this.  So last night, before I could fall asleep, I had yet another scene that I could see in my mind's eye.  It was a circular scene of what at first appeared to be sperm swimming about trying to catch each other.  As I watched they grew larger turning into what you might describe as tadpoles.  I tend to experience things when I close my eyes.  Just at some times.  At the moment my mood seems to be a little high/low is what seems to  over it. I have talked before of getting very clear pictures of faces from the past - not people I know.  I believed them to be dead people.  So I just wonder what others think ..."
96,"anyone with bipolar have S.A.D. before they got bipolar?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder"
97,"I have been trying to reasearch the various trigger that can bring on bipolar episodes. One of the major ones is stress; when consistant mental pressure from life builds up, I can slowly feel myself either falling into depression or mania. However, in the run up to my latest episode, my life was previously uneventful. And, unlike most other episodes, did not build up over time, but rather came on very suddenly. I have been trying to track any changes that I have had in my life recently, but couldn't identify one. The only thing I came up with is that the weather had suddenly changed here in the UK. We had winter temperatures of -5 degrees celcius and snow for a couple of weeks and then suddenly it was Spring, +10 and sunny. This seemingly coincided with my episode. 

I looked into it and found that it is common for bipolar people to have sudden affective switches in Spring. Coming to think of it, the same thing happened in my first episode. I was depressed for a number of months between January-March, and then in April/May I suddenly became manic. Does anyone else experience sudden changes in their mood when the seasons change? If so, what do you do to prepare and mitigate against it?"
98,Hi! I’m new and I have so many thoughts/questions. My mind is racing and my thoughts are chaos but I think I’ve recently had a huge breakthrough. So here’s the deal. I’ve been in therapy a number of times over the years and I’ve seen a psychiatrist twice in my life. Once many years ago for PTSD and have now been seeing someone since last Spring. The thing is that I don’t think I’ve ever really been honest with any of my mental health professionals. I’ve always withheld a LOT of information. I don’t really know why I do this. I’m not trying to be intentionally deceitful but I think I’m just doing what I’ve always done in every aspect of my life which is trying to appear “normal”. My current diagnosis is PMDD because that’s basically what I handed to my psychiatrist. I started taking Fluoxetine in April which I believed to be life changing. I had energy and motivation. Every time I had an appointment I would tell my doctor how great I was doing and how much better my life has been. I’ve been self medicating for insomnia (unisom and cannabis) for years but recently I have had to increase these things and have now come to the point that even on massive amounts I’m still waking up for hours at a time and can’t shut my mind off. So I moved my April appointment up to this coming week to address the insomnia. I always rehearse what I want to say to my doctor in my head but today I started writing things down and it is literally pages and pages of mostly things I haven’t told anyone. I’m so embarrassed about hiding things all this time but I’m desperate for help. Seeing all of my concerning behavior over the years written out makes a bipolar diagnosis seem obvious to me but I still have the urge to rationalize each individual behavior. I’m 41 and my Dad wasn’t diagnosed with Bipolar until he was 60 but we all knew he had it all those years even if he didn’t. I just feel like I’ve been putting all of my energy into trying to control and hide my mental health because I’m so afraid of such a major diagnosis.
99,"Im not diagnosed w ANY mood disorder so far (diagnosis takes too long anyway), though both Anxiety and Depression have been diagnosed.

101,"Does anyone know if sleep can take away a manic episode without meds?

Just to clarify manic episodes are typically episodes where one becomes abnormally euphoric and can become psychotic and delusional."
102,"Is it? I wish to know.

As some of you heard about me, I live with my parents to survive. There were times when my mother was schizophrenic, and I had to caregive her to get a roof over my head and have food in my stomach. The doctors demanded her to be hospitalized; but I had no money. We were so destitute that we had to sell everything to survive. I mean, we couldn't afford shit back in US, at least the doctors in South Korea are more affordable. That's why we flew over here. To survive. I had to search meticulously for a renowned hospital to get the help she needs.

The stress I had to endure and struggling with my bipolar disorder is unbearable. There are times I nearly had a mental breakdown!

People around me think I'm lucky or some shit. That I have my parents pay me for my living expenses in my college years. I thought this too, and tried to take advantage of this shit. But my parents became difficult and these problems forced me to move from country to country, delaying my chance for graduation. All these could've been avoided if I just got off my ass and became independent at 25. Yeah, I might face some financial troubles. But in the end, I would've succeeded. Instead, I became a dumb-ass and listened everything they told me to believe.

Do you even realize how difficult it is to be independent? You're safe with us. You'll not leave until you marry.

They say this. Wait a minute. Do you know how impossible for anyone to marry in this day in age? (Sigh)

I tried defying them. Put some boundaries. But that caused more trouble and conflicts, and my family was almost ruined because of my defiance.

My family and I are sailing in a boat. My defiance is causing holes to form. If I rebel, it will sink.

I need to be believe what they tell me to believe, or else I won't survive. My chances of survival DECREASES if I think for myself. Let alone my sanity draining.

This, and other things that goes in my life, led me to deep depression. There are hobbies, and things I want to do, and I can't do them.

I tried philosophy of all kinds. I tried to live for myself and live for the moment. Nothing works.

And didn't I mention? My parents are right. When I asked Reddit and this forum, people told me that it's hard everywhere. The economy is in the dumps. It's impossible for me to be independent. Not only my paycheck will NOT be enough, I will shiver in the cold and starve to death. The money I get isn't enough. I need my parents to survive because it's all about sharing nowadays. I'm not good enough to get a fucking roommate, so I need them to survive.

But today, I saw Elon Musk telling how difficult starting a company is. There was a time when Musk had to code on his computer the all day and night, seven days a week. Plus, he had to manage is tight budget. He started to describe the difficulty of running a company in details. And I thought, It's not as hard as dealing with my parents...

I'm not gonna start a company. I thought about it, and I can't take any more stresses because of my parents. But if starting a company is less difficult than my parents (although it's impossible to make the company successful), how easier for me to be independent? The pain I go through during the independence process, is much easier to bear than living with my parents or starting a company.

Even if it is harder, that's still a lot better then living with my parents. But is it worth it? Or am I wrong? Do I have to stay with my parents and deteriorate myself?

(And yeah! I'm not gonna move out here in South Korea. Employment is IMPOSSIBLE! But back in US might seem possible...)"
103,"Disclaimer: the following is only a personal opinion of mine after years of contemplation, experience and research. I also didn't know where to place this.

Before I start, the sensory systems mentioned below are kinda like our simple senses we have like ""Mental"", ""Emotional"", ""Physical"" or the ""Body"". But also ""Non-physical sensory systems"" like the ""Non-physical auditory system"" and the ""Non-physical visual system"" where hallucinations seem to be perceived. There is evidence of those last two actually being a genuine reality because it is established they commonly activate during sleep deprivation and dreaming but also with people who have brain tumors and other diseases. It's not only the case that when people are awake and experience a hallucination those systems become active. Everyone has them and they can be triggered for different reasons.

Hello everyone. I have come to the following conclusion regarding many major, chronic and debilitating Psychiatric disorders including but not limited to: Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia, OCD and Schizoaffective Disorder.

The conclusion is: ""Many chronic labels in Psychiatry are simply composed of disturbances that are manifested into different sensory systems that every human being has. These disturbances at the fundamental level follow the same mechanism of action but are expressed through different sensory systems.""

So in simple terms I'm saying that many of these chronic disorders are simply the same negative ailment expressing itself through a certain sensory system.

I will give examples of this below to help visualize what I am saying.

OCD is known to follow the following mechanism of action: obsession -> cause compulsion -> the sufferer then typically responds which causes more distress

Hallucinations (whether auditory or visual) found in the diagnoses of Schizophrenia and Schizoaffective Disorder follow the following mechanism of action:
Hallucination -> cause fear, confusion and delusional thinking etc -> the sufferer then also is naturally distressed

As you can see from above I could simply name the above mechanism of action as a single general one as follows:
something unpleasant perceived in a human sensory system -> emotional turbulence -> some type of human response or distress caused etc

So you could actually simply describe many chronic Psychiatric Disorders as following the same essential and fundamental general negative mechanism of action.

Now with OCD the established principle of reversing the condition is to do the the opposite of how it operates which is like a healthy stress. So you basically do exposure therapy and don't act on the compulsion. After my research I realized that internally this is ""rewiring the brain"" or applying neuroplasticity which is basically when this ""plastic brain"" moves and the neurons are reprogrammed. There is a lot of evidence that many major chronic psychiatric disorders involve an issue with the neurons being programmed wrong.

But applying what I said about the fact that these disorders follow the same general mechanism of action and combining it with the fact that an example of a reversal of this mechanism of action allows a cure to arise as is the case with OCD. I believe that anyone with such debilitating disorders should simply start giving their brain a workout by giving it healthy stress/changes. The brain according to me would then literally move and reprogram the neurons.

But as I have stated in an earlier post. Helping the brain to move is not simply a case of exposure therapy, at least not in every Psychiatric disorder. The brain gets a workout when we exercise in sunlight too for example which gives us the natural melatonin dose we need to sleep at night which is another form of helping the brain to move and possibly contribute to neuroplasticity. Sleep hyigene in particular is a very well established principle of health for Bipolar patients as it helps to maintain and control it and I just mentioned how important it is for brain health.

In fact I wouldn't limit these issues to the brain either. Consider the stomach which is being regarded as the second brain now too.

So move, literally. Make healthy changes. Eat well. Speak well. Walk well. Breathe well. Socialize well etc. I feel this current epidemic could be improved immensely if holistic principles were applied.

My opinion may be hard to visualize, I am trying to make it more visual with time.

Any feedback would be appreciated.

106,"""Music has been very important in my life. Most of my youth and a good portion of my adult life was spent without a psychological diagnosis. Hence I was a walking bipolar with no treatment. Experiencing the world through deep depressions and high highs. The world was a crazy, mixed-up emotional mess to me.""  Chester Bennington



Linkin Park - Chester Bennington - bipolar - 2017 death 

I never listened to Linkin Park but after Chester Bennington killed himself and finding out he was bipolar I started listening. I posted One More Light from the One More Light album 2017.  His music is very deep.

While I can relate that music helped me through my youth, the medications and psych visits did very little.  I was 16 for my first failed suicide attempt which lead to self harming for a year.  My childhood and now adult years are and will always be a mixed-up emotional mess.  Every morning I look in the mirror and I want to scream."
107,"And I was doing so well. I've been totally stable since November 2020 and then last night I started to feel agitated, overexcited and restless. Slept for about 5 hours, woke up and still hypomanic. Not as bad as last night, but still not normal. Tried studying, but my thoughts are racing and I can't concentrate on a single thing. 

I've got a lot of things going on in my life right now, so this is REALLY poor timing. I feel ashamed that I'm letting my family and myself down. I cannot put my mum through this bullshit again. She's always exhausted and under tons of pressure already due to other problems. I have to take responsibility this time. I'm afraid that things are falling apart again and I'm breaking down."
108,"Hi forum hope you are all having a good day, 

I've been taking Aripiprazole for the better part of a year now to control (hypo)mania and psychotic features associated with bipolar disorder. I was initially prescribed a low dose, 5mg and it worked remarkably effectively. Within 2-4 weeks, I was totally stable. However, after a few months, I started taking only half a pill (2.5mg) as I started to feel that it caused me to feel a bit flat and dull in my emotions (emotional blunting). 

I told my psychiatrists about this and they were OK with it, as long as it works. I am medication compliant and fairly responsible with how I manage my condition; I always keep my doctor in the loop about any changes and we trust each other. However, since then I had two mild hypomanic episodes, one for a week in November 2020 and one just yesturday (which is resolving now). I'm now concerned that maybe 2.5mg doesn't offer enough protection and that I should go back up to 5mg. 

I read that the minimum effective dose of Aripiprazole is between 10-15mg and upwards. I'm most likely go back up to 5mg, which is something I can do myself. However, I'm debating whether I should ask for 10mg . Pros and cons as followed: 

Pros of going up to 10mg: 
- Bring it in line with the proven recommended dosage. 
- Minimises the chances of relapse, which is important for me since I have a lot of things going on in my life within the coming months and a lot of pressure, which an episode will compromise.

Cons: 
- More side effects: this includes things like dulling my emotions, cognitive and movement problems. I also found that on higher doses my balance and coordination goes a bit off. 
- Tolerance: The more you use medication, the more tolerance you develop in the long run. If I jump the gun on the med increase now, I'll develop a greater tolerance. Perhaps it would be better to save 10mg for a rainy day. 
- Middle ground: I can go for a middle ground and go from 2.5mg to 5mg. I can do this without the hassle of contacting my doctor as I have the full 5mg pills, I just choose to take half. Its worked pretty well in the past and I seem to be very responsive to medication. 

Right now, I feel like going for the middle ground of 5mg is the reasonable choice, but of course one can never be sure with bipolar. I realise you are not proffesionals, but I would find it helpful if you can share your experiences. What dosage are you on? Does it work for you? Does anyone have experience with low doses of medication and how does that work for you? 

Any input will be much appreaciated. 

As always, all the best,

109,I am currently in Medical School and had to take a leave due to a hypomanic episode weeks ago that I feel like I haven't bounced back from. I take seroquel at night and am currently working on getting to a therapeutic amount of Lamotrigine. I need to study for a test that I will have to take in the coming month but have not felt like doing it and when I do sit down my mind wanders or I don't retain anything. Did anyone else experience this when starting meds?
110,I had a phone appointment today about how I am doing.  So I was explaining to the Doctor that I seem to be over- eating at times.  It probably verges on binging eating.  Whatever it is I am not content until I have eaten several of.  She is going to discuss this with the Consultant but has anyone any experience of? I would generally struggle to eat really so this feels strange.

112,"Hi, 

As some of you may already know, I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder last year, having struggled with my mental health since 2019. Its been a long and arduous process of trial and error with meds, changing psychiatrists, chasing down doctor. But at last, I am stable and well and have been so for the last few months. Feeling a lot more positive and I'm ready to start getting back up on my feet.

Due to my mental health, I had to drop out of university, and for the past 2 years my life has pretty much been put on hold. I have watched my friends and peers carry on with their lives as usual; graduating, getting jobs and living life. At times, it was painful to see this as I have been feeling alone and isolated, constantly trailing behind. However, in recent months I have made peace with this and have decided to live life one step at a time. 

I am setting myself short-medium term goals which I am working on and have seen reasonable success. Back in december, I reapplied to uni and have already got my offers back. I pretty much decided which one I'm going to and am excited to get back into education. I've been studying and revising in preparation. 

Although I know I'm doing the right thing and I'm trying to be cautiously optimistic about this upcoming oppurtunity, but I'm constantly overshadowed by thoughts that at any time, my illness may return and my life will once again fall apart. I read that Bipolar disorder has a 40% recurrance rate in the first 3 years of treatment. This is a haunting thought that is always at the back of my mind. I want to do well and do right by myself and the people close to me, but I am in a state where I cannot make any firm commitmants. I am willing to accept that a relapse is just part the parcel of living with this illness. However, if and when it does happen, I want to be better prepared to deal with it, so that I can cut the problem at its root and prevent it from derailing my life. A friend of my mother's who is also bipolar managed to build a sucessful career and family despite it and this is what I aim to do in time.

Sorry for the long post. In short; I want to learn how to roll with the punches that this illness deals. Any advice from people who have made it out the other end?"

I was a college student during this period and after taking lamotrigine it became very difficult for me to study even after stopping. Worst mistake of my life!"
114,"So far, I know I have OCD (my germ issue), but there is another problem that I have and I have no idea what it is. Can it be Bi polar?

1. I get angry easily... Very angry 2. I do not like the authority or anyone telling me what to do.  3. I sometimes have breathing issues and dizzy when I get panicky 4. My moods shift from angry to sad to happy. 5. Paranoid sometimes with people (not extreme, but do not trust anyone). 6. I am almost 30 in 2 years, so I feel depressed thinking about it knowing I did not achieve my financial goals. And feel worthless if I am still broke in two years. 7. Restless thoughts (although not sure if that is my OCD). 8. I have breakdowns sometimes screaming at my loved ones and friends. It starts with rage inside and I explode with words, not physical violence. I feel like a pot of tea cooking and boom. But this is when they do things to cross me.  I have never physically hurt anyone. I punched walls, objects, never people. I would never allow myself to hurt anyone. That is not me. 

what is wrong with me?"
115,"Dear Forum, 

As a person who has struggled with substance abuse, which I believe was a contributing factor in causing my mental health problem, I find it concerning that drug use is not only becoming common but also socially acceptable amonst young people. 

This is particularly true for Cannabis/Marijuana which is often seen this day as a harmless vice and there is a strong push for legalisation. Legislators often point to low potential for addiction and low mortality rates, since it is practically impossible to overdose from weed. However, I think what is often underestimated is the potential for weed to cause/exacerbate mental health problems. Many people use pot to de-stress and say that it helps them to cope with social anxiety. But studies have show that weed has a variety of negative effects on mental health worsening anxiety and depression in the long run. It also has the largest rate of conversions to psychosis, higher than hallucinogens and stimulants. 

But these facts are often overlooked by the majority of people. There is a concerning trend that cannabis is becoming more and more socially acceptable and there are many special interests groups pushing for legalisation. But such was the case with tobacco. Until the 1960s, cigarretes were seen as a harmless vice, people could fundementally function whilst smoking and no obvious ill effects were found. Until medical reasearch proved otherwise and hence we saw the lung cancer epidemic of the mid 1900s. My concern is the same thing will happen with cannabis if it become legal and widespread and only decades later reasearch will prove conclusively that it exarcebates mental health problems. We will see a large surge in drug-related mental health epidemic. 

I would like to hear your opinions about this. Do you think this is a problem? And if so, how do we raise public awareness of it so as to not fall into the same pit as people did with cigarretes back in the '60s?"
116,"My fp (favourite person) is everything to me. I can't see myself living w/o them.
Now they have given up on me. It was sudden.

I was emotional because they had ignored my calls for 4 hours while they were out with some friends. The thing is that I didn't know they were out with friends because we had barely talked that day. I started panicking. I messaged them my feelings and all they said was ""I give up"".
Now we have barely talked to each other since Friday morning and I am lost. 

Me and my fp have always had constant contact since I'm very anxious. They know that my anxiety has to do with abandonment and separation issues and now they left me out of nowhere.
I feel so weak.
I just spoke to them since I felt as this was being handled in a bad way.
All they could say was ""Idk if I wanna be with you anymore, it's too much"".
I know I am a lot sometimes, especially when they're a stone (no emotions, careless, free). 
We had over the years learned different ways of understanding each other and we have made INCREDIBLE progress. But now it seems like it was worthless? They left me in the end...Like I said and feared for. 
I have no one else. I pushed everyone away for my fp. We have planned to meet on Friday which has been pushed by them since we were supposed to meet tomorrow (Tuesday). 
I have been the only one who's held contact by saying ""good morning/night"", ""I love you"" and other stuff. They're acting as if we're enemies. It's not ""us"" anymore, it's ""you"" every time they write. I feel so lost. I wanna fight for our love, even though I know deep inside it's dead. I wanna believe it's there. They are the one for me.

124,"Hi all.

I was diagnosed type 1 in 2020 after ~5 years of decaying mental health and stupid, impulsive behaviour. The genetic markers were there and the huge amount of pressure I couldn't help but put myself under was (imo) the trigger. 

I have long told myself that the origin of that pressure was a decision I made many years ago to achieve great things in order to know I've lived a full and worthwhile life. However I now contemplate how much of this is true and how much comes from a desire to have my moral compass validated. One consistency among everything I want to achieve is that I want the result to be positive for others rather than myself. As a Christian I believe there is an afterlife and fear of it is the only reason I am still alive, and as a deep thinker by nature I am terrified of the prospect of judgement for all of the wrong I've done and thought up to this point. 

Much of that wrongdoing has probably been a result of Bipolar disorder, and that is not an excuse but objectivity. So are we to be held accountable for what we do, say and think when we are 'away from our normal self'? If yes, to what degree? Are we partly to blame for allowing our minds to be contorted by this vicious monster? Is it a test? And is to act virtuous for fear of eternal punishment truly virtuous or is the motivation corrupted?

I've had this thought chain rattling around in my mind for years so hopefully you can understand it based on this brief explanation. Has anyone else struggled with similar thoughts? Keen to read your insights. 


Best wishes to all that see this,
Joe"
125,"hope you're all doing well. just had some thoughts to share and would love to hear your experiences;

so I was diagnosed at 18, type 1 w/ psychotic features. i just turned 20 in august. through my earlier teens (15-17) I experienced some hypomania and depression but didn't have a full blown mania until that year I was diagnosed. i had a big crash and was pretty depressed for months, then finally got lucky with a med combo after a lot of trial and error. had a brief hypomania spring 2020 after a slip up on my meds and presumably combined with the stress of current events. but since then i have been quite stable.

anyways growing up i was never very creative, nor observant, i didn't look at the small things in life. i just existed. but after my full mania i believe it somehow changed the wiring of my brain, i have a whole new lens on everything i look at, it completely changed me and i am very grateful for that because without the viewpoints i have now, i don't think i would have a purpose. my life revolves around art, in forms like painting, drawing, but also music, photography, and the art i can see in so many everyday things and how i can appreciate and connect with nature. the mania has brought me a lot of negative too but i feel that the positive outweighs (but maybe not :/)

i know this is pretty common with mania, the heightened creativity and ideas and ambition. but i've never really heard a conversation on what happens after the mania. do some just simply lose the brain wiring (for lack of better words) that they had during the mania when coming down? i of course have had a lot more of a drive during my mania (last hypo i was writing my own philosophy book lol.) but i never quite lost the perspectives it gave me. it feels permanent.

 if you've had this type of experience, i'd love to hear how things went for you following recovery. or just generally, have you had mania that made a profound change in yourself?"
126,"Have you seen people like this? People who cares about a person's performance, the product, not the person's heart. For instance, a parent cares about a child's performance, not his/her well-being or loving the child. The parent might say ""If you don't dedicate your ENTIRE life on performance, you're not my child"". I've seen some dirtbags like that. This boils my blood. Work your ass off. You matter in terms of performance, not who you really are.

I hated the concepts these people held. But I am worried that this is needed for survival. The world is getting more impoverished and cruel as time passes by. Love and kindness could be detrimental to survival. You can't be weak, you need to toughen up. Weakness is path to doom.

When I think about this, this shit depresses me. At first, I was enraged when I realized this. But this concept gnawed any sense of hope.

You have to work your backs off to survive. Life is tough, and same thing goes to survival. And I have no capability to commence such a thing.

Nevertheless, I sacrificed everything to survive. But I can see the cracks in my progress. It's taking a toll on my mental health just to survive.

More people said this fuckin' crap to me. It's common in my culture. The Korean culture had to embrace this to fend off enemies. This small nation is surrounded by powerful nations, and they always wanted conquests. They had to be their best to defend themselves. That's how they survived. Now, others taught me that my life is not based on them. 


Unfortunately, it's impossible NOT to embrace a survivalistic mindset in this economy. Look, the economy's spiraling down(even before the pandemic). The world is getting more chaotic. Greedy elites are grubbing power, and people are getting poorer. Expenses are getting high, and there's not enough money to cover everything. Jobs are getting scarce and more competitive. You have to be highly skilled to get a job, and once you get a job, you face variety of abuse. Hell, I even saw white-collar workers getting physically abused. And yeah. You won't be guaranteed payment. You will end up starved, exhausted, and barely alive.

Embracing this will require some ruthless, no-nonsense mindset. And am I capable of that? I tried to have that mindset long ago, and faced mental meltdown. Not good for a bipolar person.

So I used other deplorable means to survive. I had to stay with my mother who had bouts of schizophrenia. I have to obey every control tactics and demands from her. Just to get a meal from her. I had to listen to her delusory rants, and forced her to a doctor. I even went to psychiatrists and pharmacists to find out what medications are good for my mother, because her previous psychiatrist wasn't able to give her good pills(He was a legendary doctor). I had to plead and sort of lure her to Korea's finest hospital. And I had to struggle with college. Yeah. I couldn't understand ass-shit about Korean(I'm from US). I studied, and I ended fucking up. My parents don't give me any time to prepare for colleges, and forced me to do things quickly. I have to obey every command to the letter (even if it don't make sense), or else I will go homeless. Damn! How the hell am I supposed to survive when I'm homeless. You need more than food, you need shelter.

My parents love me, and they thought this was the best for me. Since I couldn't get a job in US, let alone pay the ridiculously expensive medical insurance, they took me here. To have an affordable living. Medical insurance is good in South Korea, and medical care is excellent. To them, it was a compassion. Other parents kick their children out when they're 18. I should've ran away from them anyway.

They weren't controlling me during normal times. It's these bouts of mental disorder that drives them to make my life hard. My father is working his ass back off in US to provide us and keep my mother together. But he sent us away here because he was tired of looking after her. You know, schizophrenia? He dealt with her for 20 years, and had a nervous breakdown. As for me, I had to endure. Hey, it's all about survival.

But if I keep this up, I might have a nervous breakdown. I might get with brawls with other people and die. Or, I might hurt someone. Right now, I'm good. But if she does this again, I might flip out. Fortunately, it's unlikely because she is on strong medications. However, I can't live like this forever. Jobs are hard to get, and staying with my parents won't last long.

I'm losing hope. :("

my psychiatrist asked about how my appetite has been. I told her “better than it was” but I don’t want to say how much or little I’ve been eating. I know I don’t eat enough on a regular basis."
138,"Hí! I am new to the forum, I decided to join because honestly I feel lonely and scared. Had been diagnosed a couple of times for the last 10 years,  always the same results zchizofrenic bipolar. But lately things have been worse I decided to reach to my family for help and understanding but in response a got nothing but judgment.  They don't like to talk about it they shut me down. Have trouble making phone calls, video chats ,making groceries ,getting out of my room,getting through my husband I just want someone to understand me and don't let go...."
139,It's a genuine worry.
140,"I gained over 50 pounds on the antipsychotics.

Now I am trying to lose that weight, now that I am off of those meds.

It's very hard to shed the weight. Has anyone else tried a type of prescription weight loss drug to help lose the weight?
If so, what kind?"
141,"Ok this is long...So I have been talking to someone for about 5 months we already knew each other. Right now we are long distance he is moving back home sometime this summer.
He is under a lot of stress right now. He seems to push me away or act one day and a few days later another. I think knowing we can't see each other makes this harder of course.  But on new yrs I told him I was taking a step back I was just feeling things were off. He has told me he loves me all kinds of stuff. I had feelings before so was easy for them to come back.
So he wrote me later surprisingly trying to talk I'm guessing. Then he goes in to he is at the edge with everything etc I asked him what exactly he meant. Then he was beating around the bush and I jokingly like I do said god I can't stand you sometimes. After that he blew up told me he was done. I was hindering not helping, causing chaos in his life, that he told me he was in pain and I wouldn't listen,  he told me to back off which he didnt, he just said very hurtful things and how he was about to erupt. Then he goes in to saying just stupid stuff like all I care about is clothes, I should go pretend I have it bad just ridiculous stuff. 
I have mental health issues I'm treated and been ok lately besides some depression. He is treated but I think needs an adjustment on his meds. I don't believe he meant what he said I think he just ended up having a breakdown. It may not have even been about me but he took it out on me. I told him I was backing off and he's just a mean person. That was our last interaction. 

It has now been a month and neither of us has contacted each other. I do think I completely overreacted to a lot of stuff and to blame also. But no excuse for his actions. I try and be sympathetic since I know how bipolar can be. I feel its best to leave it alone but I also don't want to abandon him I care tremendously.
That being said I really feel like he has to be ashamed and feel bad but his silence is making me think otherwise. But then again I'm doing the same. 

Guess I'm wanting to share for some advice and if I should ever reach out, be done, give time? I have just been having a hard time with it and both of our issues together probably aren't a good mix."
142,"Does anyone experience this kind of 'lingering depression' outside of mood episodes. By this I mean when your mood is on the whole stable, but you continue to have some of the psychological symptoms of mild depression.

In my case, this usually manifests itself as an overall pessimistic outlook on life, worrying that something bad is coming round the corner and apathy. At its worst, I would get passive suicidal thought, which I have no desire to act upon. By this I mean, I don't wish that I'd be better off dead but rather I would get away from life and all of its responsibilities, like going on a long, permenant holiday, or retiring. 

None of these symptoms would qualify as a full depressive episode. I don't feel an aweful sadness, no breaking down in tears, I can still motivate myself to get on with what I have to do and even enjoy and smile and laugh at times. But there is this lingering psychological feeling of 'meh' Je ne sais qua quoi.

Its really hard to explain, its prob more of a psychological problem rather than a psychiatric one, but I was just wondering if anyone can relate to this and whether its worth seeking help for it.

I don't really feel like I need to tell my psychiatrist about it, I have been taking my medication properly and my mood is fine, I don't think more meds will solve the problem, but perhaps therapy might?

P.S. I think I always had this to some extent, even before the bipolar (apart from the suicial thoughts). Its just getting harder to cope with as I don't have the same nerves of steel that I had before."
143,"Hello folks,
My wife had an intense manic episode last fall (full details in some of my earlier posts) which she came out of by mid-November. She was recovering well to the point that she was excited about going back to work just a few weeks ago. Unfortunately it was likely too soon to return and that did not go well. She started to get anxious at work, which I was a little worried about because she is a healthcare professional working in a hospital and the hospitals are being overwhelmed with COVID. Anyway that anxiety got more intense and spiralled into depression. She is off work again but is struggling with a lot of anxiety in addition to depression. Her logical mind knows that she has nothing to be anxious of right now but she cannot help it. She currently takes Depekote/Epival 500mg and transitioning from Olanzapine (which was used to treat her mania) to Seroquel (currently 150mg) since Seroquel historically has a very sedative effect on her. The Seroquel is helping a little but her sleep, while a little better, is still poor and her anxiety is still high. It seems especially bad in the mornings, where she can get the shakes. She seems to calm down more in the afternoons after doing some activities to distract her from her constant ruminations. We found certain activities in the afternoon that she enjoys (yoga, meditation, walks, some games) help a lot and by evening her mood can be actually ok. Just the mornings are always rough. She tries some of the same activities in the morning with more limited effect. Because of COVID and the cold weather here we are limited in other activities she can do. I play a lot of calming music for her which helps a little while she lies down. I wonder if she will need to try something like ativan for a few days, though I don't like those types of meds.

Any other suggestions I can try?

Thanks
Keith"
144,"I have had depression and anxiety since a teen. I had my son when I was 33 and I can't even explain what I went through after him. I thought it was just postpartum. I had anxiety so bad I couldn't eat lost 20lbs, couldn't sleep and wouldn't allow myself to sleep past a certain time, felt like I lived in a bubble and wasn't even here, racing thoughts so bad wanted to hit my head against the wall.
Got on an antidepressant got worse, added lamical then finally abilify which was a life saver.
3yrs later I ended up getting off meds thinking maybe I could in a matter of months happened again. This time Lexapro, Lamictal, and Zyprexa which helped get me thru it. I'm off Zyprexa now and take the other two been doing good.
That being said my doc diagnosed me with bipolar 2 never had been before. Could I have gotten worse after pregnancy? I wondered if hormones also had a bad delivery, c-section, blood transfusion. Also could what I felt been a manic episode? 
Lately I have had this feeling like I'm a caged lion, I want to go wild,  think about sex a lot but not acting on any of it. Could that be some mania?"
145,"Dear Forum,

For the last 8 months I have begun the painstaking process of getting my drug regiment right. I have ADHD and Bipolar Disorder. I was first put on Lamictal (Lamotrgine) 200mg for bipolar depression which worked great, however, didn't help with hypomania. I was then put on Abilify (Aripiprazole) 5mg which helped totally even out my moods. However, I continued to struggle with my ADHD symptoms.

I was then put on Strattera (Atomoxetine) 40mg trial for about 6 weeks, and I showed no signs of improvement. So now, my doctor has decided to give me a trial of Lisdextamfetamine otherwise know as Vyvanse in the US or Elvanse here in the UK. I don't know what to expect from this combo, because I earlier tried using my old ADHD med (ritalin) with an antipsychotic and they completely counteracted each other. Does anyone have any experience with these two drugs, or any advice on dealing with comorbid ADHD and Bipolar.

Would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance,
-H

P.S. If this combo doesn't work out is it worth asking my doctor to switch the Abilify for Lithium or Valproate so my mood stabiliser won't counteract my stimulant?"
146,"Ey, BP bb's. 

How do y'all deal with looking back on psychosis when you make it to baseline?

I have a little trouble with this one, I'm not gonna lie. because to me, I actually experienced this wacky nonsense (In my tousled little mind) So what the heck? 

Like, I fully understand I was in an Altered State(tm), but I dunno if I really get to go back after I followed the strings of the universe and felt everyone's feelings at the same time. (also ghosts?) I kind of still believe I really had those abilities at that time because i remember it happening.

Look, I get that during that time I was la'crazy, but from my perspective, it still happened. Some psychiatrist guy telling me it wasn't real doesn't retrospectively unravel my memories of being there. 

How do y'all contend with this kind of thing? Is it easy for you to rationalize it and separate what is 'real' from what is wacky brain times, or is it a real challenge? 

Let me know."

150,"Hi im looking for some advise please firstly ill try and give a brief description to explain where i am and what got me here.Im currently in contact with my GP who referred me recently to a counselor after a suicide attempt around Christmas 2019.This was my second suicide attempt the first one being around 15 years ago which i was hospitalized for.The second time paramedics were called and said i was having a phycotic episode but i refused hospital.And because i was lucid they said they wouldnt take me to hospital.But for my family to check on me every 15 minutes through the night as i was at very high risk of organ failure.

During both suicide attempts it was after a binge on drugs and alcohol and the times im at risk of alcohol and drug abuse is when i snap out of periods of depression and life looks rosey again.I will also abuse drugs and alcohol when im feeling low but not during deep depression when im basically just in a catatonic state.I can tend to snap at people sometimes and be irritable somewhat short tempered but im never a violent or aggressive person.

Ive currently been off drugs and alcohol since around Febuary 2020 and when im not taking drugs i do not suffer with the phycotic episodes but i still suffer with highs and very lows.But generally those very lows without drugs go to thoughts of suicide and wanting life to end without actually acting on it.I have just yesterday snapped out of a 2 month period of depression where i could barely get out of bed.I was getting up for something to eat and going back to bed.Sleeping for 18-20 hours a day and just wanting to sleep life away and wishing it could be over with.

Now im full of beans planning to get my drivers licence get a job have holidays get all the small jobs around the house done.Thoughts rushing about my head of how great life can be if i want it to be.But the problem is this wont last im going to sink back in to depression ive been through it to many times to think otherwise.

I had a period a few years back during a time i was full of life where i was left £5000 by a family member who passed away.And i was handing it out left right and centre to anyone i thought needed it finding homless people and giving £50 here and £20 there.And abusing drugs and alcohol and after about 4 or 5 months it was all gone.It's not something i regret but i mention it to try and explain a reckless period.

When i snap out of depressed periods i tend to be very reckless and spontaneous purchasing things i wont really use like a recent £400 spree on fishing gear.I havent been fishing for 20 years but its going to be my new hobby in my mind to replace drugs and alcohol but it never seems to work out the way i plan.

I spoke to my GP today after requesting a screening for bi polar disorder specifically bi polar 2 disorder.Because everything i have read about it matches me to a T.But my GP didnt want to give me a screening and told me it's usual behaviour for depression to have these highs and lows.

But what i read about depression is that depression is unipolar and doesnt contain these highs.If i could break it down with a percentage i would say im 50% to 60% of the time depressed  10% to 20% of the time buzzing and full of life everything looks rosey.And the other sort of 20% to 30% of the time im what i call the me me just even keeled and level headed not high not low just basically what id consider normal. 

Im kind of lost as i dont want to disagree with my GP but he hasnt spoken much to me and has little information but seems very adamant with his assessment of me.The couple of times i did speak to him my mind becomes very confused i have all the words i want to say but it doesn't come out right i dont seem to express or explain myself very well at all.I spoke to him today and he could barely understand me asking me to slow down multiple times.I was firing questions and talking a million miles an hour at him and my speech can become very eratic as i can mumble a lot when speaking making me heard to understand.

The counselling ive been given is basic counselling that isnt going to give me any kind of diagnosis.But ive agreed with the doctor to finish the 12 weeks and see where we stand at the end of it.He has offered me anti depresents but i refused as i just didnt think he or i had enough information at the time.So can anyone give me any advise how to deal with this i dont want to push for a mis diagnosis. But im my head it just feels like the people im talking to are missing something although it's early days of my councelling.


Any thoughts are welcome and thank you for taking the time to read if you have any questions please fire away."
151,"A few years ago, my sister was going through a manic episode where she believed her family was coming after her daughter and was eventually hospitalized and diagnosed as bipolar with traits of schizophrenia. During this episode she became engrossed in the idea of Ra and the Law of One.

She’s been doing better for the past few months, but a recent conversation has worried me a bit. She brought the topic up and I asked her if she would consider her belief in Ra and witch-related stuff to be akin to a religion, and she stated that she simply sees it as the truth. She also mentioned that before her medication, when she was “enlightening” herself with these books, she would reach euphoric highs that she is not longer able to reach. Which is a good thing, of course, but it sounds like she is seeing it as a negative thing. Which makes me worry that she may decide that she no longer wishes to take the medication.

I really need some advice on how to properly approach this situation. Though she has spoken to me about this topic, she doesn’t seem to bring it up with her husband or therapist at all. I’m entirely supportive of her and want to encourage her to pursue healthy hobbies, but to me this feels a bit more dangerous and unhealthy than anything. As she previously admitted that this type of stuff likely triggered her delusions, I worry that her continuing to dig too deep and getting too obsessed with this could be detrimental to her overall mental well being. However, I also fear that she may start to see me as an enemy if I try to discourage her from looking into what she considers to be the truth.

What should I do here that would be most appropriate to help her? Should I just sit her down and talk about my concerns directly? Should I talk to my parents and her husband first? Or should I just mind my own business…?

Or maybe I am looking at this entirely wrong and am being ignorant. If so, please let me know that, too!"
152,"So I was just diagnosed with possible bipolar I was told i showed signs and also had a mania episode and was also delusional i had not slept in causing 2019,,,  I had a tree fallon our home in 2016 I thought I was just on to high of zoloft and found out that zoloft with out a stabilizer may have made me do what I did I used to cry to my doctors and tell them I felt like I had no control over my life so long story short after episode  I cold turkeyed off of zoloft and  just the other week was potentially diagnosed with bipolar. Any  thoughts on this or any one who can relate by the way the tree was the reason I got on the zoloft it completely destroyed our home and only by the Lords mercy is my 8 year old here todayi. believe I suffer from PTSD she said I have a few things we have to figure out and work on"
153,"After years of thinking there was something wrong with my moods yet feeling misunderstood or simply dismissed by the GP I read about cyclothymia. There have been a few occasions where I've had an appointment with a doctor or crisis team but by the time I got there my mood had changed and I just ended up looking stupid! I've realised that I follow a pattern of seeking help when I'm really bad then deciding I'm totally fine and don't need help when my mood improves.

Is cyclothymia diagnosed much in the UK? Is it worth asking about a diagnosis? Are there any treatments that fit in well with a rapidly changing moods? It seems like all mental health revolves round feeling a certain way for long periods of time. Not sure I should even be wasting their time now with the virus anyway."
154,I was on a little bit of a high for the past few days. Now I'm beginning to feel my spirit declining. There's no hope for a future for me. What's the point in continuing on? I can't even express myself. Five sentences and I feel completely depleted.
155,"Hang in there with me I'll try to make this as short as possible, but this needs to be detailed enough to completely understand what I've gone through. 

I'm 25 now and the last manic/psychosis episode I had was in 2017. Before the last episode I went through 3yrs of having a couple months of mania which always turned into psychosis eventually having to be hospitalized everytime to come out of it (never saw or heard anything just major delusions/complete loss of reality). Was diagnosed during that period with bipolar 1. I've gone as long as a year since my last episode without meds and the only reason I'll go on anything again is for depression. I have had months were I'm okay and have enough energy to work and go about life. On the other hand I go through periods of severe depression where I don't leave the house for sometimes months because I don't have energy for anything and the fatigue is debilitating. The depression is not what I want to focus on here though.

Big thing I've wondered about is if the episodes I've had was caused by marijuana. I started smoking at 12 basically every day as much as I could until I quit in 2018. I truly believe that the marijuana could have been the sole cause of the episodes. I don't go through mood swings or have had any mania whatsoever since 2017. Does my story sound like I was misdiagnosed?"
156,"My psychiatrist recommend to try TMS treatment to help with my depression and bipolar type 1  highs and lows.

My first question is about TMS treatment.

1. Has anyone known of the pros and cons and how it might effective after the full 5 weeks of treatment?



2.
I noticed that the uncommon side effects are the manic; increase in people with Bipolar.

Is that happened to anyone else who may have tried the TMS treatment ?"
157,"Man....

I'm exhausted.

Just as good as fucked.

Tired of playing the tough guy. Tired of working excessively hard to survive. Fed up of this shit.

You know, life is hard. Everyone is suffering. No one can help or give two shits about me. Everyone is say, occupied.

I didn't say life is easy. But it shouldn't be hard all the time. And I'm exhausted.

But I have to fight on to survive. How? By working excessively hard to the point of mental exhaustion.

I can't get a job. South Korea is known damn well for unemployment. If you want a job, you have to be highly educated. Since everyone's well-educated, the stakes are high. You might ask, ""Start your own company."" Can't. The big companies will liquidate every chance of that!

Same shit goes to US. Since the economy's screwed since the recession, it's hard to get a job. Since US has high expenses, that's also a minus. To survive in US, I have to do the same horseshit like I do here! Being competitive, working your backs off to be highly educated, and basically getting exhausted.

And what the hell did I learn? Life is hard everywhere. UK is losing healthcare because of US, for instance.

No matter where I go, I have to work my ass off to barely survive. So tired of this shit.

When I was in my early 20s, I wanted to do what I wanted to do. Being a weeb who likes to write short stories and travel. My father opposed this shit. Since life is hard, I had to toughen up. That is no crying, sacrifice your life and be up to standards of the snobby elites. Work to the point of passing out and die. I think that's the resolve. Maybe he was partially right. And I'm getting frustrated.

Who needs to commit suicide when you overwork and burn out? When you can die from it?

I'm a religious man and I can't commit suicide. But I can overwork and die instead.

But instead of dying, I can go psychotic. Since I have Bipolar disorder, I can explode and have a mental breakdown. I can really harm someone.

So what's the point of grinding on? It gets me nowhere. I'm done with this mind-wrack.

But I didn't say I give up on life. I want to live life in a different approach. Go to trips. Japan would be nice. I just wanna take a break until the economy improves... If not, I don't give a rip."
158,"Hi all.hve started new meds last friday.quetiapine,had a total melt down Sunday,took too many pills ,and drank which I now is the devil and avoid.woke up in hospital the monday.partner has had enough of me and driving her mad,I feel stupid and remorseful,can't remember anything.we had a disagreement on the Sunday and bang,lost my mind.does anyone know anything about quetipine? Doctor won't give me anymore pills now.unable to sleep .m/h are involved and have spoken to me. Any clues? Many thanks."
159,"About two months ago, I went to my doctor because I could feel a depressive episode coming on and because these were still happening despite being on strong medication, I felt we should up the dosage of my anti-depressants. The anti-depressants I was taking work on the level of dopamine and help to stimulate your brain and give you energy. Well, a rare side effect is also seizures.
We upped the dosage from 300mg to 450mg, but I began to swing into mania and took the leftover 300mg I had with the 450mg for a total of 750mg. I was spiraling into mania. I didn't sleep, couldn't focus, and went on tangents about stuff even on here. The sudden upping to this dosage total encouraged this manis. Then, a few days later, I had a seizure. 
I had never had a seizure before, and there's no history of them in my family. Luckily, I fell and hit my shoulder instead of my head, but I dislocated my shoulder. I woke up on the floor at work unsure of what had happened. People were talking, but I couldn't hear what they were saying. Next thing I know, there's these two guys trying to get me to go onto a gurney, but I was in total hysteria and refused because I didn't think I could afford an ambulance ride. But eventually, I went with them still not being able to remember what happened. I was in excruciating pain, and I had to ride in the ambulance all alone while still trying to piece together what happened. 
When I got the hospital, they pushed me into a room with nurses who were telling me to remove my clothes, which only made me more hysteric. After that, they ran tests on me, pushed me into machines while I still had no idea where I was or why I was here. It was at least two hours before my arm was pushed back into place and another hour after that before I could change from my pee-soaked pants (yeah, you can piss yourself or even shit yourself when having a seizure for those that don't know. I sure as hell didn't know). It was one of the most terrifying experiences of my life because I had come so close to death without understanding why or how. Later on, the doctors told me it had most likely been my medicine since nothing came back on the MRI. 
Moral of the story, if you feel yourself slipping into mania, get help before you do something so stupid you nearly kill yourself."

 My blood cholesterol is slightly raised, but according to Dr is within range.

Just woundered if anyone else has had any sides from their meds?"
162,"Hello everyone. This is my first post.

Some background: I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 in 2006. I've been on disability since 2007. I currently share a house with my 80-year-old mother (my Dad died in 2009, I got divorced, ugh, so much happened to get me here).

I've felt like a loser since having to leave work and go on disability. It's still a source of shame, though less so now. But, crippling anxiety and depression are daily problems. Some days are okay; some are beyond awful. I long for death often. And that's without dealing with my mom, whom I love, but who is emotionally unstable. I never know which mom I'll wake up to, the one who's funny or the one who's angry at EVERYTHING. (It's not just aging; she's been this way all my life). I do not have the funds to leave, plus I'd feel like I'm abandoning her. (She has some physical difficulties). 90% of the time, she's fine. But that remaining 10% drains me completely. She's emotionally abusive. (She will ignore me for hours or days, depending on how much she feels I've slighted her in some way. Again, something she's done all my life.) She drives my brother crazy with her bouts of anger and judgements, so I do have someone who gets what's going on and is helpful. But he doesn't live with her. (He doesn't understand how I do.)

Gah, what am I even asking here? I guess I want to know how to live with an elderly parent who has zero respect for boundaries, zero respect for me as a person with needs she neither understands nor wants to understand. (This is a woman who self-identifies as selfish and seems to think that somehow makes everything okay. It doesn't!) She discounts my mental health entirely. (""Think happy thoughts!"" As if she'd ever listen to that advice when she's railing or depressed about something.) I know she's toxic. I know this. But even if I had the financial means to leave (I do not), I couldn't just abandon her. I cannot do that to my Mom. To be clear, I don't want to be a martyr, and I'm no angel. I'm just trying to figure out a way to navigate the cess pit I live in. I'm already predisposed to depression and anxiety. I do NOT need her pushing me to the edge of the abyss. I don't know how to reach someone who seems to have no respect for me as an autonomous person.

(BTW, she forces her opinions on everyone, not just me. She cannot conceive that anyone thinks differently than she does. Ever. I want to bang my head through a wall.)

I'm sure there's a lot I'm not seeing or understanding. That's why I'm here. I cannot count the times I've planned to shuffle off this mortal coil. Actually planned. But I'm still here. I have reasons to still be here. She's just not one of them. I sound like a hideous human and an ungrateful, horrible daughter. I don't mean to be. 

Ugh this is so hard. 

I've rambled. I'm sorry. I'm just so tired of trying to navigate the eggshells at home. So very tired."
163,"Hey everyone, I recently was diagnosed with bipolar & I’m really questioning everything. This was my first appointment with a psychiatrist, I thought I was getting in for talk therapy so was a little confused...

Basically, he just asked me a series of questions then advised I show signs of bipolar 2. I’ve had depression and severe anxiety since I was a kid and the depression occasionally subsides for a period of a few days to a few weeks (anxiety never goes away lol).

When the depression subsides I have an elevated mood and high self-esteem, which were the characteristics the psychiatrist said indicated I have bipolar. During these times I made a lot of impulse decisions such as scheduling vacations (which I always end up cancelling and losing my deposit), or making big unnecessary purchases (juicer, treadmill, new car, clothes)... I’ve never gotten into legal trouble or struggled with addiction during these times, but I used to smoke weed. In the past I’ve also done things like cheated on my boyfriend (ex), gone to parties, made a lot of new friends, and lost some friendships as well. But it all seemed to me like “normal person” behavior as it is the only thing I know outside of my depression.

I was prescribed ZyPrexa and my mom and fiancé both think the psychiatrist is crazy for diagnosing and prescribing me meds and they both think I shouldn’t take them. My fiancé said he’s known people with bipolar and I’m nothing like them.

My mom went on to say how my cycles are symptoms of anxiety and depression and that she’s gone through similar things but they’re not bipolar, just other responses to trauma etc. Then I remember times where she had gone through what seemed to me like manic/depressive episodes, mostly depressive but would go through phases where she’d get into gambling, or start take impulsive trips in which she makes friends and hugs strangers during a pandemic...

Sorry for the long post, I guess I’m just really torn between relating to what the psychiatrist described and listening to what my mom and fiancé are telling me. Has anyone had any similar symptoms/experiences?"

I have been feeling depressed while dealing with issues in my personal life. My manic high degree to just eating more food sometimes and then go to worst like having sexual risky behavior with some times. I won't think I would just act with my mind thinking "" I feel better if I can relax with sexual pleasures."" Is something I many times just pops into my mind. I not understanding which treatment would benefit me besides the therapy session which my own mother has told me she refused to pay for the sessions. Until next month Feb. 1st. I have known mental health since my mother has been heavily involved in my passes years during grammar 7th grade up to the present. 

My first question is about TMS treatment.

1. Has anyone known of the pros and cons and how it might effective after the full 5 weeks of treatment?

I have been on now 1 - 20mg of Geodon in morning with 1 - 1mg Klonopin. Than 80mg of Geodon at bedtime with Trileptal 300mg . yet I dont know what the next step with dealing with my manic high and lows . I writing poetry most of my time and than I try and color and sketch ."
166,"Excuse me if I come across as a bit uneducated about Bipolar. I’d like other people’s input and views.

For years now, I’ve suffered with depression. After recent events, I am contemplating getting reassessed, as I actually suspect that I may have some kind of Bipolar.

A few times I have been really low and then can suddenly watch a clip on YT, and cry with laughter. Then after ages of giggling uncontrollably, I sink back to either ok, or the state I was in.

Other times I experience my mind rushing from one great idea to the next, only to just think later on, I can’t be bothered. Or the idea gets forgotten.

Also on occasion, I’ve been really full of the joys, like I’m high on life, but the feeling doesn’t seem to last. Only a couple of hours.

Are these signs?
I also ask as my cousin who I don’t see much suffers with Bipolar."
167,"Hi. About 5 months ago I had an ex boyfriend from when I was younger contact me. We started talking and feelings came back pretty quick. For the most part it has been long distance. He is moving back this summer all of his family lives where I do.
That being said he can be all in and go 4 days without talking and a little more stand offish. He is under a tremendous amount of stress right now. So on Newyrs I ended up telling him I was backing off he could get in touch when he wanted too. Also told him to have a great year which I know sounds like I'm done talking.
Later that night he was drinking he wrote me and blew up said I caused chaos in his life, that he told me he was hurting and I wouldn't listen, leave him alone. I was so hurt by it esp after this is someone who has even said he still loves me and wants to be near me. 
So now we have not spoken in 25 days of course I feel like he meant what he said and is not sorry...even though deep down I don't believe this.
I started really thinking the stress and the bipolar is more what caused this outburst his illness and not really him as a person.
I want to be there for him and feel like I abandoned him and was way to pushy. I want to give him space and I'm hurt. Another thing he is drinking some and not on meds so it's not good. Should I leave him alone? Reach out? Any advice would be appreciated."
168,"I haven't gotten a diagnosis yet though my therapist and psychiatrist suspect that I have bipolar. Here's a random question. During hypomania, do you ever get tired. Yes, there is obviously a lot of energy that goes on but do you ever find yourself wanting caffeine to get through the day. Last night I decided to wait to take my meds since I knew it'd make me tired. I had a caffeine pill and stayed up all night then took the meds at 5:30am (supposed to be taken before bed). I was tired for a couple hours because of it but had a caffeine pill before 9am and was good the rest of the day. It's almost 7pm and I still feel energized. But not exactly that manic-like energy I had earlier today. I stayed up all night writing music, but it's not like I'm constantly experiencing symptoms. I honestly think I am not bipolar and I think all my manic symptoms are just attributed to my ambitious, goal-oriented, over achieving personality and desire for control and purpose in life that makes me want to work on projects and get a lot done even when I should be sleeping. But I don't know, is it normal for energy to kind of ebb and flow in hypomania or is it always constant. I also feel a lot of depression to goes that coexists at the moment. How long can or does mixed episodes typically last? It's been like this for awhile. I feel mostly depressed for most of the time but then still experience hypomanic symptoms at different times during this as well. It's really confusing. Also, maybe I'm ""addicted"" to feeling manic and so that's why I want to schedule these all nighters and productive days, or I simply just want to find productivity in my life, in a very extreme way because I am very obsessive as well about things like schedules, productivity, goals, etc. Maybe it overlaps with other things. I don't even know anymore."
169,"Exept for olnzpine, seroquel, carbmzepine, lamictal nd depakine. 

I guess I have to choose from antipshichotics becuuse most mood stabilisers give allergies. 

The problem is I don't feel good nighter with antipshichotics, make me feel like a zombie, fainting, can't feel any emotions, can't stand on my feet, can't walk often, loosing balance when walking, brain fog, unable to have a normal conversation etc... Serious problems with cognition and memory. No motivation, no energy. Make my depression worse.. 

Does it mean I will feel the same with other antipshichotics? (I'm really afraid to try them) 

Is lithium more safe with less sides effects? 

Can i take lithium and antidepressant in the same time?"
170,"I have a question about taking meds. So I’m on 100mg of Seroquel and 50mg of Lamictal (slowly increasingly dosage). I was told not to take my caffeine pills for the time being, but I need to stay up tonight. The meds make me tired enough to go to sleep. I’m not going to completely stop taking them because I know I need it. I’m supposed to take it at night before bed but what would happen if I waited to take it till like 5am? Is it supposed to be taken around the same time? If my psychiatrist said “take it before bed”, well then that could mean literally any time because if I sleep during the day more then I could technically take it in the morning then sleep and so on. I mean, it’s not really specific. How long would it take to experience any withdrawal symptoms if I just waited to take it. I don’t want to push it too long, but I really need to stay up tonight? Anyone know the answers to my questions? Thanks."
171,"I do not take medicine for my bi polar. I would like to feel ""normal"". You know, like everyone else that do not suffer from any mental problems. I do not like feeling the way I feel. I am sick of my mood changes. The sadness. The anger. Sick of feeling negative. It is getting in my way of living, well combined with my other problems (OCD). 

Do you feel better after taking medicine? And are there any side effects to the psychical body? I mean do you feel sick when you start taking the medicine? I want to start seeing a doctor and take medication. I want to know what I am in for. Thank you to everyone that answered"
172,Im a medical marijuana patient and am gathering information about cannabis and Quetiapine.  Does anyone have experience with the two and what side effects did they experience?
173,"I don’t know who I am or what I want in life. I am just a depressed person. I don’t have any skills. I am terrified of people. But mostly terrified of my own view of myself. I cannot name anything good about myself. I don’t even want to live because I see no purpose. All I can think of is myself and how everything is wrong with me. I want to be liked and wanted by someone but I have nothing to offer. I have no confidence or social skills. I feel
Empty inside. Is there any cure for low self esteem? I just want to be happy. I want to connect with others. I just hate myself and doubt myself in everything I do and my existence. I feel like a waste of life."
174,"Hi all, i am sure this will be viewed as a slightly taboo subject but i wanted to bring it up. I was diagnosed 4 years ago with Bipolar 1/2 (borderline) and since then have tried many medications. I am now on Lithium and Lamotrigine and have been for about 2 of the 4 years. They are ok but i still hit very big lows which is obviously dispointing. I live a very healthy life, veggie, no booze, no smoking and i do my best to sleep for a good amount of time every night. 

With all the above in mind i have been researching about self medication. I am going to venture down this path purely out of interest and intrigue and i will be taking a properly measured amount of MDMA. I will be on my own and in my house with calming music. I hope for the session to last 4-6 hours in which i am going to let what ever will happen, happen.

I am keen to get peoples thoughts on this and has anyone tried it? What has happened? Good? Bad?"
175,I'm a runner and pretty good about water intake but sometimes forget to drink enough. Do folks on Lithium find it hard to stay hydrated?
176,"Disclaimer, post contains opinions and theory.

People like Dr Peter Breggin who knows about what happened before the pharmacological revolution and Robert Whitaker are interesting individuals in the world of Psychiatry. I hope one day I can reach their status too because this topic is close to my heart and we need people who care enough to research these things. Especially for the children.

I come from an information technology background and I try to apply those concepts to Psychiatry and I have had some success in simplifying some of the mess. There are modelling languages in computing science such as the Unified Modelling Language and the object oriented thought process. There is another one called the entity relationship model. I used these languages to develop generalizations and apply them to Psychiatry to simplify the over-complication in it.

One such generalization that I think took me over a year of contemplation I call the Pain class abstraction. If you are into art you will know that abstract things whether it's in art or in other spheres of life make you think and provoke thought. They can be used to solve problems.

My pain abstraction states that every Disorder derives from one general disorder (pain). Why? because simply they are all a form of pain. Quite logical right? In this way I simplified all disorders. Now pain has attributes and behaviours and because all Psychiatric labels are a form of pain I was able to generalize, simplify and relate to them all. Check the picture below:



You can relate any Disorder in the DSM and it will fall under the above generalized Disorder. Let's use the above pain abstraction as a template and fill it with Bipolar Disorder. Let's consider my own case as of current.

Pain: Bipolar Disorder
Initiator: Myself

Initiation Method: Trauma

Responder: The people involved in responding are Psychiatrists, myself, family etc

Response Method: Very broad: mood hygiene, sleep hygiene, Sodium Valproate, diet, vitamin d, trigger prevention, stress management etc

Subject: Who was impacted by this form of pain? Myself

Manifestation Subject: Where does this pain manifest? It cannot be detected anywhere in the body so it goes under the category of Non-physical ailments. Therefore it manifests non-physically. I experience it, others don't. It also gives thought to the fact that because it can't be detected, it has made me realize that external entities contribute to my Bipolar such as societal stress.

Time period: How does this form of pain relate to the dimension of time? Is it intermittent? Is it a permanent illness? etc. Bipolar is known as the phantom disease because it's symptoms can be regular or unpredictable and even disappear for years at a time. By generalizing the time aspect of Psychiatric labels we can do more than what is being done now in Psychiatry such as classifying illnesses as permanent, acute etc. We can go deeper, explore and get better outcomes.

Communicate: The bottom attribute ""communicate"" is a behaviour of pain. So how does bipolar communicate? This basically comes down to the symptoms (mania, depression etc)

You can apply the abstraction to all disorders.

I hope that makes sense. Feedback appreciated."
177,"(sorry for my english grammar)3 years ago started the worst period of my life i had a maniac episode i dont know if im bipolar cause i never really got to an actual doctor to officially do a diagnosis but im sure i got a maniac episode im not gonna write all the story cause is long and is in a span of time of months so i was smoking weed everyday alot completly addicted i started getting paranoid because i got hacked on facebook 2 times and ""friend"" fucked me over for a  money thing , people started talking behind my back in the city next i started thinking there were cameras in my house in every corner i stopped using the pc cause i thought there was someone monitoring it then i stopped goin outside  lose sleep  and not really eating much and skipping  meals i started talking with the tv like all the tv channels were reffering to me in all that i smoked even more weed at some point  i wasnt sleeping for more than a day and i didnt eat  i kept smoking and there was the film matrix on tv when the famous part of the pills came my heart started pumping harder than ever did in my whole life my brain started to feel like there was  electricity waves things growin on it i couldnt move or close my eyes after sometime a light come from the corner of my left eye that come near me i dont know how to explain it i collapse i wake up after sometime (not alot) and my left eye i can see barely with it i start cryng and sayin sorry to god and praying after that i go to sleep again i do 3-4hr of sleep and i go out of my house looking for ""signs"" like little clues that god left for me to understand something the level of delusional is big next after hours going around for the city  i get arrested cause for a passive aggressive thing i didnt hurt nobody they arrest me im in a cell for some hours and then they let me go i go back to my house next day i get out of my house again without documents i go to the train station and go on the first train i found before going there i cried i dont remember why i get on the train the ticket guys come they say to go down but i insist that i gotta go i have to so they take me down after they are in front of me i run back and go in another train i go off in a city i go around for hours no money no document no food i get in this condo place i wanna go in  i dont remember why the guard of the condo put me down and call the police . police came and arrest me think that im a refugee and bring me to the country side and break my sim card of the phone cause they thought it was made with another person document after they left me there without saying  nothing i try to get back to the city because 118 think im a joke call and i didnt even know where i was after many wrong roads i took i arrive at the city in all that i didnt sleep or eat or drank i go around the whole city again i try to bust down a door in another condo cause i think that is the place i have to go  for some reason in all of this thing is full of this ""signs"" that i interpret any absurd ways so police arrive again im destroyed i barely stay up on my feet they understand that im not ""ok"" because i keep saying things that dont have sense they get me to an hospital they do some questions and then sedated me i wake up in a mental institution."
178,"I had an episode last summer which lasted 3 months. IT all started from smoking weed which eventually led me to drinking and in turn I fell into psychosis. I ended up in jail for five months. The embarrassing things I did on social media and words I have said to friend me and family are unforgivable. I became a monster and eventually homeless  I am now dealing with the repercussions. Feeling lonely and depressed, ruined relationships and tons of humiliation from the public forum I put myself out in while being incessant and erratic on social media. I was acting like a 5 year old. It’s turkey a progressive disorder and I have never had this happen to this extent before. When I am sober I don’t experience mania. I have 5 months clean now and never will touch a substance again. I take lamictal and am hoping this phase of depression shame and embarrassment will fade. However the damage has been done. Please let me know who else can relate. Thanks. Ps new to this site"
179,"When you are manic, are you aware of what's happening?

It's just the the more I observe I feel like you can either be conscious or unconscious.

If you're very very drunk, you're basically another creature and are unconscious. Just like how someone who is Manic loses touch with reality. Both cases don't always have memories of what happened.

But if your emotionally overwhelmed, it's not really a disease...because you're still aware of your state."
180,"Hello,

Does anyone have experience with changing jobs because of bipolar disorder? 

Im currently an Elementary School PE teacher and the potential of the chaotic environment can trigger me into a manic episode. I recently yelled at some kids for acting up and threw a cone on the floor. Parents complained and the Principal is writing me up. 

Should I ask for the district to accommodate me by giving me a desk job (if that is even realistic)?  Or should I try to keep teaching?

Going to be hard to just change careers or take a pay cut because I have a family and my wife only makes $12000 a year.

Anybody familiar with a similar situation?"
181,"Hi! This is the first time I have posted on this forum. I have bipolar disorder. I know everyone has a different experience when it comes to this mental disorder, but I was wondering if anyone else experienced this. When manic, I have done and said some terrible things to people. I feel incredibly guilty after the fact and was wondering if anyone else suffered from extreme guilt due to things they have said or done when they felt as though they couldn't control their impulses? For instance, one Christmas I was manic and absolutely ruined my family's day. I was just so horrible to be around. I won't go into what exactly happened, but every year when Christmas comes around I feel tremendously guilty and depressed after that one year. Does anyone else feel this way? If so, how do you get over that guilt? And if you never really do, how do you cope with it?"

I was wondering what peoples thoughts are on Lithium and sexual dysfunction."
184,"Hi, sorry if this is so long, I just want to write it all down and see if someone has had some similar experiences or has some advice. 

I was recently diagnosed with cyclothymia. Before that, they tought it was just depression and anxiety. Since 2017 to 2018 I was on duloxetine (30mg), a drug, they told me would be very beneficial to me as I also have Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (a connective tissue syndrome that gives me chronic pain and constant injury) and also clonazepam (1mg) and quietiapine (12.5 mg). My worst symptom back then was insomnia, so I felt a loooooooot better with this drugs cause I could sleep. But I started doing weird shit, I broke a 4 year relationship because I started sleeping around putting myself in danger and later I almost got married with someone I didnt really love. (I also finished my masters and started a Phd program). I did drugs and took risks I wouldn't ever before. Given my new diagnosis, I think I was experiencing (hypo)mania probably caused by the duloxetine (I've read that taking antidepressants can do that if you are on the bipolar spectrum). I didn't think any of it was bad, I was ""having fun"". 

Then I made a mistake and thought that because I was feeling better I should stop taking the meds. I did this with my psyquiatrist and therapist approval, though. They said it was only a year long treatment and it was time. 

It did not go well. The psyquiatrist told me to stop duloxetine cold turkey (I have a new psyquiatrist now, of course) and the withdrawal syndrome was so, so bad I really thought I was dying. It caught me off guard and I know that was an exaggeration but it was really awful, I had brain zaps, diarrea, fever, joint and muscle pain and the whole package. 

I eventually tapered duloxetine off but kept taking clonazepam because when I tried stopping it, I started having horrible panic attacks. It was the end of 2019 and I was feeling extremely depressed. I was crying at work and home and everywhere, running to the bathroom to have panic attacks with no one seeing me. It was bad.

So, on march 2020, I went to my current psyquiatrist and we agreed (not having a bipolar diagnosis yet) I should go back to duloxetine. It made me feel better but not entirely (I myself do not know what that means, I have always been ""functional"" but I have always been very depressed and prone to toxic behaviour)

Then came the pandemic and this horrible lockdown that makes everything so dificult to distinguish. Having some more sessions with my psyquiatrist, and questionaires I filled with the help of friends and family members (to have a broader view), we landed on cyclothymia.

I changed meds a month ago accordingly. My new meds are magnesium valproate 600mg a day, quetiapine (a higher dose of 50mg xr) and clonazepam (I take a quarter of a 2mg pill). I quit duloxetine and psych said upping quietiapine should help as a bridge drug. The first week was absolute hell, I self harmed, cryied non stop, yelled to my boyfriend and created problems out of nowhere, etc. I had withdrawal symptoms but them from week two to three, I was feeling a loooot better, more focused, almost happy, I was sleeping and with no trouble at work.

But, now, on week 4, I feel more depressed than ever, I feel so drowsy, sleepy and unfucosed than ever. I feel what I read in this forum as ""plain feelings"" and I am more irritated than ever. I unintentionally cut myself cooking several times. I know some of this is withdrawal syndrome from duloxetine, because I again have brain zaps, diarrea, fever and joint and muscle pain but, does it take that long to go away? I am extremely irritable, I hate everything and everything makes me mad (I am not usualy like this).

I tell myself that we are on lockdown (i'm in Mexico) and this is hard on everybody, that may be this would be this hard even if I had the right meds and dosage but I just don't know how to tell apart what's making me feel this way. I think may be after a while, quetiapine (that was taken from 12.5 to 50mg) started making me feel this way or maybe it is just contextual. 

I started taking drugs on 2017 because I really really needed them not because I thought they would be a quick solution, I took two years of psychodyanamic therapy before chosing to take meds, and I waited like 4 years to even afford that therapy. My family looks down on people who take meds and I feel really guilty for taking them (they don't even know I have mental health issues), but it is clear for me if I didn't, I wouldn't be here writting this.

I admit I am very impatient. I second doubt everything, the choice of meds, of dosage, the timing. But maybe the drugs just need to settle in and work but this place I'm at, changing meds, I am truly worried I won't survive this. I feel so low, I am suicidal and it's not like I can go to a movie or see a friend to take my mind of off things. I'm not being as ""functional"". I am specially afraid I won't be able to stay in my Phd program or I'll lose my job (a small non tenuretrack academic job), I know my bosses are aware of ""something called mental health"" and they are somewhat caring but academia is not well known for being compassionate.

I appreciate any well meaning comment on any of this.

I tried to write this as well as I could, but English is my second language so if you got this far I hope this wasn't hard to read."
185,"This is partly a response to Diana's post - but I thought it warranted a new thread. I was literally in ICU for a couple days with an incubator shoved down my throat and a catheter inside me. They almost gave me dialysis.

Has anyone else suffered anything this severe?"
186,Help
187,"Hello All,

I'm Vicious (new user)! I recently started taking burpropin once a day every day. I just don't feel like its working for me.
The only time that my mood changes (that I can physically feel) is when I'm with this particular ex. This ex (now bf, I think.. it changes everyday) I've been dealing with for almost 10 years now. We were highschool sweethearts! It was definetly the most loving and disastrous relationship at the same time. There was a lot of cheating and lying when we were younger and I do think that changed my way of thinking. I felt attacked all the time and unloved. But I stayed.
Fast forward to three years ago, we tried things again. I told myself to let go of all of then pain and make things work!
I lost weight, I was feeling great about my self (since we took 6 months off after the first breakup), I didn't have as many negative thoughts. Then, I started to get stalked online and harrassed on IG. Turns out that was his GF that he was living with the whole time we were ""dating"". When I found that out, I think thats where the old me finally died.

I was no more with myself. I didn't value life. I didn't pay attention to my bills or livihood. I became behind at work. I completely lost my mind. I lost my mind because when I finally let the hurt of the past go, I was still heartbroken. The same day I found out all of the lies, I went to go hang out with some music industry people. Long story short, I was sexually assualted and I attempted to kill myself that night.

After all that, it took 2 years to finally get the truth out of him. At this point we were loosely dating. Honestly, we would just hang out to smoke and argue about the past. He would get hotel rooms to have sex with me. Nothing felt right during this time. I felt like a sex doll. I started to deal with other men at the same time to feel how it feel how he felt when playing me. I wasn't myself for a long time. I began to abuse a lot of drugs. We stopped dealing with each other agaim because I broke up with him on his bday. He claimed that he was broke on his bday and couldn't see me until the day after. I knew it was a lie so I looked up his Gf's IG and found out where they were. I chose to crash the ""celebration"" like a cheaters episode. 

I could go on and on about our crazy relationship but I'm sure not a lot of people want to read this much lol.
Fast forward to now after not speaking for months, he decided to email me on valentines day. Of course I gave in because why else would god keep placing him in my life? I'm thinking theres a reason but it always goes bad somehow.
It's only been an month and we're already fighting hard. I recently told him that I may be bipolar. Since I've told him I've had a few episodes. I feel like he doesn't understand what I'm going through. Hell! I don't even understand it.
I take the medicine everyday but I don't think its working long enough for me. I feel like it makes me feel ""normal"" for half the day and then the other half I feel like myself again. I feel depressed and unworthy.

When we get into arguments, I tend to call and text a million times knowing he hates it. The last ""episode"" I had is last weekend. I wanted to talk about something so bad but I knew it was going to turn into a huge argument. Instead, I looked in his back seat and found nipple pasties. So I accused him of being with someone else. When I started to yell, he proceeded to start hurting me. That ended up becoming a huge arguement to the point he started to drive me back home, saying ""I always start problems"".  I felt something bubbling in my stomach. I started to scream at him and threaten him with an item. When I did that, he hurt me again.I ended up with a knot on my face. He then told me to get out of the car and I did. I cried on the street for an hour, Hurting myself as he watched. He left then texted me "" when I was done to walk back where we were "". Which was two miles away. I did walk back eventually.

I feel up and down everyday. I cry everyday. I'm a dark room everyday. I feel like I can't escape my sadness. I feel like I can't help to annoy him or just piss him off. Ever since I was 14 and we laid eyes on each other I wanted him to be my forever. It just seems like now even with knowing my issues, things are really bad. I just don't want to kill myself or be killed from this relationship. I'm not sure if I need a better medication or more therapy or a mix. I'm just lost right now.

Thanks for reading my post (if you made it through lol) I apprieciate it."
188,"Dear all, 

*I would like to say in advance that this might seem redundant in the perspective of other problems that people (including myself) have faced in their lives. But I believe that boredom is a very understated plague amongst people with mental health problems and it should be more talked about since bordom is just one step away from depression. I believe that keeping occupied is part of keeping sane, so it is important to combat this.*

I've been fairly stable for the last few months, and if you follow my account you may know that I had a few rough patches but I've manaaged to by and large iron them out. Mental health wise I'm doing pretty well. 

But, I'm struggling to deal with the mundanity of life. This is also due to the lockdown that is taking place, but I haven't been able to find a job. I reapplied to uni a month ago and I've already had some offers come through, so I'm sorted in that respect, but I don't start until October. And between now and then I have very little going on. For now, one day rolls over into the next. From the new year, I set myself a few goal, such as weight loss. I have been dieting and already lost 3kg. But for the most part I struggle to keep myself occupied, because right now, my life doesn't have any kind of discernable direction. Mostly, I just watch Netflix and look forward to going to sleep.

Any ideas on how to combat boredom and find meaning and direction in life.

Regards,

189,"Hey!
i normally don’t ask such important stuff on the internet but because of the lockdown, I can’t go to therapy.

my mental health didn’t got better and just worse, so I started to watch mental health. When I started to watch one of the videos of psychologist talking about bipolar disorder, she mentioned stuff that I was going through.
like going from a extreme low to a extreme euphoric episode. for example for 2 weeks I’ve been working out extremely at 2am, redecorating my room,dancing in my room with loud music as if I didn’t need sleep to feel energetic. Also spending a ton of money and just being talkative and social. I also felt the need to take drugs. The next to weeks I was just laying in bed and I felt nothing like emotionally numb and I felt the need to harm myself. I just have so many negative thoughts and I just don’t care about anything anymore.
i also know that i always go from extreme highs to lows and every time I feel happier I am scared to feel so bad again for longer time episode for no reason


I hope that anyone can help me"
190,"Right now I have stability, but it so tends to veer off course shortly after. I am either super depressed so much that I can't move or hypomanic to the point of spending so much money needlessly. I mean, I wish there was a way to find stability and keep it. If there was a way, I'd be all ears. Turns out when I was in a relationship with a stable and kindhearted boyfriend, my symptoms were minor. It was almost as if I had a break from being bipolar. I'm on the verge of finding that again possibly, but I have to be careful. It's no good jumping into things and regretting it later. I learnt my lesson after the breakup which totally shook me.

What are people's strategies for maintaining stability if you have bipolar disorder mood swings on a regular basis?"
191,"After meeting a man, I got manic and was irritable, loud, and talking fast. But, I slept it off and continued taking my medication.  Now, I feel fine. I don't know if sleep can make mania disappear. But for me, I felt a whole lot better after sleeping for awhile."
192,"would anyone who i don't know anyone who is not my family miss me because i know they won't sometimes they ""show"" that they love me just to keep up appearances, and i don't like it when people touch me even if its just a brush a tap or something i hate being touched period even by my family like hugs i don't do hugs i know its stupid but hugs scare me i need my medicine and i haven't seen or heard from my psychiatrist in months i keep telling my mom but she just says i'll make an appointment but she never does she keeps brushing it off she keeps doing that she's going to be the reason for my death i'm sick of being this way i'm so miserable i always tell my mom but she doesn't care no one does if this doesn't get fixed soon i'm self medicating i swear to god i'm in the point of my life where i can't get a job no matter how many times i try, i'm so tired of trying to be the best, i'm tired of being overweight, i'm tired of not being pretty enough to have a boyfriend/girlfriend because years of bullying, i'm tired of life, i'm never gonna be good enough, i'm never gonna be the best, i'm never gonna have the life i wanted, my life...its just a waste of a life...goodbye"
193,"I've been watching the sun come up everyday for the past 2 weeks. 

Yesterday I moved my computer desk and reorganized my office area. I spent one night working on the unreal 4 game engine which is a game design program and engine. I did that for 8 hours straight then quit because the sun was coming up.

I've been getting naps in here and there but for a hour or 2 at most. 

I'm seeing the shadows and movement in my house when no one is there because I'm sleep deprived. I like to keep the lights off inside my house to help reduce the shadow movements. Shadows are a bunch of darkness then.

I doubt many can relate since bipolar 2 people are in an abundance and don't have the same experiences or they would be #1.

I get irritated easy and lack patience. A common side effect of being sleep deprived.  My family are self employed and apparently I need to be also because I don't get along with management. 

Lately I've had a strong desire in wanting to be with chef Ramsey. He seems to be on the go 24/7 and he makes me laugh. Well the look he gets from the people he communicates with makes me laugh. Is his behavior typical of UK men of his age group?  I don't usually like that age group or anyone older than 30."
194,Hi I am suffering from bi polar I have been prescribed olanzipine 5mg and clompiramine 100 mg daily the last few days I have been feeling manic one minute and suicidal the next it's dark I have this obsession with being sectioned I can visualise being sectioned I'm trying to keep it together but its tough
195,"Has anyone else experienced this? So I’ve been depressed now for months at this point. And I feel miserable most the time. But on occasion, I spend time with my family and I kind of show them a side of me that is humorous, slightly talkative, almost like this is me “turned on”. Not manic in any way, but just what looks maybe “normal”. I don’t feel completely better, but I feel “numb” as if I’m doing what I need to do to manage my life in front of other people. But at the end of the day, when no one else is watching, I’m right back to this depressed state that feels unmanageable. When people see how depressed I am, I get a lot of backlash and people say cruel things. So I don’t let them see that anymore. But I even kind of convince myself that I’m doing well. Until I remember how I feel when no one else is around. Is this just me, or do other people experience this when depressed?"
196,"I’m suspected bipolar, and today I feel detached from myself, like I feel as though I’m not quite in my body and mind, my nerves are shredded too! And I feel sad and tearful but also upbeat at the same time if that makes sense? It’s like I’m in two moods at the same time and also bad tempered and irritable. Has anyone else experienced this?"
197,"Hi I’m new to the forum and Iv currently just started Lamotrigine in November for suspected bipolar, was told by my psychiatrist if they work for me the diagnosis looks likely. Before I started Lamotrigine I was a complete mess 
One minute Id feel slowed down, lethargic, feeling negative about everything,i feel so depressed I can’t see a way out. I seem to have so much hatred for my boyfriend during this time, I say the most nasty things, everything and everyone irritates me and I have a fiery temper in which I want to argue and fight and I dont consider the consequences at these moments I just do not care. I can’t control the urge to say the most awful things and shout at people. I don’t feel comfortable in my own skin and even my clothes really irritate me. I avoid people I know, I feel like I want to self harm and I have suicidal thoughts during this time too. I sleep a lot also. 
Then all of a sudden I get a switch in mood which I am bright and cheery, thinking positive about everything, I love my boyfriend again, life is great and I’m excited to be alive, I am sociable and very chatty, my head feels like it’s fizzing and I have adrenaline pumping through me and I just feel alive, I have lots of creative ideas and I’m constantly cleaning and sorting things, I can’t sit still, I’m laughing and joking and also talking some jibberish at times, my thoughts are going so fast I can’t keep up with them and sometimes they don’t make sense it’s like their all muddled up, i have a very high sex drive during this mood and I’m less inhibited. Does this sound familiar to anyone? It’s like a constant cycle and it’s exhausting. However the lamotrigine has calmed both the highs and the lows to a point I can cope a bit better. Just wanted some advice and maybe someone to talk to?"
198,"My husband experienced a severe manic episode and went missing in late November. It's been 6.5 weeks since he has been gone and about 7 weeks of full blown mania. Police made contact with him in another state; he had flown there with nothing but the clothes on his back. We have talked a few times briefly on the phone with some one line emails here and there to me and 2 of his friends, but he still won't tell anyone where he is. He was adamant that he is staying where he is, engaged in a project, and is divorcing me and ""starting a new life"" there. He quit his job here, left me with all of his unfinished projects and logistics to care for; pretty much blew up his life.
This past week he has pretty much stopped all communications with me, his sister and friends. I fear that he has entered a depressive period and is completely isolated in an unfamiliar place. I think I have enough information to figure out where he is.
Question is; should I seek him out and try to get him to medical care at this point or do I continue to give him time and space? 
I wasn't able to help him or convince him to get medical care when he was home, so convincing him now may be futile. However, he may be in a different state of mind at this stage in the episode. I just don't know enough about bipolar disorder to guess or know the pattern. 
Playing this ""wait and see"" game is absolute torture; I want to help him! At what point do I or his friends try to intervene and seek him out??
Any input is welcome."
199,"Do parents have a right to know about mental health struggles/treatment etc.? I’ve been very depressed with also some manic symptoms. I may have said some things impulsively without thinking and got myself in trouble with my dad. I was very irritable earlier and felt suicidal and impulsive.

then later today my dad asked me what’s wrong and pressured me to talk about what I’m struggling with. He totally does not believe that I could be bipolar. I briefly mentioned that I’ve been depressed for months and he said “so what are you gonna do about it?” And there’s no way I’m telling him about medication because I don’t think he agrees with the idea of taking psych meds. Super uncomfortable, also with the fact that he has been emotionally abusive in the past and I don’t really trust him when it comes to talking about anything personal. By the way I’m 19 and in college. I don’t think he needs to know About everything that’s going on.
But what about educating parents about the symptoms? I’m sure at some point it could be helpful for them to know when I’m having an episode or what the triggers are etc. Any thoughts?"
200,"I feel so angry feeling like I could beat the shit out of someone that crosses me. I have been losing my temper with 6 year old and partner. Whilst driving yesterday I wound open my window and shouted at a driver saying you can't park here. Thinking back he could of. Was going to beat shit out of him. 

Shortly after these angry out bursts I feel very depressed, like nothing matters anymore. If I go back onto quitirepine I just feel drowsy and numb. I thought manic episodes were supposed to last for weeks then you crash. 

Does anyone else experience this?"
201,"Haven’t received the official diagnosis yet. I’m starting to question though if I really have bipolar. I’m very convinced that it’s not ADHD or borderline or anything else that’s often confused with bipolar. 

My biggest doubt is because of what’s happening right now. I don’t think I meet the criteria for a mixed episode, but it doesn’t feel like a pure depressive or pure manic episode. It’s like I’m depressed then sometimes show more signs of hypomania on top of the depression. However, in the past I have had episodes that met full criteria for hypomania and episodes that met full criteria for depression. But right now, I don’t really know what’s happening. It’s like I’m depressed most the day then sometimes in the evenings, I feel super agitated and frustrated for even being depressed so I come up with ideas and things to do that will make me feel more powerful, alive or express that increased energy. And then I get very irritated and want to hurt myself but then that sometimes turns into slight euphoria. But overall, it feels like depression is the main mood that I feel, and have felt for months now.
Does anyone else have feedback or have experienced something like this before?
My psychiatrist saw me last when I felt very manic-y but I don’t think she realizes that I feel mostly depressed right now. And I don’t even know how to explain it at the moment."
202,feel like ending it all. no one understands me or thinks im attention seeking or pretty much scary. i have no family or friends and the one person i have (my girlfriend) views me as toxic and abusive for being mad over every little thing even though i've tried to control my bursts and angers. she will probably end up leaving me too. everyone sees me as scary or manipulative when all i've done is try to be a good person. my manic and depressive episodes fluctuate so quickly everyday on and off and idrk what to do anymore. i dont want to end my life but thats how it is. my mum treats me like absolute shit. :/
203,"Hi,

I just need something antipsychotic as I had 3 psychotic episodes over 19 years-  every time I got off meds, which was three times. 

I wish I could come off meds but I can't! Because I always have an episode if I do... :( it sucks!

Is there anything that is antipsychotic but NOT SEDATIVE... so that you can feel motivates and energised.

Really appreciate the answers! Many thanks :)"
204,"Dear Forum,

Following on from my previous post I am currently debating whether I should stick with aripiprazole (abilify) as my main antimanic and antipsychotic agent or switch to something else. As I previously stated, aripiprazole works great for me and I have virtually no side effects, apart from ONE which REALLY REALLY causes me a problem.

That problem being is that it completely blocks out my ADHD medication. Hence, after doing some research I considered Depakote (Sodium Valproate), however after reading your comments I have decided that this is not the right drug for me due to its long term toxicity to the liver and lack of antipsychotic effect. Also not lithium for similar reasons.

I was about to give up all hope when an idea struck me like an apple from a tree, which my old psychiatrist (now retired) implied (albeit very subtly) to me (God bless him). Why not use a short acting antipsychotic in the evening (like Seroquel) and then take my ADHD medication in the morning once it wears off. You see the problem with Aripiprazole is that it is extremely long acting (half-life 72-94 hours) whereas Quetiapine is only 8-12hrs. Hence, if I take my drugs right, I will have perfectly balanced ying-yang effect. However, I want to know more about the drug before I try it.

TL;DR: How effective is Quetiapine for Mania, depression and psychotic features? How does it compare with Aripiprazole? Any side effects I should be aware of?

Thanks in advance
-H

P.S. I will prob only have to be on a low dose, because I am predominantly depressive type (Stable on Lamotrigine) and have very mild psychotic symptoms. I would also consider other short acting antipsychotics such as Amisulpride."
205,Hello everyone. Im on Lamictal and Latuda (which Im getting off of). Im looking for ideas for medications to replace this antipsychotic or some type of therapy. I'm in therapy now doing bits and pieces of DBT but was looking for option geared at Bipolar disorder.
206,Anyone got any goals for 2021. I kept mine simple this year: loose 10kg.
207,"Hi Everyone,

This is my first post. I'm really glad to be here

I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2002. I'm on Olanzapine 5mg now. The problem that I have is that I feel tired most of the time and I don't know how much of this is my med which is sedative AND how much is my bad habits....

I have a problem with my daily routine. I can't wake up in the morning at all. Or I'm half awake but still, eyes closed and won't get up for 1-2h, as if I don't want to face the day.

Then when I finally wake up, I still stay in bed to read a book etc. I know this is not healthy at all. But I have no motivation to do anything...
I should be waking up early, exercising at some point in a day.... but I can't make myself do this 

I choose the path of least resistance because I feel like since diagnosis and being on meds my life is over! I basically can't wait for all this to be over. I don't feel any happiness. It's been like this for a long time. I also feel like, what's the point to try anything now... I'm in my late 30s.

My medication makes me so sedated. I don't feel anything. My emotions are flat. I wish I could come off it BUT most probably I'll have a relapse if I do. Happened before.

I know that if I tried to make positive changes and break the bad patterns I'd probably be better....but another day passes and I still do the same thing.

Does anyone experience similar?
How is your daily routine? What time do you get up and go to bed?
How do you make yourself to exercise - if you do?
How do you manage bipolar fatigue?

A part of me wants to have a better life but I don't find the strength to fight.


Thanks so much! Sending you Blessings!

Julia"
208,"I am 24 and have always been irritable. I can sleep a very long time. I have such bad social anxiety its very had for me to even make myself go to the store. I probably go out once every 4 months. I have a toddler and I am easily irritated with her. I hide it as much as possible. Recently, I decided to go to a psychiatrist to be evaluated. She diagnosed me bipolar 1 due to me telling her since I was young, I would be unmotivated and couldn’t get off the couch for a week, then all the sudden I would get this intense adrenaline rush for two days where I could not stop cleaning and organizing. I would be srubbing walls till 5 am. She prescribed me lamatrogine. I instantly felt amazing. My anxiety was gone for the first time in forever. I was motivated but not overboard motivated. I was able to focus and it felt like my mind calmed down alot. Although, I had a sever allergic reaction to it. I am now too scared to take mood stabilizers and antipsychotics. I asked my doctor over the phone if I could please try an antidepressant. She refuses. I don’t understand! I am not suicidal, i do not feel depressed. I just have a serious social phobia and anxiety and I feel lazy most of the time then i get adrenaline and clean! How can trying an antidepressant cause that much harm? Im extremely self aware and if I feel the slightest bit off, such as feeling depressed or bad thoughts, I would of course call her right away!"

210,Can some primarily be depressed but then show signs of mania every once in awhile? I have the habit of trying to force mania to happen because I hate depression. I can manage to do that but it’s only very briefly and happens at the same time as I’m still depressed. But they are just manic symptoms that come and go... it has for the last week and a have or so. Would this be considered a mixed episode?
211,"Dear all, 

As some of you already now, for several months now, I have been receiving treatment for bipolar disorder. Since stating I have made waves of progress with my mental health, I no longer feel depressed or suicidal, I no longer get horrible manias that result in me doing impulsive things and no more paranoia.

I was initially diagnosed and treated by a fantastic psychiatrist who totally understood me and helped me immensely. Unfortunately, her retired and in his place I had someone, who lets just say is less than ideal. I had an appointment with her where we had a minor disagreement about the medication that I should be on, however, after much conversation we agreed on a middle ground and that she will speak to her supervisor about changing it. 

So, you can imagine my surprise when a receive a phone call from this **** tonight telling me that my Bipolar diagnosis has been withdrawn, my medication has been withdrawn and I have been discharged from the clinic. She claims her reasoning for this is that, no psychiatrist has been able to observe me in the midst of a manic episode (despite many of my friends and family saying to the contrary), I smoked a little pot in the past and that she believes that I will not benefit from being on bipolar medication, despite the fact that I have responded very well to it. 

Now, luckily I had the presence of mind to request my repeat prescription before my appointment with this absolute twat so I should be good for another month, maybe more. But what do I do after that? I'm on NHS so beggars can't be choosers really when it comes to selecting care. Who should I talk to about this, how do I go about being re-diagnosed?

Any advice would be VERY VERY VERY much appreciated. 

Thanks in advance 
-H"
212,"I don’t have the official diagnosis yet. I won’t know till they see how I respond to medication and rule out other possible diagnoses. I started some Seroquel and Lamictal. It makes me so tired and so I’m actually sleeping enough.

I don’t know how I feel right now. It’s like I’m depressed but also have some manic symptoms as well. It could potentially be a mixed episode. The medication will take longer to begin to start working for my mood. But all of this confusion and instability doesn’t even make sense and I’m beginning to question if this is even real? I am doubting if this is even real.
Also, does anyone know when the fatigue will go away? I just want to have more energy. It’s almost like I feel somewhat manic and want to do anything but I have no energy to stay up all night and execute on those plans. Then I’m starting to wonder if that is just part of my personality and not so much mania. I’m generally a passionate person and I get excited about goals and things I want to do. But how do I know if it’s beyond just my personality?"
213,"I can only speak for myself.  The images are unreal.  I have seen a lot in my days.  The death of JFk, RFK and MLK, racial protests, Vietnam protests, nightly casualties on the news of young americans in Vietnam in the hundreds.

Two 1/2 years of stability, I feel at the moment it falling apart.  My hands are shaking, my breath catching and untold sadness.  I don't care about either side at the moment and this post is not meant to start any political discussion.

We really have to get our act together.  I am just going to take my anxiety meds which I haven't needed in 6 months and hope to God this ends now."
214,Just curious if anyone’s tried or had success with this? Never tried Cbd before but I’m curious if it can help. Or anyone try those thc vape pens?
215,"i used to have bipolar (i bellieve) in my 20's but the highs i had were kinda like a dopamine rush where i would have racing thoughts, and would feel in top form where my mood would be elevated......but i dont think i had mania or hypomania as my highs lasted maybe 5/6 hrs and also i didnt have reckless spending or engagement in risky behaviour nor did i sleep very little

anwyay my point is i had mini highs coupled with severe bloody severe depression......would this qualify me as bipolar or are my highs insufficient"
216,"To be completely transparent, I don’t have an official diagnosis yet. They are leaning towards bipolar II but are still kind of in the process of starting medication and ruling anything else out.
I’m just wondering, during hypomania, is there ever a time that feels exhausting? Even if it’s just once during the day? Or feeling like kind of the effects of sleep deprivation but also extremely energetic and euphoric all at the same time? But then just certain parts of the day that may feel more calm? Also, I’ve heard people say they can stay up all night then almost completely flip their schedule and sleep more during the day. That’s happened before but usually it’s only a couple hours of sleep every night and oftentimes that sleep happens in the afternoon sometimes when I start to kind of feel tired. 
I know, I want to leave it to the professionals to diagnose but it’s helpful to at least know more about bipolar so that I can try and see if there’s any key differences in my own experience and bring it up to the psychiatrist.
Also during times of irritability, are there ever moments that are not completely agitating? Like it just feels like everything is annoying and frustrating but you are calm enough to not want to hurt someone and the agitation isn’t there?  
Today my psychiatrist said I seem kind of hypomanic-y and I agree. Even though it kind of feels like mixed. There are some lingering symptoms of depression as well though which I didn’t really have time to talk about much. Any input and feedback would be much appreciated. Thank you."
217,"It has been 3 hours since I last posted on here and talked to my partner. They finally picked up my call 3 hours ago where I cried and told them I was starting a panic attack. They were with our mutual friend and kind of played the situation off. Now, these three hours without any contact with them have felt like HELL. I have never felt this type of sadness, anxiety and heartbreak? I don't know. I can't sleep, eat or do anything, I am so scared. 

They were only supposed to go for a walk ALONE for about 30 minutes and it has been 5 hours and they're with someone else...Whom I don't trust. We were supposed to spend the day together since it has been a few days and they never came home...They never walked home or tried to calm me down. I feel like I'm losing control of myself. My partner has done this multiple times. I contacted a relative to them and they told me ""to not be worried"".

218,"Dear Forum,

I'm currently on 2.5mg of Aripiprazole (abilify) and 200mg of Lamotrigine (Lamictal) for Bipolar. I am also on 30mg of Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse/Elvanse) for ADHD. However, I have found that my antipsychotic is blocking some of the effects of the ADHD medication so I'm looking to switch it up.

I have done some research about treating comorbid Bipolar and ADHD and the only combination of drugs that have been proven effective is Amphetamine and Depakote. Lithium and Antipsychotics have been shown to block stimulants. So I am considering speaking with my psychiatrist about switching me to Depakote.

I do have some concerns. I haven't been able to find a lot of reviews/first hand experiences about the drug, but from what I have heard it tends to be pretty negative. I've read that it can cause sedation and weight gain, which is a problem for me considering I do struggle with my weight and I need to stay alert and awake. But perhaps the Lisdexamfetamine can counteract this?

Any experiences shared/advice would be greatly appreciated.

P.S. How does Valproate interact with alcohol? Can you drink on it (in moderation obviously)?"
219,"I feel so miserable. So depressed and feeling suicidal but also agitated, irritable, annoyed and euphoric all at the same time. It’s like I can’t escape myself and I just want to run away from everything. It’s so annoying.
I was first depressed but then I tried to bring on hypomania by using caffeine, mood light, supplements, skipping medication etc. because I enjoy the productivity that comes with it. But the depression never left and now I just feel terrible.
My main goal for the new year is to never skip medication and to start actually working on mood stability. I would actually be so much more productive that way because I wouldn’t be so easily distracted an wouldn’t be so sleep deprived so I could do a lot better quality of work. Anyone relate? I have a lot of hope for this year."

I also have big adrenaline surges for daft reasons and I’m aggressive.

222,"Me and my partner have been ""a thing"" for more than a year. They know everything about my extreme separation anxiety, PTSD and my mental health overall. I have been suffering from BPD and PTSD most of my life, but it has never affected me as much as it does with my partner. You see, this is my first time getting so severely attached to anyone. Now, I'm currently having a slight panic attack as because my partner is hanging out with a person of the other gender. Now, this is usually not a big problem for me but my partner becomes really disrespectful and non-caring when being with this person. My partner and I have discussed this matter where they usually blame it on me. Saying stuff like ""you're controlling"", ""you make me feel like shit""...etc. I ALWAYS tell them that I'm alright with them being with others as long as they can assure me that everything is fine. I have explained for hours what they can do to reassure me like: message me telling me when they will be home, that they're alright. Say that they love me...It's quite easy. 

They can get really mean sometimes and tell me how worthless I am and that they will leave me any second. They know that this is my biggest insecurity and that I have a strong attachment to them. I have panic attacks more than 4 days/week which consists of shaking, suicidal thoughts, dissociation and extreme headaches. They leave, in the middle of the night hanging with the same person when they know how extremely anxious I get. I only have a problem with their friendship because of how my partner acts when being with this person. 

At the end of the day, I am the one to apologise because I'm scared that they will leave. I'm scared they will get angry. While I'm crying my ass off, they mock me or hang up. Which they know is the worst possible thing. 

There's so much to tell you all about, our situation is really complicated but I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do. I don't know if I'm in the wrong? If they are? I have a therapist but she has a very busy schedule because of the coronavirus which leads me to not being able to talk to anyone about my struggles for more than 2 weeks."

225,"Hello,

I’m new here and I just recently stopped my medications for personal reasons and I was doing really well for awhile but then one day, it all hit me like a Mack truck. Back at square one, my brain started to attack itself again leaving me in the ruins. It’s a constant overwhelming feeling of wanting to escape, escape my life that I worked so hard to build. I’m making the ones around me miserable but I can’t get back on my meds for certain reasons. I just feel like I want a new me, I feel like everyone around me finds me to be a burden and I hate myself night and day for just being me. I’m paranoid over the dumbest things and ideas that pop into my brain and I start to catastraphize to the point of no return. I am not well and just wondering who’s out there with me? I’m so low I had push myself just to take a shower. I’m trying but I’m so lost. It’s like being in a dust storm and putting your hand out and no one is there to grab it. Anyone out there in the storm too?"
226,"I’ve been on lithium for 20 years with barely any issues until the last 3 years where I’ve been all over the place with what I call anxiety. This anxiety is not caused by anything i.e it’s not caused by my job or difficult relationships, it is simply ‘there’. I am on quetiapine for the anxiety but I never feel right.

A friend of mine suggested maybe  the lithium isn’t working as well as it used to. When I have doctors  appointments they always tell me they won’t take me off lithium because it’s stabilising me really well and that they don’t want to mess with it. I have left a message with the surgery but am wondering if anyone had had experiences of lithium stop working and move onto another mood stabiliser or any knowledge about combining lithium with other mood stabilisers or drugs in general.

I have looked into getting a private appointment with a specialist psychiatrist for bipolar - £395. I think it’s disgusting. Like robbing people who need to be helped."

A couple of weeks ago I was in a very bad manic/mixed episode w/ bad disassociation and overdosed 3 times....I was finally committed for a week for psychological help and finally my meds and regimen are working and I'm stable. 

But the thing is, I am now finally in a space to sort through everything that happened and picking up the pieces of my life. My memory of the events are pretty limited and I have a lot of things that I just do not remember (which is terrifying). 


This weekend I am going back home finally (with someone there to support me), but I am nervous about how being there will make me feel... given all the events that took place. I'm also upset because I caused so much damage to myself and scared my loved ones. I just don't want them to leave me because of this. I've been reassured they aren't and they just want me to be better but I can't shake that fear."
228,"Just wondering how anyone manages their job along with their moods?

I got into an argument with my boss last week. I came to work at the height of my mania. (Coming off risperdal ) Without sleep, and no sleep that night. I was emotional and out of control. She didn't want me to go home. Like I wanted to after I did the big orders. She pretty much said if I want to work there I have to put their business first. I told her I had to take care of my health. She told me she just wants me to change my mindset. They pulled me aside today and told me I've been unprofessional. I just don't know what to tell them. I just feel like I do my best, and it's not good enough. I never call in sick, maybe that's the problem- they see me out of control. Just a few weeks ago a girl called in sick because she didn't sleep all night!"
229,"Hello everyone, just joined the forum. My therapist and psychiatrist think I have bipolar II but I don’t think it’s an official diagnosis yet. I think they are right but I have some doubts about it.

is it common or normal at all if you still have “normal” spaces of time that occursin the middle of an episode? Say for example, there were two weeks of hypomania then one weekwhere things felt more stable but then another three weeks of hypomania.
Or if there’s certain times of the day that things are a bit more calm within an episode. Like today, I’ve felt very manic-y (with symptoms starting a week ago) and I was very much elevated even with no sleep at all last night and this late afternoon, feeling a bit more irritable. But then felt okay and just my passionate personality this evening. But we’ll see if I decide to stay up again tonight. There’s so much I want to do. Do symptoms have to be constant for the entire duration of the episode, or cane different symptoms come and go throughout however long the episode lasts.

thank you,
Butterfly."
230,"It's good in some ways to stay informed, I guess but I just can't emotionally handle the news. It's just too much negativity. China is apparently threatening to invade Taiwan and Russia is hacking the shit out of us. What the hell happened to world peace? Is no one interested in it? And I cannot stand George Bush. His asshole administration made the world a thousand times worse. It feels like there wouldn't be as much turmoil in the world had that jackass not invaded Iraq. Why are there so many stupid humans in the world? They're just killing me with every stupid act. So all this is making me angry and anger is not going to solve the problems in the world either. I just want to give up."
231,"I am diagnosed bipolar & currently on medication for it, but I’ve realized that in the past month I’ve started picking fights with my boyfriend at least once a day & I always feel horrible after. 

I also have been super fantasizing about going to bars alone and flirting with people that aren’t my significant other, which I know is me trying to self sabotage. I need help, has anyone delt with anything similar? My boyfriend is amazing and totally understanding of the disorder & I’ve been trying so hard to stop picking fights and end my feeling the need for extra attention - but I’m worried he’s going to get tired of my fighting. He has made comments before about how “if I don’t want to be with him anymore I don’t have to be” so I know the fights are starting to wear on him too. 

Any similar issues? And how’d you work through them? Am I just too unstable for a serious relationship? I want to marry this guy & we’ve been together for 3 years, but I feel horrible for dragging him down with me - he doesn’t deserve it."
232,"Are there any great differences between these two.
My main gripe with Lithium is that it starves me of all feeling / emotion. I feel emotionally dead, although I feel it helps me sleep at night. Hoping to taper it and switch to Lamictal if I can.
Any advice greatly appreciated."
233,I have been waiting for months to be assessed for bipolar and was assessed over a phone last week the doctor said he would phone me back and hasn’t yet a week later my problem is I am starting to go down hill like I am crashing and it’s so hard cos I am having to go threw this every few months after feeling on top of the world what can I do I have this horrible feelings like in the pit of my stomach
234,"Has anyone got any tips for losing weight while on lithium? 

I read that you shouldn't go on a crash diet, which I presume is due to the reduced salt content. I'm looking to use meal replacement shakes and was thinking of taking electrolite drinks alongside to keep my salts up. Anyone tried that?"
235,"Has anyone else experienced memory loss because of ECT treatment? I don't mean short-term memory loss which is very common during the treatment day. I mean a little harder memory loss. 

All my memories are gone. Especially last three years are in the dark but I believe depression has it's own effect. I barely remember my kids' birthdays. I don't remember where my friends live. I need a navigator just to find a grocery store even though I go there every day. I don't recognise people I haven't seen a while. I repeat myself all the time because I don't remember a conversation I had an hour ago. 

Those are just a few examples. Living with this kind of memory loss isn't easy but I have created some ways to cope. The easiest is to write everything down. My kids are also eager to remind me of things. My family has been great and patient with me. 

I believe I've been treated with ECT longer than usual. My memory was gone during the first treatments. I haven't noticed anything new lately. Something else has changed too in my brain. I notice it when I have to do simple math or use my brain otherwise. I am slow and can't think logically but this also could be depression. And when I realise I can't do it, I have a panic attack. 

They say ECT is totally safe and doesn't cause any of this and I believe it. Maybe I was just one in a million that this happened to. Hard part is that nobody will ever believe me. My doctor won't even listen to me if I try to tell about my memory problems. ECT has helped me great deal. It keeps me functional and helps with self-harm. 

Just wondering if anyone has experienced same."
236,"Hey there everybody!

First post here and I'm so grateful to have access to said forum. I've been doing a lot of research on here about individual experiences of people with bipolar, and it is eye opening and informative.

I've been with my bipolar girlfriend about 6 months now. We are in love and she is so sweet, perhaps even the sweetest girl I've ever dated. It was this genuine affection and care on her behalf that so closely attracted me to her. 

Our relationship, for the most part, has been very smooth. We both are mature and are not ones to argue, yell, etc. For that I appreciate our connection. 

She has always been open about her bipolar with me ever since we started dating, and I liked her so much I wasn't willing to walk away based on such a condition because I love her for who she is - and she is all I want.

She has been on medication for sometime, and hasn't experience what she considers a 'manic' episode in some time. However, recently due to multiple life stressors, she has been experiencing intense depressive episodes about once a month. During these episodes, she withdraws, ignores my texts and phone calls, and just generally leaves me feeling concerned and worried about what is going on with her.

Initially I, unfortunately due to lack of experience, used to think she was 'pulling away' due to dissatisfaction in the relationship. Granted, once I got to know her, I began to understand it isn't me - it's simply her mental health. I'll admit I wasn't always the most cognizant in the initial comprehension of this, but I'm slowly figuring out she truly does love and care about me, she just needs space.

My issue is that she refuses to tell me her feelings or that she is feeling down / depressed, thus perpetuating the above. My gut tells me to leave her be, but I become so worried. All I'd like her to do is just state something like 'I am having a difficult day, and would like some space.' I can accept this. However, her refusal to communicate that she is feeling this way until after the event occurs is difficult for me.

My question is, how can I be there for my partner if she isn't willing to divulge such feelings? She frequently tells me she isn't used to having somebody who cares for her in the general vicinity, but the pain of this multi-day silent treatment really hurts my feelings. She then will become emotional and cry, calling herself a shitty girlfriend, etc. Obviously if I thought she was a shitty person we wouldn't be together! 

Is there anything I can do to make her more comfortable sharing that she needs space to deal with these feelings? Or is that something that can only be organized on her accord? Thank you so much for any input you can provide! I fully understand a relationship takes two to communicate, but I end up just feeling confused when this is happening as she won't tell me anything at all."
237,"Interested to hear from anyone who has done/experienced any of the following:

been stable on lithium for a long period and then started having issues. What happened and what med changes?

Was on lithium and changed mood stabilisers or added mood stabilisers eg was on lithium, moved to carbamazepine or was on lithium and now also takes lactimel.
 
Has been diagnosed with anxiety but does not actually have a ‘cause’ for their anxiety eg just feels low level anxiety continually.

Have a relaxing Christmas Day everyone, be good to yourself x"
238,"I am bipolar type 2 and my life is constantly out of hands mainly because of depressive episodes. 

I am on

Lithium 900mg
Quetiapine 300mg
Sodium Valproate 1200mg
Lurasidone 74mg

I also take Quetiapine 50mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg for anxiety. And Thyroxin for hypothyroidism. Also suffering from anemia. I am also treated with ECT. I've recieved so many times that I've lost track. At the moment I am given ECT every two weeks. It has ruined my memory but it keeps me somewhat functional. 

I've tried so many medications, I've tried Ketamine infusion and have been hospitalized so many times but nothing works for me. I suffer all the time. Just wanted to share this. Feel free to comment if you are experiencing the same."
239,"So, I haven't really been compliant with my medication for over 6 months now. I usually take my morning tablets but I rarely take my night meds. Mostly because they make me feel really nauseous for about 30 mins after I've taken them. I've stopped taking my antipsychotic completely because it made me so drowsy the day after that it was just not practical, especially when driving around.

Anyway, I still live with my family and they all try to encourage me to take my medications regularly. Of course they get frustrated when I'm not taking my medication properly, but I figure it's my health, my choice. My sister in particular gets pretty frustrated to the point where she gets really angry with me. A couple months ago, she injured me while shaking me that I had injuries that scarred for a long time. She apologised and we moved on. But earlier this week, we were fighting about my medications again and she tried to harm  me three times. She apologised just a few hours ago but said she didnt think we could be sisters if we kept fighting over my medication, so it was up to me whether my not taking my meds was more important than having siblings.

In all honesty, I'm not ready to forgive her despite her apology. I understand she was upset but that's never an excuse for violence. It's hard to forgive, especially when I still have bruises and injuries that hurt.

Despite not taking my meds, I haven't noticed any worrying symptoms and I've been living my life just fine. I'm going to talk to my psychiatrist about changing my meds and I'm not looking to stay on them long term either. I would ideally like to not be taking any medication in two years.

Anyway, I wanted advice on what to do with my sibling situation. I feel like I'm pretty set on just keeping my distance from her because I just find physical violence unacceptable. We had a childhood full of domestic abuse, so I'd expect that she would know that violence was never okay since we were witness to and on the receiving end from such a young age.

Thoughts?

240,"Hi,

I wanted to share with you my experience of experiencing Manic Auditory Hallucinations that have peaked and subsided and now are a few last men standing who are prolonging their miserable existence ..
The way I have dealt with these is not to pay any attention to them or give any importance to them ... if you listen to them and analyse the ramblings of these voices I could write a motion picture script of some inmates of a lunatic asylum screaming away and dying for attention ...

I just want to say too all of you the way to go is to take your meds regularly and DO NOT let the voices get to you and DO NOT pay any attention to these voices these are not of an credibility that's a part of the lunacy not meant to be taken seriously ...

Whenever I hear in the news that some people have gotten into trouble and blame it on listening to their voices I just cannot understand how ""STUPID"" they are to have made such a mess of their life's ... if your wish to  talk back to these idiotic voices simply dismiss them off by telling them that ""There is nothing that you all can do or achieve you all are nothing but Auditory Hallucinators !"" 

You have got to put these Voices in their place and do not let them get to you ... these voices are highly manic and progress in an highly exponential manner you give an an inch of liberty and they will eat your soul !!! So know them right from the onset and do not give in to anything ...not even a glass of water ...

The voices that I have been experiencing are so god-damn insane and bloody malicious that they take me for a fool and expect me to disrupt my entire life and satisfy their stupid insane cravings ... these creatures go on and on screaming expletives and what they call is we are ""P'ing"" you and yield to us ...
I can't help but laugh at these insane voices and what exactly they are trying to achieve ... they have the mental reasoning and ambitions that match those of terrorists and quite fit that profile ...
They set out to disrupt anything and everything and have no concept of law and order or neither seem to know the difference between right and wrong ...

Any one else have such experiences ... if you do one piece of advice do not succumb to the voices and do take your meds religiously ....

Cheers !"
241,I am feeling my self getting more into the idiot version of me brought on by once again a combination or arguing stress and worrie but I am doing things I should not be doing and this is how I always hurt and destroy everything I love and care about and it has been like this for the last 25 years yet still have to go threw this every few months I am waiting for results after getting assessed over the phone but it’s getting too much from r me to go threw once again
242,"since this has been happening to me i cannot talk to anyone, tell anyone. i am in mania and disoriented...whenever i interact with someone this fake facade just acts, responds, talks--it actually doesn't sound manic most of the times, sounds pretty smart and coherent, sometimes really unpleasant and arrogant, weird, but always always has fooled anyone interacting with it that it is me, and that i am not manic, and that i am going through something tough, but not that i am incoherent, manic and out of control which is the truth. in the beginning i needed to tell someone because i needed help getting to safety, now after 12 years i am in a physically safe place. now i need to talk to someone because i cant seam to come out of it and someone else knowing, and acting accordingly i think would be the thing that changes that. but i can't...im trying to come out of it to some degree as much as i can so i can get to the point where i can talk to someone..someone who will be valildating to me, have the right things to say, understand what i am talking about...but to get to that place----i dont know how, i have no idea...im so alone and isolated for so long...i dont know how..i just keep going and try to hold on..."
243,"Dear all, 

I have been on Abilify 5mg for about 4-5 months now and it has been great. I sleep a lot better, no hypomania and no psychotic symptoms. When I first got it prescribed, I spoke to my doctor about antipsychotic side effects. He initally wanted to prescribe Quetiapine but I refused due to weight gain and sedation. We eventually settled on Aripiprazole, as apparently it has the fewest side effects. 

However, ever since then I have been feel very 'meh'. I no longer have as much motivation or drive in my life. I can't seem to get excited or interested in anything in particular. I have to force myself to socialise, but have little actual motivation in doing so. I even took it as far as halving the tablet to see how that goes, and although I have had some success with that, I still feel very numbed. 

Can anyone relate, and if so do you have any suggestions with coping with that?

Thanks in advance,
-H"
244,"Hii all :) 

I was diagnosed with Bipolar II earlier in November and I have a lot running through my mind. Mostly questions about forming friendships and relationships because that seems to be where I struggle the most.

I realized that over the years I have put my friends and family through a lot. I did and said a lot of things that were hurtful. I am starting to realize these things after the fact and although there is no salvaging my past friendships, forming new ones is my main problem.

I recently moved away to college and have been trying to find my “people” i guess. But i find myself oversharing and dumping information about myself on people I just met. I tell them that I am bipolar and all this other stuff without realizing how it might affect them. I am also now seeing that I am very toxic as a friend and I dont know how to stop myself from doing thlse toxic things. Maybe this has nothing to do with my disorder and im just a bad person. I started taking abilify but I cant really tell if theres been any change.  

I dont really know what the point of this post is I guess I just need some guidance or some pointers on how to navigate all this?? No one in my family likes to talk about mental health and I do not have any friends besides the new ones I made at college. I dont really have anyone to talk to about this besides my therapist. Guess I just wanted to hear from people who are going through the same or similar things as me.

thanks for listening :)"
245,"I've been reading a lot of posts recently about feeling like when you meet people, you overload them with personal problems that you've been dealing with and sharing too much too soon.  And then it seems like they get scared, back out, and disappear.  You're left lonely and asking yourself what you're doing wrong.

I've had similar experiences where I overshare my problems.  In the past I have told people that I have bipolar disorder when we aren't even that close.  I remember one time these girls were always around when I was telling people about it, and then I realized they were giving each other eye contact like ""here she goes again.""  That's what really made me wake up and stop revealing my issues too early and with people that I barely know.  I think it's important to keep certain things to yourself until you know someone's ready to hear it, but also it's good to feel comfortable talking about it.  There's a balance.

I was just wondering if other people had similar stories.  Feel free to share your experiences, problems, and solutions that you have found.  I'd love to hear about them."
246,"12 years ago i became manic do to a bad trip and trauma--the psychosis started about 8 months after that experience. my trouble started when i turned to get help and no one understood i was manic. i have been stuck like this since then, been through rehab facility for 1 and a half year towards the beginning, and it was very abusive--they kept me in mania--or didn't give me a safe way to come out of it--they didn't actually acknowledge that it was happening. no one ever did.  i have a lot of trouble communicating, i am afraid of people. i tried turning to help again recently after 5 years that i stopped trying and the same thing happens that always happened, what is going on went right over her head, and i didn't have the ability to tell help her understand.   i am still manic.  only a few months ago i got a safe place to live. this state has left me very very isolated. the few people i can be around are not the most stable people in themselves. after reading posts and articles of people with bipolar i finally felt there is room somewhere for the way i feel...that there is something that makes it all make sense. i'm frightened...i know i need to be able to talk to someone, but that has been traumatising for me, really really traumatising--every person belittled and invalidated me---while in mania i can behave weird and childish and ugly---so i just got judged for being that way as if its who i am."
247,"My wife is going through a manic episode. Throughout all this, her sister (who has dealt with her past manic episodes) is insisting that the ""tough love"" approach is recommended. Basically refuse to engage her unless she accepts her diagnosis and gets back on her full medication. Her sister says that if I don't, then I am ""enabling/rewarding"" her behavior and she will see no need to change. I have been trying that with some mixed results. In some cases, it made my wife take her meds a bit because she was worried I may leave her. But it didn't last long. She is currently hospitalized but is resisting treatment and not listening to the doctors. I have been continuing my ""tough love"" by minimizing communication with her when she is hostile to me. Her sister again is saying to not engage unless she is more agreeable to the treatment proposed by the doctors. My wife is accusing me of abandoning her while she is stuck alone in the hospital in difficult conditions. I am torn about the ""tough love"" now. I stuck to it for awhile and there was a day when I felt she was calming down and I started communication again... then she was back to her aggressive manic self. 

Basically I'm asking is if the ""tough love"" approach works at all or if so-called ""enabling"" is not as bad as some people make?"
248,"Dear All, 

Just a quick update on whats been going on these past few days. As some of you already know, after months of treatment and progress, my new psychiatrist decided to unceremoniously screw me by pulling my medication, withdrawing my bipolar diagnosis and discharging me from the clinic. Following all your helpful advice, yesterday, I contacted my GP and told him about what happened. He was in as much shock as I was and told me he would try to get me referred to a different clinic, but he needs to review the discharge letter to try and understand the reasoning behind their decision. 

Today, I spoke with my other psychiatrist, who is treating me for ADHD. I told him about what happened and it turns out he already knew! He saw the discharge letter from my bipolar psychiatrist. He went through it with me and he helped me to better understand their decision. He explained to me that due to the limited resources available on the NHS, sadly, a lot of patients get unceremoniously discharged if they are deemed to have recovered sufficiently and are no longer functionally impaired. He also told me a bit more about why the diagnosis and meds were pulled although he understood that that decision it was very flawed. 

I ran through the mood symptoms that I have been having, and he said that in all likelihood I do have bipolar and not Mood Dysregulation Disorder. He was very surprised that they have given me this diagnosis, as he said in his entire career of 25 years, he has only twice diagnosed Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (characterised by extreme temper tantrums in children) and that I did not match the criteria for it at all. 

He told me he will write a letter to my bipolar psychiatrist (as well as the chief clinician) recommending that my treatment is resumed, but he said it is unlikely that they will listen to him. He is also going to write to my GP, recommending that I be kept on mood stabilisers. Even though his area of speciality is ADHD, he has a background in general psychiatry and has dealt with bipolar patients in the past. Its too early to say, but I trust that the GP will listen to him. 

Now, I'm not going to hold my breath, because if there is one thing that I have learnt is that with the NHS anything is possible. But I'm hoping that longer term, I will manage to get myself the care that I need. 

So if anyone has any other recommendations of what I should do next to ensure that, would be greatly appreciated. 

I would like to thank everyone for their advice, support and kind words. 

Best wishes, 
-H"

250,"Getting real fucking pissed... 😡

I was having a good day until a damn news popped into my YouTube feed. Tom Cruise ranting at his crew for not following COVID-19 procedures. Him being a punk-ass fuckbag, cussing at others for some shitty mistake. Just read this crap:

“They’re back there in Hollywood making movies right now because of us. We are creating thousands of jobs, you motherfuckers. That’s it. No apologies. You can tell it to the people that are losing their fucking homes because our industry is shut down.""

Same old bullshit. Just fuckdamn same. They think that they're so bloody important. This made me ENRAGED and a bit worried. Reason? I've seen this horseshit here in South Korea EVERY FUCKIN' DAY. Cocksucker CEOs saying every day,

""Oh, change your grey hair, or you're out the door. You got your kids on the line, and they'll starve.""
""Do as EXACTLY I SAY, or else you won't get any jobs ANYMORE.""
""How dare you talk shit about me? Never question me, dipshit!""

Power harassment in South Korea is commonplace. People get yelled at, getting their asses kicked, and getting sexually abused. Cops track this shit down, but this thing continues.

If you don't understand what I was talking about, look here: Gapjil - Wikipedia

I'm scared as a bitch, man. I'm so scared of being abused for a petty mistake. So frightened for being dicked around by assholes for making a small error. Especially by these corporate fuck-nuggets who are hard to please. If you think Americans bosses are messed up, wait till you come here.

I'm scared of getting a job. Scared as hell. I'm scared that I might get yelled at or even physically abused. Why? I have a nasty temper.

When I get yelled at my face, my rage goes up. Hate fills my mind. The more foul-mouthed the opponent gets, I get more pissed. I explode and scream at them back.

This is why I can't go to a military. If these drill instructors bitch at me, I can't stand their mouths.

If someone physically abuses me, I also attack back. I got into some brawls where people were hurt, and I was almost in trouble. All for what? I can't stand being yelled at, and the dumbshits can't keep their hands to themselves.

As of now, I try to stay out of trouble. But this shit is harder in Korea. I already said that Korean bosses are jerks. How the fuck am I supposed to get a job if everyone acts like fucktards?

I can fly back to US, but the poor economy drove them to do the same unbelievable malarkey as here. I'm so afraid because of my rage. How the HELL am I suppose to keep my temper composed when I get yelled at?"

Not sure if any of you have experienced this, but if I get less then 11 hours in bed, I'm exhausted the next day and find it hard to function or to get out of bed. I'm constantly waking up through out the night so that could explain why I need more time in bed to feel ok the next day. Everyone goes to bed around 9.30/10pm here and sometimes i go to bed at that time or up to 12am. The thing is, I've been consistently awake by 6am and lie there trying to sleep. I can hear everyone in the house and I'm really tired but I just can't force myself to get out of bed any time before 9am or even if I managed to sleep well. I never had this issue before I was put on epilim - (a mood stabiliser) and was able to function well for years with little to no sleep. I originally thought it could be because I was stressed/depressed and had alot of things on my mind, however those issues are now resolved. So I don't know why I'm like this. I've also had a thyroid test, sleep apnoea test and vitamin d test and they came back all fine. My weight is still the same before I started epilim. I don't drink alcohol, do drugs or drink anything with caffeine in it. So I don't know why this is happening. Please help!!"

254,"Hi everyone 

I would just like to know more about how it affects you on a daily basis with this illness. Can you work, be around your children and maintain a healthy lifestyle at home? 

I have a couple of friends that have it but I just wanted to know how you all cope with it as it's not a nice symptom to have. I ask because I may start dating a guy that has his 3 daughters that live with him 95% of the time and the mum is a changed person, she doesn't look after them. She doesn't work but she lives off a allowance through him,  she's apparently having lip fillers, botox, expensive treatments and drinks a awful lot. 

She does take medication but when she drinks she gets worse. I know I don't know her. I have my own issues but to not look after your children half of the time or even just (20% of the time) she's more concerned with partying and keeping up with social media trends on Instagram. She's a party girl as well. 

Maybe I am over thinking too much. He seems a lovely person that wants to settle down again which is great.


I was ill last year and I struggled having a proper income for 6 months. I have always been a career's person! besides that I had to do jobs I wouldn't normally do! it was such a terrible experience for me! and I am just coping at the moment paying my debt off and it's getting much better. I had no hand outs and I wish I had something because I really needed the help. I had free nhs help and it lasted for about 6 months and it helped then it got worse and I had to be put on the waiting list. Looks like I am comparing myself again but when I hear about someone wants 25 lip fillers I was just thinking if you didn't have a allowance how would you afford £300 lip fillers each time? amazed

Just wondering I wonder if those children may have issues?"
255,"one word answer: you are more honest and sincere than others

ten word answer:  In the third layer suddenly you become aware that you don't know who you are! Identity is lost, rules disappear, tremendous chaos, a vast ocean in-a storm; beautiful if you can understand. If you cannot understand: very very terrible. This third layer, if understood well, and if you can remain mindful in it, will give you the first glimpse, the first vital glimpse of life. Otherwise you will go neurotic. In the third layer people go mad. They are more honest than the people who belong to the first and second layer. A man who has gone mad has simply dropped formalities, has dropped the role playing, and has allowed the chaos to envelop him. He is better than your politicians, at least he is more sincere and truer to life

one hundred word answer:

I'm not saying: Go and become neurotics, go and become mad; but madness happens at the third layer. All great artists belong to the third layer, and all great artists are prone to become mad. A Van Gogh goes mad. Why? Artists, musicians, poets, painters -- they belong to the third; they are sincere people, more sincere than your politicians, than your so-called monks, popes, so-called mahatmas -- they all belong to the second layer, playing a role -- of being a mahatma. The third layer is of more sincere, honest people, but -- the danger is there; they are so sincere and honest that they fall into the chaos; they don't cling to the world of rules, and then they are in the storm. If one can remain alert in the third layer, aware, meditative -- that chaos turns into a cosmos. It is chaos because you are not centred, not aware. If you are aware it becomes a cosmos, an order; and not the order of human rules -- the order of Tao, the order of what Indians have called the DHARMA, DHAMMA, RIT; the ultimate order, not manmade. And, if you remain alert, the chaos is there but you are not in the chaos, you transcend it -- awareness is a transcending phenomenon. You know all around is chaos, but deep within you there is no chaos. Suddenly you are above it, you are not lost in it. Poets, painters, musicians, get lost in it because they don't know how to be aware. But they are more honest people. In the madhouses of the world there are more honest people than in the capitals of the world. And if I am allowed my way I will turn capitals into madhouses. People who are in madhouses need help, they need Masters, to take them beyond the third to the fourth. Sufis have a particular word for the third layer people, they call them MASTAS: mad, but mad in the love of God. They are mad! For all practical purposes they are mad. They need a Master who can hold their hand and take them to the fourth. At the third layer a Master is needed. If you belong to the first layer, you don't need a Master. If you belong to the second layer, there is no question of, no search for a Master. Only people of the third layer start searching, hunting, for a Master, somebody who can give them help in their moments of chaos. In the third layer the possibilities are two. You can become mad -- that is the fear, that is why people cling to the second layer, they cling deeply, afraid, because if they lose hold they will be falling into chaos -- you all know it, that if you don't cling to the roles you will fall into chaos. You play the game of the husband or the wife; if you drop playing the game you know you will go mad. You go on playing the game that society has enforced on you, afraid that if you drop out of it -- where will you drop? Drop out of the society and you drop into chaos. Then all certainty is lost. Confusion. So one possibility is confusion, neurosis, madhouse; another possibility is: if you remain alert, meditative, aware, the chaos becomes utterly beautiful. Then it is not chaos, it has an order of its own, an inner order of its own. Even the storm is beautiful if you can remain alert in it and don't get identified. Then the chaos surrounds you like a tremendous energy moving all around, and you stand just in the centre, unaffected, your awareness not touched at all. This gives you for the first time a glimpse of WHAT SANITY IS. People who belong to the second layer only LOOK sane, they are not sane. Force them to the third and they will become insane. People who are in the third AND aware -- they are sane, they cannot be forced to become mad; no situation can force them to become mad. People in the second layer are always on the very boundary. A little push -- the market goes down or they become bankrupt or the wife dies, or the son becomes a hippie -- and they fall into the third; they become mad. People on the second level are always ready to become mad; any situation, just a little push. They are boiling at ninety-nine degrees; only one degree more is needed -- and that can happen any moment. And they will be mad. One who moves into the third, aware, goes beyond madness. Then, there is the fourth layer. If you pass the third, only then can you enter the fourth. If you have faced chaos, if you have faced the anarchy of the inner world, then you become capable of entering the fourth. The fourth is the death level, the death plane. After the chaos one has to face death -- the chaos prepares you. On the fourth, if you reach, you will have a sudden feeling of dying -- you are dying. In deep meditation when you touch the fourth you start feeling that you are dying. Or -- because meditation is not such a universal experience -- in deep sexual orgasm also you feel that you are dying"
256,"We have all heard of, or experienced, what happens when someone, who is bipolar, quits their medications.  I have not been medicated for two (2) years now.  Not by choice.  I am allergic to all psychiatric drugs.  This might sound unlikely but it is not.  Psychiatric drugs all have similar formulas; if you are allergic to one, you have a high probability of being allergic to others.  My allergist explained this to me.  Two years ago, I developed a med rash and was placed in an acute mental health care facility.  The longest stay is generally two (2) weeks.  I spent four (4) and a half (1/2) months there.  They tried every drug their pharmacy carried for bipolar but none worked out.  I was an unusual patient as I had never deliberately stop taking my meds.  Now I have no help, from meds, for my illness.  This has forced me to remove myself from almost all social contact.  Social contact almost always is negative for myself and those I come in contact with.  The loneliness wears on me and I think it is worse due to being bipolar."
257,"Hello everyone thanks for accepting me to the forum. I need help with trying to understand my partner who has bipolar. Everything had been going great then suddenly a week ago he stopped texting and calling. Said he is having some problems and will call me when he is feeling better. I have sent a couple of light/chatty messages to let him know I am here for him and can see he has read them but not responded. Is this par for the course when dating someone with bipolar and should I just sit back and wait until he feels ready to contact me, or does it sound more like he just isn't interested in me any more? If it's just part of the BP, how long is it likely to last? Prior to him going cold everything was really good, he was incredibly keen, so I'm feeling very confused and hurt but also don't want to make it all about me. If you could give me some ideas about the best approach I would really appreciate it!"

260,"Hi everyone,
Happy Holidays! I was just wondering if anyone here suffering from bipolar 1 has experienced strong delusions during a manic episode? I did recently and it’s been haunting me ever since. It’s really disconcerting to not really know what’s true or what exactly happened in the past. If you’ve experienced this, how have you been able to cope with the aftermath of such an episode?
Thanks so much. I appreciate it!"
261,I was readin about hypomaniac thing. At this moment I feel like that. Is a bipolar or cyclo symptom? I would like to recognize my ups and downs.
262,"I thought it would be good to be open and tell people Im bipolar, as it would explain my behavior. But now Im finding lack of knowledge about it might make people betray you. Then you have this stigma attached to you, almost like its a choice. So all you nice folks out there who do you tell, who do you tell?"
263,"I need help. 

I’m so disappointed in myself. I don’t even know how to get out of this rut. 

My GPA dropped from a 3.8 to a 3.5 now in one semester. I received a C in a class that I had an A+ in because I couldn’t recover from a depressive episode I had for almost two months. A B+ in a class because my attendance was shit and I didn’t make the syllabi requirement for receiving an A. 

Yet, I don’t want to sign up for disability services at school. All of this could have been prevented if I did. I would have gotten chances for extensions and I excused absences. 

Yet, I don’t feel sick. I stopped taking my meds because i felt better and also because I was lazy and didn’t want to refill them because, well, I felt better. But then the “better” was overspending to where my account is currently overdrawn by $50, I spent almost $2000 in two months with no job, I wasted my money on fucking clothes and shit that I don’t even wear. I’m so freaking hungry all of the time. I’m hyper sexual and can’t stop talking when provoked. I mix up audio to where they’re saying what I’m thinking in my head on the show. I was watching spongebob thinking about something and he started talking about it on the screen. Is that normal? I got someone else on tv and their outfit wrong (white suit and black shirt instead of black suit and white shirt) and when I was corrected I was denying it because I saw him wear a white suit and not a black one. I’m on chat rooms talking to men and I’m so overconfident on my clothing style, life, etc. I think?? Now, I think that it’s okay for me to crush on guys older than me even and these symptoms ALWAYS are bundled up together. I wake up late and stay up late. 

Just last week, I was getting up early and going to sleep well, not eating enough (somewhat), feeling levelheaded about myself and now I feel like I am the shit by judging people and their lives. I don’t know. I’m so upset with my school performance but I don’t think that I’m sick. I think that this is me and I need help. I’m aware and not aware because I don’t need meds. My life isn’t affected that bad I guess. Idk. I’m so fucking dumb. My first college C because I was depressed and didn’t seek help. I hate myself. 

I want to give up. i want ti drop out of school for my gpa because i have to apply to transfer to a nursing program and now my gpa is fucking ruined. i dont want accomodations. i want to be normal or whatever. lamictal, it stopped the depression but then idk bc it was like hypomania.



i hate this sh!t bc i dont know who i am."
264,I'm just wondering exactly how people suffering from a form of bipolar feel during hypomanic episodes?
265,"I have tried quitipine but makes me feel drowsy, and wake up with a dry mouth at night. I have read into other drugs and they seem to have similar side effects. 

Drugs for bipolar all seem to be toxic to health like lithium. People say that these drugs can shorten your like. 

I therefore am considering self manageing my problem."
266,"I have a LONG history of being anxious and/or depressed.  This spans 40 years as I am now 63.  I used alcohol for around 20 years, eventually concluding my drinking was done at the end alcohollically. During the years 2012 to the end of 2015, I had a good few admissions.  Drink figured in these but I was also in major depression and there were concerns about my intention to end my life.  At this time there were concerns about bi-polar disorder.  My alcohol misuse did not make matters easy.  Mixed states were mentioned.

Fast forward to 2020.  I have not touched alcohol for 5 years now.  There have been changes to my medication here and there, and most recently a mood stabiliser, Topiramate, was removed.  This had been used for the alcohol side of things but I was ok in that respect.  My other medication is Pregablin 150 mg x 2 daily, Venlafaxine SR 20p mg daily.  Other meds for physical illness.

So what's problem?  Difficulty sleeping resulting in me being awake till 5 in morning.  During the day I would not say I am depressed to any worrying extent.  In fact I feel quite cheerful and can be bubbly and excited.  My point of worry is that yesterday I was driving somewhere early morning and I 'thought' the radio talk etc was directed at me.  A song was played - but to me it was a jumble.  Muffled sound.  Prior to it being played I thought the DJ  was announcing it was for someone with my initials.  The song title was given out at the end and I googled it, to find it did exist.  The song was Love Will Tear Us Apart if anyone is curious.  This links to a personal relationship situation which has been bubbling this year.

Now away back in 1999, in the midst of a major depressive episode which kept me off work for nearly a year, I experienced something similar.  I had become fixated on someone at work.  I thought I could hear him communicating directly with me (talking.in my head).  There was a car radio incident where a song was played (supposedly?!) for me etc and it had been  asked for by this worker.

This has got me worried.  I don't know whether to call the crisis team tonight to discuss.  So I have come here first for advice.

Thank you all."

268,"Hi all, 

I am on lithium for bipolar 2 but I am discontinuing due to side effects and I want to switch to lamotrigine. I am scared of the possible insomnia though because it's a side effect and I am very prone to that. 
What are your experiences with lamotrigine? Is it effective? Do you experience insomnia? What other side effects do you have? 
Thanks!"
269,"Hey guys.
Close person to my heart has bipolar and is on and off medications since 13 years old. Almost 10 years now. She smoked weed since that age as well, was alcoholic for a long time.
Currently she is off her meds for about  a year and shes getting worse. I really hate to read that she started to drink again, she hates herself, she hears voices. Overall its super bad and depressing period for her. She tries to get appointment to get back on meds but wait line is long with her insurance. Do you guys have any experience with bipolar, what on earth can help her feel better, are there any new methods to treating it other than making person numb with meds? She really wants to die and piece of me would die as well if she ever took her life. I really dont want that ever to happen. Shes such a great person but so unfortunate to have this mental ilness.

Any feedback appreciated."
270,"Hi guys, 

I've been having issues with restlessness and psychomotor agitation. Any tips on how to relax and calm this down?"
271,"Hi all,

I've been around in the background for a few weeks, searching for info and feeling so glad that I'm not alone!

I was diagnosed with bp around 10 years ago.  Spent 6 of those on Seroxat and Lithium and 3 of them coming off of Seroxat and Lithium!!  (planned baby).

I was put onto Escitilopram after having my baby (been on it for 8 months now) and that has been increased to 20mg.  I've also recently been put on 50mg of Quetiapine, with the view to increase it.  I've been on this dose for a few weeks now and no-one has increased it!  I see my CPN regularly and I came off of the quetiapine myself for 2 weeks as I'm not happy taking it.  Anyhow, after a very bad week (OD as SH) I'm back on it until I can see my psych (maybe middle of Jan by time I can see him!).  I've already put on 1/2 a stone and I don't like how it takes so much time out of my day due to grogginess.  I'm hoping to go back on to lithium.

What I wanted to ask though is...does anyone manage to take Quetiapine and continue to carry out their employment each day?  I'm due back to work soon (part time, couple of evenings a week) and am worried that, if I do stay on quetiapine, I'll be a zomby!  I usually take it at 7.30 (so would need to take it whilst at work) and am zonked by 10 (when I would be driving home from work).  I can't take it any later, as getting up with my baby in the mornings will be too hard :confused:

I want to go back to work, it's part of who I am.  This drug makes it seem too problematic though :scared:

272,"So I’ve been slowly devolving into a manic state over the last few days. I quit taking my Abilify because I can’t afford it right now. Last time I quit taking it I had a severe manic episode within three weeks. So here I am again. I’m moving past the fun happy productive mania into the loud, talking to myself, irritable mania. I don’t want to tell my doctor because I just really don’t want to, I don’t want her to mess with my meds. I’ve slept maybe 3 hours in the last 3 days, tonight I’ve taken 3 30mg Restorils and I’m still fidgeting, grinding my teeth, and staring at the ceiling. And itching! I’ve never been so itchy all over my body before it’s very annoying. Has anyone else found themselves constantly scratching during a manic episode? That’s a new symptom for me. Anyways there’s not much point to this post, just restless and reaching out. I know every comment is going to tell me to seek help immediately, I know I should so I’ll think about it."

277,"I hate fighting with negative thoughts; they start constantly fucking me up EVERY time! My negative thoughts have one goal; lead me to depression, stress, and eventually, paranoia. When I try to fight it, anger comes. Unimaginable anger comes and I get urges to wreck anything in the house or anywhere I'm at. If someone tries to harm me during that sequence, I wish to harm them back... brutally. So scared right now. I might get arrested for fighting.

There are many times I tried my ASS off to succumb to those shitty thoughts; I just gave up from the bombardment. No matter. Leads me to despair and fury. Wanted to destroy things and harm people, equivalent as the result of fighting against these negative thoughts.

When I'm angry, I get paranoid. I feel like I'm a screw-up that deserves abuse. Always a fuckdamn has-been. I'm in deep shit; some asswipes might bully me for that! Then I rebel and get even more enraged. It's a snowball effect. Negative thoughts and paranoia fuels my anger, and enhances it. I can stop the negative thoughts, but my emotions propel them; it's a constant wrestle, so I have to vent them here.

I get pissed when I feel hopeless, and gets enraged even more when I see someone being angry. I don't know, I see angry people as dirtbags and gets filled with HATE. I feel threatened, and I want to attack them... which ends up in screaming matches with these fuckers. Why the hell am I that nosy? Some weren't have to do anything to do with me. Some were pissed DIRECTLY at me, not always due to my horrendous temper... more likely with my incompetence (demanding standards). If they direct their anger toward me, my fuse gets shorter. I swear more and grill them with vicious insults. Sometimes, I get more violent... if my opponent physically abuses me. Almost got into trouble with the law. I get easily hurt, and get defensive. Otherwise, I fall into paranoia and greater rage.

The psych meds did me well in fixing me and easing the negative thoughts, though."

279,"I've been having a lot of ups and downs since I have a psychotic episode and quit my job last year. I've pushed all my friends away and isolated myself from ones who forgave me for my behaviors during manic episodes. But I'm too ashamed to look at the ones who forgave me for being a horrible person, so I'm ghosting them and haven't spoke to them since they forgave me weeks ago.

How can they forgive me if I can't forgive myself?, I'm still bipolar.. I'm afraid I'm just going treat them badly again and it feels like staying away is the right thing to do for them. I'm trying to get a job so I don't depend on my mom, and I'm taking medicine and talking to a counselor and blah blah blah, it doesn't fix anything because I already hurt my friends. If someone treated my friend like that I'd have a big problem with that. But I can turn around and treat my friend like that. I'm a hypocrite, I don't even deserve friends.

Self harming again. Usually I sleep a good 8 hours, sometimes more. Sleep is my escape. yesterday I had a very stressful day. Psychologically because I celebrated my birthday (hate birthdays, triggered suicidal ideation) and emotionally because I couldnt get the cake I ordered twice, then I burned the brownies I ended up making. So, we fixed the day, but certainly not perfect. Last night I was agitated. Anxiety was through the roof. I don’t usually get anxiety any more, at least I didn’t think I did. heart palpitations would not stop and I self harmed. I calmed down after that but wasn’t tired at all. Didn’t go to sleep until 3 am and then I woke up at 6. I’m wide awake. Almost wired. Not anxious, not really motivated to do anything, but wired. Could this just be nerves? Or hypomanic?

3. My family and friends always ask me if I took my meds last night.

4. It's difficult to have a full erection. 

5. No matter what happens. No matter how good it gets I can't feel joy and no matter how bad it gets, I can't cry. I feel dull and devoid of emotion or vitality most of the time.

6. I'm afraid of having a psychotic episode and tempting a police officer to shoot me.

7. No matter how bad I think I have it, there is always someone in the world who is worse off. So I feel like I can't even complain about having a mental illness.

I feel like my psychiatrist just throws me on random medications and hopes for the best. I am switching doctors at the end of the month because of insurance issues.

I have chronic insomnia, which would go hand in hand if my diagnoses of bipolar one is correct.

I get drunk all the time just to get to sleep, and even when its not an issue I still drink. Sometimes I will go months without a drunk only to hit the sauce hard afterwards.

And now for the first time ever in over ten years I did THC twice. I even considerded it as an alternative to beer.

I rarely come on here except when I am drunk. For the moment I am not, but that is rare.

I don't know what to say I am taking my medications and nothing seems to get better.

I guess I want a miracle cure which does not exist.

I don't know what to do anymore with this disease. I constantly think I am better off dead with the exception being when I am on some type of substance.

I'm not complaining, I glad to be finally occupying my mind with something. I know, there is no cure for life. 

But these past few days, things have been tough. Of course I'm in a much better place that I was a year ago, but what's become abundantly clear is that those problems have not gone away and have started to rear its ugly head again. Today, I had a bit of a clash with my psychiatrist about my treatment and I also discovered that it might not be possible for me to get therapy which I have been wanting to do for months now. 

So I was in a bad mood already so I distracted myself by starting to clean the house. The other day, my friend was over and he smoked half a joint and left the other half in the ashtray. As I was cleaning up I found it lying there. I have been completely clean since February this year and have become a better man for it. I was previously addicted to tranquillisers and self medicated with cannabis during my depression. I smelt the joint, even put it to my lips, but didn't light it although I was very tempted. Cannabis triggers my manias and psychoses and generally destabilises my mental health. But I really miss the short term relief from stress and anxious thoughts that it would give me. I know its bad for me and I know I cannot control it if I start again, but I was so tempted today, more tempted than I was these last 9 months. 

But I can't give in that easily."

Any advice or thoughts??

288,"Dear Forum, 

As you may already know I have bipolar disorder and I am currently taking Aripiprazole (Abilify) and Lamotrigine. These medications, up until recently have been working very well for me with minimum side effects. However, recently I was also been treated for ADHD by a different psychiatrist. Since then, I have found that the Aripiprazole that I am taking is causing an interaction with my ADHD meds. So I have been considering making a switch to Quetiapine. 

Today, I finally got the chance to speak to my psychiatrist about it. Initially, she suggested that I take the antipsychotic out of the equation completely, but I countered with the fact that antipsychotic helps to prevent the mania, so removing it would be a risk destabilising my mental health. She agreed. She then suggested that to switch to Quetiapine (Seroquel), but she wanted me to be on a VERY low dose (25mg). Quetiapine is only really effective at preventing mania at doses of 300mg+, anything below and it works practically as a sleeping pill only. I told her this, and she seemed to get very frustrated with me, asking me why am I so desperate to be on such a high dose etc. After a lot of backwards and forwards, she agreed to a middle ground of 100mg, even though I doubt that this will work for me. She also said to call her if things don't work out and then we will be able to review in 6 weeks. 

I fear that in the heat of the moment, I may have overplayed my hand. I know that only a fool argues with his doctor, but I honestly believe that I was in the right. She's been a good doctor to me, definitely better than 80% of the shrinks out there, but it does sometimes feel like we fundamentally disagree on a lot of key issues and this causes friction between us. I used to have an amazing psychiatrist with whom we got along perfectly, he could really speak my language. Unfortunately, he retired. Since being with her, it has become somewhat of an uphill struggle, I kept insisting that she gives me 300mg and even though we settled on a middle ground, I could hear the frustration in her voice. I fear that I may have alienated her now and she might even ditch me as her patient. 

Anyone have any advice on speaking with psychiatrist?"
289,"Hey guys 
So im a 28 year old man I'm bipolar 1 im medicated but have been abusing amphetamines for the better part of a year anyone dealt with this and come out the other end? Because its starting to feel like there's no hope
Thanks"
290,"It is just my personal feeling and opinion that the effects of physical affection on the brain and way that the condition of hypersexuality may be the brain's way of compensating against brain degeneration, are not being looked at closely enough by the mental health profession.

When I have a relationship and am touched often I do not have symptoms and others in my life have also commented that they have noticed this as well. I think a pathological sense of loneliness, a really deep feeling of loneliness is emotionally painful. That is why I am wishing to find a long term relationship partner, someone that wants to stay by each others side and that has a love language that is also ""physical affection.""

I really do wish to the universe that I can just find a person to have a crush on and to be in love with, a person that is actually interested in spending quality time with one another, before Christmas arrives, because not having any person to think about often when a holiday is happening is even more isolating that that scene in the movie Beetlejuice of the lost souls room."
291,"Before I start I would like to say this, I don't believe that suicide is the answer, and would strongly discourage anyone to go down that route. It is my firmly held belief that no matter how hard things get that there has got to be a solution and that you owe it to yourself the people that care and depend on you to find it.

That being said, I am coming close to wits end. Last week, I thought I was on the verge of a breakthrough. After months of a painstaking process of selecting my meds, for the first time in two years, I more or less felt normal again. I was exercising daily, studying, eating right and seeing friends, and for the first time I actually got enjoyment out of that. I felt alive, more alive than I have ever been these past two year. But it wasn't to last. 

These past few days are by far not the worst I have felt mentally, but they have hit me hard on a different level. After finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel, I am once more in the darkness. And that there is the cruelest thing about this, to be given hope, only to have it snatched away from you 2 weeks later. You may say I'm overreacting and I have just hit a temporary bump in the road, but I really am at wits end. The hours that I have spent, researching meds, chasing down doctors, getting referrals, going places. I played my best game, and I have still come up short. 

It does beg the question, what am I fighting for? To be constantly hanging on to sanity by a thread? To be a constant source of frustration and a burden to my family? To wake up every morning and to look in the mirror to see a disappointment nothing more than a sad sack of wasted opportunities and broken promise? To have to chug pills like they are smarties just to get through the day? And to finally stand up on your own two feet, only to get beaten back down to the ground twice as hard? Only to do it all again the next day with the same result. 

Fuck man, what else is there to say."
292,"Hello there -
I am questioning the value of counseling / talk therapy.... I've been at it weekly, with the same therapist, for about a year. At times I feel like my 'sessions' are a hour BS'ing with a trusted / unbiased friend.
I do look forward to our sessions as I can talk about anything / she keeps me ontrack with scheduling my pdoc appointments as I am still struggling to find the right meds... But since we aren't working on anything (like going thru a book) I am starting to question the value -
Is my experience normal for therapy in treating bipolar2? Should we be doing something other than BS'ing about life?!

Thanks"

294,Me and my wife are currently separated for 3 months.  We have been together for 8 years and married for 3.   She was diagnosed bipolar about 4 years into our relationship.  For the past year her drinking got really bad and around last January she stopped taking her medication.  Things went down hill from there.   I got in a bad depression just dealing with everything then got sent home from work for 3 months during the covid crisis.  She had a bunch of things happen towards the beginning of June that sent her further downhill. Her drinking got worse. She moved out at the end of August siting that I was the problem and she needed to try to find her happiness.  Of course I told her not to leave. And just talking it didn’t seem like the decision she wanted to make.  But she moved out a week later.  So I started getting myself together and got back to a good place where I need to be.  After she moved out she was already dating somebody within a week.  And he is the complete opposite of me has three baby mamas and lives in a trailer and works third shift.  And one of her complaints was that I work too much and was never there.  But all her family members have reached out to me And asked me what’s going on with her and the decisions she is making do not seem like her whatsoever.  They think she is making a huge mistake with the guy she’s dating and just in general With all the decision she’s made lately.  We still talk want to twice a week and she still calls me when she’s super depressed and tells me she doesn’t know how to do life without me and then it’s a complete 180 2 days later she says she needs space.   She has been posting pictures with this guy and two of his kids on Snapchat and Facebook all the time from what I’ve heard and her friends say she does not look good.  Basically they all say that she completely downgraded leaving me and going to this guy and he is not anywhere close to her type.  I still try to be there for her when I can but can only do so much if she’s dating somebody else I have to move on with my life at some point.   My big thing is I don’t know where to go from here of course I would love to have my wife back.  But I don’t know how to get to that point or what the best course of action is.   In the end I just worry about her well-being.  And she has threatened scuicide in the past but I’ve always been there to help her thru it.   She has pushed away a lot of people that care about her and she has moments of clarity when we talk where she seams to regret the decision to leave but seems to not know how to come back. I assume this relationship she’s in is just to not deal with the pain of the break up and so she doesn’t have to be by herself all the time.  But it’s definitely not healthy.  Like I said I’d like my wife that but whether we get back together or not I just want to make sure she’s gonna be OK.
295,"Has anyone done this?

I miss my dopamine and have asked my care co-ordinator about swapping onto Lithium but I'm getting cold feet now. I may lack motivation on Risperidone but at least I'm not psychotic.

I've got a teams meeting on Monday where I can discuss it further so if anyone has any advice I'd love to hear it."
296,"I am taking it. I didn't get depressed the first day i took it but second day onwards it doesn't seem to be working that well in stopping the depression.

297,"For the longest time I’ve dreamt of living a long life. But that changed after I found out that most people with bipolar disorder will die 10-20 earlier than somebody who isn’t mentally ill. Heart attacks, diabetes cardiovascular disease, and COPD are very likely to happen. 

Even if I make the effort to live a healthy lifestyle I won’t live past 70. I’m currently 18 and I know that I shouldn’t be obsessing over how much time I potentially have left. But I am. 😕"
298,I saw a psychiatrist to get evaluated because I’m often depressed in a LOW low and he suggested mood stabilizers for bipolar medicine but told me that if I AM bipolar then I could try to harm myself and not even know I’m doing it. WTF? Is that true?
299,"I keep beating myself up over my impulsivities of me posting on explicit sites. I am ashamed of myself, and i try to talk to my counsellor and ONLY my counselor about that portion of my past. I feel evil, gross, trashy and scummy for all that. I can’t believe that I am a good person, and pure and nice. I will always have this skeleton looking me in the mirror and showing me why I am not all so good, and nice. I feel terrible, I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to talk to my family about it, it’s personal and private and they’re very strict. But I just want to forgive myself and let it go. What should I do?"
300,"I've recently been diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder. Up until my diagnosis I could never find the words to describe how I felt. The only way I knew how to describe it were with colors. When I am in mania, the world is shades of gold and white. Everything is bright and beautiful, but as the colors start to change, so does my mood. I know when I'm sinking into a depressive episode because I start to see the world in light grays. Once I'm in dark blue, nothing can get me out of my depressive episode. But I'm frustrated! No one gets what I mean! They don't understand colors and the way things change. I just can't seem to articulate the colors well enough. Even here I am not describing them accurately. I looked it up, and apparently, this can happen. So, I guess my questions is: does anyone else experience this? Does anyone understand what I'm trying to say? No one knows how to handle my bipolar disorder. They don't understand that it's more than mood swings. No one understands the colors."
301,"Hi all,

I'm on a cocktail of drugs for my condition and they've started to make me feel really nauseous. To the point where I've been skipping doses to avoid the nausea. When I'm good, I've been taking my meds maybe every second day. It's been like this for over 6 months and I haven't suffered an episode yet.

Should I keep doing what I'm doing? The nausea is honestly getting so bad. I dread taking my tablets. I've mentioned it to my psychiatrist multiple times but he insists I take the stuff he's prescribed me and that they shouldn't be giving me any nausea."
302,"I’m 29 and was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I can understand the mood swings, irritability, and manic episode as part of the disorder. I’m not sure about something else though and was hoping for some input! Sometimes I get into these modes where I feel like people don’t like me? Like my friends are talking behind my back and my dad doesn’t care about me. It’s only during certain times though. It’s definitely not when I’m in manic mode, that’s when I think everyone loves me and I know how awesome I am 😂. Does anyone have experience with this?"
303,"So, I have been tracking pretty much everything about myself using the 'eMoods' app, and I finally exported the data and generated my report. I used that data to create 4 graphs... one has all of my moods overlain into one, and then I also have 3 distinct mood graphs...

I just wanted to share with you all to get some insight and see if anyone else can maybe relate?

304,"(This was written primarily for now mostly orphaned forums where I had decades long presence so some of the stuff within like references to my almost complete lack of dating & relationship experience, being a low wage worker and alluding to past mental health issues are meant for an audience familiar with my posting history.

As a matter of fact since 1992 my only medical attention has been the occasional AIDS test or flu shot. Late 40s male. Almost no mental health issues related to COVID-19 that I am aware of.)





But after googling ""Manic Phase"" I came across all sorts of interesting reading and this pretty much explains an experience that lasted most of October and I was just trying to figure out how to get the feeling back.

I mean I have definite mental issues for sure.

Common signs and symptoms of mania include:

    Feeling unusually “high” and optimistic OR extremely irritable. (In my case it was high and optimistic)
    Unrealistic, grandiose beliefs about one’s abilities or powers.
    Sleeping very little, but feeling extremely energetic.
    Talking so rapidly that others can’t keep up.
    Racing thoughts; jumping quickly from one idea to the next.
    Highly distractible, unable to concentrate.
    Impaired judgment and impulsiveness.
    Acting recklessly without thinking about the consequences.
    Delusions and hallucinations (in severe cases).

However it had a definite catalyst when I got asked on an unexpected second date (and an in home date, my home at that) and decided to quit smoking pot (after ten years I relapsed during the summer) and spend a week straight cleaning.

My mind started racing (see my posting flood), I started sleeping 4 hours a night and probably talked to my roommate more in the space of a few weeks than I had in 11 years.

In that time period I

Lost a lot of weight. My metabolism sped up and an additional ten pounds melted off (since regained). I was almost 140 and my roommate said I was looking gaunt. But then I would run to the top of the local ridge (2600ft?) at the crack of dawn on an empty stomach 5-6 days a week during this time. However due to racing thoughts, it was hard to listen to podcasts during this time. I was wondering if I was sick I was so skinny but I felt too great!


Wrote a tribute to my deceased uncle that garnered all sorts of praise when my mom posted it to Facebook. It made her cry. Started working on more writing projects.

Went out on a several dates including a lawyer and a professional jazz musician. One grew some legs into additional dates and the jazz musician after one date kept up communication for a month making it clear the only deal breaker was my lack of driver's license (which of course I already knew).

Convinced myself this weird thing from earlier in the year which troubled me greatly actually improved my confidence and self-esteem making all the above possible. Now not so sure.

Made a new hiking friend.

Convinced my friend who has a vintage clothing company to hire me as a model (never came to fruition, couldn't get my fingers moving to answer his text trying to set it up last week and I am ten pounds over what I told him last month).

Said good morning to everyone from my front door all the way to the top of the mountain and back and convinced myself, along with all the other displays of outgoing personality I can never conjure up, that I was engaging in cognitive behavioral therapy and finally rebuilding my personality from the ground up.

Cleaned my room.

Completely fearless.

Also family drama I have been trying to avoid close contact with for 8+ years I finally jumped in the middle and started swinging. That might have not been good.

So perhaps the daily smoking for a few months reset my system for a few weeks? Or maybe I really am bi-polar? That's what I wasn't trying to diagnose, I wanted to find out how to get the feeling back, without smoking myself into oblivion for a few months straight first.

And on to the crash.

Was it the continuing ricocheting effects of my participation in the family drama that started to wear me down? Frustration with the lack of traction with all the women I am meeting (though I have no idea what I want out of this)?

My knees started to hurt derailing the daily early morning hikes. And it started to get cold so I also attributed internal personal changes to that. Don't want to hike in anything but shorts and T shirt anyway.

So that completely blew a difficult but fulfilling routine I made for myself. Not really interested in the exercise bike or resistance bands anymore.

And I do have memories of these manic phases before, few and far between over the years but few accomplishments can be tied to them.

Except for the major life shift that happened in 2014. It was more a moment of chance than anything but stumbling across a verifiable hey I can make money off this without moving much more than my fingers that led me to seek out a few similar opportunities and within 18 months allowed me to quit my McJob (hey I really was making less than 20k a year up til 2013, was never lying about that) and why even now I am not worried about work. I made 6 figures 3 years in a row.

At the time I attributed it to experimenting with a Piracetam/Oxiracetam/Noopept combo, both a certain device that stimulates physical pleasure (think massager) and getting more action leading to better mental well being where I can think of things more clearly. Now I am not so sure?

I mean it's obvious I have abilities and potential here and it shouldn't take freak mental events to unleash them.

So, am I bi-polar or not? And regardless of what the answer is, how do I get that feeling back?"
305,"Hello all,
Many of you have been following the plight of me and my wife, and I have gotten so much support and great feedback. Thank you for all of that.

After 5 weeks of hospitalization for her mania and nearly 2 weeks of taking Olanzapine (after constantly refusing her old meds), she seems a bit calmer but still overall manic. However, it seems like she has really changed... permanently. I know it is hard to say this while she is still coming down from mania but she is SO CONVINCED that she is a new person... that I kind of believe her. She is a more aggressive person, someone that I'm worried that I don't get along with anymore. She said that she experienced a lot of trauma at the hospital and did weeks of self reflection and became reborn into a new changed person. Said she ""finally figured her past issues out for good"" and it made her change into someone ""stronger"". It is really convincing. I'm starting to believe this change is permanent. Does that make sense? I mean people can permanently change after some trauma. I've been told that Olanzapine is good for treating acute mania and it has been nearly 2 weeks now and she still has this aggressive new personality. I know she is still manic and she acknowledges she still feels it a bit, but says her new personality overall is here to stay.

Had anyone feel their overall personality permanently changed after a severe manic episode? Am I being paranoid and need to give the Olanzapine more time? Or maybe Olanzapine isn't as effective on her (she refuses to take her old meds). Granted I've never been with her through a manic episode but even her sister (who has been through a few) feels that this time ""it feels different""..."
306,"Dear all, 

About a year and a half ago I first started experiencing problems with my mental health. I went undiagnosed an untreated for about a year and during that time I've been though hell. I rapid-cycled through 6 mood episodes and was twice on the verge of psychosis. Needless to say, my mental health wreaked havoc on my life which culminated in me dropping out of university. Since then my personal and professional life has ground to a complete halt. I couldn't hold down a job, I couldn't study sometimes I couldn't even face seeing my friends. 

Since getting help, my mental state has massively improved. I have been stable for the better part of 5 months now and I know that the only way is up. However, this improvement has not been reflected in any meaningful impact on my life. I'm still unemployed, I struggle with motivation and ability to keep up with the ordinary demands of life. I feel like my mental health problems have got me stuck in a swamp and although I do not feel like I am drowning anymore, I still feel unable to pull my way out of the swamp. 

I have tried to set myself goals and adhered to them with various degrees of success. I am currently trying to re-apply to uni and have been sticking to a regular routine of exercise and sleep. But most of the time, I still feel as though I am not doing enough and just grasping at straws. Meanwhile, most of my friends have either graduated and have jobs or will graduate in a years time. I'm just left behind. The only thing I really smile about is thinking about better times in my past, before all this happened. I cannot envisage a better future for myself or that I will ever be able to get back to the place I used to be in my life. 

Sorry for ranting, but if anyone has any advice on how to get out of a rut and how to truly get back your life post-mental illness would be much appreciated. 

regards, 
-H"
307,Hey guys I'm new to this forum well any forum discussing my mental health im bipolar 1 looking to connect and gain peer support im a 28 year old man and have been diagnosed for 4 years but suffering from the illness since I can remember anyone who is well enough to have a chat with me would be much appreciated thanks
308,"If I'm too happy something is wrong with me. If I'm upset about something I need someone with me because I will overreact and I will get mean. If I talk too fast I'm going manic. If I'm quiet something is wrong and I might be plotting some evil plan. Regardless of any of these scenarios it all comes down to has she taken her meds???

I always thought of myself as a nice enough person. Its not like I run around and kick puppies or when I see little old people with walkers I tip them over anything but my family has informed me I am a mean person. I hold doors for people, always use my manners, let people go in front of me in line if they have fewer items. I have been in really hard times so I love being a believer in pay it forward and I don't stop doing it. I help people if they are struggling in public with stairs, walkers, canes or crossing the road those sorts of things. A nice enough person so when my husband told me I was mean I was shocked so I phoned my daughter and asked her if I was a mean person and she said yes. I was soo shocked I died a little inside. Has she taken her meds?

My daughter explained how I'm very distant, hard to reach. I have a wall/hard shell that I don't let people into my actual me. The only emotion I am good at expressing is ager/rage. The worst thing is to be on the receiving end of my rage. My family really goes into panic mode if I get upset. I have been told I am scary when I am mad from a complete stranger. Has she taken her meds.

I really don't like people. I mean I really don't like people. It is soo hard to people everyday when somedays I do feel like the mean monster my family says I am. I know I can be mean don't get me wrong I just didn't think it would be answered yes so easily or followed with a yes but....only when someone attacks your family or if someone is doing something to hurt someone else. Having to be around people I have to pretend to be interested in things. I don't care about anybody else's life. I am at this job simply to make money not friends. Has she taken her meds?

I wish no bad on anyone but I laugh when stuff happens to people that buggered me over. I simply wish not to people. My experience it doesn't matter how long the friendship or if you are family the time will come you need them but nobody's around. I think I'm in a pretty good mood, haven't had any upsetting things at work and if I did I handled it fine. If I talk about it when I come home I get more animated and excited depending on the situation. That's when my family starts talking mania. Has she taken her meds?

I'm an animated person. I've always been an animated, expressive person. When I was young they just called it hyper active when I was in high school the meds started off and on, many different dr.'s, drugs, diagnosis. My dr saved my life from where I was 10 years ago. Sometimes I feel I could be off some of the meds I'm on because I am on quiet a cocktail everyday but my dr won't take me off some because I smoke pot. This blows my mind. I can get just as calm from smoking a little bit of pot as compared to taking risperidone. I prefer the side effects of pot than risperidone but the family likes the prescription drugs because they make me a zombie, where the pot actually makes me happy. Has she taken her meds?

I've been hospitalized so I know what it's like to have not control of being able to go outside. I've never gone off my meds because I know what life was like before and I am terrified of what I would do. When I got out of the hospital and when I first go diagnosed to deal with it ""crazy"" jokes were made. Well they are really starting to bug me and I have said things. So now the only time I make a ""crazy"" joke is when it is meant in a ""crazy, I will get you"" voice. Then it's fun for me because they have to think twice and I get to think the devious thoughts I'm not supposed to think or talk about, haha haha. Has she taken her meds?

What ever you do do not touch me! I've always had a thing with personal space. This is my bubble and this is yours, if you are within punching distance of a person you are too close. I like to live life ... I don't want to be kicked in the knee so I don't kick people in the knee... Some days I just can't handle the thought of someone touching me nevermind anything intimate with my husband. He is so patient but I know I fail him. Has she taken her meds?

Every morning,
Good morning babe,

Did you take your meds"
309,"Hello Everybody!!

I'm brand new to this site, seems like a great community of people helping people.

I'm here to help but also seeing guidance for my own personal situation. I met a woman online and she has Bipolar l and I have depression and anxiety. We talked for a few months and everything was going very well and we began dating, shortly after we had started dating, about a month, she broke things off. All she stated was that she didn't feel ready to be in a relationship and also saying "" this is just what I do, I don't want to hurt you"". Up until this point I was her ""Mr. Right"". I did notice that as things went along she started saying things like "" you're good and I'm bad"" told her mother "" he's to good for me"" "" I don't feel I deserve this"" meaning a good relationship. I know she also told her mother that it's not me, that she's just shutting down. 

She has a past filled with physical abuse, guys that took advantage of her, rape, molestation, alcoholic father.

I've been doing as much research as possible to understand bipolar and what she goes through with it. 

Am I experiencing a switch from manic to depression? I do understand overwhelm is part of it.

Of course I want us to be together again, but more importantly, I just want to help her, but it's hard when she has slammed the door shut and it seems I just trigger her into anxiety. I'm doing some things to gently let her know that I'm still here for her and I won't abandon her.

Any advise of  how I can help her through this?"
310,"So, I am definitely having mixed episodes and am ultra-rapid cycling here lately. Today i woke up at 6am after going to sleep at 11:30pm... I got up and went for a 4.5 mile walk at 7am this morning. Never done that before, but alas, there is a first for everything. While I have the increased energy and am moving, doing things & talking much faster than usual, my thoughts are also racing and I am more anxious.... frustrating to have these mixed emotions and feelings! Depression isn't realllly present, but I do have some of those less-than-helpful feelings that come with depression. 

Just had to share and get this off my chest."
311,"Hi. I had a manic episode landing me in hospital about a year ago. Followed was another six weeks of being rather high, and on sick leave.  Back to full time work after that, and put on Abilify instead or risperidone - which made me feeling very low, and numb. Depressed, low, tired, numb for six months, i dragged myself to work every day (in office or home) and really struggled. But I did it. I started feeling better in June/July and my psychiatrist agreed that I could stop taking Abilify.  Fast forward two months, everything has been great, work is fun again and more busy, and I enjoy seeing my friends, hanging with husband and sleep a more regular amount of hours, 6-7-8 per night instead of 10-11!!  But past 10 days I’ve been too happy and too busy at work. Efficient and enjoying it, but can’t sleep enough.  I fall asleep fine but wake up early (4 am) and just want to get up and get going with my day.  After 10 days of this I’ve consulted psychologist and psychiatrist and agreed to take a short term cure of Seroquel at night in a low dose.  Wish me luck!! I really don’t want to have another manic episode. My goal is to manage my condition long term without medication. My doctors are onboard and think I might be able to but right now a little worried of relapse. Anyone else out there managing their Bipolar 1 without meds?"
312,"I have to go back to US one day, and this might become awful. No matter how hard I work, I'll never afford healthcare. Now, I love Obama for working his butt off to have affordable healthcare, but Trump ruined it! And there is no guarantee for US to commence such a thing. This means I can't leave Korea. I have to stay here until US pulls itself together, but I doubt it.

US doing far worse in terms of working conditions. They work longer than Japanese, which are known for dying from overwork.

All over the world, the wealthy is getting wealthier, driving the rest of us into deeper poverty. And there ain't no change. At least in South Korea, I can pay for my healthcare.

Speaking of South Korea, I can't bear the enormous pressure to be competitive. Unemployment is brutally high, and I have to double up and work so hard that my stress level gets into maximum capacity. And if I want to afford healthcare in US, or not financially struggle, I have to do the same crap. Being ultra-competitive, high-stress... in America? I can't believe it, but I have to work my ass off like a Korean to survive; American system is a mess.

Man, I don't think I can handle this stress. I suffer from severe bipolar disorder and I have to do this? That will easily lead me to mental breakdown! I throw things and have tantrums. Sometimes, I might fight other people!

Before coming to this forum, I posted a similar post on Reddit. They said just own up to it. Suck it up and push through the pain. And risk passing out and dying. Because I have no other choice. I need to survive. But taking a risk including harming others is no excuse.

Nevertheless, I have to do this to survive. I ain't got any choice left... And this depresses me..."

314,"Hey 
So at first I thought I was hypomanic and rhat it was just leading to mania. Or rather my girlfriend did she noticed the change in me first, I spent ages telling her I'm fine. And honestly I could be anyway. Maybe she's just worrying over nothing. Probably 
Eh, anyway 
Now everything is the same except my mood. I have the restless energy, no sleep, projects, spending sprees on fucking yarn and crochet hooks, presents and presents and presents. I have all that and more. Ooh, I want to make a flip book, I started cutting the paper last night. An alien one I think I'll do
Eh 

But yeah my mood? Jumping between a mixed episode-like thing, and euphoria. Is it normal to cycle between them both? It was just euphoric for almost a week, and now its between the two. Back and forth. Like a yo-yo. Which are so hard to do, I tried the walking the dog one for ages and never got the hang of it 
Like I was fine, one top of the world all day. And within the last hours I've been this angry, frustrated disaster who punched something to release some energy and then started bawling my eyes out. 
I feel like I'm going crazy 

I don't know. Maybe I'm not even manic at all and I'm just being weird 🤷‍♀️"
315,"The doctors after eight years of this are still not sure of my diagnoses. They seem to have ruled out schizophrenia despite that being one of my previous diagnoses.

They however are conflicted between major depresion, and bipolar. They are leaning bipolar, and addressed my skepticism of the diagnoses the following way. They told me not everyone experiences mania the same way. When I told them I had never experienced the feeling of intense euphoria and invincibility I associated with mania that others can express it differently.

Namely in the form of irritability and anger, and I am forced to admit at times I can swing from intense anger to very deep depresion. Confronted with this I am forced to admit I may be bipolar experiencing a type of atypical mania.

The reason they are not sure of this diagnoses is because I have consumed large quantities of alchohol over the years, and alchohol can mimic the effects of bipolar.

So they put me on a medication regimen effective against major depresion and bipolar."
316,"I have never experienced joy or euphoria before, and right now the past couple of days I have experienced it frequently despite still battling low points and suicidal ideation.

I spend a lot of time looking for work and schooling. The plan is to go back to workl part time, and then go get a degree that will help me in the path I have chosen to pursue while working part time at an entry level position.

I have connected with a lot of friends in a very short amount of time. I am on a relatively low does of medications compared to the past, but my sleep has corrected itself nicely, and I no longer get nearly as irritable and angry as I used to most of my life. This anger and irritibiliaty is a large part why the doctors lean towards a bipolar diagnoses while not ruling out major depresion one of my previous diagnoses.

Maybe its just because I have friends again, and it seems like I will be imminently getting my own place with a friend of mine moving out of my mothers house for the first time in seven years. Further my jobs counselor thinks I have a real good chance at landing a decent job, and going back to school.

So all in all my life is pretty good right now, and unlike in the past I do not have this crippling fear the psychoses will come back. I am still cautious that it might, but I am growing more confident I will never have another psychotic episode ever again.

The doctors did not seem to think I was manic, and niether did any of my friends when I asked them. Still this happiness while it does not last all day is very new to me. I have not felt this much happiness in over seven years.

Its probably just the joy of having friends again, and the imminent prospect of regaining my independence something I have craved to recapture since my first psychotic episode.

Forgive me"
317,"After a lot of talks and discussions with my therapist I’m finally on medication again.

I started again after 4 months. And the side effects were horrible. I hope it’s worth it"
318,"Hey everyone, good morning~

 I've been on several different antidepressants but the possibility  of cyclothimia or bipolar 2 hadn't been raised before (maybe because I didn't report my very high highs, as I thought it was weird but since it's ""good"" feelings it can't be bad). I've had no luck with my first try, Oxcarbazepine, and I've been hypomanic for the past days I'm wondering how it feels when the medication works (regarding manic/hypomanic episodes, because I have a feel for what attenuating depression feels like). I'm feeling great, excellent, but this much energy makes me feel sick in my stomach and it's hard to do daily stuff. :woohoo:"

320,"Trying to find out info. On bipolar and depression. And found this forum. Wife has it and she is pretty good with meds and how she acts. But she still goes up and down. Her Dr. Recommended couples therapy and we went and that just opened up a can of worms.  The Dr. Wanted me to be honest and that I had a hard time dealing with the wife. She can't handle the truth. I thought we where going down the divorce road.  We stop going and things are back to normal now. We have 3 kids and she is great with them. We just go through life. I'm always on my toes and checking everything I say not to upset her.
If I say anything about her meds. She get upset and says why can't I have fealing   it's not the meds.
A month ago she got her meds. And she said the pill had changed. I believed it was a different brand same dose. I was on my toes for about  two weeks and she went back to Normal.

Just getting it off my chest"
321,"Hello everyone,

I am new here. I recently spent 2 weeks in mental hospital and was diagnosed with bipolar 1. My mania had progressed into psychosis so that's why I ended up in hospital. Since getting home I have hit the depression, or rather it has hit me - hard.

I relate strongly to a recent thread about feeling frustrated by lack of progress in life.

I have so much support. I have moved to be closer to in-laws and they are helping look after my toddler. There is no pressure on me to go back to work until I am better. But there is nothing for me to do. I am so bored at home. I keep going back to bed even though it's bad for me, just to pass the hours.

Reminds me of that book/movie, The Hours. What do you do with the hours when trying to traverse mental illness?

has anyone else had to deal with this problem?"
322,Was wondering what meds people take. Trying to find a good combo that makes me feel decent
323,"so I’m trying to figure out the pa to I want to go down with my career, and I keep going back and forth on ideas. But I’m scared of my last coming to haunt me in the process. I have done things I am ashamed of and know I wouldn’t purse at this time or in the future. Even though I have moved past my experiences, I am scared of making it big as a doctor or lawyer and having these experiences rise back up and destroy me and my career. Any thoughts on how to conquer my thoughts and fears?"
324,"My son is 23. I wish I would have found him help at a young age. He says from the time he was 8 he wanted to die. He's mad at me for bringing him into the world, instead of aborting him. This is the most painful thing for a mother to hear. He's cynical about everything in his life. He's dominating of my home and time. Completely narcissistic and spewing anger and resentment. He lived solely with me and at 11 he went to live with his father. Who I did not know was a drunk and physically abused him. He moved back in with me at 18 and stayed until I kicked him out at 21. I have younger children and he was taking over every room and his younger brother of two yrs hates him. So it was stress to have him live her. He's bitter and hurt I don't want him living with me. But he's 23 and he's inconsiderate, does drugs, and drinks nonstop. I have a 17 and 11 yr old that need a stable, livable home. He's homeless and sleeping on my couch again. He's bitter that I kicked him out and angry I don't want him living here. Last night he told me he doesn't want to live anymore. He's always talking about how great death is. I am actually to the point of frustration. Because it's how he sees life and his life. I feel at my wit's end. I don't think I have the energy for him anymore which sounds awful. He yells and starts fights with me and I'm trying to not have stress. I'm having physical problems now, due to too much stress for so long. I told him he needs counseling. He only wants to wallow in pain, and tell at everyone about it. Maybe there are support lines for mother's to know how to handle kids with suicidal thoughts. I just don't know how to handle him or what even to say anymore, nothing works."

328,"Good evening to you all, 

I am new to the forums and have been seeking to find out some answers in regards to my wife's mental state. I would like to start off by giving a minor back story while most certainly trying to keep is short. My wife and I have been married for almost 9 years (December 9 year anniversary). 

My story starts a few weeks back when I noticed my wife had been mentally becoming flat and her facial features seemed to change? Her face seemed to become just ""dark looking"", cant really think of any other way to describe it. Someone married to someone that long can just tell when something seems off. Anyways as time progressed I started noticing my wife being very secretive of her phone, ultimately I grabbed it one day and found on google searches on satanism, and how its practiced, the history of it etc. When I found it I was a little shook at first considering we have always been a Christian family, regardless I didn't care, because at this moment I knew something was just really off. She explained that she was no longer wanting to be apart of the Christian faith, and had always felt brainwashed by her family members, I supported her through this and just tried to understand and support her on this journey, ultimately she began to practice Wicca and began to really get into the religion, practicing cast and spells, etc. Again I just stood by her side a supported her. 

As time progressed, one Saturday she was very distant, very quiet, not talkative and you could really tell something was going on. I tried every way to get her to speak to me and all I got was nothing is wrong. I left the house to grab some things and the wife was making dinner. As I got back to the house, the wife was gone, I called her phone, she ignored the call, I called again and no answer, I checked tracking on our iphones, and she turned location services off. Wife then called me crying, stating that she didnt have any idea where she was, she broke down on the phone and told me that she is tired of being sick, she will never feel better, nothing we ever do will fix the way she feels, etc. I consoled the wife as best i knew and helped her figure out where she was and whos car it was and reminded to use gps to plug in our home address to get back home. Wife came back home, we went for a drive and as we are driving she is telling me that she cannot shake the racing thoughts and she takes a lorazapam (0.5mg) to take the edge off. We drive around a little more and finally go home and head to bed. 

Next day, same thing, acting way off very flat, distant, quiet and just not the same person. Afternoon comes around and wife decides to take a bath, I give her, her time, and after two hours I walk in and ask if she was ok, immediately this upset her, she puts down her phone closes out the candles, essentially ending her bath, she gets out, and wife is extremely upset, stated i am controlling, i can never give her space, peace she has so much going on she states and says she needs to figure out the divorce. THE DIVORCE! i was thinking, yes the divorce she said, long story short she stated she is done and I should have paid attention to the numerous times shes asked me to change. ( I am in no way blaming this part of our marriage on her, or meds or anything like that, I was asked to change, became complacent in our marriage and now she is completely done.) 

Next day, I am unfortunately still shocked, begging pleading, crying the usual anyone does when it feels like someone has died. Im doing better now but at first the initial shock is just very upsetting. Wife tells me the she doesn't mean to be rude but how i feel now is how she has felt the past 8 years. The wife and continue to talk during the week, shes still staying in the house and we are still sleeping in the same bed. During this week i am pleading for her to stay and we can just do a break, separate, etc. Wife says she'll stay for now, but the weekend coming up, she was going to go out of town (3hr drive away way bigger city) because she needs space and to get away. And wants to be alone. I forgot to mention during the middle of the week, we had emergency appointment with wifes psychiatrist after I contacted the psychiatrist and explained what all has been going on - psychiatrist reevaluated my wife, wife explains that she has been having hallucinations, hearing voices and things not right, psychiatrist states that it sounds like she might be going through a little bit of psychosis. NP (psychiatrist) prescribes 0.5 risperadone. 

That weekend comes, wife goes out of town, by herself, allows me to track her, turned her tracking on and we share the same bank account so I saw all purchases - sunday night came and I was able to speak with the wife about something shady that happened and she admitted to cheating on me with a female. I asked her about incident, and she stated it was horrible... 

My question to everyone on the forum is, has anyone ever seen anything like this? My wife has done a complete and total 180 degree turn and has turned into something i almost don't physically recognize. She has changed religion, became protective of her phone, taking off, turning off location services, having sexual encounters, drinking every night, asking for a divorce, and I took a sneak peak at an intake survey she completed for a psychiatrist she is about to see and the intake packet is horrible, pretty much states that she is hurting has suicidal thoughts, never feels good enough etc. A lot of issues. 

Is this divorce and sexual encounters and change of religion all real? or could this be something with her mental health? 

***PLEASE ANYONE HELP ME UNDERSTAND*** 

P.S.

Backstory on wife she has been diagnosed with....

Bipolar 2 
Severe Depression
Severe Anxiety
PTSD 

her medications currently....

Viibryd 40mg
Lamictal 250mg
Lithium 300mg

Could this be too many meds, could something be making all this happen? 

any help i great appreciate it"
329,"My wife typically goes into a depressive episode shortly after her manic episode subsides. Is that typical for most people? Just curious how common it is for people with bipolar 1 to come down from a severe manic episode without going into a depression.

Thanks"
330,"So, I have now been on 25mg of Lamotrigine for two weeks. I bump up to 50mg tomorrow and I'm kind of excited.

I have actually been doing somewhat better since starting the medication two weeks ago and I think my body is adjusting finally. My episodes have been milder and don't last as long. This week I have been rather balanced, with little mood swings here and there but they do not linger.

I was manic/hypomanic the past two weeks and hit a brief depressive ""swing"" this weekend (however it was my late best friends birthday).

My roommate/best friend even made the comment that things have been going better between us. Things had been kind of bad for a while until I finally got help. I've been using the eMoods app and tracking things more closely and have given up alcohol, which I think has helped."
331,"My bipolar was early onset, I was diagnosed at 7 years old, and then 11, and then again at 16 and 23 by different doctors. After finally accepting my diagnoses for myself, I have started researching Bipolar 1 disorder, and honestly its kind of scary? I came to the realization that ALOT of my childhood was mania and VERY vivid dreaming. for some periods of time I could not tell fantasy from reality, i would live in my own little world. I now have a pretty bad identity crisis, I am unsure what was real and hat was psychosis, dreams, or delusions. I feel like I have lost half of my life....is this strange at all? 

I have also recently been informed that early onset bipolar typically leads to a duel diagnoses with BPD, which also scares me, I fit it almost to a tee, I almost feel like I got the short end of the stick on mental health to be honest. like I am slipping into a hole as a realize how MUCH of my life this has truly effected."

333,"Someone I know who has PSTD was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

He keeps having delusions and false memories that people have drugged him up on truth serum and date rape drugs and put him in front of famous people so that he would tell them his deepest and darkest secrets and act completely disorderly. Which I can see would hypothetically be an absolutely horrible experience to go through. He believes these people did this on purpose to cripple his chances of becoming famous himself. He believes these same people are trying to steal from him.

Can someone tell me why this is happening to him? and what can I do to help him fix this once and for all?"
334,"And I was doing so well. 

I don't know whats wrong with me. I'm not depressed, I'm not manic. I just feel strange. I can't think straight, I can't talk properly, I feel agitated. I don't know how to describe it, but the last time I felt this way my psychosis happened."
335,"Hello everybody,

I am a 41 year old female from the Netherlands. I am new to this forum and hope you guys can help me with a question about bipolar disorder. Sorry in advance if my English isn't very good.
I was diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder 18 months ago.
I am also diagnosed with Avoidant personality disorder with dependant and borderline traits.
My problems started about 16 years ago with what was then diagnosed as social anxiety and depression. Since then I've been depressed off and on, mostly not too severely.
12 years ago I had a psychotic break during a holliday in Egypt, following five nights of complete insomnia. I was admitted to the psychiatric hospital in Cairo and recovered quickly. My psychiatrist and psychologist (in the Netherlands) thought this so-called micro-psychosis was caused by extreme stress and my personality disorder (the BPD part in particular). Six months later I had another micro-psychotic episode due to stress and insomnia, which was followed by what I later recognized as a (hypo)manic episode of about two weeks.
During the first psychosis I was on mirtazapine (anti-depressant), during the second I had just started taking fluoxetine (anti-depressant). I stopped the anti-depressants and started taking Seroquel (100 mg). 
Still, my psychiatrist did not diagnose bipolar disorder because they thought it was caused by my personality disorder - it was, according to them, just how I responded to stress.
After that followed years of low grade depression, diagnosed as dysthymia (persistant depressive disorder) and a lot of different therapies for my personality disorder. 
Through the years the Seroquel was increased to 200 mg and later to 300 mg because of episodes of stress, that caused severe insomnia and some weird dissociative symptoms that I also had prior to the two micro-psychotic episodes. 

A little over 18 months ago I tried to taper off the Seroquel, which resulted in insomnia and severe depression. The Seroquel was eventually increased back to 300 mg, but that didn't help, so after a few months my (new) psychiatrist and I decided to start with Lithium. By then she had diagnosed me with bipolar disorder after hearing my story.

So now, after this long introduction I want to ask you a question. Do you think I have bipolar disorder, or were my psychotic episodes and hypomanic episode purely due to stress, the use of antidepressants and my personality disorder?
My psychiatrist said: When someone responds to antidepressants with (hypo)mania and even psychosis, that is indicative that they have bipolar disorder. Is that true?
Because I haven't had a (hypo)manic episode in 13 years and because I've merely been depressed (dysthymic, sometimes with short episodes of more severe depression), I wonder if I really have bipolar disorder. I read on this forum and on the internet that people with BD never really go without episodes, even when on medication.
The weird thing though about my depression is that I usually sleep too much, bun when I am more severely depressed, I tend to get insomnia and some agitation (a feeling of restlessness that is very uncomfortable). That is the only thing that may point a little towards some slight (dysphoric) hypomania - I read that hypomania can also be quite negative. I never in those 13 years experienced more energy or the lack of need for sleep, I always desperately wanted to sleep but couldn't.

Sorry this is such a long post. I really hope someone can answer my question. To find out if I have bipolar disorder I want to taper off Seroquel and when (if...) I have successfully done that, maybe even try to stop taking lithium as well, to see what I am like without my medication. I have been taking Seroquel for so long now that I can't even imagine what I would be like without it.
Thanks for reading."
336,Well I been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and also depression and anxiety for about 6 years now. Me and my fiancee live with her mother and have been for 7 years now. We love one another alot but it's been trying. Ok so I have never held a job before because i just cant very around people or have certain stresses cause it triggers my symptoms. Well my fiancee gets so upset with me cause I have no job and no money because she said she wants a happy life and a home and be comfortable.

339,"Hi everyone,

As we're all aware I'm sure, the mind never really heals from the trauma induced by manic episodes that seem to take a piece of us away with them each time they rear their ugly head. I know for many, Mania is euphoric but for me it is reliably a combination of euphoria and disaster, akin to the world falling apart before one's feet. Then comes the nothingness of non existence, for a world worth living in has ceased to be.

Luckily, somehow I manage (pun intended for those Office fans out there) to maintain a pretty good job and have the luxury of being able to get away to a nice hotel and enjoy some 'me time'. We shall see how long that lasts as I fall into the abyss, clutching at sanity as if were my only lifeline. Alas, here is a poem with which I hope you all can relate, for we all know the seasons and we all know this outstanding condition:

""
A departing leaf of autumn is a mood forever fallen,
The white sky of winter is a face drained of colour,
For forever is calling and death is the only odour.

But before frostbite kills it is spring once again,
And a mood is uprising like cool, lifegiving rain.
Soon life is awry and summer nigh,
A mood has been growing and now is bursting to thrive.

Now summer is here and nothing can stop me,
Life is so full of colour and inevitability,
The sun is queen of the world and I king to thee,
Summer please won't you stay for eternity.

But autumn doth come so seasonally,
And a mood doth slump so predictably,
Such is the nature of Bipolarity,
A mood that doth swing so painfully.""


Take care and God bless,
Joe"
340,"My mother and other family members have suffered from bipolar. I'm scared I may have it too (definitely going to wait to see a doctor and mental health prof before I say I actually have it tho)

Imma just describe my experiences to see if anyone can relate.

Sometimes (maybe three or four times a week. It depends) I have this feeling of euphoria. Like I'm perfect mentally and physically. I get very hyper. I talk so much that I can tell people are annoyed with me because I'm usually not very talkative. I feel extremely agitated and snap at people without really noticing. I feel like I've too much built up energy. I have the urge to just straight up beat myself. 
It really looks to other people that I'm just VERY happy but there's like this unsettling feeling I get.. I cannot describe it then after an hour or so I feel like a switch has been flicked. I instantly feel terrible.

Today I felt like a god. I felt like no one could stop me from doing everything I wanted to do then suddenly I was drowning in tears in front of a whole store of people lmao. Usually, after that, I dissociate.

I'm naturally kinda paranoid even when depressed but it seems amplified when I'm like this. I feel like someone is out to get me/kill me but obviously, they can't get me because I'm too important (???). Nothing can happen to me... at least that's how I feel sometimes. Others I feel very anxious. It's quite scary. I was walking home a good couple of days ago now. I saw this man and he scared me(looking back he wasn't doing anything that scary lmao). I went home as quickly as I could, locked myself in my room, and stayed there for a while. I heard banging on the front door, someone opening it, and their footsteps coming up the stairs towards my room door. No one was there... I've had many hallucinations and delusions before but never really knew where they came from. I thought it was all just anxiety.

I've noticed that these episodes I guess have gotten more frequent over the past year or so. I'm exhausted from the ups and downs especially with me having body dysmorphia, arthritis, and horrible teeth problems on top of everything. I can't really seem to get a break.

Sorry for the long post. Probably not the most organized heh I hope everyone has a good day :peace:"
341,"Hello all,
Just an update for those who have been aware of my plight:
https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/does-tough-love-work-for-someone-who-is-manic.325285/
https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/need-help-regarding-how-to-respond-to-my-wifes-last-outburst.326083/

Quick summary, wife is in the throes of a manic episode. I was able to get her to a hospital and make her stay against her will. She has been fighting being held there and won her last appeal. She will be discharged today against the recommendations of the doctors who feel she needs another week to make sure she follows through on her treatment. 

We are currently in a separation. She is mad at me for: a) calling 911 on her to get her help b) advocating against her in regards to both leaving the hospital and also c) supporting the hospital's desire to take away consent for treatment. Her true mood fluctuates between wanting total separation/divorce and temporary separation and possible reconciliation. She feels she is not manic anymore so I fear she will abandon outpatient treatment plans. Any discussion regarding her mania immediately causes anger.

She is planning on staying at a hotel while she figures out longer term housing plans. I may move out and let her stay here.

In any case, I fear our relationship is over if her mania does not subside on its own. I get anxious even talking to her because she can quickly flip to anger. Sadly, I am actually simply not comfortable being with her anymore. I do think it is best we stay apart during this time. 

I'm thinking for my own good, I really take this separation seriously. She still wants to meet up, etc when she is in a good mood (but that can change on a dime). I'm thinking I should avoid her as much as possible because her mood swings worry me and I simply am not comfortable. I'm wondering if I am not being fair to my wife, who is still in a manic state and maybe needs some more support from me. But I've been trying so hard to convince her to get the help she needs at the hospital and she is really fed up with me and I am exhausted and drained dealing with her. 

Is it ok if i really treat this separation seriously and let my wife do her thing, and avoiding her if needed?"
342,"Yea, spelled it wrong probably. Lol nice to be coming off a med instead of going on one.

Reason is I was very very stable but I couldn’t concentrate. This has made it hard to complete tasks at work, or to do hobbies in my home time .

paying close attention to depression. So far nothing showing up. Plus I wasn’t in the same place I was years ago when I went on the meds. Much more stable now.

anyway happy to be having one less med in my life. Still on saphris each night to control the worst of the bp thing.

just wanted to share"
343,"I was feeling good earlier, kind of anxious and had energy that was more positive, but was triggered by stress. Now I am turning more agitated, delusional (thinking certain things are so when they are not), irritable, my HR is up and I feel like I want to cry all at the same time. I tried recording my mood in my journal, but I feel out of control right now and I hate it."
344,I get depressed when I can't fully live out my mania.
345,"my boyfriend has bipolar disorder and when he’s in an episode he completely shuts down and cuts off all communication with me. he says he just doesn’t know how to talk about his emotions and doesn’t want to be a burden. i’ve repeatedly told him he would never be a burden to me, but he still doesn’t believe me. he’s in an episode right now and completely moved all of his stuff out of our apartment and took his dog and left me. he blocked my number, blocked me on snapchat and facebook and won’t talk to me. i’m so close to giving up on him but i want to help him but i don’t know what to do. does anyone have any advice?"
346,"On Psych Central we had daily check-in threads were everyone would drop by each day and say how they were doing.  I really enjoyed it so i'd like to start one here.

I've had a quiet day, spent most of it lying around.  I took my dog out twice.  Still no sign of my usual Fall hypomania.  My mild depression still hanging on.  Worried about losing the Psych Central forum.  Did well in online Scrabble today and also at my city's club's weekly online meeting last night.  There's a construction project in my building and it was noisy at times today but better than last week.

Hugs to all who struggle!"
347,"In my prior thread, I talked about how I abandoned the ""tough love"" approach and opened up to my wife.
https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/does-tough-love-work-for-someone-who-is-manic.325285/

It was going pretty well for 3 days. Good, positive communication. Then we had a super major setback. She completely unloaded on me, saying I was a failure of a husband, we are totally not compatible, she wants a divorce as soon as possible, I abandoned her, how could I make her stay in a hospital?, we have no future, etc... It was brutal. Something must have happened that led her mind to a bad place. Last time she did this, I did the silent treatment to protect my sanity and because she told me to never talk to her again. After a long stretch of silence, she since apologized for her behavior and said I did the right thing (this was several days ago). We started communication again and it was going good. But then tonight during her verbal rampage, she held my silent treatment against me saying that it is proof I abandoned her and not fit to be a reliable husband.

I'm now torn what to do this time. Should I reason that she hit a very bad bump in the road right now and continue to reach out to her or pick up her calls despite her being currently hostile to me, so she doesn't accuse me of abandonment again? Or should I take another breather (silence) even though she may feel abandoned again?"
348,"For background info: I have adhd, generalized anxiety disorder,, and a social phobia/social anxiety disorder (the title depends on the doctor who wrote it lol) and bipolar 1.———-
I constantly feel like there’s someone with me watching me, and talking to/about me. I’ll imagine the conversations they have word for word, with specific voices and inflections. I know they’re not actually there, but I’ll still change my actions based on them. Like I won’t watch porn/masturbate (sorry lol but it’s relevant) because I feel ashamed like they’re watching me, and I would hear/imagine them making awful comments about me. Even down to looking at memes, I’ll skip certain ones that I feel like the person in my head would look down at me for looking at. Like a makeup meme if it’s a dude who’d think I was stupid for looking at makeup and liking it. It’s just a constant thing, sometimes it’ll last an hour and then the person will go away, sometimes it’ll be ten minutes, and sometimes it’ll be all day. ——-
As I’ve gotten older (and been put on seroquel lol) I’ts gotten easier to force myself to do the things I like and want to without an overwhelming feeling of shame and worry about what they might think. I used to not be able to take showers alone/ had to cover myself with a coat/blanket whenever I went to the bathroom, but now it’s not as present, and it’s not all the time. Plus the conversations aren’t always super in detail now, and usually I’m talking to the person and imagine our conversations, instead of having multiple people having conversations and I hear them. ———-
I don’t feel like it’s part of psychosis, because I know that the person is not real and I’m just imagining the thoughts, and because I don’t actually hear the voices or see the person. ———
I wondered if it was just extreme social anxiety, and Im anxious about what other people would think about what I’m doing so much that I start imagining it, but other people with social anxiety I’ve talked to dont do quite the same thing, it’s usually like thinking the person will judge them or whatever but not actually hearing it ya know.———-
Im sorry this is so long and so scattered, my brain is only able to stay on one topic for about three seconds right now, but hopefully this group will understand that lol. ——-
If anybody has had similar things or even just has some sort of input on this I would really appreciate it.——-
Obviously I’m talking to my doctor about it, and of course I’m not expecting anyone to be able to tell me 100% what it is, but I don’t really know many people I can talk to about this that struggle with bipolar, so hopefully I’ll gain some new insight through this. Thank y’all so much for reading all this lol"
349,"I'm only asking because at 54 my new boyfriend, who isn't really fazed by it, and my half real sister I found through an adoption site said she thinks I am, and that there is a family history of it.
My two closest friends have also said ups and downs are noticeable. I spend more money than I can when giddy, but take sleeping tablets and hide when low."
350,"Recently I have been spending money recklessly and using drugs a lot, I have also been shirking a lot of my responsibilities. Also I have been lying a lot. I have been feeling quite happy and confident however I don’t believe I have had a reduced need for sleep. Is this a hypomanic episode?
Thanks in advance for your support."
351,"I think I'm broken and can't be fixed. I'll always be trampled on by others. I'll always be a doormat that says, ""welcome, please wipe your feet on me before you enter"". They live in the fast lane, I live in the training wheels lane. And I can't seem to get off those training wheels."
352,Just wanted to listen to people's experiences on Risperidone. I'm thinking of moving from quitipine onto Risperidone see.
353,"First of all, I don't normally post to message boards. I am a very private person and tend to shy away from revealing my personal business. However, I have been struggling with numerous issues with my bipolar wife and I have no support base to speak with. So I am here hoping to learn more, gather advice, and maybe get some answers to her odd behavior. 

Let me give you a bit of a back story so you know my current situation. I am a 49 year old male and I met my wife in 2009 and we married in 2010. She seemed perfectly normal, happy, and a very loving woman. I had met the love of my life. We shared the same interests and are both like-minded in many other ways as well. We were very happy together, never fought and she used to tell me all the time that I was her ""perfect."" She had never been diagnosed with any mental illness in the past, but she had never sought treatment. A red flag that I missed was her family mentioning the cycles of trouble she would get into when she was younger. I just took that as a rebellious teenager or young adult. I didn't really pay much attention to the stories. 

I am in the military (about to retire) and in 2016 I was away for a military school for 4 weeks. During that time we spoke every day, and she began complaining that she couldn't sleep at night. When I got home, she wasn't there to greet me like she normally would be when I return from travel. I called and texted her, and she finally replied a few hours later. She never did come home, she stayed gone for a couple months and she refused to speak with me. I had no idea what was going on, so you could imagine my dismay and confusion. Then out of the clear blue she called me, and from the tone of her voice, she was clearly scared. She told me that she had travelled to Florida to meet a ""friend"" she had met online and he was trying to force her to have sex with him. I told her to run out of the house, get in her car, and drive away, which she complied. I stayed on the phone with her for 12 hours as she made the trip back to home. The next day I took her to the doctor who recommended a stay in a local hospital for evaluation. It was there during an inpatient stay that she was diagnosed with Bipolar I and Complex PTST (previous abusive husband). 

She was placed on medication and everything was back to normal until August 2019, where she suddenly started complaining about not being able to sleep. After her first episode, I had read and researched just about everything I could on Bipolar Disorder and realized that she was entering another manic phase. When I asked her to commit herself to the hospital again, she became angry and left. I found out later that she had became agitated at her psychiatrist earlier in the year for not showing up to her scheduled appointments, so she just stopped going. In return, her prescriptions had run out and she had not been taking her medication. I was oblivious to that, and I do blame myself for not paying better attention.

I did manage to finally convince her to see another psychiatrist, and I set everything up for her. She did start visiting the new psychiatrist and is back on meds. It took another 3 months for her mania to subside, and that was March 2020. It is now September 2020 and she still hasn't come home, even with her mania gone. Now she claims she doesn't know why she can't come home. She has been living with her mother, just a mile down the road. Even being so close, she only visits me about 1-2 times per week, and only for a short time before she gets antsy and has to go. She does usually call me every day, sometimes several times a day, but with intermittent periods where she breaks off communication for a day or two. 

I just don't understand this behavior and even though I have researched, I can't figure out what is going on with her. She claims she isn't depressed, but rather says her emotions are just all gone. From what I have read, this may have something to due with her meds and emotional blunting. But due to Covid, and the fact her Doctor just retired, she hasn't been able to see a doctor in 3 months to address this issue. She still has meds on hand but I have no idea if she is taking them since she doesn't live with me. 

Honestly, I am so exhausted with the emotional roller coaster. She will get close for a day or two, then pull back. This cycle has been going on weekly for months now. Pretty much the same thing each week, she will visit for a few minutes to an hour or two a couple days in a row, then she will stay away for several days (with a lot of excuses). I just don't know if I can take much more. I have looked into divorce, but I feel bad about that since I know that she is sick, and I wouldn't abandon her if it were cancer or some other illness. But then again, my mental health is taking a toll. I am now on anti-depressants and anti-anxiety meds and my overall health has taken a downturn. I just keep holding out hope that she will get better someday soon and the girl I married would come back to me. Right now I don't know who the hell she is anymore, she isn't the same person."
354,"Hello all,
Just joined the sit and wanted to introduce myself. I am married to my lovely wife. She is bipolar. But she manages it quite well with medication and therapy, Recently we had a string of bad luck. First, she had a very ugly dispute with her sister (who triggers her). Then she had to go to the hospital for an emergency surgery. While the surgery was successful, she found her stay at the hospital uncomfortable and triggering for numerous reasons, too many to explain. Basically she is becoming manic. This is the most manic I've seen her and I am scared. She got so emotional that she had a severe mental breakdown during her stay that forced the psych team to get involved. The one positive is that the psych team is doing an analysis. She has calmed down since and is still very manic, but under control so that she is advocating that she is not manic and doesn't need medication. For the first time since we met, she feel she doesn't need her meds anymore. I am praying that the psych team can somehow convince her to continue taking but I am very worried they will let her leave with a prescription that she will disregard. I've expressed my worries to them and they seemed understanding but I'm not sure if they will really take action. I've never been this anxious in my life. I know I just have to gut it out and be there for my wife. I just wanted to get this off my chest. Thanks for reading and and any comments are most welcome!"
355,"Hey everyone,
I thought I’d make post because I’m depressed and a bit upset about something that happens now I’m then because of my bipolar. I’m getting my doctorate in music but had to take a break because of my illness I’m doing a lot better because I have been able to reduce stress, plus the fact that my
meds have changed. I’ve also been working part time. Well the thing that has been causing me some depression is that sometimes at work there have been people who treat me as if I’m really dumb. And I think it’s because sometimes I’ve asked kind of dumb questions about how to do certain tasks, mostly, I think, because I am really insecure and anxious and so don’t have the confidence and clarity and boldness to figure things out on my own. But sometimes I think maybe there really is something that’s not right with me. That I’m really smart when it comes to music but just not very bright with more basic life skills.

Not sure if I explained that well or if anyone can relate. I’d love to hear back. Thanks again everyone for being such great human beings. This site is wonderful.

356,My wife and I have been married 24 years.  We have a 20 year old daughter who was diagnosed bipolar about 4 years ago.  Two years ago she dated this guy for like a month and eloped.  Son in law has a disorder that causes him to have seizures. About 5 months after they married they got pregnant so now we have a grandson.  So they have all lived with my wife and I for this 2 years.  Neither daughter or son in law work.  My wife has assumed the raising of the grandchild.  Grandchild sleeps in our room so that daughter and son in law can stay up till late hours watching Netflix and they don’t get out of bed till noon most days.  They do absolutely nothing around the house.  They cook late at night and leave their mess in the kitchen for us to cleanup.  The issue I am having is that I believe we should be expecting more from our daughter around the house and the raising of her child.  But if I say anything to my daughter she blows up big time starts texting my wife saying I was yelling at her which I was not.  My wife then starts angrily texting me about getting on to her.  Everything can be calm for a few months as long as I do not question my daughter and let her have her way.  But we had a recent blow up again.  My wife believes the relationship between me and my daughter is too toxic so she said maybe we need to divorce so that I am out of the house away from daughter.  My wife has stated she will do absolutely everything to keep my daughter happy since she is bipolar.  Oh yeah one more thing my wife said that my daughters therapist told her we should allow my daughter to sleep in and that we should give her money so she can go do fun things so she doesn’t get depressed.  Is this normal advice?  Is this really the way doctors want to handle bipolar?  I would think part of the goal of treatment would be to help that person gain some normalcy and hopefully some independence.  Maybe I just don’t understand enough about bipolar and what my daughter is going through.  Maybe I am supposed to let them run the house and the rest of us just need to fall in line.  Looks like either that or get divorced.
357,"Hi All,

My partner has Bipolar 1 and we have been together for about two years and she has been very stable over this period.  A couple of weeks ago, due to an increase in work and financial stress, and also Covid-19 lockdowns, she started having suicidal thoughts and even acted out on it.  I had a feeling something was wrong when she didn't answer my calls, so I drove to her place and took her to the hospital and she has since recovered and is now staying at her sisters place.

Since then she has been acting very strangely, it's as if we don't even know each other anymore.  When I text her or call her, she doesn't respond, until one day I told her I was worried sick about her and she finally decided to talk to me.  I asked her whether I've done something wrong?  She says ""no, nothing at all"", she just doesn't want to talk.  This came as a huge shock to me because we talked every day for two years straight.

Is this normal for someone going through a depressive phase?  If so, how long does it typically last for, and is there anything I can do to help improve her condition?  She did say I have been very supportive of her and I'm trying my hardest to do anything I can, but she's become so distant and passive I don't know what to do anymore.  

Please help me, any advice would be greatly appreciated thank you."

359,"My fiancee is from the US and I am from the UK. We met online when she was working in the UK 5 years ago. Since then we've suffered a myriad of visa issues that ultimately meant us maintaining our relationship long distance with occasional visits (maybe 3/4 weeks out of every six months). We did 2.5 years of this. We really managed it very well and eventually in January this year we got our visa to settle in the UK.

However, once she arrived here, covid happened. We couldn't marry, which meant she couldn't work and the lockdown meant she was stuck with absolutely nothing to do. Her mental health deteriorated over the months. I also work from home so we were in each others company 100% of the time. The NHS in the UK has been struggling to deal with the mental health crisis and was not much use to us. It did seem like our need to marry immediately was going to be pushed out 2 years due to visa circumstances. This all changed when our lawyer said you need to get married right now. Well, with 8 months of cabin fever, rapidly declining mental health and a staggering lack of purpose it was too much, she couldn't do it. She did the right thing and called it off, nobody should marry in a state like that. 

She decided she needed to go back to the US to be around family to get proper medicine, therapy and familial support. She left a few days ago because we called off the visa process there is no immediate path to get back together permanently. In fact, it's not even possible for us to visit each other again until travel bans are lifted. Her mother is bipolar and they've long suspected that my partner has Cyclothymia, along with the online therapist she was seeing here. She has however hidden elements of her feelings from her family to avoid this. With this crisis it has forced her to entirely open up about everything. 

On our emotionally charged last night together we talked endlessly and a whole bunch of stuff about her childhood came out that she never even told her therapist when she was young. It also came out that the same issues and emotions she was feeling were not new, and existed long before I was a part of her life. She even told me she made an attempt on her life when she was a teen. If this all turns out to be true did we ever really have a chance to succeed with untreated cyclothymia in between us?

In my sadness and desperation since she had left I had being saying things to her like ""I can handle anything that comes our way with this diagnosis! We'll find out way back together I'm sure"" and being overly positive about the future. Until last night when I did some serious reading on the subject and the magnitude of what is to be expected of me was revealed. I feel much more sober about the prospect of what is to come:

Firstly I am worried that her depressive state might make her just call the whole relationship off. If she were to do that, should I necessarily believe it? After all, it's still going to be untreated for sometime until meds/therapy do anything. I think the tough part is I'm learning that IF this is to work out I have to start reacting to my partner in a more logical way rather than an emotional one. But right now I am still in a very emotional state sitting in the house that we created together only 4 days separated. That is also going to be more difficult being long distance once again.

Any future I see for us now I believe must be based near her home and family in the US. I am happy to relocate but I also have to take extremely seriously the idea of moving to the other side of the world away from my own support network to be with someone who will inevitably make me face intense emotional challenges. 

It is my belief that we do have something special. We share similar outlooks on life, we influence each other in the right ways, we have respect for one another and I think most importantly, we make each other laugh even in the dark times. She has taught me to talk about my emotions and I have shown her how health & fitness can make a huge difference in our lives. I always tried to explain this throughout our hard times and she would be dismayed at why even though she totally agreed about all of that, she wasn't happy.

I have checked myself into therapy myself as I believe this time has held a mirror up to my own issues regarding cannabis abuse and anxiety. I don't want to pretend I am perfect in this situation. I also need the therapy to help me deal with the idea of spending my life with someone who has a mental illness or to have the strength to move on from her.

I'm glad I found this place and it feels to good to write all of this out. Love and respect to any of you suffering out there with these kinds of conditions, my heart is with you."
360,"This doesn’t necessarily pertain to bipolar disorder, but I don’t see a good place for it. I’m closest to II, and this seems like maybe a fairly active section. I don’t like forums for various reasons, but I really can’t find anything online that feels relevant.

I maybe felt love as a child, but I don’t remember that. I do know what love feels like, because I love my now dead cat. I’ve also felt some level of love towards my best friend when I’ve been drunk. Otherwise, I don’t feel it. Not my parents, not anyone. I lean aromatic/asexual which has led to me never being in a relationship with anyone, so no experience in that area.

I don’t have the symptoms of Emotional Deprivation Disorder, nor the causes. My mom loves me unconditionally, but I don’t consciously care about that very much. I’m glad to have it, even if I don’t feel anything about it. I don’t know about my dad. He’s done a lot for me. He’s also kind of shit.

I’ve talked about this with my therapists. Little has come of that. I yearn for intimacy a lot. As I mentioned earlier, I lean aromantic/asexual. I have interest in those things in theory, especially romance, but not in practice. Maybe connected. I’ve been on the big ace forum if you’re familiar with the territory. I don’t like it, so I’m not asking on there.

My feelings otherwise are relatively “healthy” outside the whole bipolar thing. At least I think so. My mom thought I lacked empathy as a kid, but I definitely don’t now. I think I just didn’t give a shit back then. I have a hard time making friends. I have 3 currently. I did move 10 times in 4 years, which hasn’t helped. 3 of those friendships and at least 1 previous one are or were very close. They’ve also been primarily distant. Like thousands of miles distant. They’re not online friends, though. I’ve been very introverted in the past, but I’m mixed now. I have a retail job, and I like interacting with people. I mainly prefer being alone. I‘m misanthropic a lot of the time, but I can find something positive in everyone.

If I could wish for anything, it would be for love and intimacy. I know a lot of other people can relate to that. However, I don’t necessarily relate to other people on the subject to a far enough extent that I get comfort from hearing about that. I don’t expect much to come from this, but I was crying about it earlier and wanted an outlet."
361,"Hi

I have not struggled with mental health for about 7 years now. Medication was reduced to lower doses and everything was great.

NOW BANG from nowhere I am struggling and I mean struggling. My thoughts are all over the place, have no energy, feeling of things crawling on me... 

I asked doctor to increase my mood stabilizer, change my anti depressants and up my sleeping pills. I seen a mental health specialist which wasnt much help. I dont know who to turn to... feel so alone..."
362,"Hi, I am new...

Figuring this out. Looking for support/ to connect with others around experiences of bipolar.

I was fired from a theatre group during a manic period two years ago. It was this that led me to get a bipolar diagnosis and I now have regular therapy.  The group's collective rejection of me during this time left me traumatised and a lot of challenges I have experiences are of a fear of rejection due to my mental health challenges.


This week my Grandma passed away, I ended up in A+E with a minor injury and I was triggered by two conversations- one with a friend who has grown distant since someone she was dating sexually assaulted me last year. She spoke with me about getting much closer with a new friend we both know and also going to visit someone who is a mutual friend with the person who assaulted me. 


The other conversation was with my partner who told me (with good intentions but bad timing) to find a way to 'let go' of all the trauma. 

This happened on Wednesday and it felt like something snapped. I can't stop crying and had to take yesterday and today off work. I have arranged to see my therapist this morning. 


Does anyone else experience the fear of rejection in this way? And being triggered by a collection of things?

Has anyone else been rejected from a seemingly 'kind' group of people when they were experiencing mania/ other mental health challenges?"
363,"i so struggle when he is going through depressive phase
is it wrong i find it easier when he is manic?
i just want to help and feel useless x"
364,"I'm 28, lifelong depression, anxiety and substance abuse issues.

Finally this year after a really bad episode I started to actually commit to getting real treatment. Since doing so, I've been diagnosed as having ""borderline personality traits"" and now very recently there's been discussion of bipolar 2. I'm currently in inpatient.

I've been on Effexor 150mg and Quetiapine XR 150mg (along with various sleeping aids and occasional quetiapine SR) for about 6 months and both of those (introduced separately) were super effective for my depression and anxiety, but now as of today the Effexor will be upped to 225mg and they are going to slowly start getting me onto Lamotrigine.

Lamotrigine is new for me so that's of course a little nerve wracking but most people on this forum describe the side effects are pretty mild which is encouraging. But I am hesitant about adjusting 2 different medications at the same time. Because if there is an improvement I wont know which one made the difference or if I do actually need both. Does anyone else get concerns about that? I just really dont want to end up taking more different meds than I need or an unnecessarily high dose of anything

I guess I just wanted to reach out in this moment of great change and see if anyone has either had experience with these particular meds or just has any similar fears re meds. Also, I just today checked into a new inpatient clinic after a really really bad experience at another one (my meds were being adjusted, I self harmed, went and told the nurses so I could make myself safe again, they told me that self-harming was grounds for immediate discharge, they put me out that same day with no discharge plan even though I told them I had no accommodation to go to) so Im feeling a lot of trepidation and having some trouble with trusting the clinic.

Something that I'm grateful for is that I can afford the insurance necessary to be in a private clinic and get medical treatment at all so I dont want to sound ungrateful Im just scared."
365,"I've joined this community hoping to find insight and connection with people who may have been through what I'm going through. Mental illness isn't new to me - I'm 33 on the 8th, and I've been struggling with undiagnosed mental and behavioral issues for a long time - but right now, it feels worse than it ever has.

After many years of ""no, I don't need therapy, I don't need medication, I can do this on my own"" and failing miserably, I attended behavioral therapy for two months. Then, my insurance denied the claim. After exerting myself through sheer will and battling against my ego to see a therapist, I was both devastated and relieved to know I couldn't go anymore. Now I don't know how I'll get myself to begin scouring for an in-network therapist or psychiatrist.

The thing is, even after seeing her for two months, I still hated myself for going to therapy. And I get it: your mental health is just as important as physical health, and if you have a disease or an ailment, you go to the doctor, etc., etc.. Except the tumor the doctor is removing isn't a reflection of you as a person. Going to therapy is, to me, a reflection of my weakness as an individual, an admission that I'm a failure that needs to pay people to hear me talk so I can feel better about myself. Prostitution for the mind. I know that everything I just said is wrong, and I'd never say that to another person seeking help. Why should I say it to myself? Even coming here to talk with people makes me feel shame. Ego?

I've never really wanted to talk about my issues. My ex-girlfriend pressured me a lot to open up to her. ""What's wrong? Tell me why you're upset"". No, I don't want to. This is how I feel right now, I'm not entirely sure why I feel this way, and talking about things doesn't make them change or go away, I just want to be alone. I explained to her that when I start to open up and talk about how I'm feeling, it just makes me feel worse in the end. I'll regret it, I'll hate the words that came out of me, I'll feel ashamed, and I won't want that person to see me again. You can say, ""it's okay, I love you, and I don't think any less of you"". And I'll think you're lying, or you just don't want to admit that you think I'm a pretty sad individual. I don't need or want your pity, so let's just drop the subject, and leave me alone until the way I feel changes. I react much the same way from therapy.

I go back and forth between this place where I don't care what people think, and caring only what people think. I go back and forth between understanding I'm an individual with his own history and his own path in life, and comparing myself to others to the point of an inferiority complex. I might get a little better with handling negative thoughts, for a little while, but I always slip back into the bad place. My thoughts are often racing, they cause me anxiety and keep me up at night. I often have this inner dialogue where optimism and positivity becomes this imaginary thing. I don't want to pretend that I'm a success, I want to actually be a success. I have this perfectionist attitude where I'll go above and beyond to achieve something, yet never feel satisfied. And then, I give up so I don't have to feel bad anymore, but, I feel bad for giving up, so I still lose. In ten years, I've lost weight, only to gain it back, only to lose it again, only to gain it back a dozen times. I have every shirt size from medium to 3XL in my wardrobe, a reflection of my inability to be satisfied or love myself.

If you took the time to read this, I am very thankful, and I look forward to being a part of this community. Please understand that it took tremendous energy and courage on my part to write these things. I've been suffering for a long time. I have mood swings that happen suddenly on a daily basis. I'll feel fine, then I'll be angry, then I'll have a crying fit in the middle of the day, and none of it ever makes sense. Some days I'm too fatigued to just do laundry, and some days I have boundless energy. I often find myself avoiding family for stretches of time. I love people in my life very dearly, yet, sometimes I just can't stand them in the slightest. There are times that my best friend of half of my life feels like a threat and I won't talk to him. I have anxiety all the time. I've been drinking heavily lately because I can't deal with the depression, the mood swings, or my twisted thoughts anymore, and I've gone so far as to plot out how I'll commit suicide to escape having to be me anymore.

My confidence has been dwindling over the past several years, and when my relationship of five years ended a year ago, I've been progressively worse. I feel like I'm not good enough, like I have nothing to offer, and that I'm simply not someone that can be loved. My family never seems to enjoy my presence, and I don't seem to enjoy theirs, I feel uncomfortable around them. I get along famously with most co-workers, but that's because the connection is shallow and it's just work. I do have long-distance friends that I talk to, and I live with family, but I'm still lonely. I think even when I was in a relationship, I was lonely. I never feel connected to other human beings. Not the way I think I should.

In the end, I'm not even sure who I am anymore. But I'm going to keep trying to come to terms with my condition, and seek the help that I both need and... deserve, maybe? I want to be a better person for myself, and for other people. I want to feel like I'm in control. I want to feel like I'm happy with life. I want to be happy with my achievements instead of feeling inadequate. I'd like all of this to happen before I'm dead, naturally or otherwise, and I have a bad feeling it won't.

Thanks for reading."
366,"I was diagnosed with bipolar type II about 18 months ago but had struggled with the illness for at least four years now. They were some of the hardest years of my young life and I really experienced the full brunt of the ups and downs of the disorder, almost taking me to the brink of death and leaving my mind permanently shattered and confused. After my diagnosis I was prescribed quetiapine (I think its called Seroquel in the US?) 100mg. I used to credit this anti-psychotic for saving my life. Soon after beginning my medication, despite some side effects and difficulties adjusting, I truly felt content. Not really happy, but also no longer psychotically depressed or insanely manic. I sometime describe it as being ""neither heaven nor hell"".

Obviously life gets in the way sometimes, and despite using my medication I would still feel the pressures of relationship issues, employment problems and the general stresses of reality. However, I dealt with them much better than I had in the past.

Over the past two weeks or so, however, my mind has been dragged back down into the dark murky waters of depression. I have no energy, don't want to do anything, have intense guilt over nothing, sleep too much, I'm drinking too much and so forth. I'm getting little enjoyment out of anything. Worst of all, for the first time since I started medication, my mind is almost constantly occupied with the thought of killing myself. Suicidal ideation (idealisation). Suicidal thoughts were my constant cheery comrade during the worst days of my depressive phases before medication, so I know what I'm dealing with and don't think I'm in any danger, but it's still so heartbreaking for me to feel this way. I tried to tell a friend today but I just couldn't. It's not that I feel that I've failed, it's more that I'm just downhearted because I realised that no matter what I do, how far I run, what medication I take, my bipolar will always be there ready to come back and make me miserable again. They call what I'm experiencing a relapse.

Sorry if this is a bit wordy. I've never posted to any mental health forums before and hardly even post anything publicly anyway. Funnily, this is probably the most I've opened up to anyone in a long time and its my own computer screen. 

If anyone has anything to say to this, please do, even if its unrelated.

367,"Hi, I suffer from bipolar disorder type 2 and am trying to manage my mood swings by microdosing elemental lithium by taking lithium orotate. Does any one out there have any experience in treating their manic depression doing this?"
368,"Dear all,

I suffer from Bipolar disorder and I have been prescribe 200mg of lamotrigine and 5mg of aripiprazole. For 2 months now I have been doing really well. The lamotrigine works perfectly and is at the correct dose, however it only controls my depression. The aripiprazole works great too but I feel the dose is too low. Recently, I have been feeling as though my mania is coming back. I have been sleeping less, have too much energy, been having racing thoughts etc. 

I was wondering whether it is possible for me to adjust my medication by contacting my GP directly. My next psychiatrist appointment is in 2 months time, which is of no help to me now and I really do not want to go to A&E. 
Does anyone have experience with this, and if so how is the best way of going about this. 

thanks in advance,

369,"Hi all, this is my first time on this site. I want fo share today something that is bothering me  a lot. So since I was 20 years old, I have been taken advantage of and manipulated by men, sexually, mentally, and physically. It still affects me to this day. What I want to share is how men have pressured me to send them explicit pictures, I couldn’t say no and defend myself. So for the past two weeks I keep having nightmares about me getting talked into posting pictures on sexual websites. It scares me terribly 😭 I’m scared if that ever happened I’d get arrested or something. I mean getting back to my past, I did agree to taking explicit pictures, but I was always back and forth on if I was ok and not ok with it. I was always told guys like my pictures and it makes me a model (I’ve always dream and talked about wanting to be a model). Anyways thought im terrified about getting in legal trouble for these mistakes. I’m scared of if my nightmare comes true, I’ll be arrested. My stomach is in knots just thinking about it. I haven’t really shared this much with anyone, especially my parents, they’ll never understand. I feel like I’m a whore, and dirty. I just need some reassurance."

372,"Dear all, 

I have been diagnosed with a double whammy of Bipolar disorder and ADHD (Predominantly Inattentive). The latter was diagnosed in 2016, whereas the former was diagnosed in 2020. 

In terms of my Bipolar, I have been doing well. I have been stable on Lamictal 200mg and Aripiprazole 5mg for over 6 months now; the last 2 of which have been totally symptom-free for me! But, I continue to struggle with my ADHD. Before my first mood episode, I was previously taking Concerta 27mg (Methylphenidate) daily, which helped control my ADHD symptoms very well. However, it would also give me severe social anxiety and irritability, for which reason I chose to withdraw from the med in mid-2018. 

I have recently seen a new psychiatrist, who reassessed me and diagnosed me with adult ADHD. He also prescribed me strattera (Atomoxetine). He explained to me that the medication takes 4-6 weeks to fully kick in, unlike stimulants. But I am concerned about side effects and whether or not it will be as effective as the Methylphenidate for treating my ADHD. 

If you are in a similar position to me, or have experience with Bipolar and ADHD, I would really appreciate it if you could share your experiences and any tips you may have on dealing with these conditions. 

thanks in advance,

373,"""Hypersexuality is extremely frequent or suddenly increased libido. It is currently controversial whether it should be included as a clinical diagnosis used by mental health professionals.  Clinicians have yet to reach a consensus over how best to describe hypersexuality as a primary condition. Psychological needs also complicate the biological explanation, which identifies the temporal/frontal lobe of the brain as the area for regulating libido.""


"" People with bipolar disorder may often display tremendous swings in sex drive depending on their mood. As defined in the DSM-IV-TR, hypersexuality can be a symptom of in bipolar disorder....  ""

The article goes on to say that ""... increasing hypersexuality has been theorized to sometimes compensate for declining self-esteem and cognitive function ""

So if it is the brain's way of compensating for declining cognitive function then is this not quite actually a positive aspect of a trait that is characteristic of some of those living with bi polar symptoms. 

I do not understand why they would be considering hypersexuality as a clinical disease if in fact it is protecting or repairing the brain in a compensating way and feeding self esteem needs."

375,"Hi, I'm new here. I wondered if anyone else suffers from irritability and anger in a prolonged hypomanic or mixed episode? I read once that 30 per cent of bipolar sufferers do. From my point of view, this is the worst symptom I have to deal with, as it affects others as well as myself and is impossible to mask. (I can mask depression and most other hypomanic symptoms.)

I would dearly love to get a handle on this symptom, but if I am hypomanic for more than a couple of weeks (as I have been lately), it always turns nasty and the elation turns into extreme irritability (or agitation as it's called clinically.)

I would like to hear from anyone else who struggles with this, particularly if you have found something to help. I use self-help techniques including meditation and yoga, but when episodic, they don't seem to help much. Thanks in advance for any insights you can give."
376,"Hey folks!

Just looking for some support and thoughts. I think this is day 3 of this feeling. I've got a fire burning inside and having sleep struggles, but I'm also feeling bummed and the most noticeable thing is the thoughts of self harm (intrusive thoughts, I guess?). I'm not acting on these thoughts, but they are so strong sometimes, I just curl up in a ball or sometimes I'll cry if I can. 
The fear of injuring myself is very strong, so I'm probably not in too much danger, but I still feel sick, ya know? I mean, like ...well, I just need a mental health day type thing.
Other thing though, I'm cycling (you know, lady stuff) and I know this can be a trigger for episodes and I nearly always get moody during these times, but i don't always have the intrusive self harm thoughts. I'm not really sure what I'm asking anymore... I just need to vent and get some love right now, I suppose. <3 :'("

Just think its all in my mind and need to be a stronger person, to control myself.

I've been told I need to come off citalopram and go onto lithium. I've read that lithium is really toxic and long term use can cause kidney damage. I dont really want to take lithium.

I'm curious, has anyone else had success in explaining their situation to someone who hasn't experienced mental illness? What was the conversation like?

383,"Mania and depression are two opposite mood extremes that are associated with Bipolar Disorder. If you look into nature we have many examples of such distinct extremes to help us break down the problem and understand what is going on.

First understand that Mania can be compared to an ""energy rise"". Manic episodes are an extreme rise in energy levels. Perceived as pleasant and positive by the patient but in reality are negative and harmful. 

There are many examples of a rise in negative energy levels we see every day. Epileptic fits are a rise in uncontrollable energy expression (how amazing that anti-epileptics are also used for Bipolar Disorder).

If your child is having a tantrum, do you let them continue or do you stop them? Guess what, you are supposed to be careful stopping epileptic fits too....think about that.

What about anger? comes out like the steam of a kettle that doesn't want to be bottled up....

What about when you answer the call of nature....what goes in, must come out....

Bringing it back to the topic of Mania. Understand that we are creatures of input and output. What we perceive and consume goes into us. If you experience a bad memory, it's now a part of you. If someone hurts you, it's now a part of you. If these two negative psychological injuries fuse within you then they aren't being processed and excreted which is comparable to not being able to relieve yourself after eating or drinking...

Mania has three categories or stages that may be experienced when I last checked online. Hypomania (mild stage, not always a problem), Acute mania (Stage II, problematic with loss of impulse control, sometimes not connected to reality and have psychosis), Delirious mania (Stage III, this person has gone extreme and needs to be hospitalized. They are a danger to themselves and others).

Understand that our emotional expressions/moods are within a continuum (a continuous sequence with the opposite extremes being very different). Like the weather (extremely cold, cold, slightly cold, warm, slightly hot, hot, extremely hot etc). 

Observe an adult arguing with someone or a coffee lover who's had too much caffeine. When moods generally become negative, they can be described with similar terminology. Angry people jump from topic to topic just as manic people do. Angry people have pressured speech and speak quickly just as manic people do. Angry people can become dangerous just as manic people can.

Neutralizing extreme moods aren't limited to the science of chemistry. Chemistry is useful in certain cases though. That's why Bipolar patients are sometimes prescribed lithium, but they are also recommended a healthy sleep wake routine and diet and they are also recommended good family relations and avoiding stress. Every case is unique.

Every time you see a child having a tantrum or an adult having a heated argument, you are somewhat observing a type of manic episode.

The point of this post was to open the mind and present examples from nature to understand the anatomy of manic episodes and how they are neutralized."
384,"My question is if a person( after years of meds and counseling) able to get better after dealing with lifelong trauma. I recently read bipolar is chronic lasting years OR lifetime. Can a person be bipolar for decades and come out of it, after healing a broken heart?"
385,"Being lost in life is like being in a maze. Whether the maze is in your head, or physically at a large shopping mall or airport. I remember when I used to work in a help-desk the trainer told us general principles in how to deal with customer issues. One of the principles I still remember to this day was the acronym KISS (keep it simple stupid).

What does this have to do with Mental Health?

Amazingly if you study the science behind body building you will see it mirrors some Mental Health Disorders very well. What happens if you don't use your muscles? They atrophy (of body tissue or an organ, waste away from under-use/neglect).

In other words, use it or lose it.

What do they recommend for OCD? (Exposure therapy). Expose yourself to the feared thing, healthy stress occurs like carrying a weight, and you grow to learn not to be so obsessive and stuck in a loop.

What do they recommend for Social Anxiety? (Exposure therapy). Expose yourself to the feared thing, healthy stress occurs like carrying a weight, and you grow to learn not to be so fearful about your social situations.

I could go on with many Disorders.

I'm not surprised that I've read you need to ""rewire the brain"" to come out of chronic mental disorders. I'm also not surprised that the brain is ""neuroplastic"" and you have the power to change it which is basically what happens whenever you habituate and learn something new.

What happens if you are schizophrenic and you hear voices or see stuff and are fearful of them? you get paralyzed by them and they ruin your life. Well what happens when you take a calm approach and not be so scared about what you see/hear? Eventually you habituate to it....maybe your neurons/brain changes as well in a positive way. 

Habituation is a big principle for human health. And amazingly in body building your muscles eventually habituate. That's why you have to ""surprise"" them with a new stress for them to grow or you hit plateaus (little or no change). 

When someone with a mental health issue is not changing (just like muscle growth having no change), they aren't getting the right nourishment. The same thing happens in body building, that's why those guys may change their diet up a bit. Or they may change their frequency of lifting. If the muscles aren't growing then something needs changing. No progress is no good! In the case of a mental health issue, the person may need to nourish themselves by processing a persistent delusion through an alternative view from the doctor down the road. Or they may need to read a book. I myself came out of a few delusions after years.

Is there a simple way of saying the above? yes...

Before I say it, first consider the fact that some schizophrenics deteriorate into dementia (brain atrophy). Did we just hear a word from the body building world?

MOVE, and give your brain a workout. If you get stuck, change your nourishment."

390,"Hi everyone, 

I was wondering if you can help me answer a few questions.

1. Did you ever walk away from someone you truly love due to having a depressive episode? If you did, what was your thinking/feeling behind doing this? - Did you feel like you were doing this person a favor or did you just feel overwhelmed and like you can't handle people altogether including your bf/gf? 

2. I am aware that each person has a personality and a mental illness doesn't define a person, but based on your personal experience, if a bipolar individual truly loved the person before the episode do these feelings tend to come back after the person is out of the episode and leveled out? Also, if the feelings come back would you try to reconnect with your loved one? 

3. When a bipolar person goes to this dark place in depression and cuts off all contact with bf/gf - is it better to give them their space or to try to keep in touch so the bipolar person knows they are loved no matter what? I would love to offer support but feel like this would just drive them further away 

4. Do you tend to remember your depressive episodes and manic episodes or is it all kind of blurry? 

5. If the person is not diagnosed, how to approach this topic and open a conversation once they're feeling better, and is this a good idea at all? Also, how to do this with a man who is not very keen on psychology, therapists, and medication and thinks it's all a joke and a waste of time/money while clearly in distress and needs help? 

I am asking all this in hope to get some guidelines on how to approach my now ex-boyfriend as it breaks my heart to see him suffering and in pain as well as get some understanding of our relationship and breakup to find peace and clarity for myself. Thanks to everyone who took the time to read and comment. :)"
391,"Dear all, 
Apologies for the long post in advance but I really could use your help.
For over a year now, I have been struggling with my mental health. 
In march I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder with psychotic features. I was placed on lamotrigine and aripiprazole.

The medication so far has been great in terms of managing moods, and I have been stable for over 2 months now. However, alongside my illness, I have noticed a deterioration in my ability to communicate. It started just 2 months before my first depressive episode. 

I would experience sudden bouts of mental blackouts. This would present itself in the form of not being able to finish a sentence. I would begin the conversation normally, and then suddenly mental blackout toward the end. My train of thought would become derailed as if my mind suddenly became empty. E.g. A sentence such as “Today I went to the park and walked my dog” would become “Today I went to the park and…(Blackout)”
As my illness worsened it progressed to a point where, I would no longer be able to form sentences properly.I would be able to give short one word answers to questions but would not be able to form proper sentences. “We need to leave at 10pm and get a taxi to the club” would become “We…need errmm *pause* we have… get taxi….”. My thoughts became jumbled and incoherent to the point that I was unable to complete any complex sentences clearly and was only able to give 1-2 word responses.
Since being on the medication it has improved a little. I am able to form proper sentences if I try hard. However the fluency of conversation is just not there. I strutter, I am unable to express my thoughts into word coherently. My speech becomes jumbled, disorganised. 
Subjectively, under normal circumstanced when I try to communicate, I usually have a ‘mental map’ of my trains of thought and I am able to comprehend the speech of others and appropriately react. Now due to these symptoms, it feels as though this map has been lost and I am attempting to navigate the conversation in the dark. As such, I may not react appropriately or even adequately comprehend the content and context of other peoples’ speech as well as my own thoughts.

I have told my psychiatrist about this. She believes that this is caused by anxiety, but I disagree with her. I have read that people with psychotic symptoms often experience what is know as 'Negative Symptoms' among which is Alogia - a poverty of speech that results from impairment in thinking that affects language abilities. Alogia - Wikipedia

Again I apologise for the long post, but I could really use some advice. Can anyone relate to this? If so, how should I tackle this. 


Many thanks,

392,"I will begin by giving a short summary of my experience with depression and psychosis. So basically I have experienced 5-6 psychotic breaks with manic features since I was 18 (26 now) and whilst I became mildly depressed for 1-2 years (ages 18-20) my mood seemed to stabilize to a decent level for a couple of years. Then after a psychotic break, when I was 23, major depression struck me. In the past 3 years I have had two psychotic breaks and during the moments running up to the psychoses plus most of the psychoses themselves I would describe my mood as reasonably well. In-between the depression remained, and particularly the last two years have been really dark.

Since 2.5 years I have been put on paliperidone while before that I took Seroquel due to it being an injection instead of pills as during my breaks I pretty much always refuse to take my medication. At the moment I have tried Lithium, Escitalopram (SSRI) and Venlafaxine (as an SSRI and an SNRI). Whilst on a high dose of Venlafaxine, so it functioned as an SNRI, I still became psychotic despite having had a 75mg Paliperidone injection. But the psychosis started in the last week of the monthly depot so it could’ve been that somehow it didn’t work long enough. Since Seroquel is actually quite coincidentally one of the three approved drug treatments for Bipolar depression I want to opt for returning to taking Seroquel instead of the proposed Abilify despite it not being injectable.

Other than this I have tried TMS, a healthy diet, working out frequently, I have had some psychotherapy, one psilocybin experience and have supplemented with Vitamin D, omega’s and vitamin/ mineral complexes. Thusfar none of these methods has even begun to lift my depression. Today I have started a ketogenic diet to see if this will help my mood. Also I am working with a coach doing a combination of mindfulness, meditation and Wim Hof breathing. And I will be supplementing with magnesium.

Other than this there are as far as I know only a few other options besides medication which include ketamine infusion (which unfortunately is extremely difficult to get while being prone to psychosis), fixing my sleeping schedule (chronically oversleeping at the moment), some questionable supplements such as 5-HTP and CBD and ECT (which I see as a last resort). Now I am wondering if I am still missing some treatment options. I am keen to hear what helped in treating your bipolar depression"
393,"I don't get it... this time last week I was so overwhelmed with a sense of isolation and panic I was genuinely suicidal.. And now nothing !..

394,"Hey everyone!

I'm here to reach out for input and possible advice regarding a loved one of mine! I've known her for just over a year and a few months ago she opened up to me about being bipolar. She mentioned how I was the second person, besides immediate family, she ever told about her being bipolar - the first being a bad experience hence she pulled back from telling others. She told me I made her feel appreciated and wanted, for who she is, including her flaws, and through mutual trust she decided to open up to me. I immediately went to educate myself but she had some major changes coming up in her life so she got busy before I could ask more personal questions regarding bipolar for her specifically.

Now because none of our mutual friends know about her being bipolar, and even though they might be familiar with it, it's not up to me to tell them about things. Hence I can't ask them whether they've noticed things, so I decided to come onto these forums and share my experience here :)

Like I said, I met her just over a year ago and the first few months there was barely any communication between us - when we eventually started talking properly, about 9 months ago, we clicked immediately. The same interests, similar mindsets, similar goals and dreams in life, every time we'd hang out it'd be all over the place, laughs and giggles (in a way her mutual friends had never seen/heard her laugh/giggle before she met me) to intellectual conversation about politics, the world and the future. About depression too - we both had experiences with depression so we had some deep talks about this, too.

At some point she suddenly became incredibly active socially, while before that we'd have a few words exchanged a day - hanging out a couple (2-3) times a week. She'd be texting me almost all day, sending me good nights when going to sleep, good mornings when she woke up and we'd continue right where we left off. During this period she also had many, many ideas of things she'd want to do, projects, she even wanted to start a business and unaware of what was going on I discussed the things she had in mind with her, we talked about them, made lists, fantasized. When we weren't together we'd be on voice chats drinking wine, watching shows together. I had to get used to this for a bit, cause it didn't seem like the woman I'd got to know before, but I did appreciate and enjoy it.

Suddenly her behavior changed. All the things she wanted to do somehow she wasn't interest in any longer, she was no longer as socially active as before and the plans we made for activities we'd do together - she neglected them. She didn't seem depressed to me, so I mentioned I was confused and how I didn't understand what happened with our plans. This is when she opened up about being bipolar. She had been in a hypo(manic) episode and ended up crashing down. She did mention the crash was nowhere near as bad as she's had before, she said I helped her stay grounded during her episode and it felt like I guided her through this safely. Initially she was afraid I'd be mad at her. I was not. At no point was I mad. Instead, knowing this is the woman I really appreciate and who I want to keep in my life, I decided to educate myself on bipolar. I googled for days, asked questions on reddit.

Eventually, she came back to what I learned is considered a baseline and we started hanging out again. We'd meet up for drinks and watch movies. We went playing pinball. Not as actively as we did during her manic episode, obviously, but I loved every moment of it and to me, everything was perfect. Throughout this all we went along as friends, but I decided to break the ice and ask her on an actual date. She told me how happy she was I actually asked and exclaimed that of course she'd go on a date with me.

However, things did get busy, it was during the middle of the summer break and she was getting ready for a big move across the country to start studying there. This is when things massively changed, and where I ended up being incredibly confused. At the start of her new university semester she was incredibly anxious and she started drinking more wine. A few times she showed me pictures of things she bought, claiming she didn't really have the money for it but bought it anyway. She then also had a massive fight with a family member, which broke her quite a bit. I comforted her and she thanked me for validating her, reminded me how I always manage to make her feel wanted and loved. She reminded me how amazing she thinks I am and how glad she is to have me in her life. The next day she suddenly goes on and on about all the projects she wants to get going, all the ideas she has. 

A couple of days later she suddenly decides she does not want to go on that date with me anymore. I notice she'd hardly been sleeping, from what I gather she spent a few nights staying up all night. If she does sleep it'd only be a couple of hours. Her contact with me has basically died and I feel like I don't even exist to her anymore. It's hard to get any information out of her cause she's basically unresponsive, but a mutual friend mentioned that they did speak with her and she has mentioned she's ""going to save the world"". 

She IS on medication, but I'm not quite sure which one. I'm also not sure if she's still taking them.

Now I don't want to assume things when it comes to bipolar so my question to all of you really is: does any of you recognize this latest behavior of hers? If it does seem recognizable, would you say I have reasons to be concerned? And if my concerns are rational, do any of you have any suggestions/advice on how to move ahead/how to help her?

Thank you :)"
395,"I have always had serious anger issues. My anger feels almost uncontrollable most of the time. I have been much more aware of it than I was in the past and have been able to manage some episodes that would've been catastrophic into something much smaller. However I still really struggle with it and was wondering if anyone has gotten somewhere with theirs.

Honestly, after I have a major meltdown/manic episode, it almost feels like an out of body experience. Like I wake up and there's all this destruction around me, usually in the form of my ex boyfriend looking at me like a self destructive stranger. I always really hated this feeling and I know and understand completely that it is me that causes all of this, but at the same time it feels like someone else is making these horrible decisions and then leaving it for me to clean up. I always regret these times and eventually I used up all my ex's goodwill and he couldn't trust me anymore. This all came to a culmination when I got so angry that I literally packed all my bags and left him overnight. Objectively the worst decision I've ever made, and I don't want it to continue. 

I know being angry is a normal human feeling to have, but how can I express it without it being world-ending all the time? 
I still have a lot to learn about my bipolar 2 but this is definitely my most prominent issue. Anything will help. Thanks for reading!"
396,"Something is sapping my strength.. Will power ?.. I just feel so drained.. I'm eating 'better'? At least a wider variety of crap.. But I can't get going... woke up about ten this morning.. And did......? nothing !.. Just sit here and drift.........

I feel nothing.. Just empty.. Hollow maybe.. Its coming up to four o'clock and I've already given up on today...

I think I may have given up on life..."
397,"Hi all, 

Does anyone start to feel upset when you can feel or notice mania or hypomania coming on? I've had a good few months with no issues and suddenly the signs are there, and I almost feel a sense of dread. It's really odd because at the same time I feel pretty good about myself and the future. Can anyone relate?"
398,Do your eating habits change at all when manic? I'm looking at symptoms online and it doesn't seem to mention anything.
399,"So I'm having a lot of stress, fear, anxiety, depression. I'm looking for a new therapist because I'm not on the same page as my current one. I feel as though I'm on the verge of needing to be hospitalized yet my current therapist doesn't seem to get that I'm not ok. It's a problem of communication. I'm letting my wife know I need help and she's helping me look for a therapist. 

Anyway I'm struggling at work big time i don't know how I'm not on disability it's so bad. I'm afraid and struggling to complete work my boss has noticed. I was laid off my last job because of poor work performance and covid. I'm hanging on by a thread if I lose this job I dont know when I'll get another I don't want to lose my house. Maybe I'm being irrational. I'm terrified though.

Since my meds and therapy don't touch my issues I've turned to alcohol to get some relief. I don't drink all the time just once in a while. It helps and it makes things worse. I'll take it for an hour of relief.

I don't want to end up in the hospital again but I don't know what to do besides suck it up and keep going like I always do. Any advice is welcome."
400,"hi ...

(Background)..
29 f diagnosed with bipolar around age 16-17. After being told i have severe depression (age:11-16) and constantly switching antidepressants, things got worse and they realized i was bipolar and discontinued  all the anti depressants as they were creating frequent manic episodes ( which I didn’t have or at least remember having before all the med experimenting)

after years of more medication experimenting , now with bp meds and multiple ER visits... a  psych finally had come up with a cocktail if medications for me that seemed to “ work “  i was taking geodon, buspar, topamax, welbutrin, and a few other things that were to treat the twitches , tremors and convulsions being caused from the geodon.. which now i still suffer from, it has become slightly less noticeable (to the public) i seem to have made myself believe that at least.

anyway i remained on the meds for many many years , always being hesitant to let anyone attempt to make adjustments. The meds “ helped” kind of...they helped mellow me the heck out .. so much so I forgot the person i used to be , but not in a good way. They made it so i had less manic episodes, and when i did it was slightly easier to pull out of them. They mostly kept me“ down” or in a “ zombie state”   it became hard to even smile, i was in a constant state of depression which really only felt like numbness , i never actually truly felt my feelings( if that makes sense) i would then very randomly have manic episodes of full on rage. It was until 2017 i had a manic episode that was a “ good high” however others picked up on it though i was still in denial. At this time i was in a hospital program for eating disorders but they helped a little with the bp. Here i had been a little more open to med adjustments however none of the changes ended up being helpful at all after leaving this program i found myself back in the hospital not even a month later in the psych program where I became so desperate I allowed them to adjust my meds freely because i knew i was not “ok” and i was very suicidal. During this time they royally f***ed my life and I developed a huge fear , i was terrified to leave my house specifically my bedroom, I could not even go down the driveway to the mailbox i didnt leave home for a month, i was afraid to shower I became paranoid someone would come in and hurt me, well u ended up realizing this was not ok and discharged myself over the phone.

i feel i am now just talkin too much so im just guna do bullet points

 since age 12-29 things I suffer with

-self mutilation
-Depression 
-rage
-anxiety
-eating disorders 
-voices 
-dissociation 
-paranoia 
 

1-2 yrs ago: worked with my psychiatrist atm to ween off all of my meds i didnot want them anymore i was tired of being a zombie
- first few months withdrawn on and off not doing ok
- then i felt AMAZING, i felt free and like i could breathe again, i felt like me , however now i felt my emotions.. which wasn’t actually that great at all
- I managed I distracted myself and i was for the most part episode free for a decent amount of time being off meds
- now... for months have been rapid cycling and this is the worst i have ever been ... i am not ok and i feel that my disorder is now driving a wedge between my fiance and i who rarely ever fought, now we fight daily and by fighting i guess in reality actually means that im losing my s**t daily over dumb, really dumb things and then crash follows up pretty quickly, im crying until ive made myself so sick and its just constant now all day sometimes but at least one time everyday i have an episode 

i do not want to go back on meds but i know i need help bad! Is any one or do you know anyonr managing other ways without meds??

Sorry this is so long"
401,i recently bought smirnoff and was wondering if its a better alternative than medication because its keeping me calm
402,"Hey my girlfriend admitted she was on lithium which I know is for bipolar/major depression etc, but then said it was just for stress (it has been a stressful period don't get me wrong) but I feel something more is going on.

Been so distant for weeks hasn't wanted to see me, hasn't exactly ghosted me as she's still been texting but not nearly as much as usual, has reiterated that we are ok. Still gone to work and stuff.

My question I just wanna know, for purely stress you wouldn't get prescribed lithium just for that would you? As that's what she said it was for.

I just want some idea as to whats going on"
403,"Last night, I started taking my new prescription of sertraline after one day off. (total of 2 times before that).
This morning I woke up early around 6-something. It was getting lighter outside. I normally sleep later. I tried to fall back asleep, but couldn't.

Later on, (it's 9AM right now, so a bit before this..) I felt like I used to after getting out the hospital. Normally, I'd use weed and then a hospitalization would happen and when I got out, it's like I couldn't feel happy without the pot. 

I also crave my vape of Nicotine. (i've not used nicotine in many months after quitting cold turkey because I worried over my health). I thought about CBD flower to get the feel of smoking satisfied, but I want to be able to pass a drug test should I try to work again. Plus, I can't afford it long-term.

So i'm talking about it instead.. like I did when I quit nicotine. I haven't smoked weed since 2015, but I never got over it.

I just want to feel better. I have an appt with a new psychiatrist in some weeks, and I plan on telling them about this. I also plan to tell the therapist i've been seeing next week at the therapy session.

I'm not sure if it's because I'm stopping the generic Welbutrin, which I was put on for quitting vaping..

I miss weed so much."
404,"Hello all,
My wife has been going through an intense manic episode, but looks like it is starting to subside after getting on her meds. I'm starting to realize that my wife does not remember all the details, especially the psychosis part. They are really traumatic and I think she needs to know the details to understand what she puts people through. 

My worry is that having to hear such details could be triggering, even if at her baseline? Is it bad to go in specific details? I actually have an audio recording of her screeching/screaming and saying vile things. But I'm afraid that if I play it for her, it will trigger her..."
405,"I’ve always known I was depressed and had anxiety but I recently was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I’ve been switching between a few medications and nothing works so I started smoking weed instead. Being isolated in quarantine depleted me completely. I was scared of being alone and so depressed so smoking helped me. Anyway, I have found myself doing more crazy irrational things lately and not caring about the consequences. The more I read about bipolar disorder the more symptoms I notice in myself and I’m scared. Particularly about the worst situation I got into over the summer. I slept with someone who is in a relationship and even worse he’s in a relationship with someone very very close to me. Now I’m in love with him but I’m not dumb enough to think we’d be together. His girlfriend is someone I can’t cut out of my life even if I wanted to (trust me). And even worse, she’s afraid she’s pregnant. So I just need advice on how to live with this. How to live with myself, how to endure their relationship when I’m around them, how to not ruin things. I’ve been emotionally abused and used by so many people my moral compass is off. My mental state is depleted and I’m almost at my last straw. The old me would’ve never gotten into this situation but bipolar me says otherwise. I just need someone to give me advice on how I’m supposed to continue on when I’m in an impossible position."
406,"My wife is going through a manic episode right now. There was one night that was interesting/disturbing to me. When recalling the events, I am slowly realizing that a lot of what happened she may have been faking to see how far she could push me. I was being overly accommodating because I knew both physically and mentally she was suffering. I have never seen that side of her mania before. Is this a fairly common situation with some people who are manic? They purposely fake and instigate to see how far they can push you? Do they do it because they get amusement out of it? Or just curiously seeing what they can get away with?"
407,Ok so I just wanted some input. Do you all think that during the manic phase the impulse control can potentially be combatted by overthinking? So in other words the period where people with bipolar just do things without thinking can be stopped because said person is prone to overthinking but the urge is still there. I know probably no any therapists here but wad wondering if thats something that is possible with bipolar disorder.
408,"When my wife is manic, she will some things to me that are hurtful and (seemingly come out of nowhere). She always apologizes for them later when she is back to baseline (at baseline we have an extremely happy relationship)... saying she never meant it and didn't know where it came from.

I've learned now to disregard those comments, to not take it personally.

But I wonder... there must be some truth to it, right? It does not come from nowhere? Maybe there is a little kernel of truth that is suppressed when my wife is at baseline. I'm thinking I should not easily discard those statements like I do. I should take them seriously, even if some of them seem a bit farfetched. I don't mean taking it seriously as getting offended by it - but more realizing that what was said has some underlying root cause that maybe be good to explore further to help our relationship.

What do others think?"
409,"Hello, 

I am a guy, 18 years old, from Denmark and I am studying at the moment. My psychiatrist have not diagnosed me with bipolar yet, as the mental health system in Denmark is quite late and not up to date. I am struggling with anxiety and depression. The only diagnosis I have is depression. Even tho I have bad anxiety, and I am also quite introvert and quiet. I have struggled with these symptoms since I was 15-16 years old. I went through a tough childhood. I witnessed my mom almost getting killed with a saw by my dad. My parents got divorced, my dad went to jail because of weed growing and I and my brother lived with our mom. As of today, I have a great connection to my dad and brother, but I don't have any connection with my mom. She is cut off from my life. My brother and I experienced a lot of psychological violence, as our mother was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder. My dad is diagnosed with bipolar I and have many manic episodes. I smoke weed to have better sleep and to function properly with my anxiety. I take 50mg quitapine(25-50mg PN, morning and evening) and gapapentin(1200 mg, morning) and I'm feeling well.

I have a theory that I might be bipolar II, because of everything I have experienced and the way my brain works. I have many depressed episodes and they're quite rough on my mental health. I don't experience any manic episodes, or rather I don't see them myself. I gamble quite a lot, and it is almost impulsive every time. I always end up regretting big time. I see myself as a gambling god when I'm betting. I don't know if this is manic, but I'm sure I experience hypomanic episodes, especially in school. I might arrive sad and down, but a simple smile or a favorite teacher can turn my mood around dramatically. I experience fast-talking and racing thoughts when I'm with a good friend alone. Because of my anxiety and me being introvert make me believe that my hypomanic episodes don't happen when my anxiety is high and on alert. And my sleep is very variated, I always wake up before my alarm, every time a few minutes before. I might even have gone to sleep 1-2 am. Days when I slept a lot I'm almost always tired and unmotivated to wake up, but when I get minimum sleep(4-6 hours) I function very well, low anxiety and I'm happy most of the time. I get very easily distracted, but at the same time, I can focus very well on things like listening to the teacher and making my homework. I have restless legs and it feels weird to not move them around and shake/wiggle them.

My psychiatrist doesn't think that I might be bipolar, and it annoys me so much. She says it's too early to tell, and I understand her answer because I've read that bipolar disorder is very invisible in a young age.

I would be very glad if any of you could share any useful information. :)"
410,"As the question in the headline: after you come back to your baseline, do you clearly remember everything that happened during your manic episodes? Or is it more like a fog with some details there and others being blurry?"

412,"My boyfriend is really struggling with bipolar ... he was on meds around 6months ago and now refuses to take anything. He seems to be on constant lows right now and I don’t know the right thing to do. Everything I say or do to try and help , he seems to take the wrong way. He talks often about leaving everything behind and going away from everything he loves. He’s also more recently became violent, Not towards me, but wrecking our house . He’ll rip all the clothes out the closet and throw furniture around the house. His lows are getting worse too where he can’t find joy in anything , if one things goes wrong it’s the end of the world. He’ll lay in bed on days off work and sleep all day.  I’ve tried everything I can in my power to help him I’ve begged him to let me in , but he seems to be sure he is unhelpable. when I’ve told him I’m calling for help he’s told me he will drive off before they arrive and not come back. His sex drive has also completely gone and he won’t talk about it. I’ve more recently learned this is a bipolar side affect , but it affected my self confidence a lot as I thought I was the issue. 
I want desperately to get him the help he needs.
I just want to know if this has been anyone else’s experience , advice on the right and wrong things to say and what would be good for me to do for him. There’s so much more stories I have but this is just the things I’m struggling to help with right now."

415,"Is anyone here tech wise? basic programming or database science?

I'm giving away my years of research/insights into mental health for free. I hope people, especially the younger generation are able to take my work and develop it further.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM is the handbook used by professionals worldwide in Psychiatry as an authoritative guide to the diagnosis of mental disorders.

You guys who are tech wise I have a challenge for you, it may not be that hard either. When you guys were at college or maybe as part of your job you would know about a computing language known as ""SQL"" (Structured Query Language). Very powerful language. Well, what's so special? I've found that this language can simplify a lot of the labels in the DSM incredibly. It fits like a puzzle piece in response to the complications in labelling data. That's what I feel anyway after my own experiments.

SQL is very old (1970's) but still remains in high use today. Why is SQL so important and useful? SQL allows cross referencing of large data sets. It exposes redundancies and inconsistencies. It helps the user gain insights. Users can query and manipulate data and more.

Here is my first basic example:

My intention with the following query is to find redundancies/inconsistencies in the labeling system. Redundancies in life happen when there is an excess or something is deemed as not required (sad example is when someone gets the sack at work). Inconsistencies happen when something doesn't seem right or in order.

The following database query demonstrates what I believe to be a redundancy/inconsistency in the DSM because it lists some labels that share a symptom that are actually the same symptom based on the reality that at the fundamental level they operate the same way. These symptoms are being given different terminology but they are actually one symptom.

My query is:

""SELECT Disturbance.DisturbanceName AS Symptom, Label.LabelName

FROM (Label INNER JOIN LabelDisturbance ON Label.LabelID = LabelDisturbance.LabelID) INNER JOIN Disturbance ON LabelDisturbance.DisturbanceID = Disturbance.DisturbanceID

WHERE (((Disturbance.[ConditionProcessID])=1));""

When that query is run, the following resulting data is returned:

(Please see attachment)

ConditionProcess is the power behind simplifying these symptoms and exposing them as actually being one symptom. I apply ConditionProcess in my query into the DSM labelling and symptoms data. ConditionProcess basically is: ""Perceive->Disturb->Provoke->Respond"". That means that the above symptoms follow the same process. So my database looks for all labels that have symptoms that follow this process.

As you know all those symptoms do indeed follow that exact process which demonstrates they are indeed the same thing. And it doesn't surprise me, why? Because all those symptoms are all treated well through the same or similar methods not just with pharmaceuticals but also sleep hyigene, neuron recovery, social interaction, nervous system arousal through exposure therapy (habituatng to fears) and more. This isn't the case with all symptoms, just a certain subset within the DSM that belong together and should be classified as one symptom not different.

I hope that makes sense...."
416,"I've posted in this section before, only to be convinced that I didn't have this...that it's some sort of atypical depression (or well, convinced by a mix of here and another community) However, I came across this site (linked below) just coming out of one (or even still in one and/or mixed) of my ""manic"" or ""hypo"" states, and I can tick off more boxes here now. 

Look! I put an asterick (*) by the ones I felt I exhibited, or rather, exhibited most. I don't have much opportunity to speak or speak freely so I can't judge that, and my self-esteem is definitely higher than other times, but not sure if it's high high. And I seem to recall describing myself as easily distracted, but I can't remember it clearly right now. 

And obviously, I relate to all of the criteria for depressive episodes.

418,"Hello, I have read that one of the best methods for helping borderliners is through DBT-therapy. Recently they have found out that DBT also can work for none-borderliners. I am NOT a borderliner. I am a ""depressed and PTSD-er"" on my way to recovery. I am telling this because I bought the book ""The expanded Dialectical Behavior Therapy - Skills Training Manual"". I think that there is much to be learned from this book. I hope I am welcome in this forum without the borderline diagnose. This is probably the only forum where the chance is great for meeting other people trying to use DBT-skills. And I think it is honest to tell, so that when others talk to me, they understand that perhaps my problems are different (more or less), even if there is not one person who has exactly the same problems as another. We are all unique persons. :)"
419,"Hi everyone,

I have been very low for a few days now and my psychiatrist have not been of any help. It seems that he now thinks everything idea that comes out of my mind is either paranoid or delusions of grandeur.
Fortunately my partner of over 16 years is on my side and is planning to go with me on Tuesday to give him talking to. I almost feel sorry for him.

Anyway, the actual reason for this post is that I discovered a book called ""An Unquiet Mind: A memoir of moods and madness."" it was written by a former Professor of Psychiatry at John Hopkins Hospital in the USA (one of the best hospitals in the world). 

The difference is that she herself has bipolar disorder and wrote the book from both her clinical and personal experience with the disease. This was as far as I know the first clinician that ""came out of the closest"" in such a public way about her condition, which was and still is very brave. I myself have worked in medicine for about 22 years now and it is paradoxically, one of the professions where mental illness is still severely stigmatized.

I started reading the book yesterday and it has already struck so many, ""wow, that is exactly how I feel"" moments. It is not a scientific publication but a humanistic look at the disorder, so give it a try.

I am one of those ""Knowledge is Power"" people so it is highly recommended.

Lot of love

420,"My sister has been diagnosed with bipolar with psychosis.. it went from deep depression with psychosis. In 10 years, she's had 4 relapses, she's 35.. Here is what I can see , what do you all think

Sometimes not realistic about life or situation, example: talks to a guy a couple of times, thinks she's going to marry him. Generally the guy does not feel the same within a few conversations
Spend hours and hours in the bathroom when she relapses
Hums to her self
Moves her lips as if she might be talking to her self or her thoughts
Gets hyper or very active for short bursts of time
Listens to music all day, same song or songs over and over and over and over and over. Sometimes watches the same movie over and over and over again
Does not say a word, sometimes does not speak for a week, has no social interaction
I can ask her how she is doing, she responds with thank you or some random responses
She colors, or sits outside

My sister takes Wellbutrin and something else. She takes her medication, but for some reason relapses. She's not harmful, or abusive, she listens most of the time if we suggest anything.

When she is okay, she's able to work, more talkative, and slightly more social.

I need help. Any suggestions or ideas or anything will be helpful. Growing up, she had some friends, she struggled in school, but also crushed school. She seemed okay..always kind of in space, but okay. Our mother passed away on our 20s.. She was fine for a year and then had a breakdown. Since then it's been 10 years of ups and downs.. We are in Canada. The health care system is bull, I don't care it's free. 

The other thing about my sister, when she falls apart, she does not realize it. She does not know she's going from ""normal"" to not normal.."
421,"I was put in a psych ward today for a depressive episode. This is the first time this year so it's some kind of a record. This is my 8th time at this ward in two years. So I am a regular customer. All nurses remember me. 

This time I went to a hospital before I did something to myself. Seems like I've learned something. I was wise enough to ask my husband take me to a hospital. I was actually here yesterday too. I waited four hours to meet a psychiatrist then I gave up and wanted to kill myself.

I am not planning to stay long. Maybe 1-2 weeks. I've been in this situatuation so many times I know what helps me. I want to be pro-active. I also want ECT. And I need to get over this crisis at hand."

424,"Hey all,

I'm new to this forum and this is my first post on any sort of mental health website. 

I've been diagnosed Bipolar 2 since 2015, and have been on various meds since, but finally settled on a mix that has seemed to work for the last 3-4 years. I'm on a low dose of both meds (150mg Lamictal and 150mg Welbutrin), and with my health insurance expiring in June, I fear I won't have affordable access to my medication. Most psychologists in NYC don't take state insurance (a lot don't take ANY insurance.. wild) so I feel like I'll be screwed in a couple months.

I've also been recently thinking about going off them anyway because I'm not convinced the diagnosis is still relevant, or that I have outgrown the mood swings? I had clear hypomania and severe depression cycles, but I'm starting to wonder if it has more to do with trauma than mental illness?

Does anyone have any experience going off meds for Bipolar 2, or any advice in general in this field? Any ideas or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance!"

426,"Does anybody identify?

I take Abilify. It's allowed me to be stable and I am pleased. I accept the lack of highs which I miss (those days when everything seemed laced in gold). Importantly, I have no more lows (those days when I saw the end of a line) which feels wonderful but I am so restless. I am so bored! I was never so bored before. I just go from place to place so I'm really restless and can't settle. I can't find anything to do. 
Is this because I am stable? Is this what stability looks like? I don't get much done. I find the thought of doing anything I am supposed to be doing absolutely impossible and yet I'm restless and exhausted all at once. This feels like a very very toned down mixed episode.

428,"Up all night again. It started with an urge to write a poem (which it must be said, I have never done before). 

The next inspiration was then to retranslate the Heart Sutra based loosely on snippets from the movie Little Buddha, Thich Nhat Hahn‘s version, as well as Naichen Chen’s translation. I think my version is now much more accessible for westerners with all Sanskrit words and/or concepts either removed or explained. This contracted version also only takes up a single A4 page. 

I hope there will be more inspirations during the day.


Just remembered I have sessions with my psychiatrist and occupational therapist today :-("

430,"Hi everyone,

I used to be on this forum a long time ago, but had to leave because of a major crisis. It is unlikely that anyone will remember me.

Over the years I have been hospitalised numerous times and was basically treated for refractory major depression.

It recently emerged that I actually have rapid-cycling bipolar disorder with mixed features. I am very ill at the moment, but my new psychiatrist and I have opted to not go the hospitalisation route, because I am an introvert and find those situations unbearable.

It turns out that I had the same stigmatised view of bipolar disorder even thought I have been mentally ill myself post adolescence through all of my life so far. The diagnosis and realising that it ""explains so much"" is heartbreaking and very difficult to deal with at this stage.

My psychiatrist and employer have placed me on temporary disability leave for the next three to four months until I am able to function normally again. As such I am in desperate need of someone to talk to who have the same or similar condition and experiences, while I am sitting at home alone during the day until my partner returns from work.

I look forward to being part of the f"
431,"Hi everyone, I’m glad I found this forum. I am bipolar 1, severe ptsd, depression, and panic disorder. My question for everyone, do you guys have any kind of plan in place if you backslide? A video to yourself? Just wondering the best thing to do?"
432,Ok so the thing is that i was diagnosed bipolar but a different psychiatrist said It was an acute episode of psychosis so my question is what are the highs like? so far I´ve only got the inspiration to writte. to writte about anything. but is that considered a high? because ive heard people´s highs and they are really productive which Im not. hope you get what I just writte. :)
433,"My husband had an episode 6 years ago (before I met him). I didnt get much information on what he experienced but I do know some of the reason why he went through it - his business partner has cheated and frame him and he was facing jail time for something he never did. Eventually it was proved he was innocent but it took a toll on him as he treated this person as a brother for many years. 
Fast forward 3 years, when I met him he was mostly in depression and not coming to work (he owns his own company which he has along with his family and I work for his company), not going out, he was just at home sleeping eating what hing tv, repeat. Reason being that his family tried its best to keep him away from anything so to not go through the same episode. 
i felt that was wrong and he shud change his lifestyle. Slowly we became friends and I managed to get him out of his depressioN. Over the course of 2 years he had low and high moments but vary rare within the time. We started dating and engaged. Before our wedding the doctor that was seeing him left the country which led to him changing his doctor. At this point the new doctor took him off depakine and put him on lamictal. From
That point on it was only high or low high or low one after the other. We got married and it continued, until the COVID lockdown in March which made him be normal for 5 months. 
Recently we noticed he started not sleeping which leads to him getting high. We went to his doctor to try and prevent it but the doctor did not believe us and rather believed him who said he is feeling fine. 
next day he had a breakdown. Started shouting and everyone and crying in front of everyone and asking everyone to take him to the hospital. Eventually we got him home (from work) and he was low and quiet and silently crying and being scared. 
What led to this was that He believed his data was stolen and given to the same person who betrayed him 6 years ago. I cannot know if this is true or not but his family is adamant its all his imagination. My husband was ready to file a case against this person and show proof of it being true. But I never got to see any of it because of what happened next. 
the next day all of a sudden he started being scared, thinking we are all in danger, imagining things, not knowing what year we are in, not recognizing our house, our dog, not knowing what he is doing. We managed to take him home and calm him a bit but the next week was a nightmare. He barely slept because he was refusing it, he kept having delusional thoughts, thinking he is talking to god, imagining people around, not recognizing me sometimes, destroying things around the house thinking he’s either fixing them or that they are possessed, praying in christianity or in muslim (he is christian), crying a lot of times, taking a million showers, trying to run away from home, getting really angry or being normal sometimes. 
For 1 week 1 treatment was tried, which did not work, so the next week we changed it and it seems to be working slowly slowly. 

My issue is - why did all this happen again? His family believes its black magic... 
I want to know the scientific reason for it. 
His family while taking care of him has not really been understanding of his situation. Instead of understanding that he is struggling and has no clue what he is doing, they start shouting at him, and complaining all the time. At one point they even told me its my duty to take care of him so i shud do it. I need to mention I am pregnant and due within a month. 
It breaks my heart seeing him cry, when he is angry I am scared, and when he is normal I miss him so much I wanna cry again. Whenever I do cry in front of him he somehow softens and is normal. 

His family is telling me that after he recovers I have to control him all the time and not let him talk to x y z people, meet people, do this or that. Basically he shud just be at home sleep eat watch tv repeat. I am strongly against it. Besides that I dont see how this will help him to learn to handle life, its also inhuman and not possible for me to do. 
In the city we live most people are connected and his past will always come back if he has not overcome the trauma whether its true or not (like how his family is saying he is imagining the whole situation). Plus in his company it seems that everyone is cheating him. And obviously if you dont oversee your business. As a business owner he is suppose to do business which they never allow him to do. Sometimes he himself is crying and saying “I am 36 years old, you dont allow me to do anything. Not watch this, not go here, not have a phone, not have friends, how can i live like this?” 
His family is saying we shud not tell him of what happened but I think he shud know the seriousness of it so that in future he would listen whenever I tell him he is getting high or low and needs medication adjustment. 
I want to leave this country. I feel that he needs to rather have a 9-6 job where he doesn’t need to worry of people and work afters and where he doesn’t know anyone and can make new normal friends, not big shots that can hurt him. Plus be away from his controlling family. 
I understand they are worried but this is not the correct approach and I feel its also what has contributed to the entire situation. 

Please give some comments/inputs."
434,"Yeah. It's fucked up. Economy's down. The society's divided between left and right. People are losing friends and relationships. All because they are working long hours to get paycheck to paycheck. Philosophers discourage people from having hope. Pessimism is rampant. Jobs are getting competitive. Work abuse is increasing. More and more people are giving up having families. Dreams of doing what you want is just a mere fantasy.

That's what some users here say... at least. My hobbies, such as learning history or doodling anime is pure bullshit. I should do something more constructive in order to survive. Any hobbies are bitch-ass time-wasters in this economy.

I did yoga. Didn't work. I did mindfulness via hypnosis. Worthless. Stress management is crap.

My father said that a good amount of sacrifice needed to just barely get by. Have to go through abuse just like the movie ""Whiplash"" in order to do my best. Just to barely survive. I don't agree with him. May worked during his time, but this age is different. Hard work doesn't guarentee mobility.

And yeah. My therapist said hard work doesn't guarentee progress. I can get an expensive degree and work at the largest conglomerates and still won't get shit. If you don't understand what my point is, just look at South Korea's situation.

But whenever I look at people who do what they love, especially YouTubers who doodle anime online... I feel they have it made. Of course, they go through personal issues. But they overcome with boldness do what they like.

I wish to be like them too... But no...

I feel depressed when I look at my future. My mediocre grades at a foreign college... and look aty future. It's hard to get a job in South Korea. And I can't afford any more tuition fees if I go back to US. I'm about t be homeless if I lose my parents. I get jealous and angry.

I tried many alternatives. To show myself that life isn't always a struggle.I tried so hard. All ended in a failure. My mind starts to race.

Even if I manage to survive, I feel that I'll permanently regret if I can't get to accomplish my dreams."
435,"I have this really awful yet extremely good memory like I can remember some letters I saw when driving by a sign when I was five but I can get up to do something and forget what it was by the time I get there.  My doctor explained my problems with memory as depression, and my depression comes from Bipolar, so I decided to post this here.  He recommended I take vitamin B complex and since I've been taking them I have noticed my memory getting better.  I also have less stress from psychosis when he doubled my Abilify to 10 mg which helps with my memory and lorazepam keeps me calm and even keeled which I also think helps with my memory.  Just wanted to share the progress I was seeing."
436,"So my boyfriend was taking lithium for about 7/8 months with regular trips to the doctors for blood tests. But the problem was he would never drink enough water... well know he's been and he has an enlargedbliver and kidney that could be cancerous.. small chance but still could. 

I was wondering whether there's anyone on here who has dealt with something like this or know someone that has. As the doctor said that it is most probably because of the lithium that has caused it and it should repair itself within a month but until then not to worry. Does anyone know how common this is... or any information at all relating to this would be great. 

Thankyou."
437,"Another question! I’ve googling this one also, but haven’t come across any helpful results.
I’m bipolar - my husband is also bipolar. Basically we both went nuts and were diagnosed within a couple months of each other (about 2yrs ago). We have two kids, been married 2 years, and been together 6 years.. 

Is anyone else bipolar with bipolar spouse? What’s it like? Is it constant fighting? Are you manic at the same times? Etc.
I’m going into manic depression, and it seems like he is too (he’s always in denial about it), so we’ve been arguing a lot because we’re both trying to climb in the hole. One day I do EVERYTHING, the next day he does. Seems like a good idea, but we fight about who’s doing what and who’s picking up slack.
Curious how many others are dealing with this?"
438,"Its my Depo in the morning.. And I'm soo nervous I want to throw up. I hate it.. every two weeks.. Its a nightmare.. Even though it normally goes ok.. Its just the stress of being outside my bubble. The hours are ten till three.. But I always get there just after nine.. To make sure that I'm first in the cue and to ensure it doesn't get to busy... as I'm sure you can imagine a Depo clinic for mental ill people draws in some right crazy people.. So I normally get there just after nine and take a book to read..

I find the whole process traumatic.. So the plan is this... get up at seven, get ready.. Go to the shop for fags and Coke at about half seven (see nobody).. Then at eight walk to the doctors to take my prescription in.. (another nightmare, don't ask).. Then straight from there to the shop to buy food and more Cokes (still almost nobody about) then at nine call a taxi.. I've been doing this for the last........... six, seven years ? So the guy who answers the phone at the taxi place recognizes my voice and knows what I want before I even ask.. So he says he'll send one straight round (I live right by the taxi place, you can see it from my bedroom window)

And then the stress really ramps up... I tell the taxi driver where I'm going and the first thing they say is.. 'wheres that ?'........... I really fucking hate it when they do that man.. I mean why are you a taxi driver if you don't know the streets.. What ever happened to doing the 'knowledge' ? Its not like I'm asking you to take me to Calcutta its in the next small town over about ten minutes drive away... if you don't know, why not punch it into your sat nav.. Which they all have... and then when we get there they all want to 'dance'.. I say how much is that ? And they immediately say.. How much do you usually pay ? barsteads !!! So you don't know where we are going and you don't know what it costs.. Why the fuck are you a taxi driver ? You get in the back.. I'll get in the front.. I'll drive myself there and pay you £5.50... like I always have.. 

and that's before I get in the door...

then its crazy time.. I'll finish this tomorrow when I get back.. My son is coming round (he was here last night to )... anyway I have to go tidy so we can play happy families...

be lucky  ;)"
439,"I’ve recently started lashing out when I get anxious or frustrated. I’m 7 weeks postpartum and I’ve been cycling through emotions like crazy.

Last night I dumped a watermelon in my boyfriends lap because I was hot a frustrated because he stopped listening to me. The not listening isn’t a new thing but has been the root of my anxiety issues lately. Our ac has been having issues and I tend to be more frantic and generally pissy when I overheat. On the last few weeks I’ve lashed out at others, self harmed, and been cruel for no reason. I can feel myself spiraling."
440,Hi there. I'm going through a period of rapid cycling at the moment. Does anyone have any tips or things they try that help?
441,"Hi Everyone,

I'm a 33 y/o male, new to the forums and have been reading up a lot on bipolar. I was diagnosed bi polar 2 by one dr a couple of years ago and major depressive disorder by another. I'm going to see another dr next week.

Basically I went off my meds in January (risperdone, lexapro, and lamictal) and was scared out of my mind at the time, but was perfectly fine, I wasn't real high or real low, kind of right where I wanted to be, I was sleeping and eating pretty good too. 

All of a sudden maybe about 10 days ago, its hard to explain, I just have tons of energy and everything seems like a great idea, went on a spending spree and sometimes just want to pull my hair out, my mind races and can't do one thing and hop from one thing to the next. These past 2 days or so I'm more down don't want to get out of bed and hate being around people which is what my friends say I should do. I don't want to be on meds but I'm starting to scare myself a little, I thought I was done with this. I don't get after 8 months why this is coming back now. I thought if anything I'd have problems coming off the meds in the winter, and thought I was home free after a few months. I'm working from home now so its not too big of an issue but worry when I have to go back to the office I might flip out, it's happened before. a little peppiness is great but when it gets to a certain point its pretty scary, like I'm looking at myself from outside myself but still can't stop it. I'm very apprehensive about taking antipsychotics but okay with taking mood stabilizers or antidepressants.

I know I have to be diagnosed by a dr, and not asking ""am i bipolar? I don't really care what word doctors or society use, i just want to have a normal wavelength again. I apolagize up front if I sound arrogant, am just uneducated about mental health issues in general. I guess my question is is it common to go long periods without any depressive or manic episodes and then out of the blue, for no external reasons, start having episodes?"
442,"I've been on lithium for over 10 years and have issues with my hair falling out and the texture has gotten fuzzy.  Being a woman, it really bothers me; worried it will all fall out:(  I've reduced my 300mg twice a day to 150mg twice a day over the last month.  Has this helped anyone to help their hair look better?"
443,"Depression is always so bad that I push myself into mania. There's no in between for me is depression or mania. I no longer want to be treated for mania. And I can't be becauae i also suffer from apathy and the complete lack of feeling and mood stabiser make there problems worse.
Fuck my doctors who did not belived there are mixed episodes in bipolar and those who did not care burn in hell. I developed psychopaths traits and ptsd because of them incompetent retarded losses bastards. Even I know better psychiatry comparing to them... And I'm fucking finished... Idiots.
Judge me you too I don't care"
444,"Hi, 
I have a problem with going to both extremes. In a more depressive period I Am opssesive with owning very little stuff, I mean extreme little . On the other hand when up I think I lack everything and buy things I do not really need. 
Do any of you have similar experience and how to balance? 
Thanks"
445,I’m afraid to get help. I’m less than 60 days postpartum and I’m afraid that they’re going to take him away from me if I ask for help. I don’t know what to do. I’m not going to hurt my baby. He’s what’s kept me from hurting myself.
446,"Hi all,

Does anyone else have uncontrollable mini-outbursts of anger? I find myself easily worked up since my last manic/mixed episode (and this was certainly a symptom of that episode) and almost always it needs a release of anger; shouting, punching or throwing something, even trashing a room. Then afterwards, I'll be basically normal again. 

Just the other day I was shouting all over the flat and totally trashed my bedroom but just minutes later I was laughing and joking with my flatmate. I always had a pretty high tolerance for anger but have been prone to the odd outburst through my life but it seems to have escalated recently. I wonder if it has something to do with the medication (Quetiapine 300mg once daily) as I've noticed some emotional dulling since being relatively stable on that."
447,"Hey everyone - New here.. I’m 29 and was just diagnosed bipolar about a year and a half ago. It was a lonnnng, confusing 27 years.

My current situation(s) that lead me to finding all of you.....

My brain is everywhere (yours probably are too). Off my meds (trying to get in with a psychiatrist - my doctor permanently closed) was taking divalproex.. not sure I liked it anyway, I would sleep all day and if I wasn’t sleeping I was eating. I’ve been on adderall for 2yrs, I also take Xanax for anxiety and occasional panic attacks.
My bipolar has definitely confused my kids - my daughter is now 5 and I think it’s time to explain things to her more in depth... Thoughts on that?
Does anyone LIKE being manic? Fun sex, get shit done, conquer the world! I like being manic 🤷🏻‍♀️
I just can’t deal with the manic depression, and I feel it coming.
I’ve always had issues keeping jobs because of the depression, so I recently applied for disability. How does that work if I get it? Can I work at all? How much do you usually get?
Is it hard to get? Are there other options for financial assistance?

Lost my job so I’ve been focusing on my furniture refinishing business that I started (obsessive creative or maybe a real thing - idk), kids are in daycare, and it’s lonely.. Especially coming out of quarantine. But then when everyone’s home I just want to be working on my projects 🤦🏻‍♀️ Wtf?!

Clearly my doctor never went into much detail about being bipolar or how to manage it. I’ve just been getting by with google..
Which thankfully brings me here!!

Hi there. I have been going through an episode for several weeks. Whilst it was mostly depressive, anxiety was creeping in. I'm now on extra sedative meds through the day, as well as being on a lot of night time meds.

453,"I've been getting off risperdal for two months. With each decrease came mania, but not too bad.
I am naseous most of the time and unbelievably tired now. I've been completely off for 8 days.
About 2 days ago I received a letter from housing saying they have terminated my from the program. (Letter sent 7/30 and they did not pay aug. rent.) Because of some paperwork, that I thought was done 2 months ago. And I did not hear back from them for months, just termination letter. They have cut my hrs at work. I do not feel I could function working full time. I have 3 of my children still at home. We have also been in our home for 15 yrs. I only have an income of $1700 a month. That's not enough for 4 people to live anywhere. We will all be homeless and my youngest son will be taken by his father. Not to a mention a house full of belongings would be lost.
I'm beside myself. I feel odd. Almost depersonalized. I  am worried about what kind of state this could put me in. I'm bp. I have my counselor working on my behalf with housing. 
I don't know how I can come up with an extra $1300? I may apply for disability if housing won't reconsider."

I don't really want to die... but I'm beginning to think that's the only way out.. The only choice... a way out."
456,"There is almost no such thing as a healthy discussion about mental illness in families.  It’s not even close to religion or politics.  It seems that participants in the group begin mentally and physically to do everything possible to avoid it.  They either shut down the conversation, physically leave the room, or their eyes avoid yours. 

They relatively ignore the signs Mom was in deep trouble.  They try to rationalize up to 4 suicide attempts.  Ignoring the long bouts in her room, alcohol dependence, crying at the drop of a hat, it all sets in motion a dismissal of the possibility.  Even the genetic components  get swept under the rug.

Perhaps it is a defensive escape to say, “Not in my family”.  Even though statistically the shear numbers in a large family make it nearly impossible to escape some form of mental illness. 

After some discussion with one of my sister’s, she concluded, she didn’t think Mom had it.  It reaches a point where you give up knowing almost no one in your so-called tight knit family can handle it.  You’re left with a hole in your heart and you avoid the conversation, even if you want to cry out, “I am here”.  It always seems to end with a down playing of symptoms, hospitalizations, and the concept of making too much of it.

It makes me very tired and stuck with an illness anybody can ignore.  I want to say to those who remain in a cycle of ignorance to educate yourselves.  A simple Google search would provide helpful information, but even that is too much to hope for when denial becomes the easier norm.

I know this is not the case in some families and that gives me some comfort.

I have to wonder, will this ever change?"
457,"I think i was hypomanic and now depression has hit me pretty hard. I am on antipsychotics but they don't seem to be helping this depression.

I don't have appointment with a psychiatrist for a month. there's mild loss of appetite and i don't feel like doing much but i am doing everything as normal, it just takes a bit of an effort and i am very stressed about something coming up."
458,It´s a really frustrating feeling that ive got. And I´m no sure about the root of it. I think it might probably be due the fact that I was in a mental Hospital thats why I think I might scare people. so I´m too consent about what my hands are placed or where I´m looking at. It´s really frustrating I hope some of you can relate.

461,"Hi, I'm new here.
I was diagnosed with Bipolar I about 4 years ago after a major manic episode 2 years prior. I've been depressed pretty much my whole life, very low self esteem due to bullying, just always been a super sensitive, insecure person. 
I was wondering how you all manage with the aftermath of manic episodes? What sort of support - if any - do you get, in particular from your family and friends? How do you cope with it and carry on with life...do you enjoy it anymore? Are you happy, do you find joy in things? I can't seem to find light at the end of the tunnel..."
462,"I have a lot of feelings of low self-worth and I'm wondering is it my illness or am I really just a lazy, worthless person? For example, I have an extremely difficult time keeping up with even the smallest tasks like brushing my teeth or even just tying a shoelace. I see other people tying their shoes, brushing their teeth AND everything else that ""normal"" people do, hold down a job, keep the lawn mowed, etc. Am I just lazier than most? Do normal people have the same obstacle with small tasks that I do, however, they just ""tough"" through things which I don't? 

I feel like nothing really matters all that much anymore. If my teeth rot and fall out of my mouth, I sort of have a ""so be it"" attitude about it. What is it to me if that happens? It's not like I'm going to impress anyone by having clean teeth, not when the rest of my life is a complete disaster also. So what difference does one more strike against me make? It's just a proverbial spit in the ocean. 

Does anyone else out there feel this way about life? And is it ""normal"" to feel this way but you just have to ""tough it out"" like everyone else or is there something different when you're mentally ill? It just feels like things are more difficult now than they used to be for me--before I had my first psychosis."
463,"My question: do you sometimes feel the need to hide your diagnosis and what reactions have you gotten when you have needed to share the information?

I am fairly recently diagnosed and had to disclose medication information with a GP from whom I needed a Health Check for a new job. I understand that she was struggling to write it in a way that would not affect my job, but her wording was something like ""I can't say you are sound of mind. What if you go crazy?"". 

It made me realise that this was the kind of reaction that I could expect from people from now on."

465,"Hi,

I am 18 and I think I have cyclothymia. I have been struggling with bouts of depression for about 5 years. They aren't bad enough to be considered major depression though. I am usually really creative and motivated but when I am depressed I just don't want to do anything, feel worthless and have suicidal thoughts. Before lockdown it got very bad due to stress and I also experienced hypomanic-like symptoms lasting from a day to four days at a time. I felt so amazing and hyper and sang 24/7, but I could sleep. I do now remember having moodswings before this though, but my memory is still very bad. Since I am still functioning, I am scared that a psychiatrist or doctor won't take me seriously. However my mood swings are making my family hate me.

I also don't know if I even want medication, as I do have periods of ""normal"" mood for like a week here and there.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for the help in advance!"

Shall I hand it in when I see the Pdoc tomorrow?  :LMAO:"
467,"I get depressed every evening. It's true. I get gloomy every evening. I feel fine in the morning, and get awfully depressed during the afternoons. It's fine when you fall asleep during depression, when I wake up, I feel just okay.

""Don't stay up at nights,"" I think to myself, ""If you do, you have these negative thoughts depressing you."" But sometimes, depression comes too early in the afternoon. Day by day.

I tried everything to keep me happy. But when they're gone, the depression's back. I can't shake them off; the fundamental cause of the depression isn't solved.

I live with my mother who is schizophrenic. She has auditory hallucinations, and believe that there are witches who can mind-read. She said I'm a spy and accused me of espionage. She rants about it for days, screaming about who was about to get her. She said everyone is involved in a conspiracy to destroy her, and I was a part of it. Thus she gets physically aggressive towards people. But I wasn't doing anything to her. I tried to help her in many ways.

I made her to stop drinking alcohol. I made her to take her pills. All ended up in a failure. She pretends to take the pills and discard it somewhere. She didn't stop.

We went to two psychiatrists. They both kicked her out. She does not listen to them or whatever. The third one provided her the right medications, and thankfully she was healed. Her symptoms gradually improved. (We went to South Korea's finest hospital) She takes her pills regularly and stops taking alcohol.

I had to take sole responsibility, while my family is too old and sick to give us any help. My father is too busy providing for our expenses back in US. My mother and I live in an apartment back in South Korea, and he can't fly over here to help us. No one can help her, only me. I had to do everything myself.

My father used to give us help back when we were in US. But he could not afford the medical expenses. US has high medical prices and he drove us away, only sending money. South Korea has affordable medical expenses, but crappy mental health care.

My mother suffered from delusional disorder for 10 years, and I suffered from bipolar disorder for my entire life. It's taxing for me to care-give her and keep up with my academics. (I go to a college)

I asked a lot of people in other subreddits (won't mention exactly what) and other websites. Some just bitched at me to push through the pain. It infuriates me because it means that I have to try hard to perform academically while going through this mess. Going to a college in South Korea is tough. South Korea is filled with professors who are bullies. They yell, curse, and threaten students.

My head professor said the same objective that others had said. Not only that, I have to be stuck taking care for her for the rest of my life.

I have no money or educational background to get myself independent. Even if I did, I can't afford anything. Unemployment is rife in South Korea and expenses are rife in US. It's between a rock and a hard place; I need my parents to survive.

But I push myself to my goal. So hard that I had to sacrifice everything to survive. I kick hard to survive.

This pressure to perform while care-giving made me snap and lose my anger. I have serious ups and downs. I get paranoid in one moment and depressed after. One point, I get so angry that I wanted to harm someone. If they started to say something awful to me, I feel like i could seriously injure them... which is a serious crime. I get worried if I keep going like this, stress might destroy me and do something like this.

This is why I'm depressed. If I keep pushing too hard, I'd lose my mind. South Korea's too competitive to get a measly job. Preparing under enormous pressure and caring for my mother is taxing. I'd break something or someone! I'm also worried that she might relapse... asked a lot of doctors and pharmacists. I even asked the social services for help. No use because of COVID-19.

If I ask my doctor for my symptoms (mom's doctors and my doctors are different), he'd tell me to go to a general hospital... as an inpatient. He tried to help me adjust to so much meds, only to end up in failure. I have NO money to afford to be incarcerated, let alone to receive welfare. Actually, my current medications, Lonasen and Lithium, are reducing the symptoms.

I relax by taking a walk. Going to museums and other attractions. South Korea has a lot of them. That helped me unwind and ease the dangerous stress, but something in my tells me to grind again. Or else I won't survive."
468,"A long time ago, I was married with a beautiful 3 year old girl.  Overtime, I saw my family disintegrating before my eyes.  Healthy living was marred by hazards detrimental to life and most often illegal.
One night, a dangerous plan was being developed to harm another person. The incident to this day is as clear as if it were today.  A group of men were downstairs planning another's demise when the fear that held me in place could no longer be ignored.
At some point, I went downstairs and as I got to the place I could see the group, I was stopped in my tracks.  Above the group was a mist like fog above all of them.  Then I heard a voice.  It was clearly a male voice coming from behind me.  ""Take your child and leave this place"".
I became confused, disoriented and for one, my child was safely at her Grandma's.  
What followed was 3 months of frienzied activity to get out.  Job, a place to live, determination to let nothing get in my way.  I left and never looked back.
I have often wondered if this has ever happened to other people?"
469,Just read what bipolar is but I want to hear some real stories about it.
470,"I don’t know what to do. I Think I’m bipolar, I’ve been undergoing treatment for it for over a year. I’m medicated. Yet I have this tendency to make everything about myself and say things that don’t make any sense to me at all after I think on them. When I can control it I’m able to be loving to my family. I’m able to be who I WANT to be. Who I am sucks sometimes and I just want some f***ing help or at least to see if this happens to anyone else because I just feel lost."
471,"Dear all, 

For the last few months I have been doing a lot better. About 5 months ago I was in the midst of a horrible mixed-state rapid cycling episode that nearly drove me off the wall. Since getting treatment my mood has been a lot better (with only some minor occasional dips into mild depression) and I have been stabilised on Lamictal 200mg and Aripiprazole 5mg. Initially the Aripiprazole would make me sleepy, but now I experience little to no side effects from the meds I'm on.

However, for the past few weeks I have been sleeping excessively into the early hours of the afternoon, 10-11 hours a day. My mood is fine, and I feel great on the whole, but the sleep issue is not going away. I go to bed at a normal time, around midnight, but cannot for the life of me get up before 10. Can anyone relate to this type of hypersomnia. 

I read it could be a sign that an episode is coming? Anyone have any advice?

thanks in advance

472,"Hi guys. Ziggy here, new guy :D

almost two months ago my ex fiance decided that she 'couldn""t take it anymore' and decided to dump me. she suffers from bipolar. i love her very much. 

we kept living together for a month and a half 'financial reasons' and now we are seperated for 11 days now. it's the first time since we got together for about 1 year and 8 months. 

will she come back? i'm doing NC for the moment to try and forget her but it's hard. we were supposed to get married in december. everything hurts so much and i always want to text her to tell i'm sorry and stuff. can anyone please help me?"
473,"My daughter has struggled with her mental health since she was 12.  She has been in and out of psychiatric hospitals.  Many different and multiple diagnoses.  She is now 18.  I now no longer have the ability to force her to get the help she so desperately needs.  She has been diagnosed as Bipolar Type 2.
Tonight was a bad night.  I haven’t even been to bed yet.  I’m terrified.   I had to take her to the hospital. I had to practically force her to go.  It was her current boyfriends birthday party.  She said he was driving and they got into an argument.  That he grabbed a gel candle that was in the car and attacked her with it.  She had multiple lacerations on her arm.  One deep and wide that needed stitches.  He refuses to tell me what happened until he retains a attorney.  My daughter swears up and down that she did not do this to herself.  And I want so desperately to believe her.  But I can’t.  I’ve seen her go into psychosis many times in the past.  The kind where she starts to hurt herself or someone else and I have to call EMS to come help.  Usually that means a trip to the ER and a psych evaluation.  And then they would admit her into a RTC.  Now that she is 18 I no longer have the right to get her to do a psych evaluation.  And I’m horribly afraid just based on past experiences with her and her illness that she did in fact so this to herself.  She is planning on filing charges against the young man today.  Charges that could possibly ruin his life.  If he did in fact do this to her, he does need to face the consequences.  I went and viewed the car that this incident happened in.  And I just can’t wrap my head around things happening the way that she said that they did, based on the location of the busted glass, which is next to the passenger side door.  And the fact that the boyfriend in question is a small guy. Very short, and I just do not see him having the kind of reach that he would need to do this to her while driving.  
And now I am dealing with the guilt of not being able to fully believe the story that she told me.  I want to believe her.  But with all the stuff I have had to deal with for years, well, it is incredibly hard. I haven’t told her I doubt her story.  But I do.  And I have no clue on what to do. Or how to proceed.  Or even how to get her the help she so desperately needs.  She refuses to take meds.  I am really not sure what to do anymore.  I would appreciate any advice.  I’m so lost and scared right now.  I just want her to be okay.  I probably seem like a horrible parent.  But I really do not know where to turn for help.  I’m the only person in our family that has not left her because of her illness.  Everyone else including her father have nothing to do with her.  I would really appreciate any advice or any resources that anyone knows of that might help me find something that would help her be okay.  I’m so incredibly scared for her.  Thanks so much."
474,"Medication: Seroquel, Depakote and Trazodone

Woke up today and decided to look on Safari, and i come across something that I didn’t remember searching for at first, then it hit me that I did search that.. but months ago. I go back in pages and see stuff that I do remember searching for before I searched the last page. The thing is I was using private mode before I went to bed and I rarely use normal mode but when I do I delete my history when I’m done using it.

Also YouTube search results that I would’ve searched I did not remember, and a few days ago I had stuff I like in my video history that I didn’t remember

Could this be a side effect from one of my medications?"

476,"I don't really know what to do. I work outside and get heat sickness easily.

One of my meds (Latuda) increases my likelihood to get heat sickness.

The heat also increases my Lithium levels, which sounds hazardous.

477,"Hello. This is going to be a long post but there is a lot to explain. If you read this entire post and give me advice, I cant  overstate how deeply grateful I would be. Thanks.

I am currently a 21 year old heading into my senior year of college, and i have bipolar type 2. I was diagnosed when I was 19, but I had kind of known for a while that it was likely I had the illness. My family has an extensive history of childhood trauma, and mental illness is rampant throughout my siblings, parents and close relatives. Due to trauma, my older sister has had her share of issues (anxiety, depression, anorexia) but she is now great and has been for years. My grandma and mom also have had an anxiety disorder throughout there life, and based on his actions, I am almost certain my father has some type of undiagnosed mental illness.

Before I talk about my brother, ill share a bit more about myself. I was a normal child until about sixth grade, when I began to deal with a traumatic family experience. The details are long and unimportant, but I am certain this trauma was the catalyst that brought out the bipolar I was genetically predisposed to. For years going through middle school and highschool, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was given various antidepressents to try and ease the problem, but with no success. Eventually as i got older and went to college, i started to notice an up and down pattern in my life. I would go through weeks to months of severe depressive episodes and then be fine for a while. Mainly, I noticed the lack of consistency and cyclical ups and downs. This coupled with the fact that I have severe insomnia (or thought I had insomnia) I realized there may be another issue. I got a new evaluation with my psychiatrist and it was determined I have bipolar type 2, mainly because of the long depressive episodes and the fact that I never really had a long or severe manic episode. Instead I have only have had short bursts of mania, lasting about a day to a few hours at most depending on the situation.

Once I received the diagnosis, I began to work on ways to improve my condition and become consistent in my life. I tried lithium, but it just numbed me out emotionally and didnt help too much with the depressive episodes. I have been off the lithium for a while now, and I am doing the best ive ever done. I have achieved this through  developing mindfulness, some meditation, journaling, exercising 6 times a week, keeping a consistent sleep schedule, and by maintaining important relationships in my life, which give me a strong support system. Additionally, the study of philosophy (my major) has helped  tremendously. This is because it trains you in rational thought and critical thinking. Reason or rational thought is something that I, and anybody else, can know for certain is objective and true. By applying this to my own thoughts, it allows me to stay on the right path and know with confidence that I am making the right choices. Considering that manic and depressive thoughts are irrational, this is precisely why rational thinking and philosophy helps me so much. The study of philosophy has also given me a sense of purpose and meaning in my life, and for the first time I am achieving a long term goal with consistency. I plan on going to graduate school and ultimately obtaining a PhD. I would like to teach one day. I have spoken with many different professors and a graduate advisor, and they are all confident in my writing skills and ability to achieve this, and are encouraging me to do so. I actually did so well in my metaphysics class last semester that my professor offered me a spot in a graduate seminar he is teaching, so I can get some experience with that before I graduate. The point is, I am doing very well.

My brother on the other hand, as been a mess for years. Hes had drug problems since freshman year of highschool. He currently just finished senior year, but didn't graduate. He was diagnosed with what I presume is bipolar type 1, as he has out of control manic episodes that last for weeks at a time. He has destroyed so many things in the house, said horrible things to my parents, been arrested numerous times, and severely abuses drugs. If I were to go into the details of all the destruction and pain he has caused, it would take an entire other post. He just got a medical marijuana card, which I believe has triggered his current manic episode as he is again completely out of control. When any of us try to talk to him, its like talking to a wall. He literally is incapable of comprehending what we say to him, and thinks he is totally fine. Its like he cannot register the fact that his behavior is abnormal. I feel I have so much advice to give him on how to deal with this, but knowledge is useless on deaf ears.

I am posting because neither me nor my parents know what to do. He is 18, so he refuses any help. I thought about maybe getting a court order for psychiatric help, but I think it just will make him worse. Anyone with bipolar knows you need to want to help yourself to make a change. I am also struggling to cope with this, as watching him go through this is like watching the worst version of myself. The issue is that I empathize with my brother on such a deep level. I know exactly what hes going through, and when I see him out of control or depressed, its like I literally share his emotions and feel what he feels. This takes a big toll on me. Overall I am okay and a very strong person, but this situation gets overwhelming at times. My biggest concern is that he is eventually going to turn to something like heroin. He already has an addiction to benzos.

So, what should I do to help him, and what can I do to better cope with this situation?

A particular question I have is how should I handle his mistakes. Meaning, every time he hurts me in some way, he gets upset that Im mad at him, and then i tell him i forgive him. But should I begin to not do that and shut him out a bit, so he can see that his actions are not normal? I feel like always forgiving him and telling him our relationship is fine (which its not) is what is enabling the behavior.

If you read this, I love you and appreciate you."
478,"I can explain what I mean more but having a hard time doing so upfront. Partly because I have various issues with the current diagnostic scheme as it lumps and splits things, as I guess many do though (such as the US NIMH) but it's tricky to explain without going into all that mess.

I say non-psychotic because I'm not referring to what would be considered frank delusions/hallucinations. So this might not apply at all to people who feel they're totally free of anything like that most of the time but have discrete manic episodes in type one or whatever.

What if there's an underlying belief system (perhaps linked to a genetic neurodivergence but not talking about an autistic syndrome) that both motivates hyper attempts to fulfill it, but also inherently undermines those attempts resulting in frustration, social confusions all around, and thus social anxiety and depression for example. 

That could just an after-the-fact ideological justification that the brain comes up with, as we are so adept at doing naturally.

But of course religions pursue a lot of this stuff. And they even bundle it up with a load of non-logical stuff that would probably be considered psychotic (or their historical heroes would be) if it wasn't such huge numbers of adherents mostly functional individually (though some might do self-neglecting disepowering martyr type stuff but somehow benefitting the religious group overall?)

Basically how do you resolve an independent non-functional logical idealism? (extremism?). There's a diagnostic overlap with the concept of 'personality disorder' too though where there's a supposedly inflexible (maybe just different to everyone else's inflexible) response set somehow out of synch.

I suspect this may not make much sense without more concrete examples but feels a bit too personal then I dunno."

I’m new here.
Recently diagnosed with bipolar, although I’ve been treated for anxiety and depression for over a decade.

I have felt the teeniest manic. But full functional and calm. Just my brain is firing like crazy. I like that it's finding answers again.

488,"Just wondering if anyone has had this problem. I've always had anxiety over swallowing a pill. But to get out of crazy- I knew I had to get over it. So for 11 yrs I've been taking pills before bed.
I started having more manias and tons of panic attacks at age 40. During that time pills were notoriously getting stuck in my throat. This would stress me out, I didn't want to lay down and sleep. I had to drink more water, eat something. Nothing helped. It was so bad I was afraid to take my pills and missed doses. Which of course made things worse.

Now I eat my gummy vitamins after I swallow. I think they are sticky and grab the stuck pill. Works Everytime!

My panic attacks and anxieties are better now. So that makes taking medicine easier."

Hope you are well. I have bipolar disorder which I have been keeping under control for a number of months now. However, I have a friend who I am very concerned about. He has been depressed for a while following a relationship breakdown. He's a very emotional person with a fragile psyche. He has had he crisis team come over to his house a number of times due to self harm. He has in the past been offered medication and therapy but has refused treatment. 

Recently, his depression has worsened and he has been taking a lot of drugs. He now babbles incoherently and doesn't make any sense when he talks. He also claims that he has been periodically haunted by ghost is heavily obsessed with the occult. I spoke to him when this happened and I tried to convince him to speak to a doctor about these issues. But knowing him he will just refuse treatment. He has a pretty strained relationship with his parents and he hasn;t told them about any of the things he is going through. All my friends are concerned about him but we don't know what to do. 

Can anyone offer some advice on how to help a person in crisis

499,I've been getting this really rank mood off and on today.  Like depression and severe heartbreak combined without the longing feeling for a loved one.  I am thinking this is because of my bipolar.  Do you ever have short term changes in mood that are severe?...seems more than just a mood swings.

It was so much easier to have a bit of hope when I thought I was going to sort my self out one day and all the anxiety and psychosis would be behind me for good.

501,"After three admissions to the hospital with psychosis, my wife's dosage of Quetiapine was increased to the maximum level 800mg/day.
Sarah has Bipolar and takes her medication.
The Q was reduced to 700mg
Depakote - 1000mg
Lamotrigine - 150mg

Sarah is stable but suffers from any little stressful situation which I deal with.

The question?

She has been taking this for 7 months and we noticed a gradual decline:
With her inability to listen and register.
The lack of concentration.
Forgetful. 
Inability to understand the simplest of tasks.
Clumsy, dropping things.

Has anyone experienced the same?
And!! does it get better when the dose is reduced?

502,"Has anyone ever seen the movie ""What About Bob""? And if you have, do you ever get the feeling that there's some kind of profound insight in it, an insight that you just can't quite ""put your finger on"" as they say. And the thing about that insight is that it makes me uncomfortable and anxious--like life is not what I thought it was, that it is, in fact, something horrible, so horrible that I should have gone back into the womb. 

And then the feeling goes away, like when I walk into a room and forget why I was going to the room."
503,"After 5 years of wonderful stability on Latuda, I developed extreme Dystonic reactions. Tried lots of different things including cogentin to counteract Dystonia. Nothing worked. Now reactive to all antipsychotics. Lamictal gave me drug induced Lupus and a plethora of other meds gave me unlovable side effects. doctor has now put me on Nimopidine and I can’t find much on it. Anybody have any experience? I’m basically out of my medication options and I don’t want to go back to being “fun” if you want to call it that"
504,I’m so insecure I don’t know how to calm myself and feel comfortable around people. My low self esteem hit me when I got bipolar at 19 years old. I’m now 49 and it just never goes away the insecurity. I’m around other’s and they talk and laugh so easily and I’m always a ball of nerves. My medication calms me being with myself I’m fine. Whenever I’m around other’s I’m self conscious and feel like no one likes me even when their really nice to me. My insecurity is my bipolar and I’ve tried 30 years to overcome it but it never goes away. It always looks like everyone is so confident but me.
505,I am having trouble to be strong. I am nervous around kids. They can be loud and outspoken. I feel I need to toughen up. It is hard because of how low my self esteem is and how high my panic is. If someone raises their voice to me I get so upset. Including kids. It can make me so angry or else it makes me afraid. I don’t know how to handle stress and pressure well. This is why I haven’t had a job yet. I am still learning to deal with this. It’s not easy. But I am trying. I feel so stupid to feel that kids are braver than me. This weakness feeling is slowly killing me. I will get no where in life as a “snowflake” as that term is used in today’s society. A snowflake is someone fragile and easily offended. I am easily broken.

i've had enough"
507,"Hi all,

First time poster here. Around 2 years ago I was prescribed with Escitalopram to manage my ongoing ‘GAD’ as I described it to my GP.
Since I can remember I have also been highly anxious, particular in social situations, meetings etc. This medication helped me tremendously, however I have recently noticed that my mood seems to shift at times - from being elated, feeling good, chasing my goals, able to string thoughts and think sharply to feeling down, low, and mentally ‘cloudy’- which is how I would best describe it (slow to think, talk and respond and therefore highly reluctant to speak up in meetings at work etc).
Admittedly, I have changed my dosage in response to these changes which may have been doing me more harm than good. I’m currently at 20mg and feel great, however I have before had the same dosage and fallen into that ‘cloudy’ rut. I am willing to see someone if I do happen to fall back into it while keeping my dosage consistent at 20mg.

Anyone else relate or have any thoughts?

Also, when I am feeling good, I don’t fall into risk/impulsive behaviour such as spending, gambling etc. I just feel good (normal as I should) and confident in my abilities to complete tasks and achieve my goals."
508,"It worked for us.  Sometimes we would laugh and say, we had our own little group home.  For years my husband and I struggled to get a handle on our moods, mostly.  The 3 of us were diagnosed in 2006.  

It took a long time but we worked to get on the same page whenever possible.  We became more aware of each other's early triggers, symptoms and eventually could read each other's moods daily.  We kept an eye on each other.

For example, if one of us was pacing and unaware, the other might say, Hey, come on over and sit here next to me.  Rapid or loud talking was an easy one to spot.  Whatever was happening we could not only identify with, but also see how different we each were.

There were times when more than one of us was struggling. Communication would break down and I at least, felt I was in the nuthouse.  The rough times escape none of us.

I had been diagnosed with depression when my husband and I met.  I told him early on.  He had no diagnosis.  He had always been very patient with me.  I was a yeller as are most of my large family.  For 20 years my husband barely raised his voice.    

I often think about people's concerns about dating and I would struggle now to dare date and tell a stranger I was bipolar.  Personally, I think dating sites should have an app for that.  

Anyway, it works if you are lucky enough to find another like ""mind"" partner.  My son took time but for now he is thriving!  I would not change a thing."
509,i live with them but it feels like for years i haven't talked to them i don't even want them to touch me and i ignore them and be in my own world what is this?
510,"Some of you might have read from other threads that I am battling with hypomania. I have crazy amount of energy and you know... All the typical symptoms. I have also cut out ALL the people in my life except for my husband and kids. I don't respond to messages. I don't even read them. This started when I got paranoid and started to question all these people's motives. Now I have started to recieve a lot of messages people asking if I am okay. Today my husband got a message from someone asking if I am well. All those messages cause me anxiety. Yesterday I had a panic attack when I recieved a message. I am afraid I will soon get rid of my phone. Why can't these people just leave me alone. 

Other issue that I am worried about is loss of appetite. I exercise like crazy, long walks every day twice a day. But I only eat some dinner that's all. I feel like this hypomania is giving me so much energy I don't need food. I don't know how long my body can go like this but by far no problem. 

I have a scheduled phone session with my cpn in less than two weeks. I don't know if I should contact her this week or wait till next week. I am enjoying this so much I don't want this to end except for the anxiety part. I can't talk about this hypomania with anyone so I am writing here."
511,"I only post this as my examples over the last 20 years.  Please, if you are having symptoms that concern you call a professional or share with someone you love.



Have another pill

Prozac, depakote, abilify, zoloft, wellbutrin, seroquel, latuda, lamictal, serzone, trazodone, lithium, hydroazine, lorazepam xanax to name just a few.  Figure out a combination that works for a while, start over, try again,

For a long time I have cursed my thoughts.  Worthlessness, no clear identity to self, selfishness, as well as, an inability to get rid of negative thoughts has gone on for decades.  Racing thoughts sometimes plague me.  It is like a tape, you push play, stop, rewind, and push play again, dust off the machine and head to round four.

Anxious in the Moment

Anxiety is like a drunk relative.  Sometimes you just want to say, shut up and go home.  Imagine wanting them to go but you are locked in a room with them.  We all experience anxiety, a job interview, meeting new people or stuck in traffic.  Now, let’s call it high anxiety.  It sometimes starts as confusion, trouble driving or reading. 

 When driving, not being able to settle into it.  Sometimes, a blurry view on the right or left side.  This leads you to try to compensate somewhere in the middle.  What’s in front of me?  It’s just a road drive. You grab a hard hold of the steering wheel.  You are hypersensitive to stop signs, lights, people, cars breaking in front of you. You are sick to your stomach.  You get to your location, only to realize you have to get back home.  Nervousness creeps in to the point that your teeth chatter or your hands shake.  Avoid driving for some time.

On to reading
You read a sentence and you comprehend none of it.  You try again, nothing.  Maybe it’s not a good day to start a novel.  Periods or weeks of this lead to saying, “I can do this” again and again.  Ultimately leads to, best you don’t drive, go outside, shop or read.

Going outside
You know in one part of your mind it makes no sense.  Yet some fear of “someone might be outside too”  Feeling of “I don’t like this”, invades.  Maybe not a good time to go outside.

Shopping
You enter the store which is teeming with activity.  Immediately you think, too many people.  The “noise” surrounds and grips you. Again, I don’t like this going over and over in your mind.  Time to leave the store.

You try to take a step in the right direction.  Yet it becomes a series of tense actions.  In time a new symptom develops, speech difficulties.  It’s like the brain slows down.  You know most of the time what you want to say.  A thought forms, you speak but the words come out too short.  You may miss a word in a sentence.  The next stage you have trouble forming the thought.  You pause to grab it and then your words come out slow or slurred.  Wait you say, I can do this and you try again.  Sometimes you are successful.  Exhaustion sometimes begins to take hold.  Maybe I shouldn't go out or talk to anyone.  I’ll sleep.

Something old, something New

It creeps in slowly and becomes a “bang”.  I can’t live like this!  You have gone a bit too low. Survival mode tries to set in.  What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.  Things can’t be this or that bad.  Get a grip.  She’s coming unhinged.  Try one day at a time or if necessary one second at a time. You have to get out of yourself. 

And then you are looking out a hospital window.  The sun is out, the leaves are green or orange or not there.  Then it strikes you, beauty and a beginning."

517,"Dear all,

3 months ago I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. It is something that I have been struggling for more than a year now, but have only just accepted my diagnosis and begun treatment. During this time I blatantly was not been myself and  people around me noticed this. But whenever they asked, I told them lies or half-truths such as, 'I was depressed because of problems in the family', or I was physically unwell or chalk it down to  my (now former) drug use. In fact, I have not shared my diagnosis with anyone other than my immediate family.

It feels strange to be keeping such a big secret from friends that I have known since my school days. That being said, they are all still relatively young (early 20s), and I doubt they will be able to fully understand my position. I am concerned as to how they will take the news, as when I have opened up in the past about my personal problems, I wasn't met with empathy and understanding, rather judgement and ostracising. They are not bad friends its just a lot of guys that age are immature when it comes to talking about personal stuff. 

In the end the decision rests with me. But I want to hear about your experiences. Have you told your friends? How did they react? What the best way of going about explaining your disorder?

-H"

520,"My apologies in advance for the length of this post but I don't want to leave anything out that might be important.

I never had much luck with the opposite sex. I would get nervous, tongue tied and never knew what to say. Consequently, I could count the number of dates that I had in high school AND college on ONE hand. After graduating, my opportunity to meet eligible girls drastically decreased. 

Seeing all of my friends getting married or in steady relationships meant that I was spending more and more time alone at home and it caused me to sort of panic. As a result, I began to ask random women on dates. At first, I focused on girls my age that I found attractive. I would say hi and suggest that we get together for a movie and/or dinner. That didn’t work too well. Some just smiled and walked away. Others gave me dirty looks and walked away. 

Since that wasn't work too well, I quickly expanded my field. If a woman was alone and not wearing a wedding ring or engagement ring, I would ask her out. I then met my wife to be. I asked her out and surprisingly she said yes. She immediately took control of the relationship and within three months we were married. 

I solved my being alone problem by replacing it with an even greater problem.

My wife is nearly twice my age and nearly four times my size. I am 26 and my wife is 48. We are both the same height of 5'8"" but while I weigh about 160-165, my wife weighs around 590 pounds. The problem is that my wife has a massive temper to match her size. She freely admits that she gets much too angry much too easily and that she is prone to physically violent fits of ungovernable rage with little or no provocation. 

The problem is that she refuses to do anything about it. She says that this is the way that she is. That she has a fire smoldering inside of her just under the surface and when the least little thing gets on her nerves, that fire blazes up and she can not control her temper. 

She says that just as you would not expect a blind person to be able to paint a picture, I should not expect her to control her temper. A blind person simply can't paint a picture and she simply can't control her temper. Additionally, according to her, since I know that she can't control her temper, the burden is on me to make sure that nothing gets on her nerves.

I'm doing everything I can to keep her calm. I never argue with her. I do everything she wants immediately. She doesn't work. She doesn't even do any of the housework. I do all of the cooking, cleaning, laundry, vacuuming, etc. Yet, despite my best efforts, she is constantly raging out of control. 

I live in constant fear of her temper."
521,"Read these two situations I went thorugh:


""I'm gonna sound foolish, but I am suffering from this awful mindset for years.

""Life is hard,"" people say. It has a lot of obstacles and just hardships. When I was little, I thought life was like a wave. You have ups and downs. Bad things and good things. Some have greater amount of amplitude than others. But as time passes by, I realize that it is more like an exponent. Life goes exponentially harder to an unbearable level and never stops. This is why a lot of people commit suicide nowadays. They just can't bear it; even Stoic philosophers declare that suffering is unbearable!

But what make me angry is my method of dealing with it. Just suck it up and push hard. Work hard to endure it. You know, toughen up. How? Using unhealthy ways:

-Don't show and express your emotions.
-Work your ass off to the brink of exhaustion. Without rest. Until death.
-Be self-critical and berate yourself to every mistakes
-Drive yourself to perfection. No one is perfect, but you must perform perfectly.
-Quit doing you enjoy. Do not receive comforts of pleasure. Instead, focus on what you need to survive. Read more books on success; essential to survival.
-Do not ask people to emotionally support you. That's a sign of weakness.
-If you suffer from any mental illness, do not take therapy/treatment. Go to the military.
-Do not forgive yourself if you fail. Finding a reason of your failure is a pathetic excuse.
-Focus on what the nasty critics think of you. Pretend that they're building you up.
-Hang around with demanding, hard people. They're your mentors.
-Do not reward yourself. Pleasure is a sinful sign of weakness.

You just have to be the best. Like the movie Whiplash. You have to push so hard that you break. When you succeed, you can somewhat be guaranteed to survive.

And my mind pressures me to be like this. And it drove me like this when I was a teen. I had a severe bipolar disorder, and I was about to have a mental breakdown. Despite all that, I did my homework. Finished it on time. At the cost of my mental health.

From my adult years, I went through hardships. I faced even more anxiety symptoms and unemployment. Now, I live in a different country. These people here demand that unhealthy and dangerous mindset in order for me to survive. And I don't think I can stand the pressure; trying this caused me to have a mental breakdown...

I think this mindset is so idiotic, but I have no other choice if I have to stay in Korea, everybody goes through that...""



""Have you heard of this concept? The fact that you have to lose something important to survive?

That's what I was forced to.

Like everyone else, I had dreams. Ambitions. But my father told me to stop doing these things. Instead, I should spend countless hours on how to be sociallybup to standards and being successful on what you don't want. And I was forced to perform well, and was put under high stress like the movie Whiplash. Always focus on what other people think, especially the toxic, abusive, demanding fuckers. They might be harmful at first, but they will build you up, like drill instructors at some darned boot camp.

""Life is hard,"" he says. And he told me that I should toughen up. This is the way to do it. Stop taking pills, stop seeing shrinks, just suck it up. Stop being a baby and do what you want. Give your dreams up for something important.

I know this bullshit is wrong. But these are hard times now. (Before COVID-19)

I feel like he is right. If I listened to him, I would've thrived. But I tried to chase my dreams in vain and chill out.

I'm screwed up in a foreign country depending on my family to survive. Had to look after them and I almost lost my sanity. College in this place sucks. Intimidating professors are prevalent. They straight out bully students, while the students goof around.

My father DID say that I will realize that he is right. And I sort of did! However, I have no regrets. Only contempt.

You see, life is short. Too damned short to half-ass around doing what my father demands. There a ton of shit I want to do, and I don't want to waste my life working my back off to survive. I wasted my 30 years fucking like this!

But I don't have a choice if I want to survive. Otherwise, things will end up in disaster. I might end up homeless and half-crazed. I might go to jail. Some countries don't just lock up people who made wrong choices. Some target mentally ill people and people in debt. And they get incarcerated.

Hell, I'm pissed. Being forced to survive one day after another...

Some say ""Life's hard"" and ""toughen up"". And this gives me the ass. Why? I fear that they're just being like my father again. And a lot of other people around him.

Looks like I have a misunderstanding on how to toughen up or deal with issues in life.

But some assholes say that I'm right...""

My unhealthy mindset is based on my father's demands, and they are disturbingly similar. Some say to silence the inner critic, but I feel like the times are so hard that it is needed to survive. Nevertheless, I suffer from Bipolar I disorder, and I'd have a mental breakdown if I get up to his standards, which the inner critic wants. But few say these unhealthy mindsets are somewhat right because too many millennials are receiving too much pleasure that they ain't strong enough to take the difficulties of life...

However,' I went through crap all my life. I don't want any more of this horseshit... :("
522,"Hello.
I started feeling extremely bad since last year, mostly depressed but sometimes there are neutral or full of energy and excitement days. I'm pretty sure I have bipolar disorder II. Especially when looking back to my life - it's not the first time I feel like that. Just this year things got worse.
I struggle with suicide thoughts all the time when I'm depressed.
I'm thinking of going to a psychiatrist to get a treatment. But some doubts and fears keep me from it. I read that the treatment can be long and not helpful, 
meds can be prescribed wrongfully, 
i can be diagnosed wrongly, 
side effects can be worse,
wrong meds can do things worse,
I may changed many doctors before I get any result.

Besides this kind of treatments is so expensive especially when you don't have insurance. So the picture i draw in my head is that I will be spending a fortune but will still suffer for years with the mood jumps, suicide thoughts and side effects and work or make my husband work just to afford not useful treatment.

Your advices or stories would help me i think. Thank you."
523,"Hi, I'm suffering from bipolar and dissociation disorder.  I just started Lamictal to hopefully treat these disorders.

I started taking Lamictal over 2 months ago. I went up 25mg/week increments and then finally 50mg/10 days to get to 400mg.  I was on 400mg for a few days when I had my check in with my psychiatrist.

I felt best at 250 mg and my psychiatrist told me to go down to 250 right away.  I'm 11 days into it and I don't feel the effects that I felt before on 250mg.  

It's honestly sort of devestating because I experienced significant relief at that dose and now I don't have it.  I hate this waiting game where you try different things to see what works.

Does anyone have any experience with this scenario?  Maybe since I jumped all the way from 400 to 250 my brain still has to calibrate itself to the lower dose?

Any advice or experience is appreciated.  :)"

530,"Day 9 of depression. How people do this months? I can't remember. Nine days has already been hell. Nowadays it hits so hard. 0-100 in matter of days. I keep writing here because this is one of my rare outlets. Don't worry, I don't need advice. I've been here before. 

I told my husband what's going on today. Actually I put it in one sentence while we were in a car together. I got no reply. Yeah he is not new to this. So I guess no questions needed. But I cried. Silently of course. In the car and in a grocery store. But who cares? He's probably worried about what's gonna happen to his barbeque party now. 

This is the worst time to get depressed. Both of my daughters' birthday are next month. So many parties to organize. We are having a party this weekend too. For a cat. Yes, really. The party will be perfectly executed and I will be beautiful hostess as ever. I mean, why not? Nobody cares anyway how I am really doing. In reality I lay all day on a couch planning how to harm myself if things get worse. Even my skin tone has changed. It looks dead because that's how I feel. 

I am waiting for this to last two weeks. I am counting minutes. Sometimes seconds. Depression has to last at least two weeks so it can be diagnosed. That's why I am counting minutes and seconds. In five days I can reach for help. I wonder if anybody's been to ETC after two weeks of depression. Yeah, didn't think so. Too bad because nothing else works for me. So I will be left with useless pills and therapeutic tasks (like planning daily routine). I give it two more weeks before the thing that always lead me to hospital happens. Summer's ruined.

535,Has anyone tried support groups in person ? How was the experience good/bad
536,"Hi everyone.

I've been episode free for about 3 months now, a really stable mood with my insight, sanity and intellect in tact. Which of course feels good - it's wishful thinking that I won't relapse ever again but here's to wishful thinking I guess. I've dedicated this awful lockdown to basically committing to my medication and have been teetotal for a solid year too which I think has helped.

However, OUTSIDE of major depressive or manic episodes, are any of you similar to me in the fact that you are basically crippled in anxiety? I'm relatively high functioning outside of episodes and most people would never know I have bipolar- of course when I'm unwell this is a completely different story and I am very low functioning and need a lot of support. 

It's just strange, I was wondering if anyone else is the same way? Even when my mood is stable I find there's a constant feeling of anxiety and it is something I'm struggling with. I'm wondering if I need anything else but I already take two medications (lithium + an antidepressant). Perhaps I have an anxiety disorder alongside bipolar - my PDOC agrees on probable OCD but she hasn't really offered much support with this.

Any advice or kind words would be appreciative."
537,"I am diagnosed with OCD. I have been attending therapy before, and it helped. I'm currently taking fluoxetine 20mg before sleep.

I usually sleep around 8 hours plus and feel rested, but after having breakfast and being awake for an hour or so, I start to feel sleepy.

Most days I have no mental energy or motivation to tackle anything, especially my hobbies / interests, unless I really force myself.

It feels like my mind is clouded, it's hard to focus and concentrate on anything for extensive period of time. My mind is always jumping around from one thing to another.

I often get really irritated by everything, mostly by people around me, even though they have't done anything bad.

And there are days when I wake up feeling energised and motivated. I can finish many tasks for that day and focus on studying, but that happens rarely.

From what you have read, does this seem more like Bipolar or ADD? Maybe even something else.

I can figure out why; I've been dealing with a lot of shit recently. Delusional mother who distrusts me, the heavy responsibility, the schoolwork, all that crap is fucking me up. A month ago, my mother went on a ranting binge every single day, and I had to take sole responsibility- family couldn't do shit. Although she recovered, classes are still tough because I couldn't understand Korean.

I have to do a lot of tests and shit and I have to do more assignments. It depresses me.

I'm 100% sure I'm burnt out. Even taking rest don't help- a few days don't do anything because my college pumps me too much assignments. I need a month off. But is it enough?"

It got so bland and boring I decided to throw caution to the wind because even a mood episode would be better than nothing.


my idea of attempting to trigger a hypomanic episode hasn’t really worked, I’ve had small periods of manic inspiration but I’m still super tired and have been sleeping regularly. I have felt my manic personality begin to shine through a little, but I’m able to keep it in control. Is it possible to just... keep living like this? Has anyone else figured out a way to keep some of their manic creativity without sacrificing their relationships and finances? I’d rather be slightly unstable than not be creative, even if that does mean depression sometimes. I’ve been really adamant about identifying the manic behavior like urges to text random people or make extravagant plans and haven’t been overspending at all, so I don’t see a danger to being this way."
541,"Hi all.

I'm wondering what experiences and affects people have noticed from drug use before, during and/or post diagnosis. 

I started smoking week on and off when I was 18 and in my early twenties went through a phase of a year or two smoking a lot and doing cocaine, and mushrooms once (as well as drinking heavily). I was just happy-go-lucky until I realized I was in too deep about 2 years ago and cleaned my act up. Pretty much since then and up until now my life was chaos. I always knew I had some mental health issues and was diagnosed with depression as a teenager. Upon reflection it seems the drug use contributed to bringing those issues to the surface after I'd stopped taking them.

I'm going through diagnosis at the moment, being treated for Bipolar and maybe a personality disorder. But I stopped taking meds and started smoking weed (not much) again recently. Since then, I've felt so much better. I don't get super stoned and it actually can help with productivity as it assists my focus, as if attaching a scope to a rifle to zone in on a target and ignore all the background noise.

There is a lot of stigma around hard drug use and rightly so. Cannabis is becoming much more popular and accepted by governments and society globally and there is a tremendous amount of information demonstrating the positives and the negatives (the former outweighs the latter in most learned people's opinions). 

Cannabis is far less harmful and potentially far more beneficial than alcohol in the short and long term in my opinion.

What are your opinions?"
542,"Everytime I am depressed I hate to talk to people. Also I'm convinced that nobody likes me and of being judged. That's why I'm also afraid of people and have social anxiety.
When I'm ""normal"" I'm not afraid at all. I like to talk to people a lot and I'm very outgoing.
It's like being two completely different persons.
Do any of you have the same thing like me?"
543,"I am not feeling good, have been having big ups and downs for as long as i can remember. I Have bipolar1 But this is different, i actually feel im losing my grip on reality.
I have been feeling agitated and bothered if strangers look at me and last night i sort of flipped out. I had shouted at a friend over things that have bothered me for years, then i couldnt find my handbag and went to talk to some police that were in the street and started telling them what brands makeup etc were in there. I had taken my flip flops
Off and threw them on the street as i felt so annoyed. I have been feeling it more and more lately. I tried to relax in bed a bit and kept seeing faces develop
In the curtains and i have been extremely paranoid about bugs being in walls. I bought lots of bug spray and used it all on the walls, I havent seen any but this has been my way of thinking. Im both sad, scared, paranoid, angry and unsure of whats real or not. I have never had this before. I dont know if anything i wrote makes sense just needed to get it out"
544,"Hi everyone,

I'm wondering if anyone who takes lamotrigine (Lamictal) has had any adverse effects from taking too high of a dose? When I originally started taking it, I was at 100mg and it made my depression better than when it was at rock bottom and evened out my mood swings, but I was still experiencing several days a month of difficult depression. Over the past year or so I've gone up to 200mg and added 2.5mg of Abilify, but I still get depression, especially with difficulty being interested in any activities or feeling the worth of life. I honestly didn't notice any depression improvement from increasing the lamotrigine from 100mg.

I'm still functional (getting minimum of work done, staying minimally connected to people, eating reasonably well) but just trying to figure out if there is a way I can enjoy my life, at least some of the time. (I know I may never experience months that are completely free of depression, but I think it can possibly get better than things are now.)

I'm in the process of reducing my lamotrigine to potentially transition to Zoloft (under a psychiatrist), and surprisingly, as soon as I lowered the dose of lamotrigine I started feeling much better, less zombie-ish. I'm wondering if it might be a sign that I was taking too much and maybe I don't need to switch meds after all. But maybe it's just temporary. I'm afraid of the side effects from Zoloft, so if I don't need to switch over, I might consider staying on lamotrigine. It's also possible I need to ditch the Abilify, even though I'm on a super low dose, and I added it after already having depression with lamotrigine.

Anyway, thanks for your thoughts."
545,My mom and I get jealous of people like friends and relatives. We both have bipolar. I dont know if that has anything to do with the Illness but I know it's a mood disorder and moods and emotions go up and down. I think weird social thoughts like everyone should be the same. Same income same living arrangement same relationships sometimes i think I'm a communist because I dont believe there should be an social or economic classes...we should all be the same.
546,"I'm abusing my medication since yesterday. Now i didi a lot one time.I'm in the minesotta program, but I can't tell my consoller because I bought the medecin to last a year!!!☹I should stop but iit feels good!"
547,"I've started snorting pregabalin 100 mg six times during the day. I feel absolutely controlled, dough obviously heavely druged. I take also oraly diazepam, aripiprazol and quetiapine. It feels great, i'm in an elevated mood, whitout mood and pesonality swings, but i'm afraid of the consequences. Has anyone pased through a similar situation?"
548,"Dear all,

I am wondering is it at all possible to request a medication change in between appointments with a psychiatrist. I am currently seeing my pdoc once every 2 months via NHS. But lately I've been feeling myself slip back into the depression. I read on the NHS website that you may request your GP to adjust your med doses. Is this true and if so how to go about this? Also would it be possible to change your meds completely via GP or not?"
549,"Dear all,

A few months ago I was diagnosed with rapid cycling bipolar with some psychotic/paranoid features. I was stabilised with Lamictal 200mg and Aripiprazole 5mg. This combo has been worked great although I still did not feel my usual self. That is until a couple weeks back, when I've been feeling like I'm slipping back into the depression. I've been feeling more withdrawn around friends and lacking in motivation for self care.

I'm considering asking my pdoc to switching me to fluoxetine (Prozac) for the depression and pushing the aripiprazole to 10mg. I've heard some mixed things about antidepressants for Bipolar disorder, with some saying it can trigger mania or rapid cycling and others saying how helpful it is for the depression. I'm not willing to change the antipsychotic to olanzapine or anything else, due to weight gain side and sedation side effects.

Anyone have any experiences they can share about antidepressants or switching mood stabilisers in general would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks in advance

550,"We met 1.5 years ago and practically moved in together straight away. (Sarah was, manic) she stopped her medication about a year previous
She is going through a bitter divorce which I know about. The thing I did not know about was ""BIPOLAR"" until 6 months later when symptoms of her moods were becoming a problem - she handed me a hospital letter revealing she had Bipolar.

I began studying the condition and loved her enough to continue with our relationship.

Her first hospital admission was in intensive care due to psychosis and depression (she self harms when poorly) but it was the right place to get her back on the right medication.
I visited every day when she was in the Hospital.
With three hospitalizations over a period of 7 months, she was finally home with the medication stabilizing. 

The support Sarah was given from her medication, consultants, readmissions and the love and stable home was NEVER a problem as I love her - and she loves me too... Sarah can forget her appointments and medication...

Now,

Three months ago I was made redundant (I'm 55), I thought I would find a job - max 3 weeks!! no such luck.
My hour of need! a little support over this stressful time - work, money, love and some reassurance?

Sarah has decided she will be moving out next week and rented a flat while her divorce goes through. She feels it will make for a stronger case while it is still in progress.
She does not see I had to cancel our holiday - cancel a new motorbike - now replace the furniture she is taking - losing the moral support (my turn) - lose the little contribution she made toward housekeeping. 

When I questioned her about her timing she did not recognize my concerns (one bit), in fact, she blames me,  Sarah does not drive.

Her new place is a round trip of 30-miles and she expects me to travel to see her. £10 each trip - my job seekers is £72/week - her word was; ""you would if you love someone"" 

I feel a little hurt and letdown, her inability to see it from my point of view.
What are your feelings - is it just about another Bipolar relationship breakdown?"
551,"I'm curious, who here has an overactive internal voice as part of their problem, particularly in down cycles?

By over-active internal voice.. I mean an internal dialog of our voice which just never stops talking. Always yammering and commenting on every thing, feeling, thought. 

------

I had an incessantly overactive internal voice until my late 30s, and I didn't even realize it, or realize this was different than what other people experience. Once I realized this was an issue, I put effort into reading about meditation and learning to fix it, and while it took some time... I eventually came to see that voice inside our heads is not the same thing as ""us"", and I was able to learn to quiet it when I want to. At least for 30-90 seconds, which is quite a long time of mental peace. 

It doesn't fix bipolar swings, as it doesn't change feeling like I'm made of limitless energy or a sack-of-mud.. but I do find it very helpful to be able to have a switch to turn off the incessant chattering, because then the feelings can't drive thoughts. 

The books that I feel were most helpful were...

""Waking the Tiger - Healing Trauma"" by Peter Levina

""Deep Meditation - Pathway to Personal Freedom"" by Yogani (on mantra meditation)

""The Mind Illuminated: A Complete Meditation Guide Integrating Buddhist Wisdom and Brain Science for Greater Mindfulness"" by John Yates, PhD (on controlling the mind)

----

I'm curious what other peoples experiences are with overactive internal voice (or not), and shutting it down (or not)."
552,"Hi guys! 
My counsellor and I think that I may be Bipolar 2
I am scared to get a formal diagnosis because I’m dealing with a host of other mental health issues. I don’t know how I would handle the burden of another diagnosis. I do display symptoms of Bipolar 2 ... I know I have mania, maybe hypomania. I’m not sure what to do. Could anyone give me any advice? Thank you in advance."
553,"Meditation has been the most important tool in my ongoing recovery of Bipolar 1.  It is very easy to get started meditating.  All you have to do is sit still, close your eyes, Breathe in and out deeply and slowly, and put on music 

Thats it!  I promise if you do this for 15 minutes a day you will feel results very quickly.  Enjoy!"
554,"I am a 32 year old male and I have a professional career making a good living. I joined this forum because between the Ages of 29-31 I had four or five episodes of mania with psychosis ( 3 requiring hospital stays) with delusions and hyper religiosity. I was diagnosed as bipolar 1 but I have never had a depressive episode in my life. I have never been depressed, but I have been anxious in times of great stress in college but I do not have anxiety at all. I don’t do any drugs or drink alcohol. The episodes all happened in the summer months and lasted weeks. During those times I was extremely euphoric and I would not sleep or be tired. I also would eat infrequently or not at all. The psychosis was coupled with delusions or grandiose thinking. Primarily being a prophet of God and such. Also I would see patterns in things that had no pattern such as a commercial coming on the tv answering a question that I was thinking at the time and that was just one time. Paranoia was for the most part absent except for the first manic episode where there was a bit for 2-3 days. The psychosis has happened all of a sudden before. It also has been a gradual escalation over a week. The manic episodes last for 1-4 weeks. The only thing that bothers me is that my diagnosis does not fit because of the lack of depression stages. I found out that there is something called unipolar manic which makes more sense. I also read that unipolar mania does not respond to lithium. The doctors attempted to use lithium but mine didn’t respond. Does anyone have similar experience to this? Mania without depression? I have not had an episode in a year and I feel Normal now, but sometime mania comes out of nowhere for me. The mania does feel awesome but it sure is a burden with my career and being hospitalized. Thanks in advance!"
555,"Dear all,
Recently I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder (Rapid Cycling) with some psychotic features. I was put on Lamictal 200mg and Abilify 5mg, and I am now feeling a lot better. A number of years ago now, I was also diagnosed with ADHD and put on Ritalin (Methyphenidate). I was on it almost every single day for 2 years, bar holidays, weekend etc. I weaned off it by the time I entered university last year, as I no longer needed it daily and only used it on an as needed basis.

It was about half-way through my first year of university that I started to experience the first signs of my Bipolar illness. I managed to get through it, but then took an academic leave for a year, as I became manic. It took me several months for me to accept my diagnosis and get help, but I'm very glad I did. My current medication (Lamictal and Abilify) have saved my life and I am very thankful. But I have been expeirencing the side effects of the Abilify, as my concentration and motivation has become poor and I often can't express my thoughts in words clear (I experience a type of brain fog).

In summary, the medication is really helping with the bipolar, but it is making my attention problems a lot worse. I tried taking my Ritalin on 1-2 occasions, and it still works, but my psychiatrist believes, and I agree with him, that it can make psychoses worse. So I am looking for an alternative strategy to deal with this problem. I really want to get back to my studies, but I find it very hard to concentrate and motivate myself to do daily tasks these day, I struggle to even write emails or have long conversations with people.

Cardio exercise usually helps me, but I can't to that now as all the gyms are closed and I am too overweight to run outside. I heard some good things about Guanfacine and Wellbutrin for ADHD comorbid with Bipolar. Any experience or advise would be very welcome.

P.S. I have only been on the Abilify for 5 weeks, will these side effects go away??

Best wishes,
H"
556,"My intro post has some background.

https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/45-y-o-bipolar-high-function-but-a-constant-struggle.292650/

I was doing pretty well the last few years. Then COVID hit. I spent February obsessively building mathematical models, as i realized how big s problem covid would be. I slept 3 hrs a night, and lost 30 lbs in 3 weeks.

It started as a hypomania, on the phone at all hours trying to find people to do something about covid, or at least people who could see it was a big problem. 

I do think i did some good, inspiring and donating money to some smart folks working on the problem. But the longer it went on, the more sucked in i got.. and the more days of no sleep, the more manic i became. 

Having breakfast with my kids when they woke at 6:30 because i was still up from the night before felt good, but was not normal.

I stressed out my wife, and some of my friends, and caused lots of fights.. and while the content of my covid analysis has turned out correct enough they are now trusting my analysis, bringing it to them with a mania filled zealousness and aggressiveness was not helpful or useful. 

I was also crying, with sadness about all the negstive effects covid would bring.. and while i think that sadness came because i have a big heart and i really care about the struggle the world is dealing with.. the mania made it into an all hours of the day obsession of research, howling sadness, and odd-hours sleeping that my kids and wife did not deserve in the midst ofndealing with their own struggles to process it all.

I also worked myself up into thinking danger was eminent.. and had fights with my wife trying to get us to leave our house to go somewhere safer, because i felt civil unrest was a likly future outcome. (I was pretty off about the urgency of this. Still unclear how bad this could become in the future)

At the height of the mania, i was starting to have extreme thoughts,  putting too much credibility in alternate views of reality..  feeling like we were living in the truman show and someone upstairs wanted it more interesting. Or that the singularity was here, and the ai created the virus to wipe us out (or insert us,). Or that i was seeing the data and the danger because i had some special role to play. It's strange to explain this.. because i'm not the only one who was considering alternate meta-physical possibilities (press published many such articles), and i wasn't letting my thoughts make committed actions. But there were many moments where i ""felt"" many of these surreal explanations to be more real that the grounded-reality explanation that there is a random unlucky terrible pandemic virus ravaging the planet, and that was an obvious product of the mania.

When the usa sheltered, i cried relief and finally slept.. not because its a perfect answer (there isnt one), but because i felt relieved that at least leaders were finally taking it somewhat seriously. I could finally calm down enough to see i wasn't sleeping, and took some klonszapam to encourage more sleep.

Several days later, i almost regretted getting all that sleep, as it brought the down cycle of sleeping in, not wanting to do anything, procrastinating, and getting sucked back into my videogame addiction stress coping.

A couple weeks later, i had a two week hypomanic productivity cycle when i felt like i had shed the unrealistic mania and was primed to really get some stuff done. I spun up contractors on three software projects, and did a bunch of coding on one of them myself. Then i slid again and started sleeping 9+ hrs a night and getting nothing done.

Now i'm at a midpoint, trying to stay ontop of the planning to keep my contractors making progress on the 3 software projects... While at the same time feeling anxiety and depression over managing my finances... 

I have a sizable investment portfolio, and i felt good in Feb, having exited the market before the big crash that followed, but now the fed money printing had created the bizarre situation where the market is soaring while unemployment is rising, and the government published the first ever flawed jobs report. Am i right to think we could have another big crash? Or did my mania make me overreact and get out of the market right as inflation is sending it soaring, losing out of the gains?

I really don't need this stress right now. It's making me feel terrible, like im screwing up managing my family's financial future.

For now im keeping it together.. but i can feel that piece inside of me that is starting to try and keep me in bed in the morning, shutting my mind off. And then i find some inspiration to talk about it, and I'm on here at 4:51am writing two massive posts on my mobile phone.

I really hate bipolar. I don't want these up and down cycles. I want to have a normal level of concern about what is happening, like everyone else."
557,"Hi. I'm new here and this is my first thread, I apologize if it shouldn't be here but this seemed the most correct place. For a number of reasons I believe that my diagnosis of depression and anxiety is a gross oversimplification of my problems, and my medication is not helping me maintain control like it seemed to when I first started it, which may or may not have been partially placebo and the relief I felt from having a caring voice talk to me about some of my problems for the first time. I'm thirty and just sought help for the first time a couple of years ago, but I wasn't completely honest. I didn't lie about everything, but I did lie by omission about my rage, my intrusive thoughts, how much I've thought about suicide over the years, and the like. I've read about bipolar before and it seems like I have it, but I'm terrified to open up completely and get a true diagnosis. I'm terrified of being involuntarily institutionalized on top of the crippling social fear, and have a lot of fears related to anything that involved being involuntarily restrained somewhere. I can't help but think ""if they know the truth, they'll hate me"" about everyone, including my medication doctor. Today I may be losing my girlfriend of many years who I love more than anything in the world because of my outbursts. I don't know why I can't control myself. I don't know why I do things I have no conscious desire to do, like break objects in my house in a rage. These problems all go back many years, but things have come to a head recently with what's been going on in the world and problems in my own life. I feel like I've been on a downward spiral for over a year. I don't even know what I'm asking of whoever is reading this, but I need some kind of input from somewhere, though even without my real name or face being tied to this statement I am still terrified to tell the whole truth. Thank you for your time."
558,"Hi,
I want to share a very personal story, just to read what you think.
I fell in love with two of my foster kids, I was thinking about adopting them when depression hit me out of nowhere. It hit so hard I was laying in bed, crying all day. It was bad. Three days later the kids told me they wanted to go back to the orphanage. It broke me even more. Am I not cut out to be a mom? I don’t want anyone to suffer like I do. I don’t want anyone to go through what I go through. These kids would rather go back to the orphanage than being with my depressive ass. I don’t know what to do anymore. Maybe they are better off without me. Maybe everyone is."

560,"This damn thing is becoming such an enormous problem. It started about 6 years ago, so well before medication that I'm on now, so I know it's not that. I never used to have problems with iritability at all and then it started. First it came in one big wave, looking back I see that as an episode whilst in a hypo that was building and building until eventually I broke and ended up in a massive depression. I didn't have a problem with it for a few months whilst depressed, then the depression subsided and it came back again, only milder, but it brought with it a minor bout that put an end to a relationship I had at the time. Since then it feels like it has been happening fairly regularly. It was fairly spaced out at first but becoming more and more frequent. I'm now finding myself iritable on a very regular basis, despite my mood being much better aside from this. The problem is that when I'm like this I don't want to be anywhere near anyone. I pretty much hate the entire human race and see errors, mistakes, lies, deceit, injustice etc., pretty much everywhere. Anything in the news can really get to me nowadays and it never used to bother me at all. Now it feels like I see through it all, I see the agenda and the use of propaganda; the way things are worded or presented (this is partly due to what I've studied previously, but again, it never used to cause any issues). Is this getting close to delusional thinking? Am I already there? Am I taking off the sunglasses and seeing things for what they actually are? Is my brain driving all of this? Am I going downhill and I'm not realizing it? (which tends to be the pattern historically, although not in this way). On one hand I feel I'm doing really good, but on the other I feel like something very bad is going to come of this - it's taking over.

I have PRNs to take but the weird thing is that most times I don't even think about them, I just completely forget that I have them and I leave myself stewing over everything, winding myself up and falling out with the world instead. Where do I go from here?"
561,"If my anxieties,mood disorders ,depression,bipolar are bad I still love and care about each and everyone  of you,I do feel someone depressed.sorry about this gassy to i have gerd,too,you mean a lot to me.I know you dont know me but so what  I want to help all of you if I can,Helping others is my passion,oh ya this virus thing is so upsetting too,WHen i see people hugging each other and not wearing masks or gloves it  makes me mad.Others feel the same way.I even wear a mask when i sit outside .I am so scared.I dont go out anywhere well part of that is because of my agoraphobia. I saw a anchorman on tv the other night at a protest he turned around shook hands with this guy even hugged him that was a really stupid thing to do .Even one of the other news casters asked him if he was alight,he was,What is wrong with people dont they seem to realize that this virus is still around? well god be with you all and stay safe."
562,"Hi! I'm asking in the bipolar forum, even though I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, because my doctor wants to change my medication from lamotrigine to lithium. I know it's a medication taken mostly by bipolar people so maybe I'll find more information here. 

I've been in lamotrigine for some years now and it helped a lot with my depressions. But I still feel anxiety all the time and it makes it difficult to me to have a fulfilling life. Is anxiety considered mania? Does lithium help with it? I read it's taken mostly for control the maniac side of the condition, not for the depressive side, is that so? And does it make you gain lot of weight? And finally, do you have to give up alcohol when taking lithium? Most of my social interactions involve alcohol and I'm afraid I'll have to change my lifestyle. 

Thanks ahead for sharing experiences!"
563,"I don’t know what is wrong with me other than I know I have bipolar 1. I go from up
And down moods. Having a extremely low self esteem to sometimes mild.

I also lose interest in things that I liked before and have to avoid certain things.

I get times where I am so scared and paranoid. That I can’t watch certain things/listen to certain music Or wayxh I get easily triggered by small things 

I feel that I never know what to expect. I get highly overly sensitive to loud noise or tone of voice that might make me seem someone is mad at me.
It is more depression than mania.
I don’t know if this is common for bipolar or not.
I feel like I lose my mind. I get so lost in my mind that I can’t focus on reality sometimes.

There is a lot of fear and paranoia. Also questioning my existence and thinking weird things.
Feeling so sad that life is just sad and tragic.
But sometimes I feel positive and that life can be peaceful.
It’s just that out of nowhere this can all change and it scares me.

I don’t know if this is changing personality or moods.

Feeling unstable and not able to function normally. Feeling out of place around people and feeling like a robot or unnatural."
564,"Hi. I'm not sufferin of bipolar disorder. But  got a question... Is a mania when I find a work  to do(a university work, an idea..etc).. I becomes so so so obsesive with that."
565,"So I’m on 1200 mg of lithium and 40 mg of Latuda. I also take like 300mg of Venlafaxine.

Anyone here familiar enough with medicines to know if that sounds right? I guess you have to trust your doctor but even with all this I still feel like shit over half the time. Well, anyway just throwing it out there. Thanks!"
566,"Hey guys, I need some advice and maybe some reassurance on something.
My bipolar partner and I have been dating for about 2 months. She's been in a depressive episode for about a month and a half now and some days it seemed like she was feeling better, but about a week ago her depressive episode has hit an absolute low. She went from being very happy about the birthday present I made her and saying how much she loves me the one day to the next day barely keeping in touch with me, being unable to show any affection and only replying to very few of my messages, sometimes not even replying until the next day. This has been going on for more than a week now.

I already told her she shouldn't beat herself up over it and that I know that she is going through a difficult time right now and that I still love her even if she can't show me the same love at the moment. I also make sure to let her know at least once a day that I love her, but I'm worried if this may make it worse. I already asked her if she preferred I rather not show that much affection at the moment to which she replied that she doesn't know.

I love her with all my heart and want to support her the best I can, but it is really difficult to tell if I'm doing the right thing, especially now that having conversations with her is almost impossible due to her not being able to reply most of the time.

Do any of you have any experience with having the problems my partner experiences at the moment and if so, do you have any advice on how to best be supportive as a loved one? Also, are these kinds of depressive lows usual or is this more of a rare occurence? I just want to be prepared for the next time this happens."
567,I have bipolar 2 and I’m so over these suicidal thoughts. Is the only way to be rid of them to carry them to fruition? I have fought for so long and so hard. I don’t want to lose this battle but I am. A shitload of medicine and three therapists over the last 5 years and here I am. I don’t mean to complain or whine or whatever but I do feel powerless and that’s a scary feeling when your life is at stake. I’m not sure what I’m going to do or when I’ll do it but I know it’s coming down to crunch time. Any words of wisdom out there?
568,I suffer with bipolar and I'm having a really down day I dont know how I'm going to make it through the day and I've been drinking more alcohol lately

570,"I entered a poetry contest that one of our local libraries had. I submitted my entry back in March and now they're supposed to announce the winners this Friday on a Zoom meeting. However, it appears that someone replied to the official library email announcing the Friday night Zoom ceremony with the names of the three winners. My name wasn't among them so I'm sort of bummed right now. 

It doesn't really matter that much that the person accidentally gave away the names of the winners. I'd be just as bummed Friday as I am now. It doesn't make any difference when I hear about it. My heart would still be on the floor.

I was pretty excited about my entry and thought I might have a chance to place somewhere in the contest. I've never placed in a poetry contest before, although I've never entered but a couple. It's difficult to shake the feeling of disappointment. I feel crushed. Poetry is maybe the only creative thing I'm halfway OK at. I don't really have any other talents to speak of. And I've always had this weird driving desire to amount to something in life, to make a name for myself in something, anything (as long as it's something good). 

But I'm 53 and haven't achieved anything noteworthy in my life. I feel like the biggest loser. I have no children. Heck, I've never even had a relationship with a female--even though I've always been a sucker for pretty women. But I've always been very shy and withdrawn. I was the weird kid with the weird nervous habits in school growing up, never having many friends. I've had acne all my life, picked my nose and skin. I have sleep apnea. And when I was 25 years old I was diagnosed with mental illness. 

But I guess I'm enjoying my life lately since I've been on disability. I worked for 30 years going through absolute hell in the work world, going from job to job. Most of my employers were temp agencies.

Now I sort of consider myself early retired. Hell is over...I hope. But I've always wanted to amount to something. Life has been nothing but broken dreams. I used to believe in rags to riches stories. I used to believe that the poor poster children of recessive genetics would turn around and win in the end or something. I used to believe the ugly duckling would turn into a swan, the frog into a prince or that something good would come out of all the muck. But muck is muck, you can't make a diamond out of a lump of poop and fairy tales are lies just to keep the losing suckers going in life.

But I still cling to hope. 

Just bummed right now."

Then if this works well they are going to put me monthly maybe they will up the dose to 600mg if they do that. Any information would be helpful. Thanks guys, big love."

I had planned something this week but when something unrailed them and it didn't happen that made me feel bad, especially when I was looking forward to it.

When I get low like this I like to spend money to make myself feel better. I get a nice feeling shopping online and buying a lot of nice and cool stuff. And I feel good when it arrives too. But I buy it expecting it will take away my sad feelings and when they don't I get frustrated and angry at myself for having bought stuff I'm lucky enough to afford but I'm still feeling sad. That can usually lead me into looking for something more to buy just so I can feel a little uplift again.

I had a fight with my friend yesterday too when she said that because I'm a boy I have an easier life than her and any other girl, purely because I'm a boy. That made me angry.

I'm not really sure what to do to feel happy anymore. It's hard when I get into a mood where everything that usually makes me feel good doesn't work. I like writing books and songs but when I feel this way they are never as good as I want them to be, so it becomes a negative. Everything becomes a negative"
575,"Hello

I am bipolar 1.

Recently friends and family have been acting strange around me. I lived a terrible lifestyle un medicated for the last few year. Refusing help and drinking, drugs and womanizing.

The last three month I have been On mirtazepine then on to Olanzipine.

I came clean with my issues and tried to get therapy and medication, but with covid it's been limited.

Anyway I'm clean and sober and taking my meds. But people have been acting quite harsh to me.

My partner found out some how about my womanizing, but instead of asking directly she just hints with the women's names. Now she is quoting me from private calls I have had. When I pull her up she just says it's all in my head. I have asked if she wants to end it, but point blank refuses to address it. ""Its all in your head""

Now I had a SIM card for a new phone, but it's dissaprared. ""Must of got lost"" also today my medication is missing, it's quite a bit wrapped but it's gone.

I had a suicide attempt last year and a few weeks ago, I ran out the house suicidal after a bad dream with the intention to end my own life. It all blew over and I have been trying to hold my chin up. By she has mentioned suicide, even put an implement for harm in a bed next to me and played a song off her phone quickly, the song had mentions of losing your mind.

Am I just joining dots that arnt there or is there something.

I know it might be a weak explanation, but she's never been like this before.

Thanks In advance"
576,"Why do I get the blame for my episodes when my friends with other issues get let off the hook because of their disorder. I am totally alone, I doth want to see my only friend because its become clear that she doesn't get it and doesn't even want to try to. im so sick and tired of apologising and being alone when others rush to people with anxiety or depression to help and comfort. I feel so low about myself, I feel like a monster and I don't want to see anybody ever again. the only people in my life look at me like im crazy when I ""inexplicably"" explode or have an episode. I just want to be normal or to even just have depression or anxiety or something else anything else"
577,"Hi, so i havent really been that good on lamictal, doesnt help that much. My pychiatrist wants me to come off lamictal now and start on lithium. Im also on cipralex. Does anyone have any experience of changing mood stabilizers and if lithium will be a better option?"
578,"I'm bipolar 2.
My meds don't work as good as they should. Most of the time I'm depressed. Not as depressed as I would be without meds, but still depressed. It's hard for me to concentrate and to remember things. Sometimes I would like to be in my bed doing nothing at all. Sometimes I feel very anxious and nervous. There are good days too, in which I feel happy and normal, but they are rare. 
I tried so many antidepressants and antipsychotics in the last years.
I will try to convince my psychiatrist to set me on lithium. I desperately hope this works better than lamictal. Otherwhise my hope will be totally vanished..."
579,"I often feel tremendous guilt at my past actions or episodes, however I feel like the people around me never feel guilt or apologise for their triggering actions. This makes me feel very alone and hateful towards people as I feel I am constantly apologising for behaviours which are hard for me to control but the people who trigger them (even when told they are aware or were made aware while doing it) don't apologise and act as though im just the way I am to hurt people. I often feel as though im pushed into my depressive and aggressive episodes unlike mania which I feel occurs more naturally. has anyone had a similar experience?"
580,Im not sure where else to turn. I know something else is wrong or that I may have been misdiagnosed or there maybe be something else going on as well. ive experienced full blown conversations with people close to me that never happened (these are real people in my life that I questioned about these conversations and they actually didn't happen). Then there was a full blown vivid conversation with people ive never met. it doesn't happen often but im just wondering where It might be coming from
581,"When I’m hypomanic, I am so so mean to my boyfriend over nothing.  He tries to warn me before he talks that he isn’t trying to start a fight, he reminds me he is on my side, he asks how he can help....but none of that seems to help me de-escalate.  My irrational anger happens so fast it is like a reflex.  I seem to be incapable of processing before becoming outraged.  He is to the point that he just avoids me for a week because he doesn’t want to fight.  Of course this makes me feel alone and abandoned and hurt.  Sometimes it makes me plummet into depression.  I don’t know how to fix this.  I think he is at a loss as well.  I just know we can’t keep going like this without eventually ruining the relationship.  I’m desperate for advice....has anyone else had this issue? How did you solve it? How did you learn to cope?"
582,"So im a second generation bipolar and I feel as though my dad (also bipolar) is the only person on earth who understands me and doesn't guilt trip me for my episodes. I recently lashed out at my only two friends in the whole world as they were overwhelming me and we were in a situation which could have led to serious consequences. I had tried to signal to them that I just wanted them to stop loudly talking at me and had said early in the day (after I snapped at them but less severely) that I really couldn't deal with being wound up. one of these two was my best friend of years and she just shouted at me after I snapped and shouted for them to be quiet and also said some not nicely worded things about the fact our families are in drastically different financial situations so a fine from police would be very bad for me (we were trying to avoid police attention which is why I wanted quiet and because I was getting overwhelmed) and then I drove them home and the whole way my best mate was yelling in the car that I use her as a punching bag. I don't feel like I do as before I came home from uni I hadn't spoken to her in at least 3 months, this is one of two times that ive snapped at her and I feel like she overreacted (I know this is pretty ironic coming from me) and I tried to apologise but I just kept getting a lecture. They have made me feel as though im dangerous and should never be around other people again, and frankly I don't plan on ever going out with people again since im clearly too unstable (In their eyes) to be understood. I feel like I constantly adapting myself to consider others mental health but I feel like people act like im too unwell or crazy(I hate being called this) for their adjustments to help/ they are unwilling to adjust to help me. I would like to know that other bipolar people have experienced something similar and any tips would be appreciated :)"
583,"There have been many times in which I’ve lacked empathy for others. As a matter of fact, in in many instances I enjoy watching others be in pain or feeling miserable. “Welcome to my world,” I often think.

I can feel empathy but it depends on the person. And there aren’t really many people who I have empathy for. At school I’ve already been the subject of rejection on account of being mentally ill. When I see my stunners saddened, I could are less. I enjoy them being in pain. 

If they hate me over something that I was born with, then why should I empathize with them?"

589,"Hi guys,

Its been nearly 3 months since my bipolar diagnosis and I am happy to say that I am doing much better now. After a year of struggling with my mental health, which resulted in me dropping out of university and living as an unemployed semi-recluse, I have finally begun treatment and I'm doing much better now. My bipolar meds have really been a game changer and I'm very grateful to my psychiatrist and my family for all the support they have given me. I'm currently on Lamictal 200mg and abilify 5mg.

Although my meds have really stabilised me, they are not without their side effects. The lamictal has really helped stabilise my moods, but sometimes I feel a little emotionally numb from it. Likewise, the abilify has stabilised my hypomanic spikes and quelled the psychotic symptoms. However, it does sometimes make me mildly sedated and dulled down mentally. But the worst thing by far is that it makes me loose motivation and focus. I've always struggled with this because I also have ADHD. Previously I used to take ritalin but I cant now because my psychiatrist warned me it might exacerbate the bipolar, particularly the psychotic features. Changing the abilify to something else might not be a good option either as other APs are even more sedating and dulling. Don’t get me wrong, I like my meds and they have by far the least side effects of all Bipolar meds according to reasearch.
(EDIT: Ive only been on the abilify for 2/3 weeks, any chance SEs will go away?)

TL;DR: Anyone with experience with Lamictal and Abilify or simlars MSs and APs have any tips on managing these side effects ?

Thanks in advance

I wonder if you have ideas about coping with weight gain from taking the meds. Yes I've just had a baby, but my mood stabilizers and antidepressant have caused me to put weight on.

Has anyone been successful?"
592,"I hate therapists. Most of them are terrible. My first therapist hardly let me talk. My second therapist told me I was hopeless. My third therapist actually helped me. My fourth therapist illegally broke my confidentiality. My fifth therapist lied to me. My sixth therapist was racist. My seventh therapist lied to me. My eighth therapist helped me. My ninth therapist helped me. My tenth therapist never had appointments available. My eleventh therapist rejected me. 
I don't want to go to therapy anymore. 

I hate psychiatrists. My first psychiatrist misdiagnosed me, and put me on a medication that likely caused years of psychosis. My second psychiatrist doesn't have enough time for me to make educated decisions about my medications, one of which landed me in the hospital. My hospital psychiatrist didn't look at my medical record and wasted my time with meds that didn't work.
I don't want to take meds anymore. 

I hate life. Its full of pain and suffering and hopelessness. Its full of people that are supposed to love you but actually don't. It's lonely and traumatic and hateful. It's run by money and greed and violence. 
I don't want to live anymore.

594,"Decided to start a new thread after all. I can't pull this through alone and I have absolutely no one I could talk to.

So I relapsed yesterday after six months. My husband got really angry with me and accused me of many things, many of them justified. This led to horrible anxiety, guilt and unbearable feelings and to cope I self-harmed. I didn't get BPD diagnose but I do have these traits.

So I harmed myself and then I did it again because first time wasn't enough. Today's been hard too waiting for a forgiveness so I did it again. Now it's just about hurting myself rather than relief. I should know better, I get easily addicted.

I guess I am looking for some supporting words I can do without harming myself before my next video appointment with my cpn on Thursday. 

Anyone else do this or can relate?"
595,"In the example below, I am demonstrating how computing concepts can be used to simplify a lot of data in the Psychiatric industry. The below table was generated after cross referencing data from different Symptomatic and Diagnostic data inside and outside of the Psychiatry industry. I was able to simplify, group and arrange some of the over-complication.

First photo shows the form before selecting Auditory Hallucination:



Second photo shows what happens after I select Auditory Hallucination:



I gathered from this (opinion) that what is happening in diseases such as Bipolar and Schizophrenia are that they are simply manifestations of injuries into different human sensory systems due to different causes. I concluded this to be the case by using ""Auditory Hallucination"" as an example. As you can see ""Auditory Hallucination"" triggers many diagnoses in and outside of Psychiatry. The same thing happens with mania. It would be beneficial to consider a holistic approach with treatment which is evidenced by the fact that both sleep hyigene and gut health both benefit conditions such as Bipolar and Schizophrenia.

The basic point i'm trying to get across is that by simplifying things treatment can become easier and clearer."
596,"I'm not saying any of this is fact. It is something that I have observed quite consistently in my life and would appreciate feedback. I am starting to feel that mania and hypomania are simply another two mechanisms of human self-purification or excretion. Just as you go to the toilet, blow your nose, snip your nails etc. But mania in particular is more involuntary. I have however noticed that if you were to draw the activity of other excretions on one line and compare mania on another paralell to it, they would follow mania quite consistently or with not much difference. To be exact I'm speaking more about involuntary excretions.

As an example consider a toxic excretion in you that needs to come out but isn't. Let's say for example built up urine. It is like it becomes toxic when you can't relieve yourself and you perceive that pain. If you don't relieve yourself it is highly likely you will wet your pants. So it is akin to mania as they both have an build up and release of toxicity.

Both toxicities follow a process of initiation, build up and release. As the releases happen a type of relief or bliss is felt. So on a line graph maybe quite similar. The cause however of both issues are different though.

I just found it interesting that mania has it's causes and that should be researched a bit more because if that's the case then it can be treated if those causes are looked into. I know that stress is one. Sleep related issues. I just find mania to be a normal reaction when certain unfortunate conditions are met which is why it can happen from various causes even outside of psychiatry.

If you find mania debilitating I would look into every aspect of your life that may be contributing to things like stress and poor health and generally anything negative and harmful.

Once the causes are treated it may free you from a lot of suffering. Giving attention to the cause may stop the manic toxic excretion.

I think external influences can contribute to the release but the release itself has a connection to your internal systems so I wouldn't be suprised if manic activity can be detected on some type of scan."

598,"Hello, I have been diagnosed with different things in the past and have been trying to make a bit more sense of what is going on.

Basically if a person takes something like an over the counter allergy medication and becomes very manic and excited over it, does that qualify as a real manic episode? It can take something as simple as a bite of candy to send me into talkativeness, agitation and sometimes overwhelming anger attacks, for example. I do try very hard to be careful what I eat, btw, but can't always manage to predict what might trigger what. 

Is it a manic episode only if there is no cause to it and it comes out of the blue? What about if it is not a chemical thing but a spiritual practice that causes elation lasting for several days with little need for sleep, would that be a manic episode? Does it have to last for more than 4 days? What if it's 3 days of total restlessness, chatting a lot, and elation followed by fatigue for like 4 or 5 days?"
599,"Hello, I am wondering if anyone here has a lot of trouble sleeping for about5 or 6 days before your period? I can barely sleep for about a week before my period, and am lucky if I can get even 4 or 5 hours of sleep, and this is with sedating medications which normally knock me out the rest of the time. 

It is not PMS, as I do not get depressed before my period. It is more like a huge increase of energy and sometimes causes rage days too, if I don't monitor it. I actually kind of like it a bit."
600,"Hi all

Posting in this forum as I have Bipolar Disorder.

I hope you are all doing as well as possible.

A combination of my mood episodes over the last few years and the current climate of Covid-19 has essentially left me a shell of who I used to be. Lithium is working very effectively for me with mood symptoms (no emotional blunting too which I feared)

However although my mood is stable and far from extremes I am constantly battling anxiety - it’s pervasive almost all the time. My psychiatrist doesn’t think I’m comorbid with Generalised Anxiety Disorder as anxiety is a common feature of bipolar related illnesses (the jury is out on that one for me) and has recently prescribed diazepam to take for a couple of weeks to help calm my nerves (it has helped - I was having constant panic attacks) but I’m aware this is a short term fix and want to look at ways to improve these symptoms as I’m also developing agoraphobia and want confidence I’ll be able to enter the world and function in society when the world resumes.

I’m anxious about everything but mostly about what I’ll do when the medication runs out - go back to panic attacks and being afraid? I was having 2 attacks a day (sometimes blacking out entirely) and was left exhausted and physically in pain afterwards.

Does anybody have any advice on how I could speak to my psychiatrist to explore options moving forward? I tried Buispirone but it made me feel like I was going to faint so I had to stop taking it.

It’s just frustrating, depression and mania disappear and are simply replaced by panic and anxiety. I know it’s difficult but Bipolar has cost me everything - my job, friendships, the person I thought I was and although I am confident Lithium is working for those particular symptoms, there is now a completely different set of issues for me to battle with and try to make sense of. I’ve lost the core of who I was to depression and mania and now whatever is left I’m losing to anxiety.

I’m sure many of you will understand and I really do appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this and respond."

605,"so, here’s what happened yesterday ... my son 28 has been prescribed adderall and dextroamphetomine when he was in college to help him focus ... everything seemed to be going along fine, he still continued taking these after college and it helped him at his job. But, he had built up a tolerance and so had been taking more than he should have per day.
So, yesterday was reckoning day... he hadn’t slept well for 3 days, had thoughts that people were conspiring against him at work, thought people were following him ... anyways, my son called me crying from his boss’s office that I need to come get him and that he is needing help. So, I picked him up, he was crying again, then suddenly, as soon as we left the parking lot, he stopped and told it was part of his plan to throw his conspirators off, then next thing I know he starts sobbing again ... and telling me to watch what I say because we may be bugged ...
Anyways, I felt absolutely helpless ... all I could do was comfort him and try to keep him calm. 
So, my question ... how do I proceed here ? ... his doctors office isn’t open on the weekend, he doesn’t want to take any adderall or dextro again , but what happens if his cold turkey isn’t a good idea ... how much, if any, should I give him if he starts having withdrawals ... and ... this is my major concern, do you think he has always been bipolar or did the prescriptions push him into it"

608,"I really need to get this out of my system so sorry about pouring it all here. This is gonna be long but thank you if you are reading this. 

So I had a video appointment with my psychiatrist and cpn today. I was looking forward to the appointment because it's only been couple of weeks since hypomanic episode. My doctor made some changes to my medication then but hypomania wasn't throughoutly discussed. We didn't talk a word about hypomania or my current state today. He did ask me in which mood I woke up today but that was all about present moment.

We mainly talked about therapy, BPD and results of a comprehensive psychological examination that I went through on December. My psychiatrist seemed to be sure I was BPD based on the psychological evaluation. He talked me about this year-long therapy group he was thinking is the next best thing for me. I really got excited about this group therapy. However, then he started to run diagnostics and it turned out I came short one criteria to get BPD diagnose. So he told me that sorry, but you don't qualify this group therapy thing. So that was that. Thanks for nothing.

Then we went through the psychological evaluation and it turned out that I have too many problems, trust issues and other crap that psychotherapy won't ever happen to me. He went on about my issues that could be overcome by therapy and taking all my hope away telling me that I am not suitable for any form on therapy.

So after talking about therapies that never gonna happen he said that with my treatment we will aim for what I want my life to be in five years. Seriously? FIVE YEARS. I've just had my first four stable months in 20 years and five hospitalizations last year and we aim for my five-year-goals?! I don't have five-year-goals. I have day after tomorrow goals... And that goal is to stay alive.

Of course I should have brought up things I wished to talk about but it happens in every appointment that I go blank and can't remember anything. So now I have absolutely no tools to go forward after hypomania (it could turn to depression) and I was taken away my only hope to overcome my issues. What would I want my life look like in five years? I can't even tell because I can't see longer than next month.

Idk maybe this was nothing but it made me feel anxious and hopeless."
609,I am really having a tough time on lithium and olanzapine.  The lithium is causing extreme emotional blunting.  Pdoc already did 2 reductions and situation improved somewhat.

612,"Hi, 

I've recently been diagnosed with BPD. I had a bit of a manic episoide which was a culmination of stress over a long period of time and then this was followed by a severe low - having to take antipsychotic medications and deal with all the reprecussions etc. Only recently, the doctor said I was ""high"" again but I would argue I was upset. I was on 100MG Sertraline and these were suddenly taken away from me. I was admitted to hospital for the third time which was quite traumatic experience. I'm currently on 600 MG Epilem and increasing and 20mg Abilify (Aripripozole). I've put on roughly 10 pounds since being hospitalised. Part of me just wants to give up the meds and try go clean. I am unsure about my diagnosis. Ive been non stop staying in bed lately because my social anxiety is huge too and I am depressed being on all the meds. Should it get better as the Epilem is increased? Any other advice? My family have basically said I have to take the medication and I feel a bit trapped because of that. On the other hand, I don't want to end up hospitalised again either."
613,"I feel like each year (for over 5 years now) I get an additional or updated diagnosis. My biggest struggles right now are bipolar depression, trauma flashbacks, and an eating disorder. I'm exhausted of going to therapy and taking medication, it seems like the only purpose of that stuff is to keep me alive, but its not enough to feel like I'm doing anything other than surviving. There have been brief periods where I have done very well, and gone without symptoms, and during those times I have thought, ""this is it? this bland life is what I worked so hard for?"" It just doesn't seem worth it. Right now I'm really going through tough times. I don't want to go into a more intensive therapy, I've been there done that, and look where it's gotten me. You'd think 5 years of therapy and meds would have gotten me somewhere better than laying in bed all day, barely eating and stinking up my room from not taking a shower. 

Has anyone gotten to the point where they feel like their life is worth living? What changed for you? How did you get to that point? The regret of not killing myself when I had the chance has been pretty consistent for four years. I want to know if there is hope for me."

I have bipolar 2, I'm sure about that. But I can't stop thinking that some of the symptoms of BPD, describes me too well.. And since the two are treated differently, I'm afraid I don't receive the right treatment.

616,I’m having emotional blunting from lithium so I want to get off it.  The pdoc is suggesting an ad cause I seem down.  I’m very upset about the state I’m in because of the lithium.   Plus I’ve had bad experiences with Zoloft and cymbalta in the past.  I’m refusing to go on antidepressant.  Why is it always such a struggle with the pdoc?

618,"I am 20 years old, and first sought professional help for my mental health when I was 14. Back then my diagnoses were depression, generalized anxiety disorder and also went through an eating disorder that I've successfully recovered from. After my first manic episode during my freshman year of college, I was diagnosed with bipolar 1. I was prescribed an anti- psychotic/mood stabilizer and continued with school. Things seemed mostly decent until my second year when I had another manic episode where I ended up having to hospitalized and take a medical leave from school. After I got out of the hospital I got off of the anti-psychotic I couldn't tolerate a high enough dose to stabilize my mood. I started Lithium and an intensive outpatient treatment program and for a bit things seemed to level off. About 3 weeks ago my depression and anxiety symptoms got really bad and am hoping that my telehealth appointment with my psychiatrist will help to point me in the right direction. One stressor for me right now is that I am planning to go back to school in the fall (if the pandemic situation allows for that to happen) and I am scared that I won't be stable by then and will have to be out of school longer. It's not that I feel pressure to graduate on time, I just want to be able to get back to the direction of my hopes and dreams. I also really miss the community I had at art school and want to get back as a healthier me and thrive in that community. I have a friend that I talk to often through text that lives back in Washington where I met him at school. I also am living with my family right now.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel so alone and lost. I am terrified that this is just my reality because I’ve been having these problems for years and even if things get better briefly and intermittently, it always ends up getting bad again. It feels like things I want out of life will always be out of reach for me, and that even if I get to a place I want to be, it will be snatched away from me again. I want to be okay and am doing all I can in my power to get there, but I feel like I’m not getting anywhere. I hope that if and when my meds get adjusted that it will be the piece I’m missing and that I can start building my life back up again."
619,"How do you deal with the aftermath of a manic episode? I'm coming down from a month long manic episode and I'm in a bad place. I spent $6000 on random stuff on Amazon and now I have no money to pay bills, and my voice is completely gone from talking to myself and having conversations with people who weren't there. 

I've been on meds that I take faithfully and I've been stable for years I don't know what happened. I'm really sad and physically worn out today, and I'm embarrassed. My kids are looking at me like I'm insane. Who knows what else I screwed up.

No one I know knows that I'm bipolar, they wouldn't understand if they did. I'm just in a bad place today and have no one to talk to about it. Can anyone relate?"
620,"Irritation is consuming me. This has been going on for weeks. I can't stand my husband. Everything about him irritates me. I am mean, pick a fight and make everything harder than it actually is.
Due to emotional issues I can't express anger and irritation so I have dreams about raging and going nuts. Daytime I have mental images about acting violent like killing him. I scream in my mind when he hugs me. I cry in the bathroom because I am so angry.
Nothing about him has changed. He's just trying to be a perfect husband as he always is. But this bipolar anger is making me blind. And it's consuming me because I can't express it.

Anyone else dealing with bipolar irritation and anger?"
621,"I have been relatively stable for about a month now, the first in a really long time. 

But I still feel a little down and have less motivation than normal. Is this just coming down from being constantly manic and having to deal with what it's like to get motivation like a ""normal"" person? Or is it my meds bringing me down too low.

I'm also constantly paranoid that I am gaining weight (even though my meds arent supposed to do that) from them and my body image issues are starting to come back... maybe also just because I'm not manic anymore?

This really sucks and I'm not sure it's worth even taking these meds if I'm going to feel this way! I miss my mania! 
(But when I don't take my meds I start to hallucinate so it's a real balance)

I have a feeling I'm just sort of evening out and starting to have to deal with living in a ""normal"" range of emotions, but I'm worried it's going to change who I am. Anyone understand this or have any advice?"
622,Hello mamas! I had a baby girl in February. Any advice for me?
623,"Since I moved to America, I have been dull. For a long time I didn’t know why. Then I learned of my bipolar diagnosis two years ago. Was originally misdiagnosed. I started being officially treated for it last September (2019).

Back to being dull. Information wouldn’t come in. I was slow. I learned that it’s called cognitive dysfunction.

since my first hypomanic episode, last year, I have become obsessed with math and sciences. Ok, not obsessed since I am still technically not fully functional. I still get depressed. And the cognitive dysfunction isn’t steady. Sometimes, I am so sharp. My speech is amazing, my memory is good (healthy). My ability to process and store information is great. And no, it isn’t hypomania because my thoughts aren’t racing and I don’t feel like learning 6 languages at once.

when I get like that I am also very happy. Not elated or euphoric. Just happy/content/confident in who I am. Secure.

but it’s not steady. It goes in and out. I realized that I’m not an arts girl. (I was told that hypomania heightens your innate abilities) so I’m sure math and science are what I love. Besides, this desire to study math, physics and eventually go into tech is still there even when I’m depressed.

Who else has been through this? Who else has seen their cognition gotten better without it being hypomania. I now know that I’ve been depressed since maybe my childhood.

(Sidenote: I used to be really bright as a kid. I skipped 1st and 2nd grade)

I’ve been told by doctors that when I am stable, the cognitive effects of the depression will subside. Anyone?"
624,"Mania can be different things for different people but does anyone disassociate after their manias? Like you either feel it wasn’t really you who did those things or said those things or wore those things, etc...or you don’t recognize yourself as being a part of it all because it’s just not like you or much too strange?"
625,"I hate bipolar disorder. I do the stupidest things when I'm manic. I don't know what is wrong with me. I feel like I need to be depressed just to act appropriately in life. When I'm high I become incredibly arrogant and even abusive towards others. 

Yesterday I hadn't slept in a couple of days and posted some stupid stuff on our neighborhood's Internet forum. Now I'm feeling like shit for doing that. I feel embarrassed and humiliated. I wish I was never born. The sad thing is, I know how stupid I was now and feel embarrassed but next time I'm manic I will do the same stupid stuff. It's like Jekyll and Hyde."
626,"It really upsets me. My bf accuses me of knowing people , even if I’m saying that I don’t I just met them. He doesn’t believe it and says I’m lying. Gives some reasons as why he said your name and so on. And then says I’m lying and he will never believe me. Idk what to do or how to overcome this thing. 
the last thing I want is to lose him or lose his trust , idk why he’s acting like that. Let’s also say that he is not young a young guy,in pretty decent age already. MaybeAge doesn’t matter in this case.
Idk. Any advice?"
627,"Hey guys.

College and I have a bit of a strained relationship. I took four years off after high school because of my mental health. After I finally felt horrible about myself and my productivity in life, I forced myself back into community college.

Recently, though, I feel myself slipping back into depression and my motivation is going right with it. I've recently began going to a 4-year after spending three getting my degree at community college. I commute because I wouldn't even try living on campus and it's becoming increasingly harder for me to get up to go to school when I have class. On top of that, when I don't have class, I find myself struggling to pick up a pen and do some homework.

It's hard. It's so so hard. I'm a 3.9 GPA student. I've done really well these past three years. And being in a new school is so overwhelming. I'm farther from home. The structure is different. And I'm just - I'd rather sleep. Do nothing. But that makes me feel worse being I know I have a lot to do. And I'm a junior. I can see the finish line.

I've got accommodations from my school, but they are mostly all about the exam and note taking. One thing I find really frustrating is that colleges do not like to acknowledge the impact mental health can have on attendance. Like yes, classes allowing 2-4 unexcused absences is okay and great, but honestly I'd rather be allowed to miss what I need without being penalized if I miss more than they allow. I'm aware that missing too many classes can affect my grade just because I'm not there. I know that. I would look to go to office hours or get a tutor. 

I am just very sad and very overwhelmed. Does anyone have any advice?"
628,"Hello All,
I need some advice here. Back when my hubby was in his 20’s (before we met) he fell off a balcony and smashed his head. From the injury he had a major manic and then depressive episode. 2 years later he had another after he went off his Carbamanzipine.
He had been symptom free for 20 plus years. Last week something was off - really off. Sleep, mannerisms, anxiety, concentration etc. He realized he was going into a manic state and went to the hospital. He was there for only 2 nights as he tested positive for Covid and could not go to the psych floor. The drs said he is bipolar - how he became that way doesn’t matter. 
He feels better than before but he is still in a manic state. He knows he is - that helps. I have his credit cards, we deleted his social media accounts. He gave me all the sharp items as they remind him of death. I got him hooked up at work for a leave etc. 
The Hospital added Rispardal? to his meds regimen and sent him home. Now what? How long will the mania last? Does he needs more meds? What else should I/we be doing?"
629,"So I have a good career and a decent job (I hate it but it pays well). Somehow through hospitalizations sometimes bizarre behavior I have managed a level of success. I work every day no matter what for the most part. Then this happens:

Yesterday I was extremely unwell. I had catastrophic stress and bad depression. I was upset and thinking of suicide. I blamed work stress for it. I thought stuff going on was causing the mood. I thought I had hit a brick wall. I didn't eat all day until dinner and I had a small meal. I took a nap.

Then for no reason I felt better. Like a storm had been raging and then it was gone. I got up made some eggs. The stress was gone. Nothing had changed. I was no longer suicidal and depressed.

Today I had little depression and worked alright all day. The same work pressure is there but has not bothered me.

Why is it gone? I could have quit my job I felt so badly yesterday. Nothing changes and today and I am functional. Why?

This is what I deal with and yet I manage to get through it and keep my job.

Is anyone else like this do you have a related story to share? Any advice?"
630,"I am on Paroxetine and Risperidone. I am taking paroxetine for anxiety but my doctor is also giving me Risperidone telling me that I have mood disorder too. My anxiety is cured but after 2-3 years of medication, I am getting the mood fluctuations which wasn't the case before. Is it possible that I have a mood disorder now because the doctor is giving me risperidone unnecessarily?
Please help!"
631,Has anyone tried these?  They are new to me and am curious what kind of experience others have had.
632,"I have been to a few support groups for Bipolar. I just don't feel I fit in. I don't quite feel like I experience this in the same way. It doesn't feel as extreme. To me, I just feel like I have terrible anxiety and a feeling of not wanting to do things when symptoms act up. I don't get suicidal ideation. I don't have sleep issues. I have noticed that usually symptoms start to appear more severly before Christmas and stay for a few weeks. It just feels like I am really restless, unsettled and just not comfortable. I struggle to make decisions and stick to them. Concentration seems to be a struggle too. For example I need to be able to concentrate at work but I find it incredibly hard. And also if I am to help out my mum with forms, I just don't want to read the forms because it makes me cry. I cannot even concentrate to read a paragraph and grasp what it is saying. I also feel as though I think too much. Mostly negative. But I cannot stop it. Thinking that people don't like me and don't want to be around me. One of the other things my partner has noticed often is I don't hear him. Not sure if this is because I am losing my hearing or because I am not able to concentrate on what he is saying because of the stuff going on around me. Forgot to mention I get sensative to sound and when there is too much going on around me I just want to go to my room and stay there in silence.

Originally was diagnosed with schizophrenia and then schizoaffective. However, I have only had the one psychotic episode in about 9 years. Obviously the first few diagnosis' may have been correct afterall but how am I supposed to know if I am on the correct treatment?"
633,"Does anyone else board things any time but especially when manic? 
If so, what do you hoard? I hoard makeup and clothes..."
634,For a while I always thought I was just schiopheric but now that I've taken multiple medications and multiple therapy sessions I realized that I have a touch of OCD that has now turned manic. I walk around my apartment frantically looking for stuff not thinking about how tired I've become. I asked my parents and my team what I would be looking for that is so important and they say a lot of things are worth looking for around the apartment especially cleaning I just feel like I overdo it sometimes. Cleaning is one thing but frantically moving objects from one place to another repeatedly becomes an annoyance. I just want stuff to stop moving in my mind it's becoming heavy on me. are there any suggestions as to how to calm my surroundings? I know some good ways of mental therapy like meditation. I've done word searches puzzles listening to music journaling a lot of productive things that I used to mask the symptoms but now I feel like I'm walking around aimlessly not realizing exactly how tired I am. I wish I could get into the swing of things of being more positive like a more uplifting person but I find this hard during these times because I've had so much on my mind and on my plate. I've never tried cognitive behavioral therapy? And suggestions.
635,"I was level total nine days. I made changes to my medication as my psychiatrist asked me to. Hypomania was gone before the changes but those changes in medication should make a difference now but after nine days this is my third hypomanic day. How come this is happening... Or was it ever gone really?

I am about to leave to my friend's cabin. I feel like anything could happen during this trip. These three days have been totally different than my last hypomania even though they were only nine days apart."
636,"Hi all, 

Thank you for existing here to support fellow sufferers. This is a big step for me to participate in a forum like this. For about 8 years now I have been in treatment for bipolar. I was primarily on a mood stabilizer (Lamictal) with Seroquel as PRN. Recently we switched to using both Lamictal and Seroquel everyday. I had to switch providers last month. This one would like to add an antidepressant to the mix. I am really really torn on this. Anybody have experience with this cocktail. I am trying to use a bowling alley analogy. The moodstabilizer keeps the bumpers. The Seroquel helps dampen the mania and the antidepressant helps keep lows at bay. But I am not jazzed about one more med."
637,"In 2018, I started to become open about my struggles with Bipolar I Disorder on my finsta that’s followed by my classmates in high school. My main goal was to come out and inform them about my struggles. I told them my symptoms (mania, depression, paranoia, aggression, excessive envy, making dumb decisions).

At first I thought that what I was doing was good. But within the next few days, weeks, and months there was pushback. Classmates started to shun me. People who used to wave to me in the hallways didn’t even look at me. Two people blocked me on both Instagram and Snapchat. And of course I lost a couple of followers. However, there have been people who’ve come out and supported me. And the two guys who I’ve been friends with since elementary school have stayed by my side.

Unfortunately I fit the bipolar stereotype. That we are all violent and pose a threat. I have a tendency to have really violent intrusive thoughts But these come and go within a few seconds. I also have a history of blacking out even though it only happened one time. One afternoon in therapy circle in 2016, a kid purposely splashed paint over my head. I picked up aN implement and that’s the last thing I remember. I hurt him so severely that he had to go get stitches and I had to stay overnight  a psychiatric hospital. Like I said, it only happened one time. After the incident I got a major medicine increase. 

I often think about what my social life and reputation would’ve been like if I had just kept my mouth shut instead of pouring my heart out and being honest.
But I can’t really blame people for notwanting to have anything to do with me. I’ve provided them with a wealth of reasons not to. I brought that on myself.

Currently I’m in my senior year of high school. Once I graduate, I won’t have see my shunners anymore."

640,Has anyone tried EDMR for dealing with trauma? I’m skeptical of it but have read testimony attesting that it is helpful and a valid form of treatment for dealing with trauma. My therapist is a specialist in this area and he has suggested trying it with him. What do you all think?

Is there a bipolar medication that helps focus
643,"Hi everyone,

So in the midst of the world slowing down I've been putting a lot of thought into my behaviour over the last ~10 years and researching Bipolar disorder extensively. Simultaneous to the coronavirus crisis I'm in perhaps the second worst depressive swing I've experienced. So, I wanted to reach out to people here who have suffered with diagnosed Bipolar to see what you think. 

Since going through some trauma as a teenager (am 25 now) and possibly before this I have experienced mood swings between periods of high energy and creativity, relentless positivity and quite ridiculous self senses of self belief and worth. I started a game development company with friends aged 15 and we were destined to revolutionize the industry. I wrote a fantasy book over a 3-4 month period and was to be the best author since GRR Martin. I've been the life of the party at times and so smoothly sociable and with the energy to workout far longer than normal despite not needing as much sleep. I've been so euphoric and felt like nothing in the world stood a chance against me. I've made impulsive decisions such as last minute holidays, one of which was to LA which landed up being pretty dangerous as I wasn't staying in a safe part of the city at all. When I was 19 I even moved to Germany quite impulsively. For a brief spell I believed I was an angel put on this earth as training to eternally guard the gates of Heaven, and that I could detect other angels. Most recently, I went through a 2-3 month spell of working 12-16 hours per day and barely needing any sleep or food to keep me going. 

Take that paragraph out of context and you'd think I'm a treat to be around. However most of my life has been spent at the other end of the spectrum: depressed. I won't go into too much detail here as I believe we all know how consuming and crippling depression is, but I've almost attempted suicide twice and have self harmed on a few occasions. Accompanying this at times is severe anxiety that has resulted in panic attacks both minor and major, and even hallucinations. Recently I recall the feeling of fading out of reality; I wasn't able to tell what around me was real and what wasn't. 

I don't really recall normal periods but my memory is likely damaged by years of alcohol and drug use. I suppose we're less inclined to remember the times in which we're stable. I can however remember the extremes of the emotions I've felt, how I've seemed to bounce between them and how utterly unable I've been to convey this to those around me (despite being worried about my mental health at times). Over the last year I even kept a journal (started as a mountaineering record sure to one day be one of the greats), and from it have plotted a mood chart that resembles what you see in a Bipolar type 2 disorder. 

I can almost feel the symptoms becoming worse and my Mum (god bless her for all I've put her through) was on the brink of referring me to hospital just a few days ago. I know I've affected others positively and negatively (depending on which 'mood' I was in when interacting with them), and feel immense guilt of the times I've become enthralled by a person only to suddenly lose interest (as is the same with so many projects over the years). I also wonder if I'm beginning to encounter mixed states; the past 2 weeks for example I've bounced from borderline-suicidal depression to boundless energy and agitation. 

Thank you to reading through that - it's taken ages to write as it's difficult to summarize and talk only about ones self but this seemed the best of all places to post this. It's half a therapeutic rant and half a question to those of you that have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder. Does this sound like what you've experienced? 

Thanks again and God bless you all."
644,"Hi everyone,

I'm a new member and looking for some help/support/any word of encouragement/ light at the end of the tunnel advice for this horrible bipolar diagnosis I have recently been given. I'm 27 and have been dealing with this all my life. I've been getting help with my bipolar for around 8 years but only started treatment (meds etc) for it last year. I keep feeling like I'm better then I'm not. I keep missing the manic side of my life and I feel like I'm almost grieving a past, lost version of myself!? I miss the highs.. and I cant deal with the lows.. Does it get better!?!? 

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated and I hope I can help someone else out there who needs someone to talk to about their struggle with bipolar. :)"
645,"I just got a type 1 Bipolar diagnoses at 46. I was an odd guy but never thought it was clinical, It was me and it was all I knew. With hindsight I was usually manic most of my life.  I came down with depressive states that could last months, When I was not hiding under my blankets, I was charismatic sales guy type that often talked too fast and was a bit odd. Go figure eh.   Never had my illness ruined my life or relationships. I just figured I sleep less than most of the world and got sad at times. 

In next 10 years after seeing my doctor for depression symptoms and given SSRI. I lost my marriage, all my friends, a six figure job, and two houses. I was a very promising 30 something with a knack for IT sales and lovely suburban home. Now I do construction labour and sometimes travel with the carnival to sustain myself. Five years ago I moved to the country and isolated myself as part of my illness. I am still here to this day typing this from a satellite connection.

About a month ago I had a very self destructive manic few weeks. After This I decided to see my doctor. She got me the right help and I type this a week into mood stabilisers alone at my fortress of solitude. Needless to say, I  am going through a rough time. 

I am on day 6 and the pill work well. I am grounded and lucid. However pretty darn sad and lost. Here are my week one thoughts. I would love some feedback if something sticks out to you. 

While not depression, I am really freaking sad.

Where do you start in trying to fix a destroyed life?

Anybody else with a late diagnosis feel they wasted their lives?

I like often liked being manic, this is like coming off a drug. 

I was hypersexual for my whole adult life. Not swiping tinder or planning next sex party is odd. Huge change.

Distress lines have helped a lot this week. Thanks to those you man them, You people are awesome humans.

In closing. If you are young and reading this and think you may have any mental illness, talk to your doctor. Life is short and its better when you are treated."
646,"Hey, so a little background... my mental health has been complete sh.t for the past two years or so, because of a lot of things - ocd, bipolar, anxiety, ptsd etc.. and i have also completely ruined my diet among other thing... to be.more exact - my appetite comes and goes as it pleases, i eat very little lately and the food mostly lacks any real nutrition etc etc... its irregular and stuff and its really doing a number on my overall health so id like to ask you, would someone have any advice for me as to how to get my diet back on track?"

649,"I was diagnosed in 2012 with bipolar disorder type 2 and a few other things but bipolar is the major portion.  My medication has been balanced for years and for the most part I have been fairly stable until last year.  Last year my son tried to commit suicide almost two handfuls of times that we know of.  At first I thought that I was unraveling as a dad almost losing his son, but now I know that my manic has been keeping me going.  In October last year my spending went crazy and I charged up two credit cards, I thought that this was under control but recently it flared up again.  Is this normal to have several rapid manic cycles while going through a crisis?  

This last spending spree I spent $500 that I shouldn't have and hid it from my wife, I know that this is poor behaviour and looking back I don't know how I got here.  My marriage is strained and may not pull through this, I'm so lonely and want to drink or just end it.  I wouldn't say that I want to actively kill myself I just want all this crap to be done and that is a solution, kinda messed up isn't it?  I have almost six years sobriety and drinking is all of a sudden back on my mind, why now?

I love my wife very much but the relationship is strained and we are in a horrible spot, my anxiety is telling me that there is no hope.  We are hardly intimate anymore and this rejection is only compounding how lonely I feel.

Sorry if my first post was a bit much but I'm drowning and can't handle this alone any more."
650,"When you are having your meds adjusted, what is it like for you? And how do you know when they are “right”?  It is absolute torture when my meds are being adjusted.  I wouldn’t say I’m suicidal, I just kind of pray for a meteor to hit me or something.  I feel like I always get to a point that I can tolerate life and that is when we stop adjusting the meds.  It’s no way to live.  I am a rapid cycler and I am either depressed or crazy high for almost three quarters of the month.  I can’t take it.  Doctors tell me that meds will “only do so much” and I understand there is no “cure” but shouldn’t I feel better than “not suicidal”?  What am I supposed to do about how I treat my boyfriend when I’m angry?  I can’t stop.  The only thing I can do is try not to exist... I can’t just crawl into a hole for three weeks at a time.  I feel so helpless."
651,"Hi

I’m just looking for some information. In the past 4 months my boyfriend of 2.5 years has split up with me 3 times without an apparent reason. When we are back together everything is good for a week or two but then he becomes really moody and refuses to talk about why he is being this way. He just says there is nothing wrong and it’s like he doesn’t recognise his mood swings. One day he is happy, laughing and joking but the following day he is quiet and withdrawn.

From reading online, I think he could have bipolar. I’m aware that his mum was diagnosed with bipolar about 10 years ago and this could be inherited by children. Iv also read online that breaking off relationships is also quite common with bipolar sufferers and this could explain the frequent break ups. 

We were looking at buying a house this year and actually viewed one the day before he broke things off with me for the 3rd time. So this seems very irrational for someone who was looking to buy their first home with their partner.

Can you please provide some more information as I feel unable to try and discuss this with him but I’m concerned and confused. Are these traits similar to someone suffering from bipolar?"

653,"Hi all! Hope everyone is safe and healthy.

I think we've all experienced mood swings, it comes with the territory. But what do your mood swings make you FEEL? Mine for example either make me feel like the world is ending or that I'm a superhero, able to solve everyone's problems. And the change usually happens within hours. I've only recently noticed that soon before the shift I'll have a brain fog, then I'm either scrubbing every pebble in my aquarium or crying about stepping on an ant. I don't really see an in-between. Because of the global pandemic I haven't been working for three weeks and the NYS on Pause was extended until May 15. I'm wondering if anyone else has these specific shifts. Or if anyone has any advise on how to fill my time so I can avoid the extremes."
654,Is loving someone supposed to hurt and if it does how long should you let it go on for ?
655,"hello everyone, i'll try to keep this short but i'll give a TLDR: i'm wondering what my boyfriends manic episodes will look like now that he is getting treatment. i experienced his first ever manic episode, and it was very confusing, stressful, and unsettling, and i'm worried that all his manic episodes will be a repeat of what we've already been through. any insight?

for more context, i've been seeking some guidance regarding my partner's new diagnosis with bipolar 1. he had his first ever manic episode this past june, and it was a huge shock to us all. when his mood began to shift, i didn't understand what was going on at all and felt confused and lost. the person i loved was turning into a stranger in front of me.

as things progressively got worse, i convinced him to see a doctor where they told me his diagnosis. however, his mania was very severe, coupled with full blown psychosis which made him unwilling to accept what was happening or that anything was wrong. he lashed out at me, saying hurtful things or blaming me for thinking that he needed help, and even got aggressive at times--characteristics that are completely opposite to his usual kind and sensitive personality. finally, after 3 painful months (including multiple forced hospitalizations, and several times on and off his medication) he began to get better. now 6 months after his diagnosis he has found a good therapist and medication which works for him, and he seems much more stable.

im happy that hes gotten better because it was such a relief to see the man i loved come back to me again, but now im thinking about the future. with this new factor in our relationship, i'm worried how it will affect us long term. i was hoping to get some insight from people who have lived with this disorder or have loved ones that experience it. what should i expect during his future manic episodes now that hes on medication and getting treatment? will it always be as severe as this first one (i.e. should i expect him to be involuntarily hospitalized and refuse treatment every time his mania resurfaces? will he be as withdrawn and angry towards me, or is it possible that he will be more controlled?). i know that everyone deals with this differently, but any personal experience or advice you may be able to offer would be incredibly appreciated."
656,"I'm stuck and I don't know what to do. I have bipolar depression which my doc knows about and tries to treat. I had some improvement in my last appointment I went from practically nonfunctional to able to cope. I was logging 0s and 1s in my mood log to logging 2s and 3s. 0 means the worst most depressed and anxious 10 would be manic. My problem is I've been depressed for over a year (or two I'd have to ask my wife time just passes for me).  A 2 mood is my norm.

I'm on a mood stabilizer an antipsychotic and an antidepressant. My doc said BP depression is hard to treat. My issue is that I have no quality of life. I'm so miserable and unhappy 24/7. I thought the purpose of getting on meds was to improve quality of life. I just survive and that's it sometimes I'm barely doing that. I was happier off meds until I went dangerously into a mixed episode with psychotic features. No I don't want to get off meds I'm just frustrated.

On top off all that my work is suffering. I've always been highly functional I just hide my illness (hard to do when manic). Last week I spent mornings asleep on a couch instead of working. That put me behind on a project. My boss has talked to me about work performance. I'm afraid I'll be fired for being too slow because I'm depressed and scared. That weighs heavily on me and feeds my depression. I can't relax on the weekend from work stress.

Has anyone seen improvement from depression or does it just stay with you? Is there enjoyment in life after curing mania? How do you cope with work or a bad job that's wrong for you? How do you cope with getting fired from your job?

Thanks"

How this came about... I have bipolar thoughts. I was never diagnosed but I have been acutely suicidal for years every single day 24/7 with few pauses.

I am going to kill myself. But I don’t want to. It’s my voices who forced me to kill myself.

I also have voices in my head who just laughed at me for no reason. They make me want to die every day.

658,"Ok i know this may sound strange but im experiencing something strange. I have been feeling distant from myself and almost on autopilot. Today i started thinking about a past experience that happened when manic. The weird thing is that i keep seeing people from it, in the food shop, while driving, on fb pix that came on my news feed. This is filling me with panic as i dont know whats real or not 😞 is it some kind of reason or punishing me? I dont understand any of it"
659,"Hey everyone,

Hope you are all doing OK.

     I've been struggling with, well, everything. I'm so close to giving up and stopping my tabs. I didnt take my last 2 doses but a close friend just reminded me to stay strong so I've taken them now..  My doctor wants me just to try taking my whole dosage level (300mg) at night only now as a slow release form?

I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this type that they could tell me about? 

Is the irritation worse/better? will I be as tired (zombie-like) throughout the day?

Any advice is much MUCH appreciated !:) 

Be well X"
660,"Hi everyone,

I was hoping someone could shed some light on my situation if you suffer from bipolar disorder. I had started seeing someone who informed me of their bipolar depression and anxiety. Initially I was on the fence if it was something I could handle but I gave it a shot and it turned out to be a fun and loving relationship. It had its ups and down but this person was fairly communicative with me and is also seeing a therapist and psychiatrist. The one drug I am certain of they take daily is Latuda. We hadn't dated long before the coronavirus situation started and its when I saw a lot more anxiety come out. I stayed by their side and provided reassurance whenever needed. I handled the anxiety well and asked questions as much as I could without overwhelming them to understand their past and what type of symptoms I could expect. We live about an hour apart. One night communication through text ceased. I tried multiple times to reach out and to no avail. Phone calls, texts, etc. I was devastated and confused but tried to remember this could be them sinking into depression. A week later I saw them post a picture of themselves going to the pool yet still wouldn't answer any of my texts. It is going on the 3rd week of no communication whatsoever and I've sent multiple understanding texts. I've finally decided it was time to move on, however I feel in me they may reach out. Has anyone had a similar experience? Is there someone bipolar that could give me some insight? I care a lot about this person and would like to better understand if this is the condition or did I basically just get ghosted."

662,"I hope this post finds people well. I'm new to the forum and would love to meet like-minded people.

Do you guys deem yourself as a success?

I've been in a personal growth journey for two years and I overcome a lot just like many of you. I feel like everything is starting to fall in place. I feel like I'm on the right medications and I feel like I am getting a lot of work done. 

I know my situation is different because currently I'm a graduate student who (if I graduate) will be making 6 figures. I have no stresses of horrible bosses and I surround myself with good people. I also live on my own so I don't have stresses of being home with my ""annoying"" family. (Distance make the heart grow fonder)

I wanted to know what are your success stories. What are you proud of?

What I love about me:
-I don't give up
-I dream big
-I hold myself to accountable

What I do not like about me:
-I struggle with having a healthy relationship with food. I use it as a drug in away or in a destructive way. Much like alcohol dependence I had a food dependence. But I think I'm overcoming it. I am currently water fasting for two days and hope to continue as much as I can. 

What I learned?
-I do not need food to make me happy. I can take a nice shower before starting a hard task instead of eating away my anxiety. 

I hope to have a self-reflecting discussion with you guys on the topic of ambition career/ place in life/ etc. and food struggles. 

Maybe we can become a team of people combating our health battles with the support of each other. Staying positive and looking for the best in every situation."
663,"lately I’ve been feeling very tired and don’t seem to find any motivation for anything. I do things automatically, like washing dishes, taking a dog out etc.

Very little motivation to do anything. Would like to just sleep all day but can’t do that.
I feel angry and irritated too. Recently started counting calories in order to lose weight, I kind of feel now that I can’t eat above my set goal (it’s 1600-1800) but now i have hard timeeven getting that amount, and feel guilty when I eat.

664,"I'm having some fears related to my work. I think my boss wants to fire me because I'm slow at my work. Like he's out to get me.

I have a problem with thinking coworkers are spying on me and making notes about me. When I have these episodes I don't think they are irrational. This one time i bought a special pouch for my phone that blocked radio waves. It felt so good to block the government from spying on me. Yet at the time I had no idea the spying wasn't real.

So back to my work this is yet again a time I have a feeling it's not real but how would I know if I'm scared or if I'm delusional? My advice is usually to note it for my next appointment. I don't have signs of mania which makes me lean towards it's a fear. I just I get extreme feelings to where I don't think other people have these thoughts so intensely. So it's abnormal and debilitating.

I'm curious about your stories to see if I can gain any wisdom. Thanks."
665,"New to the forum so hello and thanks for having me!

I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar II after thinking I had plain ol' depression for 15+ years... Really opened my eyes and makes a ton of sense. I've been trying to find more alternative remedies since I've had horrible reactions to almost every medication I've tried.

I've read a lot of studies about how dark therapy and sleep hygiene can greatly help bipolar. I remember reading that going to bed and waking up at the same time every day is one of the best things you can do to control cycling.

BUT this seems a lot easier to implement for people who tend to go to bed later. You force yourself to wake up early (with an alarm clock or dawn simulator) & make your room dark at sundown, so then you're tired earlier in the evening and can go to sleep at a normal time. I know it sucks to do that, but night owls at least have a path forward with clear steps to take.

How do I control my sleep if I am an early riser? I never have any trouble falling asleep and I almost always fall asleep at a consistent time, but when I'm hypomanic I'll wake up super early in the morning (like at 4 am when it's still dark out). Once I'm awake I am AWAKE and I cannot fall back asleep since my brain has already gotten its rest. Sometimes I can force myself fall back asleep after a few hours, but that feels more like a nap since so much time has passed since I've woken up and it makes me super groggy with a headache.

tl;dr: I have no idea how to control my sleep hygiene as an early riser! Anyone have advice?"
666,"When you look back at what has been labeled Mania, delusion or psychosis, do you ever wonder if it’s just your imagination run wild, if you are just naturally more imaginative than others and have a hard time separating your imagination from reality?"

I’m having racing thoughts, haven’t slept in almost 2 days and can’t stop talking to myself about things I could’ve done, things I should’ve said to people, imagining and acting out illogical future scenarios, etc.  I’ve taken melatonin for two days to try to calm down. I am on my meds and was pretty stable. I’ve also tried smoking marijuana to try to calm down and nothing is working. What can I do to calm down and get out of this? 
I have woken up panicking every morning for the last week unnecessarily and then I feel anxiety the rest of the day. 
I’ve also recently exploded on people and told them terrible things. Rightfully so to be totally honest, but in general I would hold these opinions back.
I really feel out of control and am scared that this has actually progressed into something worse. Like schizophrenia? Would like someone’s advice. Thank you"
668,"Hello and good evening everyone (it's actually 1:15a as I start to write this.)

I hope all is well for you while reading this as I know this may be a difficult time for everyone.

Where do I even begin?...

In the past year, I have moved 3 times. 1 out of state, then back; and again within the same state. (USA if you were wondering)

I am greatful for what I do have, however, for the purpose of this I am going to focus specifically on the issues at hand.

Recently I had applied for Social Security Disability due to the fact that holding down a job has been virtually near impossible. Mostly, this is due to frequent mood instability (bipolar), medications being changed all the time and my physical health as well. Unfortunately, my initial application for disability has been denied due to ""the lack of severity"" of my condition. I AM with every ounce (of the little) energy I have attempting to go through the appeals process.

1) Does anyone have experience with the current Social Security Disability system?
---
Another substantial issue I keep running into is the *Manic* debt I have created in addition to the Medical Bills that go along with it. (Ironic, is it not?) This ammounts to roughly $15,000. Keep in mind, I am currently unemployed. I do not come from an affluent immediate family, and the little (but rather enormous) help I've been receiving is coming from a grandparent of which her spouse currently has cancer. THE GUILT is beyond anything explainable as no one else can do this for me. (side note, a large portion of that debt is accruing substantial [20% and up] compounding interest)

2) I don't know what the heck to do in this situation... My credit is rather okay for the moment because of on-time payments and I'd rather not destroy it. (bankruptcy?)
---
I have been seeing my psychiatrist for a very, very long time. We have worked through *countless* combinations of medications and have determined that 99% of antipsychotics are off the table. Lithium is off the table. Depakote is off the table. & Anticonvulsant (ie. Lamictal, Tegretol and Trileptal) are... YOU GUESSED IT, off the table.
I'm currently on the smallest possible dose of Abilify for Bipolar and *That's It*
The efficacy of it is questionable at best.
---
Getting down to this moment:

I have the hardest time sleeping, going for up to 2 nights in a row entirely sleepless. This has been voiced to my doctor. Currently, a simple antihistamine equivalent (vistoril) has been perscribed but has been of little recourse.

My depression seems to be the worst at night. The engulfing feelings of hopelessness and helplessness have been nothing but pure torture. That metaphorical hole many depressed people get stuck in has now simply turned into a void of no dimension. No up, no down, no direction to go at all. Just... nothing.

I have seeked help from various medical professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.

My social supports are limited at best. Family generally wants little to no involvement. My one aunt who is diagnosed bipolar as well oddly enough is the one who has been helping the most. This begs the question as to why other perfectly healthy people simply can't/won't assist or get involved (Im not trying to sound rude in any way, but seriously... 🤦‍♂️) The one friend I have doesn't mind going for an occasional coffee but that has ended (thanks Coronavirus <- No, that is *not* what this post is about) and I feel MORE ALONE than ever.

I have a therapist now and have been through quite a few, but have yet to find one that I ""click"" with and doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

Currently living with my father has been challenging but we have a ""good enough"" relationship. We coexist at best, and he cares in his own way but generally I unable to ""lean on him"" much for the lack of better words. He is also financially tight, and I'm sure is struggling in his own way. He doesn't talk much about his own problems/struggles.

- A healthy diet is practically unattainable due to finances.

- Figure I would mention I hate the fact that (I believe) im gay. Not that I have a problem with LGBT ANYTHING. I just feel life would be more simple otherwise.

AND TO SUM IT UP BECAUSE IT'S NOW 2:15a, an hour later. (I NEED to sleep)

I find my self silently crying for hours at night, begging for it all to be over.

I'd like to believe this can't be forever, after all, we are human. The only guarantee life has to offer is death.

I'm not religious, but if there is a God... Please, help us all.

Thank you in advance to everyone in the community.

Hopefully there is  something that has given you a glimpse of hope or joy recently.."
669,"Hi All,

I'm BP1 (with psychotic features when manic), and I've been dating a great girl for over a year, and I love her very much. I had a manic episode this last February and was hospitalized for approximately a month. It was brutal. My girlfriend was there for me every step of the way and saw every feature of my episode. At times it was pretty bad. 

We (predominantly - she) has some questions about the illness, BP1. She also has *sigh* either naturally (?) or not questions about whether she want to stay with me. She loves me but she's worried about the implications of the illness for her life over time, our lives. I really want to stay together. I want to save our relationship and, like I said, love her very much. 

My girlfriend has proposed that we talk to a therapist/BP specialist (maybe even over Skype while we all in quarantine) so we/she can ask(s) questions about the illness. For what it's worth, I keep hearing that I am *very light* in severity on the bipolar spectrum -- I'm not sure entirely what any of that means. I have, however, while medicated gone 7 years before my last manic episode. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any feedback on any of this? I want to find that therapist who will talk to us over Skype. I would love for that person to have a more open-minded, generous viewpoint of the illness and not just shoot it down with all doom and gloom, like all the literature I'm reading on the web. I'm worried about talking to my own psychiatrist about relationship stuff. She seems particularly severe about the implications of having this illness, and I'm sure there are alternate takes that will also be honest and meanwhile answer my girlfriend's questions.

What do you think?

Do you know of such a person?

Thanks so much in advance.

Best,
Warmoth"
670,"TW: Suicidal Ideation, loss of family 

So I was in the hospital a little over a month ago due to a psychotic break with symptoms of mania and psychosis. I finally get back on my medications after two years and got back on a somewhat ""normal"" sleep schedule.I have been doing, alright, mostly enjoying the extra free time I have off with my cats (Went down to part time after hospitalization.)  Well recently I have been having a lot of thoughts and what I may call suicidal ideation? TLDR of the matter is that I have become very existential and realize I am losing everyone important to me, and its about to come FAST, no one I am talking about is particularly healthy. I realize the people I am about to lose are people most don't have the LUXURY of having in their lives, (two sets of great grandparents and my maternal grandparents.) Well I keep having these thoughts that keep me up at night, they are intense and almost psychedelic. I keep thinking of how easy it would be to just....never wake up and not have to deal with the hurt that is coming. That I am better off not here anyways because all I manage to do is anger others. I keep thinking about the inevitable death of everything I know and just how easy it is to end life on earth and it makes me sit and wonder why I should even want to be here? I never asked to be born, and I never asked to have to try and fit in, and now some of the only people I have to live for are slipping out of my grasp. I have my cats sure, and I have my boyfriend who lives with me, but sometimes I just think about how he will inevitably leave too after me and my disorders become ""too much"""
671,"Good Day all

This is my first time joining a mental health forum.
I dont really know exactly what I am trying to get out of this. All I know is that I am physically and mentally drained. My brother which I love dearly was diagnosed with Bipolar about 5 years ago. He is 27. Our mom commited suicide when he was only 2. He has been struggling with manic depression a lot the past 5 years. He had his first psychotic break about 3 years ago. Drug induced psychosis. Smoked too much pot and was taking cocaine. Took him 6 months of extreme depression to  recover. We went through hell as a family. Its almost as if I was also going through the depression with him. It breaks your heart to see someone you love so much have to endure so much pain. It really killed me inside. After he recovered, things went well. Sometimes too well. It was not long until he started smoking weed again saying that it calmed him and helped with his depression. One thing lead to another and 3 months later he again had drug induced psychoses episode. This really broke my heart as he knew all the pain we had gone through with him and he still chose to do drugs. Again we went through the exact same 6 months of hell and 2 suicide attempts before he became better. And things really went well. Then suddenly now again he relapsed. The hurtfull thing is that as soon as he is better and coping, hes attitude changes and he treats me like shit. He again started smoking weed and shit 2 months ago. I have warned him million times that he is gonna have anothet psychotic episode but he just does not care when he is in that state. He listenes to no one and is the most selfish and self centres arrogont prick. He had another psychotic episode 2 days ago. In a mental hospital now. 3rd time. Again drug induced and I just cant do this again. I know hes going to fall into the pits of depression once he comes out of psychoses. Our father has stage 4 cancer and is getting worse every day. I myself cant sleep at night. I have a 4 year old daughter and my wife is 3 months pregnant. I just cant deal anymore. I cant leave him but I just dont feel like doing anything for him as he does not take anyones feelings in consideration. But I also know he has no one else. Why must life be so hard and painfull all the time?"
672,"Hello everyone! 

So last month after a 10 minute assessment with some locum psychiatrist I was diagnosed with Cyclothymia... It's a step closer to the correct diagnosis of Bipolar II.

The Cyclothymia diagnosis is a complete joke. 12 months ago another psychiatrist told me I didn't have Cyclothymia because whilst I had a history of severe depressive episodes they had not seen any hypomania so could NOT diagnose Bipolar II. Oh but they did tell me I shouldn't take anymore antidepressants because they made me hyper and affected my sleep.

Fast forward to now and here I am with Cyclothymia so I have clearly experienced hypomania but now my severe depressive episodes are only mild...

Recently undergone this quick fire assessment after an OD caused by 8 weeks of very little sleep and bizarre behaviour. I most definitely experience Mixed Affective States and I took the OD just to sleep, the second in 13 days.

This new assessment saw this psychiatrist prescribe lamotrigine but three weeks in I've had to cease it due to side effects.

I've lived with these swings in mood for more than 20 years so pretty much know the signs of when a crisis is occurring. However I am not supported by a MH team.

My actual diagnosis is EUPD and I don't dispute at once I had traits and fitted this diagnosis. However always suspected I had Bipolar running alongside it. EUPD traits have gone thanks to therapy, but I still experience depressive episodes about twice a year alone with both hypomania and mixed affective states, the latter being the most scary.

Asking for help in a crisis is a nightmare as this year I asked for help early on because I knew where it was heading, nope all the MH assessment team saw was someone with a diagnosis of EUPD, so no help in crisis. Eventually 6 weeks into crisis I took the first OD, then a second. After the second after 8 weeks of distressed anxious agitation my mood switches again and my sleep returned to normal.

I've vowed never to ask for help in a MH crisis ever again."
673,So I am not devastated but the other night I shaved half my head and I don't think that I would have done this if I was not having some mood issues. Impulsivity and mania scares me a lot because I usually swing the other way and get really depressed.
674,"Hi all

I have BP2 and take Lithium. I had a hypomanic episode in January (lasted around 3-4 weeks - it wasn’t overly pleasant, I essentially became obsessed with the idea of trying to leave the country for a month straight and harassed immigration lawyers- it was impossible to do due to my bipolar debts but I obsessed constantly)

I fell into depression in Feb and my mood stabilised around mid March for 3-4 weeks. I the. had a mild hypomanic episode around a week ago which was very euphoric and elevated - lots of creativity and up all night, lots of exercise etc. Apparently I was a joy to be around. Fun, caring, empathetic, very high energy and charismatic. It seemed to end with a horrendous panic attack and  I am now suffering debilitating anxiety and have panic attacks on a daily basis. I am becoming agoraphobic.

can anyone relate with this? Is anxiety and panic closely associated with bipolar ? I have always just gone from hypo to depression (I am predominantly depressed but my hypo’s are random and can’t really be predicted - they can last for 2 days or a month) the depression is much more consistent in how long it lasts (1-3 months, sometimes more) but with depression it’s just sadness, lots of sleep, wanting to die, loss of appetite...

The anxiety I’m experiencing now feels worse than ANY depression or mania I’ve ever experienced. I feel completely on edge, trapped in every room, my chest is hurting so much because it’s so tense. The only time I rest is at night because I take zopoclone (I’ve taken it now so I’m sedated enough to be able to discuss the issue) I can’t even leave the house unless somebody accompanies me and that’s just across the garden because my family are concerned I’m not getting fresh air.

but I’m not manic, I’m not depressed... I’m just living in total suspense and on total edge. my skin is crawling with anxiety.

Any thoughts or support would be appreciated"
675,"I've decided to quit my Quetiapine dose (600mg). I've been on about 1,5 years. Could be more, can't remember. Since I started this drug I've gained a lot of weight and I just can't deal with that anymore. I know I am taking a huge risk for not consulting my doctor but I don't care. 

I am interested in knowing if there is anybody who has come off this drug easily. I've read horror stories about withdrawal symptoms and even that it is impossible to quit Quetiapine and that once you use it you will never sleep without it again. 

Anyways I decided to write here my experience. If the withdrawal symptoms are really so horrible then I will give up, it's not worth it. I am stable at the moment so I am confident I manage with only Lithium and anti-depressant. I have an appointment scheduled on May so if things go south help is coming. And if things go well my doctor doesn't need to know. 

I've cut my dosage half (300mg) and so far I am doing good. I am using Quetiapine 25mg (IR) to secure sleep because sleep is everything for a bipolar.

I'm just wondering if it's ok to cook with alcohol while on antipsychotics. I can't drink it even if I wanted to as I'm sectioned in the community right now and it's a part of the criteria for staying out of the psych ward, but I want to know if anyone has tried cooking with alocohol while on Risperidone and if there were any adverse effects from doing so. 

I'm thinking of making a stew with either wine or beer in and it's my understanding that not all of the alcohol cooks away. Is it safe to have the small amount that will remain or will it mess me and the meds up?

I only just heard that a young guy I knew at an old workplace committed suicide not long ago. We got on really well at work, we laughed, we joked. But we were never really friends,.friends out of work. We had inside jokes with one another and I gave him lifts quite a bit. I loved being on shift with him and now I know hes gone I just feel sort of empty

 If only I replied to one of his messages online but we drifted apart as I worked elsewhere.. and today I've just been trying to find some weird hidden meaning in his death..searching my old fb messages for when he last spoke to me. detective-ing his old Twitter feeds for clues..I found a fanbase novel he had written..he even edited it 1 week exactly before he decided kill himself!?!? I'm convinced theres some hidden message within it he was maybe trying to share..to anyone.  I guess I'm just grieving or whatever.

Dont want to sound selfish but I was progressing well on my new tablet dose and what not, but now I feel I'm slipping back into the darkness and depression alongside this.

682,"Do any of you over-identify with bipolar?  / think about it too much?  How does that make you feel?

At first, when I was diagnosed....I was in denial. I did not want to accept it.

The more I began to accept the diagnosis, the more empowered I began to feel. It gave me reasons for why I acted so irrationally during my 2 manic episodes. It helped to know it was not my fault, that my brain is the way it is...and that other people struggle with this illness as well.

However, that being said, I don't want to over-identify with bipolar. In the sense that.... I don't want to feel so connected with it that I don't trust myself anymore. Does that make sense?  What I mean by that...is....when I find myself thinking about it too much, I begin to get scared that I'll have another episode again. That I can't trust my perceptions. side note....

I lived about six years of my life undiagnosed, and manic more often than not. It was definitely an interesting time.

My craziest manic delusion was that I was a sort of divine being with a mission from god, and that dead rockstars were telling me to do things through old records! It's super funny looking back on some of the things I used to believe, and sorting through was was true and what wasn't. I try to have a good attitude about it all and laugh when I can.  Any good stories from others who have experienced mania?"
687,"Where I live we are having to stay home everything is closed and streets have less cars. Part of me really likes the aloneness finally people are leaving me alone. Part of me knows this is going to be very bad for me.

I have bipolar depression and have had it for months. One of the things I do is force myself to be around people and do things even though I don't want to. Now there's nothing to do and no people to be around. No movies no dinner out. Now I can just isolate and get buried in my own negative thoughts. Sleep all evening. Hide.

That's no good. I don't know how I'm going to get through the next few weeks. I wish I could be hypomanic so I'd find a hobby. I just can't get into anything right now. 

Any ideas of things to do when you're forced into isolation?

688,"I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder a few years ago. I have come across some interesting information since then as I decided to study mental health after that.

I can say one thing that continues to amaze me. There are some incredibly, incredibly, simple and powerful mood stabilizers that are very cost effective. How do I know this? I have been logging my moods for quite some time now to build my own statistical analysis and here are some consistent insights that are also established in the scientific community too. Something about lithium I realised today as well.

Did you know water has lithium in it? Just like one of the most well known pharmaceuticals Lithium Carbonate? Lithium carbonate is a concentrated form and can be toxic that's why it needs testing to make sure your organs don't get damaged. It is definitely good in life and death situations as mania used to kill people due to exhaustion.

But to be honest with you, Water, Fasting and Sleep hyigene I have found to have incredible mood stabilizing properties. Today I decided to do a semi fast again and just drink mostly water, plant products and I basically had a huge reduction in what I usually eat of my caloric quantities. I also slept really well. These three choices have shown consistent mood stabilizing properties for me and i was shocked to learn that lithium is a naturally occurring metal in water. By fasting your body also removes the unhealthy energy in your body. These two dietary choices impact the gut brain connection by lightening the burden on it. It's like the gut breathes and so does your brain. You calm down. That's exactly how lithium carbonate works, in the stomach and then you calm down.

I was also surprised to learn that there is a lot on YouTube now about the Gut brain connection and how people who have mood disorders should check their diets and dietary habits."
689,"Hi everyone. My quarantine sleeping time has currently been from 4am to 11am. I am aware I should get back to the/my 'normal' which is 11pm to 8am.

How do you guys cope?"
690,"Hi everyone,

I have to admit, it still feels incredibly strange to me to be explaining my life anonymously to random people on the internet. However, it seems that in what I perceive to be a difficult time, I find solace in writing to random people who may be more willing to listen to my craziness than anyone familiar to me. 

If anyone is listening, thank you. It feels great to be heard. I have been struggling with maladaptive thoughts and feelings since I was a teenager.

Teenage life: Anorexia and Depression
I always assumed I was just “too sensitive” or “too weak to endure the normalcy of life’s given obstacles.” At 13, I became incredibly depressed for reasons still unknown to me. Note: I don’t want this to appear as though it is a sob story. I don’t want pity and for a second brush away the, “oh she’s so emo,” thoughts you may start to think when reading this (that is, if anyone is actually taking the time to read this.) Anyway, middle school and high school are rough for almost anyone who isn’t a well-known athlete, a partier or really into Abercrombie and Fitch. I tried to get along with everyone and I never seemed to really fit in with a particular group of people. When I began to feel alone and invisible, I started to retreat within myself (and within myself, wasn’t the best place to confide.) It is difficult to admit but my parents were very emotionally and oftentimes, physically abusive. My dad was (and still is) angry, violent and controlling. This already sounds like an exaggerated Lifetime Movie. So, I know I know, boohoo, poor suburban middle class girl with mean parents. I was not emotionally equipped with handling emotions such as anger, sadness and loneliness in a positive, constructive way. Therefore, I started to self-harm in middle school. I felt God-less, unloved, invisible and emotionally out of control. I won’t go into details of how I self harmed but it wasn’t to inflict intense harm on myself or anything, just to feel the pain I was feeling inside- outwardly. My mom knew I had done this a few times- but acted like it was an elephant in the room/just a phase/not her problem. Well, long story short, that didn’t help anything (surprise.) I eventually stopped for a while, and for a while I was getting by- almost feeling okay, yanno like a real person. 

When I got to high school, I crashed again. I fell into a dark depression the winter of my second semester (or quarter? I don’t remember these things) and started to hate who I was. I began to think if I appeared happier- and happiness was a skewed fantasy in my mind that entailed: looking the way society deemed “beautiful” (skinny and pretty,) I would then ACTUALLY be happy. But first, I would have to feel light as a feather- because that is what I thought feeling happy would be like. I began to starve myself to feel lighter, weightless. What I thought was myself taking strict control over my life, betrayed me- and took control over my mind and body. I could not stop. I started counting calories and measuring my food, until I believed that I did not deserve food at all. Then, I tricked myself into believing I didn’t deserve water either. I was deteriorating but I couldn’t feel a thing. I was completely void of emotion and that, I believed, was amazing. I didn’t feel sad anymore. I didn’t feel out of control. Because I had rigid, extreme control (or so I thought) over the most important things- my body and mind. I went from normal teenage girl size, to extremely underweight. I was unable to sleep for 2 hours at a time. All of my dreams were of death, dark figures, and skeletons. I was smoking cigarettes to curb my appetite. I was only taking sips of water. And then going to my room to lay in the dark so i wouldn’t think of food because I didn’t deserve to eat. I starved myself completely for 2 months. I wore 4 sweaters at a time because I was always cold and because I wanted to try to hide this from everyone- I still thought I wasn’t good enough, or at the perfect weight to be seen by anyone yet, but at the same time, I knew I looked like I was dying and wanted to avoid confrontation. The few friends I had would ask me if I was going to eat- and i would laugh and say, “I eat so much when I get home- I’m just trying to be healthy.” We all knew I was lying. Eventually, no one wanted to be around me anymore- and I was almost relieved that I wouldn’t have to explain myself or lie to anyone from that point on...I’d just be lying to myself. At one point, talking became a chore. My organs were shutting down and I did not have the physical ability to speak without feeling out of breath. Finally, after almost passing out while walking around my house- I walked up to my mom, stone-faced, emaciated, struggling to live, and told her that I really needed help. The next day, I went to the hospital and was put on an eating schedule. I cried when I had to eat a bowl of cereal. I was only able to comply for a day- the next day- the guilt encompassed me and I refused to eat or drink anything. My dad signed me up for an eating disorder clinic the next week. The assessment process is still a blur. I just remember being weighed and being told I was “the worst case of anorexia they’d seen in a long time.” Yay I finally accomplished something-right? Well, anyway, I stayed there for 6 months and had to leave high school. I met some really amazing people who made me feel like I wasn’t alone, until my insurance ran out and I had to be discharged early. By this time, I was still not at my goal weight, but I was not refusing food. A part of me thought I would be fine- but the majority of me knew that I would leave and use that freedom to relapse. Which, I did, for two years after, on and off. I stopped getting periods, which isn’t as fun as it sounds, and I stopped having a social life. Any romantic relationship I had, I ended because it would get in the way of my disorder, and I didn’t want the confrontation. I was not mentally or physically there for my high school graduation or my high school grad party. Yet, I was still able to keep average grades and somehow got into college.

College
Once I started college, I was still anorexic, but better at hiding it, and I was eating some food but not entirely enough. I was failing a lot of classes because my mind was focused on my weight, my disorder and food. My second semester of college, I met a girl who’d become my best friend for years after. We didn’t talk about my anorexia much, but having someone to be around, and talk to allowed me to eventually...get over it? Weird. Anorexia didn’t fix my thoughts or emotions. I now had to deal with years of suppression. One night, while at home, I experienced my first manic episode. I had a strong feeling that the CO2 alarms in my house were broken and that I had to stay awake to make sure I didn’t die of CO2 poisoning. (I probably sound psychotic- but I guess I’ll get this out there since ya know, I’m an anonymous gal here.) I stayed awake for 4 days. I was losing my mind. On the fourth day, I looked out my bedroom window and saw a man with a coat, glasses and a hat. I thought I was being watched. Everywhere I went, I felt that he was watching me. Yep, I really had lost it. I started writing poems and weird notes that I would journal and put under my bed. I showed some of those poems to my parents- poems directed toward them insisting that they wanted me to die and that I know they would be happy once I just did it. This episode lasted a week and I never thought of it again. I had a lot of anxiety and pressure in college, as most students did. Again, unable to cope, I started experimenting more with marijuana. What became a fun way to hangout with friends, soon turned into a weird, disastrous way for me to “experience the deeper philosophies and intricacies of my mind and of life.” I thought I had a revelation with God. Later, I realized- it was the weed. I started to think I knew things no one else knew, that my vocabulary was profound, that I fully understood the writings of Bukowski and Plath, and that I hadn’t just ruined my mental and spiritual health to the point of no return. I was still going to the gym, getting good grades and was really involved in college- without anyone knowing any of this. In fact, I became an amazing writer because of these strange epiphanies. My junior year, I had my first drink (I was a late bloomer- also, I thought that I’d never drink because of my religious beliefs at the time- which may sound absurd considering, well everything I just discussed.) I rarely drank at parties because I was focusing on my education, but I began to drink until slight intoxication before class, before writing papers or poems, before presentations and before work. This allowed me to get by for a while, until I had my first panic attack. Wow, I really do sound insane. Anyway I drove to the hospital and believed that I was going to...well, you know. I stopped drinking and smoking weed, and tried to finally feel my feelings. A dozen panic attacks later, I decided I needed professional help. 

My First Adult Shrink
My psychologist was a meek, nerdy man in his late thirties. I think I may have been his first real client- and if so, I feel terrible about that. After going back and forth with the usual “how does this make you feel” with the occasional (leans in to mimick real concern) and the (long, deep stares of pity) I was able to explain enough about my life for a formal diagnosis. “What do you know about Bipolar Disorder,” shrink man asked, weirdly looking as though he was on the verge of tears. “Oh here we go,” I thought to myself. So there it was- a diagnosis. I looked up the mental disorder I was categorized into later that night as it was looming in my mind. “Great.” Weeks passed and I was offered an array of mood stabilizers. “This must mean I’m really crazy,” I remember thinking. After I insisted on only considering a drug with the fewest side effects, I was sent on my merry way to let the drug do it’s magic. The medication had to be adjusted 3 times before making me feel somewhat sane. I was a shell of a human. I took that medication for a few years because I felt fine. Not great. Not crazy. Just fine. Which I though, I was fine. 

Post College: Into the Unknown
A few years after being thrown into actual adulthood, I started to doubt the effectiveness of the medication I was on. I realized I had to experience my emotions in order to work through them. Once again, I made a dumb decision. I stopped taking my medications cold turkey and continued to live my life. I became really sexually active, felt very out of control, began to drink more and lost any tinge of faith I had left. I started making irrational decisions. Went on road trips several ours out of stare, on a whim, no planning involved and completely on my own. After a few years, my life caught up to me. I lashed out at work, I lost all of my money and any sense of security I had left, had to leave the apartment I lived in for 3 years and put my pets up for adoption. At this point, I truly believed my life was over. I didn’t have any real friends, a romantic relationship or a family that really cared. I took my beat up car and drove for as long as I could- until I almost reached the state line. It started to get late, and I was able to grasp some rationality back, so I turned around into a military base. I remember asking someone how I can turn around because there wasn’t a clear exit. She told me, and I started driving fairly fast (I don’t know why) and crashed head on into a large metal stint in the road. My life honestly flashed before my eyes. My car was in flames and my airbag had deployed. I was shaking. A tow truck drove me for hours back to my city, where my dad met me. I knew I had completely ruined everything. The next day, I checked myself into inpatient psychiatry where I stayed for a week. I received a new diagnoses from “bipolar II” to “bipolar I.” What an upgrade. I was discharged and moved back in with my parents. After a few months, I found a stable job and started saving up money again. My mental and emotional health still wavers. It’s difficult for me to maintain relationships. I found someone I love and care about, while I am trying to love and care about myself again. I’m trying to know Jesus. I’m just trying to be well for once.

That’s my story summed up. It’s mainly a load of gibberish, but it’s my story nonetheless. Here’s to moving forward and to putting one foot in front of the other, slowly but surely, to rediscover life.

We are having some issues with his alcoholism, and impulsive behaviors. he specifically has one where he buys porn from women in IRL. technically it's their job to sell it (bikini baristas) but its been going on forever and he wont stop even though we have been together forever. and he knows it makes me uncomfortable. He takes meds every single day but he also drinks alcohol every day as well. Everyone says you are absolutely not supposed to do that and I wonder if it just makes his impulse control ever harder."
692,I have no specific trigger i can't calm down and stop the adrenline.  Night time is always worse because when there's no day light and you have to use the lights in ur house it makes my derealization and depersonalization worse things look more dim and gloomy. Ive had EKG done it says I'm fine but I don't know if that's true. I'm all jittery and nothing stops it but Ativan. Feels like I'll lose control to be honest. I'm trying remeron on day 3 no luck. The only thing that seems to help is Ativan but it goes in ur system and than leaves quickly only to start freeking out again....I'm at a point where I'm just going to drug myself up because it's been over a year feeling this 24 hour a day anxiety. Can't work can barley breathe proper.....can't trust doctors to get down to the root of the problem they don't have the patience it's sickening....
693,I want to feel more alive and actually have a manic episode.
694,"What ever situation you are in, you are not alone. There are plenty of us and telling our story makes us stronger. I wish you all strenght on World's bipolar day."
695,"For the first 30 years of my life I was afraid.

I was afraid of my Bipolar Disorder.
I was afraid I would become a drug addict and induce Mania on myself.
I was afraid of death and dying.

All these fears were causing massive amounts of pressure on me.  I turned to drugs to reduce that pressure.  That in turned caused me to cycle harder and faster.  Once I started to relieve that pressure, start taking care of myself, start focusing inward first, start making sure I was healthy before trying to help everyone else, started learning to refill my energy on a regular basis instead of waiting till my battery gets to zero, and stop abusing drugs.  These things have been integral in my ongoing recover from Bipolar 1."
696,"I really shouldn't be here right now, but I want to document how I'm feeling while I'm feeling it.

The best way I can think to describe it is as if I just drank a full cup of coffee...I'm so physically tired, but i can't relax. I do worry about things which elevate my anxiety, but then I can get it to a dull mild level again. I'm so tired from working out. I did a jog/walk today and moved my arms around a lot instead of my steady walk this time. I had this energy I haven't had in years, but now I'm spent, but with that restlessness. I want to cry for a few reasons-that thing that's troubling me...i want to be there to address it, but I know I just need to rest my mind. I'm stressed about remembering to set meat out to thaw when I just want to call it quits for the day (it's too early to set it out now). I'm so tired, but my mind is bored. I'm thinking about all the things I want to write. Started to add to my story for the writing camp coming up since I'm finally feeling inspiration again, but had to stop typing because I was...you guessed it! Too tired (to hold my arms up).

Plus what doesn't help is this neck ache that I woke up with, but forgot to mention all day.

Oh, I didn't even finish that thought! So I want to cry (another reason because I'm frustrated with my marriage and very stressed there, plus the doctor app being canceled) but I can't make tears! Like it feels like that overwhelmed feeling you get right before you vomit, but you only dry heave. Well, it's like that, only I dry cry...sorta...only I don't get the relief after...

So I guess I'm also irritable, but it's not as bad as earlier. Oh but I still feel angry at my husband when I think of his complaining tonight. Something about the mess in the kitchen. I had just worked out, I was too tired to even finish with the yoga/stretch I usually do after and this just tightened back up all my muscles that the exercise was helping. Again, I can calm it down again, but then it sparks up again. It's as if my brain is saying, ""oh! You wanna relax? Well too damn bad for you! Haha!"" Evil brain...

Ok, that's probably enough. I don't wanna bother anyone. I just wanted you to know what I'm going through right now, whatever it may be called. It's not fun. :/"
697,"I'm gonna sound foolish, but I am suffering from this awful mindset for years.

""Life is hard,"" people say. It has a lot of obstacles and just hardships. When I was little, I thought life was like a wave. You have ups and downs. Bad things and good things. Some have greater amount of amplitude than others. But as time passes by, I realize that it is more like an exponent. Life goes exponentially harder to an unbearable level and never stops. This is why a lot of people commit suicide nowadays. They just can't bear it; even Stoic philosophers declare that suffering is unbearable!

But what make me angry is my method of dealing with it. Just suck it up and push hard. Work hard to endure it. You know, toughen up. How? Using unhealthy ways:

-Don't show and express your emotions.
-Work your ass off to the brink of exhaustion. Without rest. Until death.
-Be self-critical and berate yourself to every mistakes
-Drive yourself to perfection. No one is perfect, but you must perform perfectly.
-Quit doing you enjoy. Do not receive comforts of pleasure. Instead, focus on what you need to survive. Read more books on success; essential to survival.
-Do not ask people to emotionally support you. That's a sign of weakness.
-If you suffer from any mental illness, do not take therapy/treatment. Go to the military.
-Do not forgive yourself if you fail. Finding a reason of your failure is a pathetic excuse.
-Focus on what the nasty critics think of you. Pretend that they're building you up.
-Hang around with demanding, hard people. They're your mentors.
-Do not reward yourself. Pleasure is a sinful sign of weakness.

You just have to be the best. Like the movie Whiplash. You have to push so hard that you break. When you succeed, you can somewhat be guaranteed to survive.

And my mind pressures me to be like this. And it drove me like this when I was a teen. I had a severe bipolar disorder, and I was about to have a mental breakdown. Despite all that, I did my homework. Finished it on time. At the cost of my mental health.

From my adult years, I went through hardships. I faced even more anxiety symptoms and unemployment. Now, I live in a different country. These people here demand that unhealthy and dangerous mindset in order for me to survive. And I don't think I can stand the pressure; trying this caused me to have a mental breakdown...

I think this mindset is so idiotic, but I have no other choice if I have to stay in Korea, everybody goes through that..."
698,"I would love your perspective. I am told I often confuse mania for anxiety. How do you tell the difference?

Here is an example: 
This weekend I became very frustrated while cooking dinner. I had a stressful day and could not find what I needed in the cabinets. The result, I tore everything out of the cabinets and pantry, reorganized it all and then returned to the now burned meal I was preparing. 

So what do you think-are instances like this fueled by anxiety or mild mania?"
699,"I'm through.

I'm fuckin' exhausted!

I'm done with this HELL.

I can't do a single damn assignment. My delusional mother rants and screams often, and I can't stand this shit anymore. I have no place to stay, and no one to take care of her. I went to the government to help, but they can only pay $800 for the hospital fee- like that'll be enough... And if the US government pays me $1000, it won't enough to pay off our apartment! My father's business is going slow due to the COVID-19, and I don't know how to pay off. I have to endure every single day dealing with her bullshit- How I am a lie incarnate, spiritual spy, everyone's not trustworthy, she is the spiritually ""anointed"". That everybody else is about to harm her...

I tried to talk some sense into her, for 2 damn years (she was like that for 10 years- but less and less people are helping her now)! Not only that, I yelled at her take her pills properly, and she doesn't listen! She just yells at me and thinks that I'm not trustworthy! In the past, she was so out of control that she attacked other people. Back in the States, she was almost got shot by a neighbor! In South Korea, where we're living, she was attacked by someone!

But I have to work very hard despite the situation- otherwise I'll not survive. I missed out some college assignments due to this horrific shit. But the professor says just work harder, bitching about how everybody is going through hardships. Just push through the pain and work harder... like every fucking Koreans here. But I ain't a Korean. If I do that, I know damn well that I'd go psychotic! We came to Korea because we can't afford the ever-expensive American healthcare. Because of my bipolar disorder, I couldn't finish my college in US. I had 3.0 GPA but I had to throw it all away.

I tried to push through the pain and worked my ass off before. But it made me lose my mind and have mental breakdown. I try to stay away from the tactic, but if I would lose everything fail this opportunity. I have to graduate in order to get a some sort of decent job here. Korea is ultra-competitive, and you have to work your ass off to survive. Meanwhile, US doesn't guarantee survival. I hate this.

And this COVID-19 pissed over everything I hope for. I can work my ass off, but it doesn't guarantee survival. Not only that, I'd lose my mind. I don't think I can make it until graduation."

703,"Hi, all. I'm new to this forum, and am posting because I'd love some support/advice from those of you living with bipolar I. I am a 29 year old male PhD student and instructor.

Back in December, I had my second manic episode and hospitalization. This followed my diagnosis in 2017. My second hospitalization resulted from trying a lower dosage of lithium; it worked fantastically for nearly two months until I rapidly entered a hypomanic episode Thanksgiving weekend followed by a full blown manic episode the following week. I was hospitalized for 10 days, and was still hypomanic for a good 2 weeks after. 

Coming down from all of this in January, I entered the worst depressive episode of my life. Between my depression and adjusting to an added antipsychotic (risperidone then latuda), I was miserable and could barely function/get out of bed. I felt pretty lifeless for about a month, could not do any of my studies/readings/written work as a student, and could barely function as an instructor. Out of desperation, I decided to finish out the academic term, go on medical leave, and then relocate to temporarily live with my parents. 

In a week, I will move back to my home state. My goal is to return to my studies in September, but I have a lot of work ahead of me in terms of getting used to my meds and how they interfere with my thinking/concentration skills. I also have a partner up here whom I am eager to return to. So, I'm worried that my anxieties about the future will make me enter a depressive episode again, and I will, in effect, self-sabotage my academic/professional career. 

Are there any fellow academics on here who have been able to successfully work with their diagnosis? Alternatively, how have y'all coped with the aftermath of rebuilding your life after the devastation of a manic episode? I'd appreciate any advice, and can answer any pertinent questions if you'd like a little more info about me. I hope to be able to hear from a peer because I have good support, but nobody who really ""gets"" what I've been going through."
704,"My father is 64 years old I am 21 years old (f), my whole life i had to deal with my fathers outbursts for no reason, he always thinks i am in competition with him which i dont know what he's talking about.

My father calls me the worst names possible and has disowned me many times because I chose to not be bullied by him anymore because when I was little he would mentally and hit me with all his might, one day he punched my in the face and I told my therapist in highschool and i almost got taken away bY CPS but I lied that he didnt bc my mom told me to. My mom left my father when i was in 8th grade  because of his behavior.

I do not feel any sympathy for my father because he had 25 years to get help and he never did. I hate doing anything for my father because then he says I disrespect him or dont love him when i first started working i got myself in debt to get him what he wanted from love of him, but now I regret getting him anything because he is such a narcissist and doesn't know without my sister and I's help he would be dead in the streets or beaten up because of his attitude.

706,I have been on trileptal and Invega and I recently started having an issue with my eyes where they get stuck looking up. My psychiatrist told me to stop my medications for now but I was just wondering if anybody has had any similar problems resulting from antipsychotics.
707,"Hello!
I would first like to write about my story and later ask a couple questions or if anybody can relate to this.

I have been depressed all my life. I started on antidepressants in highschool and they never really worked for me. A couple years after highschool when I was about 22 I had a manic episode resulting in hospitalization. After using lithium for a while after I came out of it , they eventually put me on quetiapine which I have been using since.  Am now 27.

I have never since had a manic episode or any hypomania. I do still experience lots of depression and anxiety. I have started to wonder that it I taper off my medication what would happen. Would I most likely have a manic episode ? Or would that only happen if I was in a high stress situation with no sleep + THC in my system? (Like the first time)

I just recently saw a bipolar psychiatrist and he has recommended I go on topimax for the mania which will allow me to also take an antidepressant along with it. He said it should help me lose weight as I can be a binge eater (possibly from the seroquel).

I am just wondering if anybody has had a similar experience to me. With no mania /hypomania other than their first and only episode ?Also whether I really am bipolar , maybe the meds are just working well at suppressing the manic side of my illness. Any ideas would be great. Thanks ! :)"

709,"When I first saw a doctor for my bipolar, I was terrified that they were going to ""Take my mania away"". The only reason I forced myself to do it is because I knew if I didn't I would cheat on my boyfriend or steal money from my parents and I felt guilty for having those urges. So I sucked it up, and have been dealing with my illness and ""doing the right thing"" as much as possible for about a year now. I sometimes always miss my manic self - she was a crazy bitch but she was fun. 

Well anyways, another reason I started to get help is because my beautiful pure mania started turning sort of dark. I call it ""dark mania"" (I'm not a doctor) and even if I get off my meds I can't seem to get it back. But I seem to be resistant to meds and do definitely get hypomanic and depressed. It definitely lasts for less time than my past manic episodes (sometimes months long where this is just a few days). Honestly the depression just leaves me weepy and sad and my other symptoms of psychosis worry me a lot more and leave me in a lot more dangerous situations.

But anyways, my whole adult life has basically just been me waiting to get manic to get everything done. From cleaning my house to coming up with my newest great project. The worst is getting manic and making tons of plans and trying to follow up once you come down. I'm sure others know this feeling! I'm an artist and I'm constantly coming up with new ideas. I am in my mid twenties and already having some success in the world of art and design and it's really my only sense if identity. My friends call me the ""mad genius"" which um, offends me a little, but they said it trying to nice or funny I think so I cant be mad. They say that I'm the ""secret weapon"" to our success as an artistic team because I have nothing but ideas. But I get so much more done when I stop taking my meds. Like, they keep prescribing my antipsychotics because I run manic af and when I take them I feel no motivation and when I do take them I do things like write 20 pages of a screenplay in 2 hours or make an entire dress in a day. Like, I have no idea how to function without it, and taking away my ability to make art feels like ripping away part of my identity. I straight up won't take the meds if they make me feel unmotivated. I've been trying not to drink because drinking spurs on mania and my true manic personality embarrasses even the hypomanic me. Lol. After 4 months sober Ive been drinking a lot this week and the mania faded after about a day and now I am experiencing extreme derealization and delusions. I know if i keep drinking it will keep me manic instead but I got sick and my body cant handle it. 

SUMMARY does anyone else have this experience? 

I'm really into Kay Redfield Jameson's book Touched with Fire, which talks about artists who suffered (and benefited from) with Bipolar Disorder.

 Is my mania a gift or is it going to ruin me..."
710,"Hello,

I'm curious about how people have found ways to manage their relationships with friends and family during both the ups and downs. Do you tell people about your condition? Do you stay away from friends and family while you're depressed? if so, how do you explain to them why you're not coming over or answering their calls?

I personally struggle with all this a lot, and I would like to understand the different ways people handle these issues."
711,"my life is lived by a very.. Rigid.. Routine. Up at seven go to the shops at eight, during the week.. Don't go out at all at the weekend. I've complained about how boring it is on this very forum... I do this to avoid people.. I can't take crowded places, the noise in my head becomes unbearable.

Now with this crisis, the shops are as crowded at eight as they are at midday... so when am I supposed to do my shopping ?.. Not that theres anything left to buy... fortunately the only thing I really need is Coke and that's one of the few things that aint selling.. Its up to £1.50 a liter, maybe that's why.. 

Coke and a fag.. And anything else I can just want for... and we're looking at months of this so they tell me... its insane.."
712,Hi I have been suffering from anxiety disorder but I think it could be turning into bi polar is this possible or could it be my brain is tricking me into thinking Like this has anyone experienced this I am both on buspirone and mirtrazipine kind regards
713,"i have severe GAD and depression i dont think im bipolar. im 30 years old and having no luck with SSRI's they did work in the past but not anymore. i swear i have difficulty reading a simple sentence. i was able to read fine as a kid and teen but depression has really kept me stuck in my thoughts for years without exercising my brain. ive lost alot of my cognitive ability. ill have to read things 2 or 3 times to understand it (or try to understand it) and pronouncing words is much harder than it use to be. my mind is stuck on negative thoughts and it cant focus or switch its attention to anything else without major difficulty! i beleive its a combination of depression, anxiety and ADD. please i need help i havent been able to work in years. also does anyone know how you can be tested for ADD like a learning centre i can go to who can determine if i have ADD or a learning disability of some sort?"
714,"TW: parental issues and mention of drugs
Also long winded rant I wanted to get off my chest.

So does anyone here have a parent who also has Bipolar. My mother is bipolar 1 and its strained our relationship since day one...I've lived with my grandparents since I was 6months old and moved out when I was 22...her presense was scarce. When I was 7 she dipped out of Ohio all togetehr and noone heard from her until I was 9 and she was pregnent with the twins. After that we visited florida every year as she had baby after baby, my jealousy was so bad. All these kids she was having and didnt even have time for her two oldest (my sister lived with me and my grandparents.) When I was about 14...start the cycle of her coming and going out of state...letting me get close to the kids before inevitably running again. Im still hurt by all this. To be honest, I feel like I let it define me. To this day she still does these things...I missed half my siblings growing up because when they become to hard to care for she dumps them on their dads....now that I am. Older I relize she was struggling and it was not my fault....but tell that to baby me....tell 7 year old me why you ran....tell 9 year old me why you had to have more kids....tell 16 year old me why you left me screaming at my white bedroom walls to bring you back...tell 18 year old me that shes worth it......tell me you love me. 

Im so lost. I feel vulnrable.and usless and lately Ive been catching myself blaming my Mom for everything. I love her but I want to be part of her life more then anything...without having to use her as a hookup for marijuana or going to a bar. And the worst part is I think shes about to jump ship again..I just want my Mama."
715,"I want to delete all my friends, deactivate my social media accounts, and block forms of communication. I'm too insecure to make love and have romance so I've been single my whole life, and when I see my best friend hug and kiss his beautiful girlfriend I have to go home and cry like a little bitch. I an so lonely, and it makes me very self destructive. I'm definitely struggling to respect myself, and would like any advice."
716,"so....TLDR, about a month ago I landed myself in a hospital for Mania, psychosis, and suicidal ideation.

In my time there I realized something....this place wasn't for me? For one I did not have my cats (my life...my pride and joy) which only triggered my symptoms worse. I was also forced to talk in group therapy, which only caused me to shut down. I do not like groups of people. TBH, this will probably sound mean but i do NOT want to share my thoughts with a room full of strangers and i SURE AS HELL do NOT care that the guy across from me got a divorce and ""just wants to know where he stands.""

Now I am not sure if it was my ODD rearing its ugly head or if I was just not okay with the way things where run. should they not consider the people who really ARE better off at home to recover? what bout the people with ESAs that they depend on....personally one of the things that helps me most is knowing I am doing a good job taking care of my kitties, and for 3 whole days I felt as if I failed them.

The experience made me horrified to ever seek help again....I feel stuck in my own head. I don't want to end up back there which makes me scared to be honest with my doctors.

So what of us ""other people"" the people who easily fall through the cracks of this system because even the most intensive care makes us only worse.."
717,"How are you all at the moment?

I'm a little uncertain, I'm doing ok, but I get in these bipolar moods when I'm triggered. I know that there is an underlying depression there and the meds are just masking it. I really feel isolated and I feel that one of my really close friends has backed right off, barely speaks to me which frustrates me"
718,"I was recently diagnosed with bipolar 2 and I am really struggling to accept this diagnosis. I was just diagnosed in December and find myself flipping between acceptance and denial almost daily. When I read diagnostic criteria and compare my behaviors, i totally see it. On paper it seems simple-I am bipolar. However, in real life it doesn't seem to fit. Until the last six months or so, I was high functioning, maintained steady thoughts and behaviors. But now I am experiencing frequent highs and lows-I feel so out of control of my own thoughts. I have dealt with relentless anxiety/depression for 10+ years but I am used to managing those symptoms. I can't seem to accept this new diagnosis. 

I am curious: what made the diagnosis stick for you? Was there something you read, a conversation, an action? What brought you to acceptance??"
719,"Hey guys i am 28 have bipolar and relationships have been hard to find bc of my illness...I am currently working on a dating site like pof/match..

I am wondering would you guys use such a website or app?"
720,"Well so much for asking for help. If you haven’t been following. I tried to call the few therapists that is available to me for about 6 weeks daily. No reply. Then finally get an appt for Dec. about a week and a half later. My mental health goes further south and I went and canceled it.

I’m withdrawing from the world and everyone around me again. Yay!

good luck to you all. I wish you all the best"
721,"TL:DR - After heavy drug use, I experienced a full manic episode and was hospitalized and diagnosed with Bipolar 1 my soph year of college. I am lucky that it was a beautiful breakdown. So beautiful. I want to give hope to all, and all struggling. What's it like being Bipolar? Here's my positive reframe: WHAT GOES DOWN, MUST COME UP. Don't do drugs. Be hopeful. Spread kindness, love, and positivity.

In Spring of 2017, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder (I was 19 at the time, ripe for the onset of this condition).  I had experienced severe OCD and depression at times prior to this, throughout childhood. I had loving parents, but of course, mental health is a foreign concept to most, especially in Indian culture. For years, out of love, my ""weird"" tendencies got me in trouble with my family (re: Stop washing your hands for so long!! Hey, stop doing that with your fingers!).

Finally, at 18, as I entered college, I was at student health and screened positive for depressive symptoms, and was put on antidepressants. My god, the positive reframe I have here is that at least I can now understand what an extremely dull existence feels like, it's ... no words. That was the first time I realized I had mental health problems, really. It's funny how these things work.

Anyway, I started counseling etc etc, cocktails of meds, and ended up with my lovely (and current! She's been by my side for 4 years now!) psychiatrist. Btw, therapy works. Unfortunately, due to drug use, in spring 2017 I experienced a manic episode (ex: 0 need for sleep, high energy, chaotic racing thoughts, grandiosity, and in my case extreme happiness). This resulted in my diagnosis of Bipolar 1, which means you've had a full blown manic episode. My main theme was called ""Love Universe,"" which essentially is the idea that the end of human suffering will come if we are all truthful and kind to each other, simple. I'd love to tell you about my time in the hospital, it was wonderful. Being manic is different for everyone, and for me, aside from needing horse tranquilizers to fall asleep, I had a great time. I talked to everyone on the floor, wrote poems for patients, played games, wrote a 25 page manifesto with crayon one night. All I want(ed) was for people to be happy. 

The months following were hard. Often, most highs are accompanied by lows. I was still very happy at first, but you know, time passes and feelings change. Eventually, I went back to being mostly depressed all the time. Recently, I've realized that being bipolar means you don't know how you'll feel when you wake up each day. You don't know if it'll be a day you can sleep for 15 hours, or one that you want to frolic around. The instability can be annoying. 

One thing I've realized, not smoking weed will do WONDERS for your mental health and productivity. I've been doing well, well enough to write you this email. 

Here's how I view things, given the literal ups and downs that us bipolars face. WHAT GOES DOWN, MUST COME UP.

Happy to talk further."
722,"Ok, 

Hi everyone, I am new to this group. I wonder, if anyone has any experience or knowledge of driving with bi polar.. 

I haven't been diagnosed with bi polar.. However, I have a suspicion I may be.. 

I am concerned about going to see a doctor incase I lose my HGV entitlement, as this is how I feed my family.. 

Anyone??"
723,"Eight years ago I had a mental breakdown.which turned my life upside down, it lead into severe depression .the first month of it I was really low then I woke up in the morning and felt like the depression was gone and I was cured.i went to work feeling amazing like I was on top of the world full of energy and that I was the boss(normal colleague) I had all the symptoms of hypomania which I didn't even no what is was back then like talking fast changing subjects can't stand still talking loudly working fast.getting annoyed because no-one was working as quick as me etc .the next day I crashed straight back down in to a low state.i was like this for about one year, I had on and off hypomania symptoms.for two days which comes and goes then I got help and my pdoc gave me sertraline.100mg and never had hypomania ever again. Bipolar type 2 you need to be Hypomania for minimum one week so I wasn't in that category"
724,I just entered a poem into a local library poetry contest. I'm really psyched and am feeling really good about it. I hope it wins. I don't know if it's the best poem I've ever done but I really do like it a lot. My fingers are crossed. It would really mean a lot to me if it wins.
725,"All those on this crazy rollercoaster will get this.... what is it like to actually feel normal and ok? (I feel amazing when manic) (shitty when depressed) 

So after 12 days my manic spell ended with a crashing halt... my appetite is back, my thinking is slower and so is my talking. I'm actually trying to think about how to get everything back on track financially after my spree.... and for last 2 days I dont even wana breath I'm that tired... I dont wana cook or bathe I literally just want to lay and do nothing I feel blank.... deflated.... empty almost numb.

Reason for posting is am I in a normal period and just exhausted or is this the start of depressive phase.... 😔😴"
726,"I just can't concentrate on anything for longer than five minutes... its crippling me.. Yesterday was a complete disaster and this morning was even worse.

I woke up im agony at six this morning.. Its now two in the afternoon and I still haven't gotten myself together...

I wish I could just die in my sleep.. Just fall asleep and never wake up"
727,"Does anyone experience watered down versions of hypomania? I've noticed a cycle, I'm usually and have always been more depressed than anything, but when it breaks I think I'm in a weak hypomania. I have trouble sleeping, buzzy head similar to caffeine buzz, forget to eat, drink and wash enough, talk too much, can't keep up with things/lose track too easily, make lots of mistakes, have lots of busy thoughts in my head (not as bad as properly racing thoughts) - I think stress is making this more apparent right now. What I'm not getting is happiness, euphoria, positivity, ideas, crazy thoughts. I used to get all this with hypomania in the past. I thought all this had kind of gone away. I'm no longer diagnosed bipolar or under MH services."
728,"My bipolar disorder has been acting out crazy. Last year was crazy. I was so sick. Now I am trying to gather pieces of what's left of me.
I was in a psych ward five times during last year. I believe that's a lot. A few ODs, some self-harm, hopelessness, psychotic depression. Also had some hypomanic periods. 
Now I am in a weird state of okay. I am finally okay but my mind is fragile. Being okay is a strange feeling after so much pain and hurt. I am on my toes all the time waiting for a new crash.

How is your bipolar doing? Anyone in the same situation? 

Also check out what I write about bipolar disorder at Flawless Mind"
729,"I can’t possibly try to put into words how it feels to be defeated by your own mind. And I know I don’t have to try to explain because I’m sure most of you guys know exactly how I feel or at least similar. 
Im on another insomnia spell again. This came out of nowhere this time. I usually get a very over active mind with racing thoughts a few days before my period and then a couple days after I get my period I start to feel relaxed and i feel “normal” again. 
it’s not always that way but sometimes. This time it stuck around. My brain feels like it’s going to spin out of control and feels like 109 radio stations all trying to come in at once. I can’t even slow it down long enough to think about what the thoughts are even about. Sometimes it’s just this hyper alert static feeling(if that makes any sense) It Keeps me from sleeping and the more I go on the worse it gets. Yesterday and today I had to leave work early because I was so exhausted I couldn’t function, super emotional and I work in a very public place with lots of people traffic in and out and I can’t hold it together. I’m not getting the euphoric feeling of mania. I have before when I was younger but now I get agitated, and I just feel like I want to stand on top of the world and scream and cry and then shoot my self. I’m not suicidal. But the level of intensity in my brain makes me feel like that’s what I want to do. I get very nervous and scared, i get self conscious and paranoid thinking everyone can tell I’m a wreck and is judging me and viewing me as this pathetic failure. I’ll get to a point of such extreme irritability that even if someone looks at me I want to snap and lose my shit on them and I have well planned out thoughts of this happening. Now, the lack of sleep for days can put a “normal” person in this state wouldn’t you think? So am I feeling all these things because of sleep deprivation? Or are all these things and thoughts causing my sleep deprivation? I’ve seen multiple doctors in my entire life, psychiatrists, been hospitalized a couple times too. It’s like they  can’t figure out my diagnosis. I’ve no doubt depressive episodes and pretty much non stop anxiety but as far as bipolar, a couple doctors seem to think I have it but not sure. likely because I’ve never been hospitalized for major manic episodes. I think I’ve had some manic like periods in my twenties looking back, but I wrote those off as my crazy, self destructive and rebellious years because I had such a shit childhood it’s no wonder I acted out. Anyways, where am I going with this? I want so bad to know what’s wrong. It’s frustrating when educated and well paid doctors can’t even give you a straight answer. They can go down their list of 7000 medications and name a couple that “may or may not“ make you better or worse. And then you can try, and cross your fingers that they won’t turn you into this fat, lethargic, emotionless potato with uncontrollable face twitches or make your insomnia worse and turn your brain into this overworking, fearful organ that hears colours and sees music and finally cracks and kills themselves because there seems to be no escape. The best was when I last saw my psych and I was going through my last insomnia period which was about 2 weeks and I pretty much crawled into his office I was so exhausted and told him what was up and he gives me the names of two medications I could try, I said I wanted to think about it and do some research and I went home to do that and the very first possible side effect of both those meds was insomnia...INSOMNIA! Like, are you serious!? Mr doc, how do you even sleep at night!? Anyway, I know ya”ll aren’t doctors and can’t  diagnose me bla bla...and thats ok. Just because you give your opinion doesn’t mean it comes with a prescription attached to it so it’s all good. What are your thoughts, anyone ever in a similar boat? Do I need a life jacket? Should I just jump in the water and see what’s next?
I’m in a battle with myself. And I’m kicking my own ass, how does that even happen!?
Thanks in advance if you read this mess 🥴"
730,"I overthink things a lot. When I do, it makes me more upset, angry, confused, etc. but I can't help it. I try to focus on positive things, but often I continue thinking about things in my life I want to be better/ that I want to fix. A lot of that comes down to relationships. Relationships that I wish would go smoother. I have to accept that relationships are two way streets, and I can't change the way another person feels or thinks. But it is hard. I should stop over thinking those scenarios, but I can't....

Does anyone else have that same struggle?"
731,"Diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder. What I find unusual is that when I have a good sleep my anxiety level is quite high the next day.
However, when I don't sleep at night or sleep very little my anxiety is very low the next day. Seems to be the opposite of what should happen.
Anyone else experience this?"
732,My wife is usually fine but she got real sad cause around christmas her mom went to hospital. She had been sad for almost a month then we got into a minor arguement about why she wouldnt talk to me about stuff then said maybe if she visited her mom she would feel better. Said she felt like she was in a bad head apace and not to talk about stuff till she left. She also said she felt she might be bipolar. After she left she now feels like she doesnt want to talk to me. Has a distorted view of are marriage even said we should get a divorce and maybe later we can try again. Her family are noticing she not acting the same seems stressed she talks to people that she didnt get along with now there best friends. She barely contacts me wont talk on phone or see me in person. I found out she told her sister she has been trapped in a prison marriage for 11 years. Says she cant wait to flirt with guys and be free. She only text me and its like 4 words max. She got a new job by her moms and says everyone is amazed how great she is doing at work. She barely sleeps and i am her worst enemy in the world ahe will talk to others but not too me. She did the same thing minus job in 2011 she left and wouldnt talk to me for like 4 months. Its like same thing she got real sad then just ups and takes off then comes back months later. It started jan 29 i think she was depressed before and now she is manic cause she is acting really different and her family doesnt understand why. Her sister is twisting her thoughts as well. It is now march 7th and she says we need to get a divorce cause she doesnt like ar marriage feels like its been tarnished. I told her i would move quit my job and we could be closer to her mom she says no to it all. I dont know if this is really her or if she is in a bipolar state. Everything was fine till here mom went to hospital. Now i am left wondering do i get the divorce shes telling me to or not. My dad says i better file first but i really dont want to if this isnt her really thoughts. But i also dont want her destroying everything. She never had any problems besides 2011 and now 2020. Not sure what to do?
733,"How do you feel in social situations?
Do you have social anxiety?
If so, how does it affect you?
I'm interested because I'm normally sociable, but since being I'll, I feel different like socially awkward I want to know if I feel what you feel"
734,"So, I have this thing that my body does during certain times. Usually when I am having a crisis that leads my body to dissociate. The strange thing is while I am dissociating I get the chills and start to freeze and shiver. Then my feet start to go numb as if I was getting hypothermia. I've often wondered if because my body is going into protection mode that physically lowers my temp. I know that dissociating causes the body to start slowing things down like heart rate and things like that but I've not yet heard of the freezing feeling from anyone ever. Who knows? Maybe I start to go into shock? Yes I get the out of body thing that feels like I'm on autopilot like everyone else but this cold thing has got me a bit concerned. I forgot to mention it to my doctor the other day. Even though I've been going through dissociative episodes for years, I didn't even know what they were or that anyone else got them until I read a random post by another forum member. So, I just was made aware of this monday morning by my doctor. I always thought I was just some freak of nature because when I tried to explain it, people would look at me like I was an 👽. There are other times (not in a dissociative phase) when I get body shocks. It feels like I'm being electrocuted. Like my whole body is hooked up to a current that gets stronger until I freak out and jump around to shake it off. I do have neuropathy so I thought it might be part of that. I did tell my medical doctor about the body shocks and he had no idea. I've had MRIs, EEGs and had a nerve test. It's a mystery. Anyway, I was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like these 2 things or am I the only one? 😒"
735,"Started a new job which she loves in the medical field.  Last few days sha started to be a happy manic.  Easy signs to read. Takes her Latuda 60 mg each day.  She thought to go up 80 mg as anxious with new job, but thought she was goo on 60.  Last 3 days it’s obvious she’s manic. Trying to see a doctor on Monday if she agrees. She’s expected Back to work on Tuesday. Very worried she’ll loose job of her dreams Is there any chance she cal level off before doubling latuda to 160?"
736,"Living in a nation where benzos are bad, but prozac is the answer to every mental health illness. If that doesn't work they try out the brothers and sisters of this usless drug against anxiety and panic attacks (bipolar of course). If you're on benzos they might up it once or switch it. Complain too much and they take it away and think your addicted. Just because it's not strong enough doesn't make me an addict. I was accused of this in my recent hospital stay in November. Because I had all my scripts filled by my new doctor after moving to Illinois. He said to me because I have a drinking problem I shouldn't take them and probably didn't tell my GP Im a drinker. Ok no obviously not, most times I drink to get rid of anxiety and depression. I know it's temporary, but if you take away the benzos Ill opt for alcohol more often if you take away medication that works. But just because I drink alcohol doesn't mean I abuse my medication.  You build a tolerance with benzos, so if I abused it, there would be no meds for my actual panic and anxiety. It would gone in a week and Id have a history of seizures (which I dont). My husband had a problem and stole my benzos. Took half my script in a week and not too long after confronting him he had multiple seizures 🤦‍♀️. I understand the fear for doctors to prescribe the stuff, but some people really need it."
737,"I have been feeling really low recently. Bored fed up with life. Hating on myself! Feeling uncomfortable at work, making mistakes, feeling paronid. I hate when ppl ask me what i'm doing on my days off.

My bf and i aren't great at the moment and tbh haven't been so for quite some time. We don't argue or anything like that but life is just boring with us i don't feel much love!

738,"I just have to tell you all that I love this place! It's amazing to me how with an extreme manic phase that's been coming on, how I freaked out on my doctor, had to be put on emergency sedation in order to keep out of the psych ward, utterly being caught up in delusional thinking, dealing with hallucinations, having a panic attack, not sleeping and being totally out of control, I have managed to still be able to give and receive help and insight here with people just like me.

740,"How long did your first psychosis last?  Did it take you a while to realize that your sense of reality was way off? 

How did others around you react? 

I'm reflecting on my first episode of psychosis. It took me a while to come down from it. The beliefs I had during my psychosis felt so real, I held on to them for several days, even weeks afterwards. People around me were shocked. My episode unfortunately happened publicly, so my friends did not know what to think or what had happened. They distanced themselves from me immediately following. Feeling isolated like that made it harder to pull out of my head and back into reality. Can anyone relate?"
741,"At the moment I'm at the stage that I'm withdrawing myself from people. I've stopped caring about my appearance, have lost my confidence and the weight gain due to the meds is getting me down. I like this forum because I feel I don't want to burden my family and friends about my illness. Honestly I think people have their own issues and don't want to know about mine.

It's difficult when you as a person loses part of your personality, like I'm usually really outgoing and now I'm very introverted, I find it ok if I have visitors in my home though.

What do you do to help you feel more like yourself? I haven't had a major episode yet I just caught it at the early warning sign stage but I wonder if this will progress or since I'm staying on meds they will prevent an episode Beginning"

I danced for yearscand supported myself. I married my husband who told me to quit. Now we're broke because his gambling and quitting jobs. I blew up in his aunt's face today for her husband telling me to control the dog after i got out the shower while he hooked it up. I didn't ask you to come to my house and give me a damn fridge. Yea ungrateful because I hate pitty. His aunt was telling me its because we need it we need to get on our feet. But its too much help sometimes. Sorry  I got off topic, they were selfritious today and I don't appreciate it and have them demand respect, I want them the f*** out. I let his aunt know it too. He's on drugs and gambling, your enabling him lady. They don't do it for me but him Im sure. But he's my husband and it's my home too. If he doesn't get it together I might have to leave. I know in the past I've done screwed up things but he uses it as an excuse to when he uses drugs or gambles. Well you did A, B, and C and I forgave you. Screw that if he keeps that one up."
746,I often gain up to fifty pounds during mania without even realizing it and it takes forever to get it off. Does anyone else experience weight gain during manias like this?
747,Just wanted to seek some advice. I am 44 years old Bipolar 2 with mild schizophrenia. I am currently off my meds that dont seem to work anyway and I dont have insurance to pay for them. I also have kidney issues which prevents me from taking lithium which is the only meds that worked for me. I recently lost my job through no fault of my own and went from living in an apartment to living in a camper. I am severely depressed. I did manage to finish my degree but cant find a job in that field. Now I am so deep in debt with student loans and about to lose my car because of no job. I have bounced around therapists over the years and it's always the same textbook junk never any progress. How do you recover from all this? Where do you even start? My parents try to help they want me to be on disability. The thought of having to go through that processst gives me anxiety especially if I do it and get denied. All I keep thinking is I wasted my time going to school. I feel like I was treading water for a long time and now I am just drowning. Life has to better than this. I can't take any more.
748,"So I have bipolar 2 and for the most part stable (yay) however i am trying to lead a healthy life style and came across this problem. when i do cardio type workouts i feel depressed afterwards for up to a day or two as it progressively gets better.
however when i do bodybuilding i do not feel depressed after....... in fact i feel pretty good after. 
so i am posting this to see if anyone else has see this in their life and if maybe there is a solution?"
749,"hi, my first ever post here so sorry if I mess something up in advance, but I’ve always had a question that can’t really be answered by just a google search. I know it’s bad forum but I occasionally go off my meds for a little bit (forget to refill a prescription, laziness such and such) and after a few days to a week I can start to feel my thoughts change.I never let it get to far before I go back on my meds but It’s kinda like a different version of me is waking up so to speak. Always just called him the crazy me. But it’s like whole world gets altered a bit. The way I view things, my crazy thoughts racing all over the place and I’ll have Inter-dialogue convos between crazy me and my normal thoughts (usually arguing and doing or not doing stupid stuff.) but I suffer from depression really bad, it’s almost constant to a certain extent. So I thought maybe it’s just that it’s easy to see/feel the hypomania start to kick in. Was just curious if anyone has ever felt like it’s almost like there’s another (crazy) version just living inside of you."
750,"I have been diagnosed with bipolar 1 almost 5 yrs ago. The only manic episodes I ever had always progressed into psychosis pretty quickly. I stopped smoking weed over 2 yrs ago and haven't had a manic episode since. It makes me wonder if it was solely caused by marijuana. I've always dealt with depression, but over the past 3 yrs the depression is terrible. My depression can last for 6 months give or take. I also have social anxiety that magnifies x100 when in depression. I started going into depression again at the end of November. Started out sleeping a lot with no energy, quickly spiraling into full blown depression. Rarely leaving the house for 3 months now. This is the weird part I don't understand..... I have tried a few different meds that have helped and these are the 2 that worked for me, first Latuda and most recently Lamictal. Both have done the exact same thing! They will start working and the depression is completely lifted and I was able to live again. Then after about 6 or 7 months of doing great it's like the medication completely ceases to work anymore. Is this normal? I know that you can be on meds that after several years will loose effect, but after a few months?!?! I've never posted about this online before, but I don't know what else to do. I hope I can get a lot of insight."
751,"I know the responses I’m going to get. “No”, “Of course not” 
If you take someone who’s been in chronic physical pain most of their life with no cure or hope for getting pain free for their future and they commit suicide, is it sad? Sure it is but would you understand? Would you empathize? Sure you would. So if you’re mentally ill, and most of the time when I’m mentally Ill, Im physically ill as well. And I’m 36 years old, been sick 90% of the time since I was a teenager...then why shouldn’t suicide be more understood by people? Sure they will be sad and they will miss you but is it not more selfish of them to keep you here so they won’t feel sad, while you’re in terrible pain? I don’t want to hear from people that “you’re stronger than that” bla bla bla. I’m extremely strong. No one understands how strong I’ve been. But I’m feeling defeated against my illness. I’m tired. I crave peace."
752,"I stayed up all night and watched louis theroux documentaries back to back.. By the early hours I was in a daze.. Then I started talking to myself and that's how I spent the night and all day today.. And now my throat is killing me. I do that thing where I'm too self-conscious to sit here for a night and a day talking to myself out loud (it'd make me feel like a dick) so instead I've been whispering.. Which is fatal... all that tension on my vocal chords hours and hours burns 'em out.. Now I feel like I've got tonsillitis.. And all the painkillers I have taken ain't helping any.

I can't concentrate, focus or settle in on anything... I need the noise from the programs (all of which I've seen many times before) to cover up the silence.. Kind of like listening to music,  but music is no good... with music theres a chance I'll start singing along and that would stop me from talking... So now I'm hyper and I don't want to stop.. I'm saving a ton on pills.. I haven't taken any.. I don't need 'em, they'll come in handy another day.

The next bit is going to be tricky.. For the last hour before bed I should put on some relaxing soft Jazz and read.. Question is..... can I shut this down 'manually'.. I've gone past tired, I've got my second wind.. Now I'm awake.. Well wake... and I'm kinda having a good time. 

I've just got to land this shit !.. Trouble is I'm no good at landing.. I like to fly... soar like an eagle !!! Now I'm like a virgin attempting a carrier landing at night in a F15... anybody know what 'call the ball means' ? ten'll get you fifty if I don't hit the deck.. bounce and end up flying off the other fucking end !!!

Okay okay, go round again go round again.

753,"Do you drink alcohol? how much? how often? how does it make you feel?

I used to drink a lot of alcohol, but after my last hospitalization a year ago I decided to quit.
With one exception during christmas day 2019, when I drank a glass of wine. That night I could not
sleep properly, I had weird thoughts and I become emotionally unstable. After 3 days
I was back to normal."
754,I want to be a Certified Peer Recovery Specialist. But I feel like I'm in no shape to be one. I don't think I could help other people with mental illnesses because I can't even help myself. I'm going through Vocational Rehabilitation to get a job. I told them I want to be a CPRS but they have quotas they are supposed to meet and just want to get people employed and don't really care about whether people are happily employed or not. I'm afraid they are just going to get me with some kind of monotonous job that is going to be nothing more than drudgery and I won't be able to tolerate it. I'm on disability right now and I'm thinking my choice to try to get back into the workforce is a mistake. But I feel so useless and worthless on disability. I feel like I'm a burden to society and contribute nothing of value. It's an impossible dilemma. Either I work and be miserable or else I stay on disability and drag society down. I don't like either choice.
755,"I get heavily embarrassed by my manic episodes after I've come down from them, which then further leads me into the depressive, isolated/ agoraphobic phase. Debilitating toxic shame is making it hard to snap out of into a healthy medium. I usually forgive myself but my episodes have gotten stronger.  

My manic episodes are always so public. I talk fast, I spend all my money creating new businesses, I post suggestive photos on Instagram, I hit on whoever I want to, I make 10,000 plans, I take drugs. This means that the most amount of people saw me in that state & i'm usually left with fewer supporters by the end of an up stint. 

Is this something you experience? How can I accept that manic episode will happen & to navigate the shame afterward? I'm off drugs & drink have been for a while now. I'm doing all the self-care it's just the shame that haunts me."

757,"Does anyone else have bipolar disorder but without the depression part?

I had 2 manic episodes. They were acute and isolated.  I didn't have depression before or after. At least I don't think I did. My sickness came on within a matter of days, both times. Racing thoughts that led to breaks in reality. 

Can anyone else relate?"

759,I wish the world was something different than it is. But it's not. The world is cold and cruel out there and I have lived a sheltered life with my parents. But my parents are getting up there in age and won't be around forever. When they are gone I worry about what will happen to me. I'm scared that I am in for a rude awakening one of these days. I don't know what I will do. I love my parents. They've given me a happy life in spite of me being bipolar. But once they are gone I feel like I'll be thrown to the wolves so to speak. I'm just not prepared for the real world.
760,"For as long as i can remember, i have always  been in denial of various symptoms and this was encouraged by my parents who like every parents, didn't want to have a sick child.

The fact is, by registering on this forum, I tried making a first step towards acceptance... 

One of the problems:
Sometimes i am another person: I have incredible brain activity, I speak to myself for hours so much that I can't sleep. I tried everything during approximately 3 years: specific vitamins/minerals, calming music, even meditation which worsened my dissociation (I dissociate a lot) and after an ""episode"" (which is very intense) i am back to a ""normal"" state and I can for instance write on the forum. 

And I AM LEFT WITH THE CONSEQUENCES of what this ""person"" (?) has done. Because it is nothing like me. I have a quiet/very rational personality and I do not feel much honestly. There is NO continuity between who I was and who I am now. It is like a brutal transition. I woke up and felt myself less agitated than in the past 2 weeks. I have work to do that was put behind and I just want to shout to the world it was not me because God knows I was (again) not in my shoes.

And before acknowledging this when I was in a ""normal"" state I would look back and tell myself ""it was just my stupidity, my relatives are right"". I would DENY it. But ""coming back"" from one of those phases (?). It is like I have the transition, the proof just in front of me and I needed to write it.

Today and yesterday I called approximately 6 times different therapists. None of them responded. Is that a sign? Honestly i am sick of this endless stuff but I fear seeing a therapist because I do not trust people in general. Probably gonna deny it until something big happens.

Thank you for reading, this of course is not the complete list of these different little things I have noticed but it was long enough :)

Ps: I posted this in the Bipolar section however I won't self diagnose and other things make me think I am Borderline..."

Long story short. I was need free for about three years.

I just had a baby almost three months ago. I started having my early warning signs, got to the point that I couldn't make a simple decision got assessed and am back on meds again. Baby is bottle feeding now.

I'm glad I knew about my early warning signs, but feel like I don't have anyone to talk to regarding this issue. So thought I would come to the forum."

764,"Hi, I am new to the forum so I hope I have posted in the right topic.

I dont even know where to start.... Officially she was diagnosed 10 years ago but she doesnt believe in psychiatry so she doesnt take any medication. I think she has suffered from bipolar disorder since she was born.

Right at this very moment I have to endure the worst insults from her because I dared to criticize her SLIGHTLY (I asked her to not tell me the same sad story from her past over and over again because she herself told me she only wants to think positive thoughts now and it bothers me too).

As usual she is talking on the phone to my sister complaining about me, how dare I insult her in the worst possible manner after all she has done for me, even though I am the worst daughter in the world. She says she is such a wonderful person and everyone is taking advantage of her and nobody appreciates her after all she is doing for everyone.

I know she is sick but I get so frustrated I want to scream and cry. There is nothing I can say to her because she either misinterprets everything I say or she doesnt even understand what I mean. Often she forgets what she said to me and claims the next day that I SAID what she actually said. If I try to explain that the opposite happened, she gets so aggressive.

She continues telling me how every miserable thing in our family is my fault. 

Guys, how can I deal with it, what can I say if she doesnt let me finish one sentence and falsely interprets my words and instead brings out EVERY SINGLE MISTAKE from my past? And all just because I asked her not to tell a specific story over and over again...."
765,"Is rapid cycle a myth ? My 'shrink' assures me it doesn't happen.. Or can't happen. But last week I was depressed and suicidal.. Then I had a traumatic Monday and now what I'm feeling is calm relief. This morning was a bit stressful but I had everything done by midday, so had a quiet afternoon watching a film. 

Last week I felt caged up, the walls where really closing in on me.. Now I'm happy here in my little box. Mornings are a bit tough.. But that's what pills are for.

766,"Day 6 of my elevated phase (I'd say manic but I'm waiting on my psychiatrist diagnostic app)

After first 2 nights of getting less than an hour a night I go to see doctors this is second time they have prescribed zopiclone... offered benzodiazepines for day time to try and stop the racing speech, thoughts and I feel like my hearts racing but I say NO! 

Night 1 - 1 hour 15 min
Night 2 1 hour 5 min
Night 3 I took zopiclone slept 6 n half hours but broken
Night 4 2 hours 
Night 5 I took zopiclone 5 30 min
Night 6 undiceded weather to take tablets or not.

Here's my theory. I'm tea total dont smoke and anti drug I dont even like paracetamol..... the docs warn on the addictive ness of these meds so now I'm paranoid I'm going to get addicted 😫😫😫 how do you all use zopiclone? 

ANY other sleep tips?"
767,"Having my first manic episode was terrifying. I did not know what was happening. No one around me did either.

I got professional help right away. The process started out slow. I had a relapse and was hospitalized.

Accepting my diagnosis of bipolar was very difficult, but I was willing to face it because I had no other choice and I wanted to get better.

The hardest part in all of it was losing friendships that had been in my life for many years. It was so surprising and hurtful that they would suddenly leave and not offer any love or support. All they wanted was distance from me.  The stigma on mental health runs deep. People don't want to show empathy toward someone with a mental illness. Their gut reaction is to protect themselves from it (as if it's contagious.)  Very sad. Very disappointing. Going through this made my recovery a lot harder. When I needed them most, my friends were not there."

774,"Hello, this is my first post, it’s nice not to just float out in space with this very difficult experience. My story is that I had been on 250 mg of Seroquel for 8 years in combination with Lithium which kept my bipolar II in pretty good control since 2010.  I then had a hypomanic episode in November 2019 that lead to my psychiatrist raising my Seroquel from 250 to 350 mg to help me sleep as I was not sleeping for 3 nights (not to control the hypomania itself).  This turned out to be a terrible misjudgment as after about 2 weeks on the higher dose, I started to have severe vertigo as an adverse reaction. This same psychiatrist would not believe my adverse reaction/toxicity was due to the sudden jump in Seroquel, so I ended up switching psychiatrists after feeling talked down to and essentially abandoned.  The new psychiatrist believed me and is a reasonable, compassionate person.  He and I agreed I must come off Seroquel and quickly due to the vertigo  toxicity which had me basically immobilized. In 3 days, I came down from 250 mg to 50 mg.  The vertigo disappeared but within days after, I started to have insomnia (I am now sleeping with sleep meds), nausea and acid reflux, headaches and now about 6 weeks in to the withdrawal, the headaches are replaced by terrible dizziness and even more severe nausea.  It’s really scary and painful going through this to say the least, especially not knowing when it will improve.  Anyone experienced anything like this with Seroquel/Quetiapine?  Thanks in advance."

777,"Anhedonia without Depression after mania/ physical and emotional numbness

I'm struggling to see why I should live with this. After an episode of 6 day mania last year, I fell into this state where all my emotions are blunted. My body is numb as well, I can't feel anything, life is completely uncomfortable. I'm not depressed but I can't feel frisson or emotion at all, negative or positive. Is there a cure for this? My CBT therapist said it was best to wait it out but its hard to wait out a life with no joy, laughter or relaxation. How can the human brain be so capricious? Why would it do this to someone? 

Its important to note that whilst I wasn't psychotic during the mania, I was generally running around talking to people at a conference wild eyed, feeling hedonistic and starry eyed... so did this episode severely damage my brain chemistry? What's going on? I had these manias/ hypomanias on and off for three years until I finally crashed into this last year. SSRI did not work at all for my current predicament. Genuinely thinking of ending it all, the human mind is exorbitantly cruel."

i am diagnosed bipolar but pretty sure I have bpd. My whole life I’ve felt out of the loop, like I’m not even sure that I exist. I recently moved to nYC and am getting used to having a new job, new apartment, dealing with new people and social situations as well as not seeing my friends that often. I have a boyfriend ( favorite person) who I very much am in love with, who is also diagnosed bipolar.
My bpd causes me to alternate between extremely contentment and bitterness/ disgust depending on how much attention I’m PERCEIVING that I receive. I take immeasurable things like him being on his phone and comforting other people as offensive when I KNOW in my brain it’s not. It’s awful because I want to have a good time hanging out and be fun and happy but because of my illness I’m instead distant and come off as sad. He understands my situation perfectly, I just wish that I could not be this way because it hurts me and makes me feel like he thinks poorly of me ( even though I don’t think that’s true) I just wish I could be a better girlfriend. I think because I don’t have many friends here yet I’m especially triggered and jealous. I just want to know there are people out there who feel the same.

I'm kinda scared at the moment because until this moment I never truly thought I had mental health problem I knew something was different about me, but I didn't think it was that serious, it started this morning as I was on twitter looking at my profile and thought why is my bio saying this I don't people to see this and decided to put random emoji to hide myself and then came thought why did I feel like this bio two days ago and now I feel like hiding myself and not showing my ""true"" colors? then I searched google for ""feeling like a different person everyday"" came reddit post about guy having bipolar disorder and I thought I had very similar experiences in my life, for example, this thing of changing everything about me day after day was present since my childhood when I was around 11 - 12, my girlfriend at a time normal blonde girl kind warm and after being with her for a while when I was going back home randomly at traffic light I thought I'm bored of her and sent her a text we're breaking up, nothing more and I never saw her again...there were a lot of these experiences and every day I feel different one day I could change a whole world in a day another day I want to leave everything behind and live on a beach without anyone and die alone, other days I feel like I shouldn't do anything and give myself a break other days I work till I can't look no more and fall asleep in my chair. While writing this I thought how does it feel to be normal? Do these weird normal beings(bad sarcastic joke) just have regular days with same emotions no upswings no downswings and live everyday same? If someone can share anything it would help a lot because currently, I don't know what to think. Love you guys and gals."
787,"When I woke up this morning.. Well it was more like regaining consciousness.. I was boiling hot and sweating profusely and I couldn't escape the heat.. My first thought was that I left the heating on... So I got out of bed still half asleep to pee and check the heating... But the heating was off and the flat was cold.. And yet I was still boiling.. My body temperature was just way to high.. So I go back to bed and tried just putting the quilt over the bottom half of my body.. But that left my arms and shoulders cold.. Try as I mite after half an hour of wriggling round I just couldn't get comfortable.. So there was nothing for it I just had to get up.. Still half asleep and still burning up I made it to the living room and turn on everything.. All my windows to the world...
I took my first round of pills... And they had zero effect.. So the next thing to go to was Diazapam.. I save them up for just this sort of thing.. So I took a handful of Diazapam.. And now I'm starting to feel better.. My body has stop shaking and my temperature has come down to a more manageable level.. But I don't get it.. What's making me feel this bad....
Last night before I went to bed I did everything right.. The last couple of hours last night I did the right thing.. I turned off my main computer, turned off the Tv.. And turned on my lesser computer... I put on some soft, slow, coffee house jazz... I know absolutely nothing about real jazz.. But if you type 'coffee house jazz' in to YouTube you get 3 and 10 hours loops of relaxing music.. Most accompanied by rain sounds.. Its soothing.. So I put this music on and picked up a book and started reading...
The last time I saw my shrink he told me that if I stayed on the net up until the last moment before going to bed.. That.. That wouldn't help me sleep and I needed to give me mind some 'wind down' time before trying to sleep... Right now I'm so desperate I'll try anything... So I read for a couple of hours and then went to bed.. And it was one of the worst nights sleep I've had in ages.. I had to get up in the night twice to pee.. Even though I hadn't had anything to drink since six o'clock last night... 
The Diazapam has had time to kick in.. So I feel okay I guess.. I'm still sitting here in a t-shirt and underwear.. My skin is cold to the touch and my fingers have gone numb.. But my core temperature is still hot.... I did everything right ! And I still couldn't get one good nights sleep.. When I do nothing and fail.. I accept it.. I've gotten used to the fact that i'm a failure.. But when I try and fail it makes me feel so hopeless... I just don't see an end to this.. Just being alive means discomfort and pain.....i Just don't want to do this anymore

I'm off out for a walk now... In the rain with a storm blowing.. I don't know what else to try... I just feel so...so... Powerless"

Whenever they ask.. I just lie and say I'm fine.. It avoids getting into a long painful conversation.. I'm bad at asking for help to...

So...Clopixol 300mg ??? What's it for ? Is it allot ? I've tried looking it up on-line.. But I don't really understand the large blocks of medical text..

Anybody heard of it ? I'm written up as bi-polar.. Do you think that crap will help ? I've gotten very suspicious of it just lately.. To the point of paranoia.. I'm beginning to think its doing me more harm than good...

Any light you can shed on it would be greatly appreciated.. Thanks"
790,"this thread might be my most important ever

never have I ever attempted to be my real self

so many times and so often the medical world has sent me on the most bullshit adventure and that anybody survived is a fucking miracle!

wake up everyday like never alive

they gave me lithium for 6 fucking years and I was convinced

and now backing right off?... I am fucking scared

but this is the best decision of my life

I have to take control I have to claim my own moment in this life!

I have lived so much pain mental shame....

my entire life has been something to avoid!"
791,"Hi all!  Newbie here to the forums. :)

My wife has suffered for years (been married for 40) with BiPolar disorder/depression.  The worst episode began in 2003 with a full blown freak out and first psych ward stay.  Since then (past 15 years), it's been several hospital stays (maybe a couple years off), many different pdocs/counselors/etc.  Last year, two in-patient psych ward stays.  This year is the worst....total depression, suicidal thoughts, insomnia, etc.

So ...... here we are today .... with a recommendation of Electroconvulsive therapy, starting next Friday.

Just wanted to know if there are any members here who have experienced Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), how it went, was it helpful and just any thoughts or stories?  Drug therapy (and I mean LOTS of different drugs) haven't helped."
792,I have been very low and had alot of anxiety and worry the last few weeks. But today it has turned and i dont know how this will be 😬 a manic episode has definately started and i am feeling my head is dizzy and body full of energy. I should be going to bed soon but i know thats not going to happen tonight! So at least i will have the energy to give the house a really good clean and tidy and try not too wake the family doing it 😅 anyone else manic right now?
793,I have recently had to come off of lithium since it was affecting my kidneys. Since then I’ve gone into a major depressive episode and my grades are beginning to fall. I have a lot of trouble getting homework done because of the fatigue and lack of motivation. Any advice?
794,"Hi all. I was dx with bipolar last week so it's all still new to me. Am in a strange mood (felt like this a few times in the past).. I am so confused I just dont know. I feel so up yet so down I just cant describe it. For 4days I have been Angry, happy anxious sad laughing then same cycle again. I just dont know of I am coming or going. So many thoughts are going through me head right now and I just need a break, i cant focus ...argh...what do I do. Is this bipolar?? Is this worth me calling my pdoc or should I just ride it out until I see her next week?"
795,Is there anything that triggers your manic episodes? I seem to get them if my sleep routine is messed up
796,"As someone diagnosed with ""unspecified bipolar"" I'm still trying to understand this disorder. So I'm wondering...

Does anyone else cringe at descriptions of moderate to severe depression when they're feeling up? 

Like, don't get me wrong, I still have compassion but like it just hurts too much to go there when I just want to embrace the happy state. Am I alone in this?

Thanks."
797,"Hello, I will return to university this year after 4 years. I would like to read some advice about how to manage this new situation with the illness (triggers like lack of sleep, etc). I was diagnose 4 years ago after a great depression. Then I remain stable with very mild episodes but now I'm recovering from hypomania. I'm scared and happy at the same time about returning my studies. I left my studies two times because of my illness. I was not diagnosed at that time. Thanks and sorry if the post is too long."
798,"I feel my meds are holding my career back. Before taking meds, I was making over $100,000 USD a year. Now I don’t have the mental energy to go fast like I used to. I want to get off these meds and be manic because I was successful. Now I feel impotent and no one expects much of me and my future. It sucks!!!

I’ll probably stay on these meds to remain stable but I still battle with bouts of mania. I’m rarely depressed. I have Bipolar I. I just want to experience some excitement in my life instead of being bored all the time."

802,So much energy that I can't physically get it out. I'm agitated and thoughts are racing from one thing to the next. But this is not in a good way like before because it is more anger and extreme frustration mixed with energy like no other. I want it to stop but not at the same time. happen to anyone else?
803,"I always have the same pattern when I have an episode. It starts with a week or two of mania, feeling great and high energy, talking to God and generally behaving very erratically. But then the scary part starts..

I get a psychosis for a couple of days which is completely terrifying. I can't even describe to people how bad it is, it feels like a constant fear of death or worse.

It involves a fear like the universe is ending, like I made a mistake somewhere, like everyone is going to hell and can't be rescued. 

Has anyone had similar? Most people I know just get regular delusions, religious experiences, but don't have extreme fear like I get. (Thankfully I've not had an episode for about 18 months)."

805,"Hi, 

I've had bipolar for 8 years now approximately, since I was a junior in high school. 

Long story short, through several psychiatrists and therapists, I haven't reached any sort of stability. The closest I got was about 3 months worth (5 years ago). I had then gone back to school and got a job... only to have symptoms again 3 months in. Therapy has helped me cope and change my outlook, but has not been effective otherwise.

Every new drug I try either has adverse effects, causes mania, or stabilizes me for 1-2 weeks, and then stops working. Im wondering if anyone else has these experiences?  I got 2-3 days recently, during a med switch, that reminded me what its like to not be depressed or manic... Best 3 days since my diagnoses.. I felt calm and focused and human. Now I am back to depression.

How normal is this reaction to medication? Works at first, then stops..."
806,"So I’ve been suffering depression about 5 years now. I’ve had ups and downs, been on and off anti depressants... but few times I’ve stopped and wondered do I infact have bipolar. A relative also questioned me about it because of my impulsive nature. 

But more than that, I feel so drained now. I feel like life is always difficult for the many reasons I won’t list and then I’ll get moments where I get a million ideas of how to better things. So it’ll be me looking for a new job or course. Or planning how I can lose weight. And it’s with so much energy and my brain is racing and hopeful... but then the pattern is that High enthusiasm is short lived. I come crashing down soon after thinking why did I think like that, and then just telling myself to stop aiming higher because of my illness and my situation (kinda stuck). I can’t do much , but then my moment of feeling I can do everything comes with me thinking of different solutions and ways.

But it’s just exhausting. Now that I’m more aware of it I just hate the up and down. And when I’m down I’m really down, where i don’t feel there’s any solution and don’t want to continue. 

It feels like where or how am I meant to live like this. It’s been 5 years of trying - going between feeling like I can do and change things but then my lows where reality hits and it’s just my life is a limitation. I just Want to be steady, but it seems that’s impossible with my back and forth!

Are these patterns of behaviour any that you identify with suffering with bipolar? 

Ps im Sure there will be one or two who tell me this isn’t the place for a diagnosis. I know that. And I will speak to a doc (possibly). I’m just asking for your experiences and if they measure up similarly to mine.

Thank you for reading."
807,"I was on geodon max dose 80mg bid for 11 years with only quarterly psych appointments at the Veterans hospital.  I switch psych Dr's and we are tapering the geodon down in hopes of coming off of it and on to something less dangerous as I was getting uncontrolled muscle contractions.  My pdoc lowered me to 40mg bid about 2 months ago.  I feel so much worse.  I am so exhausted I fall asleep standing up and fall down, I fall asleep at school, like literally fall asleep, snoring, drooling all of it.  I am afraid to drive.  I have random muscle contractions and constant facial twitches like in my top lip on left side.  I am always run down and always so tired.  I am most likely going to drop out of school as I cannot keep myself awake in class.  I cannot do anything.  I cannot concentrate or think straight.  I just generally feel like crap 24/7.  They gave me klonazapam for the muscle contractions which did help but I had to stop taking it because I could not stay awake even worse than now.  Other meds include ambien 10mg at night and wellbutrin (dont recall dose.)  Is there anything I can do?  It's been 2 months and it is getting worse..I don't know how much longer I can deal with this.  My pdoc just states we have to ride it out but I feel worse not better.

I get my care through the VA hospital as there are no pdocs that take medicare/medicaid around me except the county clinic and...no thanks."

809,"I’m just going to give you all my story and I hope you will respond with some advice or answers because I’m really struggling here and posting on here is really the only thing I could think of. So when I was really little weird little sensory things would really upset me. If I was wearing multiple layers of clothing the under layer sleeve had to be pulled out of the jacket or sweater and I always was pulling my socks up and making sure they stayed very tight.  I also always had to have my shirt pulled down over my pants. If I got really upset at the way the fabric felt on my skin or my socks were too big or my shirt was riding up as I was running around I would get so irritated and my face would turn red and I would start sweating and sometimes start to cry or freak out and throw myself on the ground. It felt so weird because the certain feeling of something on my skin triggered extreme emotional responses and felt like a searing flash of Anger in my head and a horrible ear ache. Now, many years later I sometimes get annoyed with certain fabrics or wearing beanies or gloves that are too big but for the most part stuff like that hardly bothers me anymore. When I was younger certain smells would also send me into this uncontrollable state of hysteria. I also developed a phobia of people burping near me and would literally have a small panic attack anyone did. I would cry and usually try to get as far away from that person as possible. With both of these things I have been able to gain control of or I just have become tolerant to them overtime. I also have some body focused repetitive behaviors that aren’t healthy at all. I am so ashamed to even say this but often I suffer with dermatillomania and that causes problems with my face and scalp making them sore. I chew all the dead skin off my lips until they are sore. I bite my nails and make them sore.  I am constantly popping my joints like my back, shoulders, wrists, fingers, toes, and ankles. I don’t do this anymore but when I was little I would run my tongue over my teeth for hours and hours making my tongue and my jaw very tired. I also made a tongue clicking noice all the time. I started self harming in 7th grade and continued this semi regularly for three years. I have hundreds of scars on my forearms and upper arms and a few on my thighs from all the self harming I did to my skin. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder but the meds I was put on made me feel terrible. I was only able to tell my psychiatrist a small portion of what I am writing on this post because I am far too ashamed to admit these things to her. I also have gone to several different therapists for CBT or DBT talk therapy as well as group therapy but I strongly disliked both because I just felt like I was being judged the whole time. Please just let me know your thoughts."
810,"So I have been struggling with mental health since I was 16 I am 29 now. I got a bipolar diagnoses last week. At 26 I was put on quitiapine for mood disorder. This made me put 6 stone on due to over eating and getting pregnant with my 3rd baby. For them 2 years I was stable. Then I get pregnant again. There was now way i was taking quitiapine or any other antipsychotic while i was pregnant (problems with my 3rd when he was born- withdrawal symtoms) my 4th pregnancy was so hard without any meds but I made it though it and went straight onto aripriprazole as soon as the baby was born. The quitiapine was to sedating and the weight gain was to much. For 6 months I has awful side effects from the aripriprazole, jerky body movements blinking and insomnia plus I was still having depression episodes. So it was deceied I come off them and go back on to quitiapine (xl) as this works for me. The weight gain worries me because I have manage to lose 7 stone since having my daughter last January. I wish I could say I would rather be fat and happy/stable but I just cant. I am terrified of the weight gain. All though this time i do know to eat healthy and not to over eat. None of my family seem to understand they just want to see me well again. How do people cope with weight gain a 2nd time around. I am finally a healthy weight now and it's really bothering me. Really hope someone
 can relate to me. Thanks for reading xx"
811,"My daughters boyfriend may be bipolar. He is going to the doctor to be evaluated for depression. But after reading some of the signs I am thinking more bipolar. He spends alot of tome with us so I actually think we see more than his family does. He is very moody. One minute he is fine and the next he looks so shitty.  It’s like he has highs and lows. One minute he is full of energy the next he is sleeping the entire weekend. He seems to be fine with friends but when it comes to my daughter he is very moody (more like extremely shitty). He shows no emotion towards her like he did in the beginning. He just went kinda flat.  He has no desire to do anything with her but will jump at the chance to hang with his buddies.  She has tried to break it off several times but he keeps promising he will fix it, which never happens. He was recently diagnosed with a thyroid condition.  My daughter loves him dearly but can not go on like this. She just broke up with him which is killing her but says it’s not fair to her to be unhappy not knowing what is going on in his head.  He is trying everything to fix things but i just think things may be out of his control right now. I am not really looking for a diagnosis just advice. I feel like his family thinks my daughter is being selfish. This poor girl can’t wait to see him on the weekends and buy the middle of the weekend she is in tears because he’s here physically but he’s really not here.  I find that I create fights with her because i want her to support him but the only thing that is on his mind is getting her back to the point everyone is pushing her and making it worse.   Any advice would be helpful. Thanks!!"

813,"I am from Cape Town, South Africa. 44 years of age and unemployed. At age 25 I had my first psychosis. It was quite manic with racing thoughts and voices. I was diagnosed as schizo affective At age 32, I had my second psychosis. This time with lots of paranoia and I OD'd after having feelings of resentment due to my baby brother's death. October of 2019, I had another psychosis. No racing thoughts. No mania but more like I was under some form of control due to my wants and needs(hallucinations)and carried out actions accordingly.Most of these actions had a positive impact on me ie:the voices I heard told me to stop smoking, eat healthier and exercise. All 3 of which I did. Also, for all 3 psychotic episodes I've bee in hospitalised So it has been 3 months now. From being diagnosed as bipolar, can a psychosis change brain chemistry so much that you have a personality disorder with mixed emotions or have I bee mm misdiagnosed? I opted to see an alternative doctor after 19 years as I was still not doing too well. I am eating Epilim Cr 5oo x2 daily; Rislerdal 4mg at night and 1 mg during the day.

814,"I'm 28. About to turn 29 next month. Also about to turn 30 next year, obviously...

And yet I didn't find a single fuckin' job. I still live with my parents. And if I get a job, so what? I can't keep up with the expenses. High taxes, medical fees, and bills plague the world economy. If I tried to ask for help on Reddit, these farts tell me to ""own up to it"", and bitch about how true it is. No solution.

I live in South Korea because my parents pulled me here. No choice to obey if I want to survive. Can't be homeless. And Korea's even worse. People are struggling to get a job. They have excruciatingly high requirements that is hard for me to catch up.

But sometimes, I think... maybe worked harder and acted smarter, I would've succeeded.

Especially when I was back in the States.

Instead of relying on my parents for expenses, I should've ran away. I should've got a part-time job to pay off my expenses.

But here was the issue. I suffer from bipolar disorder and extreme stress can drive to insanity, leading me to extreme rage. Juggling between work and school can raise up high stress. Imagine working hours and hours and you have to put quality. Imagine you have to do your assignments and put quality time on this crap. Time flies by, and my work progress slows. There's not enough time, and I'm tired. But if I don't do this well, I'll have to worry about school expenses. That is a tremendous amount of stress. Couldn't handle this shit. Had to rely on my parents to financial issues. But they had enough of the American life and dragged my ass here. Now what?

It's a folly to commence such a shit here in Korea. Like I said, the job market is fierce. I wouldn't stand a chance!
I can't go back to the States. High expenses plague the whole nation, especially with Trump's incompetence. He's not doing a thing about affordable healthcare. Nor lowering down rent and housing fees. But if I knew how do deal with the enormous stress, I would've lived in the States with success.

It's dreadful living with my parents. Just read here: This piece of music reminds of the pain I went through...

And don't get me started about my father. He to has serious issues that give me a headache..."

823,Is anyone here on lithium and not overweight? I'm on lithium and am 10 kg overweight. Looking for sugggestions to lose weight.
824,"I'm a 30-year-old man who takes 1200 mg lithium and 5 mg Abilify every day. My lithium level was 1.0 last time I checked. My BMI is 25.0 now (18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal, 25.0 and above is considered overweight). I go for a 45-minute walk twice a day but I do eat a lot of junk food; I seem to have an irresistible craving for calorie-laden food that cannot be mitigated without a drug change. Therefore, I'm planning to meet my psychiatrist tomorrow to ask her to either reduce my lithium or Abilify or start me on a weight-loss drug/hunger suppressant like Contrave, that contains bupropion, an antidepressant.

How do people who have gained weight on such medications deal with it? Before starting all these meds, I was a skinny teenager with a BMI of around 17.5. I want to lose weight not only in order to look good but because being overweight predisposes you to heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, etc."

I'm 100% vegetarian at the moment and slowly working my way to vegan.

827,"So without making this a super long story my psych doctor sent me inpatient last month and while I was in she disagreed with the treating doctors there.  They set me up with a different doctor that was on board with them, that doctor put me with one of his nurse practitioners because she takes my insurance.  I have seen the new NP twice, she does not return my calls about me getting sick from new medications, the office has been unable to get this medication authorized after three weeks and keep telling me that because it is the beginning of the year they are just backed up.  I am just not impressed and getting annoyed.  My old doctor had me on way to many different medications (7) but she always returned my calls in a timely manner and I never had a problem with her.  I was thinking I should just make an appointment and go back to her with the new less meds and see if she can get them working because this is not working.  Otherwise maybe I should see the main doctor at the new place.  He does not take my insurance but my specialist copay is $50 and he is $120 without insurance which I would be willing to pay if he can get my not feeling so awful.  Ugh, I don’t know what I should do."

When my Prozac is upped it will cause me to rapid cycle. Then I will just get my seroquel upped even more. I have been doing lots of research online, and I have read that Lamictal is good for rapid cycling, and bipolar depression without causing any mania, but my doctor doesn’t add any medications just increases what I am on. I think adding lamictal would really work for me. Would it be wrong to ask my doctor abo that combo or should I just let him do what he thinks will work? Please let me know :)"
830,"Almost every time I have had one I get the most fantastic, colourful, pleasant hallucinations. They are very sort of trip like, but a pleasant trip. I am more than happy for them to continue, they don't last long and it makes me feel fab. In fact,last night I was actively waiting for them to start.
BUT...there is always a but....I am concerned that one of my trips will be a horrid one. I read up on the net and got lots of example of similar to mine. Swirling walls, bright colours kind of thing but not very many of unpleasant.
I wondered if anyone here got hallucinations with Zopiclone or if anyone knew that if I have had so many pleasant trips, if I am likely to get an unpleasant one? Maybe pleasant and unpleasant is in a different part of the brain? Or am I kidding myself?

I had a serious hospitalization in 2017 and since then I’ve been retired at the age 39. I really want to work or go to grad school but my healthcare providers say I can’t handle the stress. I’m so bored! I’m financially stable so that’s not an issue and I have access to the best healthcare.

I feel so lost. I guess I could take up hobbies but I really want to work. I’m very depressed. I know some people may not be able to relate to me because I have resources but I’m really struggling. I just want to feel like I have a purpose or be passionate about something. My family expects me to be sick forever and do nothing.

Maybe I should just give up and resign to a life of being bored. I feel like I don’t have a choice."

He lived in BC for ten years and a few days ago had a bad trip on mushrooms and a complete psychotic episode, prompting me to fly out there to move him back home with my family. He was obviously much worse during the psychotic episode but once I started researching his symptoms, I realize that he had them in milder forms for the past couple of years when I would see him. They have just really come to the forefront the past couple of months (probably magnified hugely by the mushrooms)

He needs a psychiatric assessment and we suspect he has bipolar disorder including constant streams of talking with mania, unaware of what is appropriate conversation, lack of sleep, and constant delusions of grandeur - mostly about how he knows the cures for all diseases / he knows whats best for everyone in every situation. The issue is that he's always been extremely resistant, mentally, to drugs and doctors and treatment. I can't see any way of ever getting him to come to a psychiatrist. It is difficult to have any reasonable conversation with him about anything let alone medication. The mention of any ideas contrary to what he believes prompts him walking out. We know not to argue with him, but right now there are no conversations with him. He just talks at you and shuts the conversation down. Can anyone suggest strategies to work with this?"
835,"I am not sure whom else has this problem but whenever I'm with my son, I feel happy. During my visit I start to withdraw as if I go in a state of depression - fear but not sure why. Sometimes I think I might get too close to him and his mother might harm me as she is a bit of a nasty person. 

I know this is unfair on my son but I don't know else how to react. It has been going in like this for a while

837,"I've been put on a 'fast-track' which means I've a number to ring in a crisis, not always possible, there you go.  I've no real human contact since my wife died, besides mental health services.  Family in another town and don't really bother with me, long story or not.  Despite explaining I'm feeling really low the MH are saying in a letter that I'm doing OK.  Now I'm isolated and got some really negative ideation on the go, but they've already increased my anti-antidepressents (which only work if they are in a supportive environement) which are making me feeling like worse, worse, worse.  The Lithium is essential but I'm missing human emotional contact - perhaps it's part of growing older, feeling written off as a human being."
838,"Was signed off sick 2 moths with depression, saw a psychiatrist switched medication from Sodium Valporate, to Lithium 200 mg and Setraline.
Feeling better, totally bored at home ready to return to work , but i am feeling anxious about returning to the workplace, i am doing a fazed return to work."

841,"Hello everyone,
this is my first time posting on this site and thought I’d share my story. I  have schizoaffective disorder and deal with paranoia. I truly believe  that people can read my thoughts because I get answers from society every time I think of something in code. It may sound odd to some but I’ll think of something and instantly I’ll either get a 1,2, or 3 remark. Whether it be from a dog barking, birds chirping, the amount of cars that drive by, people wiping their nose, I mean the list goes on forever and it’s literally EVERY TIME I think of something and it causes me so much anxiety. I’ve had therapists I’ve gone to group therapy sessions and nothing has worked. I could use some advice to help overcome this thinking. If you have any I’d highly appreciate it."
842,"So I was having a lot of side effects from Seroquel and I have been on pretty much everything else so the doctor switched me to Vraylar (capriprazine).  It is a pretty new medication, I have seen the commercials about it but that is about it.  I read the stuff she gave me about it, sounds like every other atypical antipsychotic I have been on.  Tonight I am starting it, stopping the Seroquel immediately.  Anyone have first hand experience with it?"
843,Hi all. I was diagnosis with BPD about 3 years ago. My psychiatrist is re assessing me for bipolar type 2. I am not on my medication at the moment (for around 3 weeks now) and I keep seeing shadows. This was normal for me before I got a BPD diagnosis started antipsychotic medication (aripriprazole) but its getting to a point now where I am suffering extreme paranoia because of them. Is this something that is worth mentioning to my psychiatrist as I have never mentioned it before? Tia x
844,"Well boo! (Not my first word choice, but i censor for this site) 
I am feeling so good and excitable today and have been pretty happy the past 4 or 5 days after being so completely ho hum with life for almost 2.5 years. The thing about this happiness is that unlike when I was depressed, sad things don't get me sad anymore. I've had bad news of two people I know dying and despite it, I'm still happy and excited. I feel guilty though...but at the same time, I feel I deserve to be happy.

Also want to point out that things have been going pretty great for me lately. I mean I've been making new friends and helping others which makes me feel good and just have had a lot of support...but I've also started fasting and since then, my sleep has been less too and all of these things combined just have me wondering. I know you folks can't diagnose me, but does any of this sound like it could be bipolar2 or am I just happy? Like, I don't even know what my baseline is, I mean I feel like my baseline is kinda low so this is an elevated mood for me. Is this how normal people feel every day or am I extreme?"
845,"Hi. I wanted to come out about what goes on in my daily life as a diagnosed Bipolar Type 1 person.
I hear ""thoughts"" that are not my own, saying I'm God's Son. It makes life a little complicated as I grew up being a girl. I went through a phase where I thought I was Transgender FTM, but staying on meds for the first time, I don't feel I am anymore. When it comes to just dress or pants, I am pants. Meaning, if I got to choose I would be male.
So the voice tells me things like she was Justin Bieber, and Justin Bieber is a lighter version of ""what we do"".
When I go out in public, the ""voice"" is stronger. It ""holds my hand"" by clenching a tight fist, ring finger against the center of my palm. I've told my psychiatrist that I was ""hearing voices"", but I think I was told that hearing voices can also be a Bipolar trait. It's difficult to tell people (on the internet), that I'm like a two spirit.. that I Believe i'm God's Son. Justin Bieber has a tattoo that says ""Son of God"". So when I go through life now, I think ""God is inside the body"" of who i'm talking to.. for example, I got labwork done this morning for my 6th month and looking in the lady that did my arm, I assume it's ""the person I talk to in my head"". It does get complicated when there are more than one person around like how. ""The voice has gotten me into issues before"" like being readmitted into the psych hospital because I was saying something delusional, after it told me to stop taking my meds (just one time though.. the rest I don't remember a voice telling me to stop taking them, shoving them in a water bottle shaking it up and flushing it.)

I didn't always live hearing the voice. I was diagnosed as Bipolar in 2012 after an issue at my job. The voice wasn't there back then, but I experienced things when I was doing pot. The voice asked me to marry one fourth of july and I said yes ""all in my head"". Recently I took myself off the dating apps I was on. I didn't have a job or car and how could I tell someone that I believe i'm ""married to God"".

Before my standing fan broke, I was hearing a voice out the fan."
846,I keep on self sabotaging by not studying and procrastinating I don't even mind failing anymore this is so wrong.
847,"My daughter is an exceptionally (frustratingly) bright 7 year old.  She has noticed that daddy takes medicine and for the past year has been satisfied with the answer that it is because I get headaches.  To be fair, she and her sister so often give me headaches. 

she is now more curious, and is asking why daddy gets headaches so much and always takes meds, asking if the doctors know what is wrong with me and why don’t they know, etc. 

She’s also now noticing differences in behavior in that sometimes my patience and energy is much less for periods of time... (why is daddy acting different).

In reality, my shifts don’t effect mj job performance or meeting obligations at home, I still get through playing after work, making dinner, reading bedtime stories, etc. But she is noticing differences in attitude that stem from swings.  

do I keep it vague- meds are for head/headache? Or do I explain the nature of the illness? She’s smart but still only 7, and I don’t know that I want her to bear the burden of knowing.

does anyone have experience/insight here?  Thanks in advance!"
848,"My words are not true; this didn't happen to me. It's scenario based on what I fear.

I hate people who is verbally abusing me. Sometimes, I want to cuss back. If I do, they get calm and sarcastic. No matter what I do, they just win the battle. Even if I get polite, they just brush me off as weak and worthless. And there are awful cases when they start getting physical. Every time I retaliate, people around me are quick to put their hands on me. And if I fight back, I lose due to their superior fighting skills. If I want to win, I have to learn martial arts. Wasting time doing workouts that are more brutal than bodybuilding. There are things I want to do, such as hobbies and taking a walk. Can't do those 'cause I have to compete against my haters. And if I do win, I end up in sorrow and regret. Of hurting others. But I have to push on, or else they will fuck with me. They will abuse me to dehumanizing levels. They will demand me to difficult things and verbally murder me for every mistake I make. All for their sadistic pleasure. I can run away, but the scars remain. The scars haunt me. They haunt me to the point where, I lash at innocent people, and drives me to more pain.

This is what my life feels like. I have to master the difficult task to survive. Meet up to demands to barely get by. Otherwise, perish. Perish and hurt others. No matter how I handle rude people and myself (especially my temper) peacefully/violently, the result is the same.

But sometimes, I want to do what I want to do. Not to waste my precious time half-assing some survivalistic bullshit. But these punks get in the way."
849,"hi everybody. I hope you're feeling well. 
 I want to ask a question about mania. my episodes are quite active, which is a manifestation of mania, ha. I go to other cities, have unwanted sexual relationships, break limbs, get into bad company with alcohol, cannabis and all that shit. I know you understand what I mean. 
  But of course I wouldn't do that in my right mind. Do you know any tips to at least have a little control over this episode? I'll be happy to get all the answers, and you can write me a personal message if you want. It would be great to find companionship here. 
(sorry if there are mistakes. English is not my native language)"
850,I was a student at a top-ranked US university and a manic episode that lasted two years forced me to leave school. I was completely delusional and thought God had given me special powers to find the meaning of life. I ended up dropping out of university three times. I'd like to go back and complete my degree and eventually get a Ph.D. but I'm concerned Bipolar will once again turn things upside down. Has this happened to any of you guys?
851,"I think being overweight is contributing to my depression though medication may place some part in it. If you’ve lost significant weight, how did affect your mood and lifestyle? Thanks!"
852,"Hi 
I’m currently in the middle of being diagnosed. I’ve seen the mental health nurse and doctors etc they have diagnosed bipolar I’ve been referred to Psycahyrist my appointment should be very soon. I’m just wondering if anyone can tell me what to expect please because I’m feeling all over the place. 
thank you"
853,I'm headed to the other side of the US for treatment for Bipolar and Schizoaffective disorder. Anyone been to one of these treatment centers? I don't know what to expect or how to prepare. I have to put my life on hold for one to three months. Thanks!
854,"I just started a med clinic to find out if I am bi-polar. I don't see how I couldn't be because I have most of the symptoms and my father was bi-polar. Anyways, like my father I have used cannabis most my life. When I was younger and he would quit smoking he would become manic/depressed. Then when he smoked he would be okay. He was untreated Bi-polar and didn't take his medications and ended up passing away from a heart attack at 51. 
       This isn't the life plan I want to follow in. My questions is if other people have dealt with long term cannabis use and how it affected their meds/moods and etc. I know everyone will be different and react differently, but I'm curious. I feel that cannabis use is destroying my life. I quit tobacco and alcohol a year and a half ago and just started smoking cannabis a lot more. I'm afraid if I quit I'll go crazy, but I'm also afraid to keep using. I'm hoping talk therapy and finding out if mood stabilizers are the right choice. Curious how others have dealt with substance abuse/meds/bipolar."
855,"last night out of nowhere he just got really low and went to lie down
im wondering if he is heading for a low and wanted advise from other bipolar sufferers on how they cope when they are in a low phase and also manic too for the future ,I want to be a really good girlfriend and support him as best I can

858,"I had my third hospitalization end last week.  Suppose it is time to accept I am pretty much the DSM definition of bipolar 1.  Went off my meds again, they were just so expensive I felt there were more important things I needed to spend my money on.  While I was in they told my I was on way to much stuff, 7 different meds multiple times a day, so now I am supposed to only take Seroquel and adderall.  I have about a month of titrating off the old stuff ahead of me though.

I don’t know what I am going to do about my living situation.  I have an apartment with a roommate who has been my best friend the past 10 years but holy crap is this a toxic situation.  While I love my friend he is a full blown alcoholic who keeps buying my booze even when I told him I don’t feel safe drinking on the Seroquel, afraid I will pass out standing up.  When I went to the hospital I was super agitated and getting violent toward my roommate, neighbor, and told off my landlord.  My roommate won’t stop making jokes about how he afraid I will beat him up because when I was mad I grabbed him by the shirt and he fell to the ground bruising himself up.  He keeps retelling the story making it that I attacked him more and more violently.  It is really upsetting me but he is too drunk to realize.  My neighbor owes me over $200 for back due power I paid for him then he won’t pay.  My mom said no when I asked if I could stay with her.
 
Because of the holidays I wasn’t able to get all my meds when I got out of the hospital.  I am falling into a manic episode, it is almost 3am here.  This is just a disaster.

I went immediately back to work when I got out because I have no money.  I feel like I cannot handle it anymore though.  Before I went in I was told to consider at least partial disability but I cannot see a way to get it without becoming homeless, again."
859,"Since jan 1st I’ve been experiencing a mixed episode and also that’s turned into hypomania for the past few days!! I’ve had fleeting excitement, racing thoughts, enthusiasm and just been feeling great overall. Sleeping at 7am and binging on caffeine! I feel revved up and great. Is it just a phenomenon?"
860,"Hello all. I know it is a doctor that should diagnose me and I am not looking for diagnosis just opinions from you kind people that suffer from this issue.

I had thought I just had bad anxiety and depression (long term 15 years) but I have tried a few different medications for depression and have not noticed any real difference.


I have wrote the majority of the symptoms I have here:

Low mood majority of time. Feel tired and lethargic all the time.
Cant ever relax.
Worry about health (pains etc).
Anxiety when outside the house, self conscious.
Over protective of my children.
No interest in most things.
Poor appetite ( not eat until lunch. Addictive personality (heavy smoking used drugs when younger, weed and ecstacy mainly).
Racing thoughts especially when trying to sleep and through the night even when I wake sometimes my mind is already racing straight away from the thoughts in my sleep.
Lack of interest in stuff
No will to work at something i dont like
At home majority of time 90%
Moments where i am very impulsive( gambling, Lottery etc) believeing I will win.
Can sometimes talk very fast and rant/ go on a tangent but mostly normal
Not angry often but when i am its very aggressive.
Sometimes Dont think about consequences.
Have had suicidal thoughts ( because things are not getting better only worse

Any help and advice is welcome.  As i said I had been on sertraline and tried a couple of other drugs for depression and GAD but nothing"
861,I'm not feeling good today I feel very depressed and suicidal
862,I am alone
863,I’m an adult and still feel so defeated when I’m in a “sad spell” and cry endlessly and have thoughts of okay how do I find a way to end it all or how am I going to lie to my husband and tell him I’m unable to have children so that I might not pass my mental illness on and I hate myself and I hate that I hate myself and I’m up at 3 in the morning crying and hopeless when hours ago I was giddy and manic and joyful and laughing with my husband and snuggling my wonderful dog. It’s so scary and awful and difficult to have these extreme cycles and especially when they’re rapid fire shooting as they are currently.
864,"I received a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, but I can’t tell if it’s denial or wrong.

since 18, I have had nights of staying up and cleaning my house until 5am then sleeping for 2 hours on my couch then going to class. I have had days with so much energy and stress I needed to go and RUN and wake up at 3am for the day. During these days, I care more about appearance. I also workout to get the energy out. Everytime this is triggered by stress. I have moments of I can do everything and I can’t do anything at all. Distracted during this time also. So is it anxiety or mania?

I get degreased often and lonely, so I know I have some kind of depression."
865,"Hi so this recent behavioral health center im at its not right in my eyes so please tell me if I'm having a episode or im i right and should be concerned... so been there 1yr 2 months and from the beginning they had problems getting my info from the other facility..there prescribers would know nothing about  me as far as what meds ive been on .and well i think ive tried over 30  MEDS cause they dont work they should have this on record it shouldn't be a smi bipolar persons responsiblity to remember that  especially if there homeless living with there family for yrs like that ..  long story on that part

866,"About 10 months ago my SSRIs may have switched me to BP.  I also possibly got flowed by levaquin around this time.

Fast forward I was pulled off 2.5 Paxil and 25 zoloft and put on 900 lithium. I’m still on 10 lexapro and 159 Wellbutrin. It’s been about 6 months and I cannot warm up. I am freezing all the time! When I tried to drop my 900 lithium to 780 (liquid) I was freezing cold and my legs were on fire so I’m back on 909 for like 4 months now. 

Just wondering if anyone else is freezing cold like all the time and unable to warm up from lithium.  I know the side effects list it as a possibility but just wanted to reach out.

I can turn a hello into an epic adventure of madness and confusion and mistake it all for love or something good like that and what I produce out of all that can kill all the life around me I have seen insects commit suicide rather than land on me doing myself nothing unusual.

I avoid goodbyes with expertise unlike anything I ever seen I never seen any goodbyes wait around for me to see them and all the hungry insects kill themselves again despite regular efforts to piss me off...

I respect old people... my best ever work effort was with the people with dementia... I calculated a few bottoms within my life so far other than mine?

possibly 5000 bottoms... give or take 50 bottoms... probably..although over xmas 2009 I wiped and comforted very desperate bottoms for 13 days straight ...like maybe 40 bottoms per day that I made better bottoms during xmas it was apparent that most bottoms were more active.

so i am waking up to new and old familiar mania...

she arrives she turns up right in front of me

she is a health care worker who still helps Lewis even after leaving the company.

I am suddenly dysfunctional...

out of my mouth did make the only sense to me I saw her eyes her smile her hair in and all about her face she is a gorgeous woman

I do the best thing and give her all my honesty

""geez... you are a good looking woman""

not only that... she had such a wonderful energy about her

after about 5 hours

I talked to old Lewis...he tells me that Nikola is married

and I get to tell someone again the philosophy of affairs and marriage

he said that this lovely woman had curiosities elsewhere and that I should.

I told him old man this is not my style and that Nikola is exactly beautiful
because her marriage is good... and her children and her husband make her so desirable....

affairs never work because they immediately break what was attractive in the first place

I could see how wonderful Nikola is... she hugged me with affection

she could see just how personal everything is

and I am a better man to watch this gorgeous woman... go and do her thing

and she is the angel that I needed right now

it's only half a day old

871,"I posted this under anxiety as well, not knowing where it belongs.
Aboulomania is pathological indecisiveness. I become extremely anxious, to the point of mental paralysis when I have to make a decision. Usually it occurs when the decision has some consequences, but other times the decision is trivial.

I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder when it was called Manic Depression and have been treated for it for nearly 40 years. I feel like the doctors missed a couple of important other diagnoses, aboulomania and social avoidance syndrome. All of these disorders have rendered me unable to have close relationships, destroyed my career and basically left me barely functional."
872,"Hi. I was diagnosed as Bipolar in late 2012, after a job incident. I ""was in psychosis"", after missing nights of sleep, self medicating, and a lot of caffeine. I already posted in introduction, but I feel like there was more I could add, like explaining my username: I want to lose weight, stop using Nicotine, and take better care of my hygiene.

I'm almost out of my ejuice (Nicotine). I've said that when it's out, I'm done. I've never vaped like I've been doing which is vaping a lot in a day. I've been excited to quit, because I want to share my life when I'm not on it. Plus, I have an appt with the psychiatrist in January. Last time I went I was ""fine"" because I was using Nicotine to cope. 

I had a free counselor and now I don't because I expressed feelings for her in our session. I was able to see another counselor but it costs $60 and I felt bad for my mom, who paid it. 
The $60 counselor remembered my story, and I would like to see where she feels is the next step. Where I left off there, was that I was going to try and get into gender therapy. I never got to go, but I don't have those feelings anymore... I plan on losing weight by dropping junk food this year, and I feel confident with God, that I will have confidence without the use of a testosterone shoulder gel or surgery. 

Speaking of God, I get thoughts from a source claiming to be God. It explains things to me. When I hear my fan at night, I ""hear words"" as the fan makes noise. I still fall asleep everynight, and I get woken by my dog.. it's rare that I'm ""up"" first."

I want to feel love for Austin, I want to be in his life forever. I want to stop talking to Austin without saying goodbye. But I don’t want to loose my boyfriend, I want him in my life forever.

Also dealing with medication changes I've been on all sorts, I'm currently weaning off Ariripiprazole and Citalopram, and I've started Lamotrigine. So far I feel ok, tired and a little shitty but ok. Anyone taken Lamotrigine? I only know what the leaflet tells you (basically a bunch of side effects)"
879,"My mind is full of anger lately. I went to a sports bar a little over a week ago. It was full of beautiful women and men mingling with each other and I felt alone and unwanted. Now I wish all those people in there would just go to hell. But I'm just as superficial as they are so I can't even have legitimate anger toward them.

I wish I could be angry for how pathetic my life is but I can't. All I can do is bury my head under the covers and wish things were different. But I wake up and they are the same. 

If God created this world I live in, then God can go to hell too for all I care. I have pictures of me when I was a baby with an innocent and genuine smile on my face. But I feel like that smile was ripped from my face long, long ago. I haven't had a genuine smile on my face in decades. I can't ever forgive God for that. Maybe I'll go to hell. But I'll go to hell with a mind full of spite for God. And all the people who worship God, all I can do is shake my head in disgust. Those pathetic fools may as well be worshiping the likes of Hitler or Stalin as far as I'm concerned. 

Needless to say, I'll never go to another sports bar."
880,"i am scum

i hate me

my ex hates me

she sends me a photo message today of her happy family. I'm now an outcast.


please god call my number."
881,Not been in a very good mindset recently i feel suicidal
882,"Sometimes I’m Hyper and really annoying and amorous as all get out for days, I’m really irritable and extremely anxious, worried I may have offended someone, also I’m hyper sensitive to loud noises which makes my job in construction very difficult. And then all the sudden I don’t care about anything but I’m still sensitive to sound.
On this very day I’ve been up and way down and back up a bit in the course a few hours. I can’t stay on topic. I’ve put in earplugs but that pretty much blocks out everything. At this point I really just want a magic pill. 
The problem is, I’m in an area right now that has very few psychiatrists and apparently plenty of people that need one so it’s even harder to get help. Back home in Fort Worth I’d be seen fairly quick. Now I’ve had to see a nurse practitioner to get the ball rolling and I’ve had to do my own research on this disorder which she pretty much confirmed. 
I’d already been diagnosed with anxiety and depression but still things didn’t seem right and the meds were wearing off. So now I’m looking back at past situations and realizing that the majority of symptoms coincide with bipolar symptoms.
I’d love to know if others have had quick mood changes, strange habits, money issues as far as being deep in debt to of letting everything go to collections and hiding from them and still being impulsive and wasting money, daily suicidal thoughts even though you’re sure you don’t want to die, feeling the need to justify everything you do and needing constant reassurance, extremely amorous but controlling it, and anything else weird you can think of.
Ps - pardon my writing style."
883,"I’m really down in the dumps right now. I’ve overdrawn my bank account. My parents are stressed over me and it’s ruining the holidays. I want to make things better and make them proud but I’m struggling with my impusivity. I just feel like I always let them down, and I’m a burden on them. Plus I tend to feel guilty about my past decisions often, and I always feel I’m a “bad person” in their eyes. Idk what to do to make things better. Ideas?"
884,"please gather your loved ones....

the worst is in effect"
885,"I never fail myself with this one

a few too many years of mental illness?

I have terrible memories of me in some terrible places.

sometimes I am incredible amazing I have done some things that even I would look at and watch like what the fuck?

how did it happen why did i do it ?

and the days continue to arrive like a battlefield the person bipolar falls into a giant emotional hole"

I am falling apart watching

888,"hi
im new here, i just made this acc... i've skimmed through the threads on this forum real quickly trying to find a thread like this but honestly i have no patience for that rn..
so to the point - idk what to do with racing thoughts ... when i go manic (which happens more and more often these days and i hate it), sometimes i can't hold on to a thought for the life of me... and it sucks so much and just messes everything up... i feel so f.....  scattered tbh like i have no idea how to put myself together..  sometimes even during real life convos i have a million things firing through my brain as we speak.. and i cant concentrate at all ... and it just frustrates me so much.. so how do you guys deal with that? self medicating helps but its hard enough not to go full on down that road if u know what i mean... 
right now i cant even really put together what i wanna write but i hope this post makes sense (im kinda in the middle of a mixed episode and was full blown manic for like the whole week)
ps i also have ocd and also sometimes i get super anxious which makes this particular symptom way worse"
889,"everyone has a pain

and?

an unrecognised pain is lost"
890,"Hello. I'm an 18 yo guy. I've seen several psych over the years and still see one. He does not think I have bipolar but I think I do. Are your cycles regular?

I have always had OCD which is sensory in nature. Like, when it flares I become uncomfortable in my body. I am hyperaware of myself and obsessed with the asymmetry of it all. 

When I was in high school these flares started taking on a pattern. It's starts with these racing thoughts about past flares (what if I flare, what if I flare...). This leads to more anxiety and insomnia where I don't sleep for 2-3 days. This leads to really bad depression and anxiety, cognitive problems. Everything hurts and my sleep is difficult. After about a total of 10 days like that,  I begin to sleep more easily again. But I feel totally exhausted for 4 days.  After 14 total days from the start of this whole thing, I start to feel better. I will be more silly or goofy off an on for about 2 weeks but functional. Then for 3-7 days I get more animated and try to get more social. I'm not manic as I can reign it in but I definitely feel just more outgoing in general. My tone is different. Then I flare again starting with the racing thoughts (what if flare, what if I flare...) It's a very predictable 5 week cycle. I have had 5 of these cycles this year already beginning this past summer. There have been periods in my life where this doesn't happen at all for a year at a time.

Is bipolar predictable like this?"
891,"Long post; if you don't wanna read, summary is. I have nobody left in my life. Not a single friend. Not the love of my life anymore. Life has lost all meaning. And I don't know how to go on. Depression eats away at me every day. Slowly growing deeper every day. And I can't see a way out. I'm so alone, I don't know how to go on anymore. Bipolar type 2.

Firstly, I thought, since the day I met her, she was the love of my life. Like an angel walking on Earth. I met her in my sophomore year of college; we quickly became best friends, but she was in a relationship at the time. For two years I patiently waited for her while being hopelessly in love, and even helped her through her relationship. Until one day finally came, that she realized she loved me too. We started dating, and the passion was the strongest thing we had ever felt, because it was backed up by years of knowing each other.
We talked about getting married. Having kids. We were completely in love.

I lived with her for several months, and had never felt a joy like it. After about a year, I had to move a couple hours away for a new job opportunity. But we promised we'd see each other every weekend, and everything was still great. Until one weekend; memorial day weekend. She was supposed to stay the weekend. She drove all the way over, but the first night, she flat out told me 

'im sorry I thought I could change my mind. But when I look at you, I don't love you anymore. I hate driving to your place, I don't like being here. I haven't really felt like I loved you for awhile, and this just made me sure""

She indicated that this was partly due to me smoking and drinking too much. Which is something I knew but couldn't stop. But partly just due to the fact that her feelings had changed 

We maintained wed still be friends. But she systematically cut me away from her life. Stopped allowing calls, only texts. Stopped allowing texts, only emails. Then abruptly blocked all forms of communication. I begged her for closure, for release. Just to tell me that we were done. But I didn't even get that.

Then I lost my mind completely. Went off my meds. started making new emails accounts, saying worse and worse things to make her respond somehow. I threatened my own life, then hers. Over and over. I told her to call the police. See I'd never hurt anyone, but I thought I could get closure if the police came, cause then I'd know she read the thousand emails I sent begging her for one sentence of closure. Just one sentence. And she couldn't give me that. Anyway. The police sure did come lol. I was 5150d. Not a good experience. And still doesn't feel like closure. But at least I knew she read it. Feels like I'm at Rock bottom.

I quit drinking. Finally. I'm taking my meds. But nothing changed, except for helping me not completely lose my shit. My life is hollow and empty.


My whole life feels meaningless. I have no friends left. She left me. And I don't want to live anymore with nobody in my life. I'm just alone with my thoughts. Every day. And I can't take it anymore"
892,Why and for how long? Did you wait on them to reach out to you or did you want to be left alone and come back when you were ready to?
893,"I have ptsd, bipolar 1 and now panic disorder.  I'm new here.  I was taken off lorazepam about 3 months ago.   Now I'm having really bad anxiety and panic attacks.   I feel so scared when I have them.

What helps you when you're having a panic attack?   If you have them...

Any input is appreciated. :low:"
894,"Hello,

I have been dating and more recently engaged to an amazing but unmedicated bipolar gal for over a year and a half now. I love her more than anything in this world, she can be so incredibly sweet, kind, funny, goofy. She always seemed to greatly appreciate everything I did to be together (she lives in Russia, me the USA. I flew and visited her in July to confirm what we.felt, we got engaged there. Recently filed to have her come here. I was supposed to visit again in three weeks, Jan 4th..)


She has been heading down hill since... Well early October. We had some issues where she felt I was being very insecure, suspicious of her. I don't remember the details honestly, we moved past it, she started to do a bit better... Then started getting more and more distant. She did this last year around this time of year too, got more and more distant, angered easier.

She told me at one point it felt like everything I say or do makes her mad. She calmed a bit, we continued on. About two weeks ago, she stopped talking and wanted to be alone. She came back saying she decided she didn't love me, didn't want to be together didn't want any of it. Said sorry but that's it. Got mad when I tried to discuss it of course. Blocked me.


Few days go by, she comes back saying sorry that she still wants to marry, but she's unsure of her feelings, unsure if she wants to see me in January. Well, I do my best to work with it. We continue on, but she's increasingly distant and barely speaking to me. When I try to talk to her, she ignores it. She gets mad when I ask. Now, I know I should have backed off. I got too pushy. I pushed and it was making her mad.

Well, then I noted she had tried to secretly add two single guys that were local to her area... She had them hidden, but they popped up on suggestions so I ended up seeing them. I asked her simply, not ruely who they were. This angered her, saying I didn't trust her, that I shouldn't have to ask. She eventually told me who they were and said she just didn't want me to worry is why she hid them. Seemed reasonable enough I guess. She removed one, but not the other. I started noticing that they seemed to be staying up to the exact same times as eachother each night, but, I ignored it, I didn't question her I trusted her and left it alone. I asked nothing further. I never accused her of doing anything wrong, I told her she should have just told me or added them normally instead of doing it secretive style, as that made me more worried than anything, but that I trusted her and it was no big deal. I didn't ask her to remove them or anything else.


Saturday comes around, her day off. I'm trying to chat with her and she's barely responding, but she's on there till almost 5 am. Note, so was he... Which was not typical for him, either, from what I saw. Yes, I realize me watching this is inappropriate, but I felt something was off so this is the best I could do.

Eventually after her ignoring multiple messages from me asking if she would please do something health related (she has been smoking so many menthols she got poisoning I guess... So I asked her to get the gum instead.). She ignored multiple messages about it, just read them and went back to whatever she was up to. So I finally asked a simple ""why are you just ignoring me on this 😔"".

She replied with , Jesus f***ing Christ, are you ever going to stop? And blocked me. I asked why she blocked me like that, and she told me she couldn't be with someone who is so insecure? I don't understand how she figured it was insecurities, when I wasn't asking anything about this person, or anything like that at all. I was asking why she was being so distant. She said something about how she should have just slept with someone else so"" it made sense"" that I was insecure.


The worst of it is, normally nothing I did would bother her. And I didn't accuse her of anything wrong at all, ever. I apologized to her many times for even ASKING who the person was, and explained that I didn't think anything bad happened only that I was wondering who they were and why she felt the need to hide it. I explained that it's been difficult with how distant she's been, and not knowing how she feels, but I didn't suspect her of doing anything wrong.


She's since cut all contact with me, blocked me, immediately blocks any profile if I try to contact her. I tried apologizing in multiple emails but I don't even know that she reads them now. This is a person who waited a year just to meet in person, filed a divorce from a failed marriage to be with me. I do believe she sincerely loved me... But I don't think she does now. I don't know what to think honestly. Last year, almost the same time, she did almost the exact same thing. Grew very distant, started adding and talking to new guys. She blocked me and told me she never wanted to hear from me again last year, too, from dec 19th through like the 31sr... It was the longest such incident. It's been a week this time already. This time feels different to me though, because she said thank you for everything but I can't do this anymore, because you're too insecure m that it's my fault.

I asked friends if they felt I was too insecure in how I handled it.. no one seems to think so. I thought all things considered I was rather polite and patient, I mean I didn't get angry with her just asked. Even whole being ignored I wasn't angry.

Last year when she eventually came back, she apologized of course. She told me she went on a few dates with one of the guys she added. She claimed nothing happened between them but ""had the chance to"", which idk if I completely buy, but I accepted it and took it in stride. I forgave her and moved forward.



My questions are.
. Well one, was I really being that insecure asking who they were..? 

Two. I know every other time in the past, she came back. But I feel like I lost her for good this time. I know she had a lot going on and I made it worse by pushing her to talk to me. I screwed up. I wish she would have told me that she needed time alone or something (although, it certainly appeared she was just busy with other conversations, and specifically didn't want to speak to me.) But should I expect her to try to come back at some point...?

I don't know what to do. I love this girl. Truly, love her, like the stupid kind you see in movies. I took a second job so I could afford to go see her. I traveled to a country half the world away, I stayed faithful and waited a year through all the ups and downs and never stopped caring. I still love her very much, even though I've been barely eating, crying for a week straight. The last two months have been difficult, but I didnt want anyone else. I just want her.

I realize I screwed up really really badly by messaging her so much especially after she blocked me (she usually allows emails, I think she's ignoring them now too). I tried really hard to apologize. One email, I got upset and frustrated by it. First time I've EVER done that. I told her that okay, she can just go then. Didn't swear or say anything rude.. but that itself I regret horribly. Idk if she even read it.


What is going on with her? Is it likely she really is seeing this person and is having guilt issues trying to sort out how she feels? I mean, I also noticed after she removed me, he suddenly made his profile private. Like maybe she told him she has a crazy ex type of thing unfortunately.

I don't know what I would do if she comes back. I just don't want her gone from my life. I love her too much for that. I don't know if I can make a relationship work because everything is getting derailed, our petition to move her here. All my friends and family tell me to move on and forget her. Some even say she never felt anything for me at all, but I don't believe that. She.. cried in my arms telling me how special she felt with me, when I visited. She cried horribly when I left. I think she loved me. I don't think she does currently though.


Anyway.. this is a rambling mess.. I'm just hurting bad. It's not the first time she's left, but it's one of the longest and there are subtle differences. Including the possible third party. I am STILL not accusing her of doing anything wrong. And if she came back I wouldn't even ask honestly. I just want to know if I should even expect her to ever come back...

About a month and a half ago, after a shorter split, she said,

""
Of course I was coming back. I always am. I don't want to lose you

You're the most important person in my life""

.. I just don't know if I should trust that now or not... 

I'm sorry this is incoherent. And I realize she's left probably a good 20 times over the time, usually only a couple of days though... But it feels different idk why. I'm scared that I pushed her out of my life. I've tried to be as kind and patient with her as possible because I truly love this girl.  Friends and family tell me to move on all the time, that it's not fair to me, but I love her... I can't just move on and forget her. She's special to me.


Thanks for the time reading this. I appreciate any and all feedback. I appreciate anything at this point. I just miss her so much."
895,"Hello. I’ve been diagnosed with BPD I for about 7 years. The first mania I had destroyed my life. I gave up a great job, a great apartment (in a very expensive city) to move to Peru and start a motorcycle campground. That obviously didn’t happen, I had $5000 in savings. I destroyed nearly all my friendships, severely strained my family relationships, and other terrible and unpleasant things. I spent the next few years apologizing to people I offended with my behavior. Most readily forgave my strange behavior, some insisted mental illness is not a thing, and sadly, there were a few whose friendship I was never able to revive properly. After the manic episode there was a HUGE crash into deep depression, and I obviously had a lot of trouble trying to rebuild my life in that state. For the most part it was eventually sorted and I went back to my “normal” (moderate to severe pervasive depression). Though I was told I came back far more fragile than I had been. I always thought that my support network and I would see the mania symptoms coming on after that and could catch it before anything horrible happened. Well, that didn’t really happen and about nine months ago a new, horrible mania started that was so full of anger and hate that was nearly impossible to control. As a contrast, the first mania felt like being high on free coke and full of ridiculous, albeit destructive, fun. In mania #2 I have managed to alienate a great number of very good friends by telling them terrible truths in anger that should not be said out loud. I can’t take those back and I’m not sure how long it will take to make things right. Or if I can even do that.

Anyhow, the point is that I feel like an absolute monster. I can’t help but think what kind of person wants to be in a relationship with this mess? Or even friends? I know if have redeeming qualities  and am still actually likable on the surface. But the unpredictable, offensive, damaging monster lurks just beneath the surface. Why should people keep forgiving me for my behavior? My therapist gives me  the whole cancer spiel, but no, this is different. This is also often a fatal disease but rather than mutant cells wreaking havoc on my body, my brain is destroying not just my relationships with people I love and any sense of self-love I ever had, but my words spoken in times of mania are causing these people I love significant pain. Who do you reconcile the awesome you that is not this disease and the horrible monster you become?"
896,"I think it's getting close to 6 weeks after Lithium.
the first few days were an immediate return to symptoms of my bipolar...
especially the mania but a mania unlike any other something that terrified me into practising my DBT skills at least this was a good thing and remains this way.

I was careful this time I took my time but it's taking a long time still.

I forget what I mean just now I think I know I am tired a bit tired.

initially I was excited to meet the brand new un-medicated me and I keep looking around and I am curious that this is just it what I got right now.

DBT taught me to just observe and be mindful...

I just nod to myself... go have a cool shower and wait for my pillows to be all that they can be"
897,"I saw my cpn on Friday just gone and explained that my mood has been extremely high since 27th November until today when it has just dropped massively to where I'm not hungry, don't want my family and am in physical pain with extreme headache yet 5am yesterday I was running hills. Literally.
I've had BPD for 10yrs diagnosed and PPD.
It's as like switching a light switch on and off with no mellowing gradually. I have psychosis too. Does this sound like bipolar? I want to have sex alot too but have a wondering eye LOL. Thanks"
898,"I thought it would be nice to have a place to post your successes. BP doesn’t always have to be doom and gloom. 

I’ve had my challenges with BP and am still working on several aspects of the disease. However I have had one great success.

Due to my suffering from BP and doing stupid things (cheating) I got divorced in 2013. After three years of being apart where I got great care and even better medications, I was able to reconnect with my ex and we eventually remarried. 

After 3 years of marriage we are happier then we have ever been. 

It’s been the highlight of my life living with BP. Now that I know what is going on I have a fighting chance to keep my life stable. 

Hopefully this will help some people. I prefer a life of positivity so I tend to post happy stuff."
899,"So, this is actually a follow up with my post here:

https://www.mentalhealthforum.net/forum/threads/i-need-some-feedback-input.245542/#post-1930389

I just want an outside opinion, if it sounds like mania to them.

Basically, my now ex fiance was growing more and more distant. I knew she was dealing with depression and was getting worse. Then she suddenly started adding new guy friends... And ignoring me. Suddenly busy a lot. She got very angry and accused me of being insecure purely because I asked what was going on.

 Fast forward to a week later of being blocked, she now said she doesn't love me at all. That I am a ""psycho"" because I told her I still love her and care about her health, and I am worried about her..

She has completely changed character, I mean COMPLETELY. She's normally a shy introvert who doesn't like people much. Stays in. Very kind, polite. This girl... She's an extrovert. Suddenly she said, we can't even talk as friends because she prefers ""real life friends"" (we live very far apart, bug we were engaged and in the process of moving her here.). She used to say a month or less ago that, I was the most important person in the world and she never wanted to lose me, not even as a friend if the relationship didn't work. Now, wants me gone because in a psycho for not instantly losing my love for her.

She seems to be meeting MANY new guys. I'm... Assuming it's probably not good heh. She is cold, cruel. I also discussed that last year, around this time, she experienced something very similar. That she stopped loving me and did different things. She said she remembered. I asked her if it seemed reasonable that it could be her disease again， rather than her actually suddenly hating me after loving me dearly for so long.. that's when she called me a bunch of names and blocked me heh. 

She seems to be sleeping less. She got angry about things that made no sense, even said she reported my social media profile because I had posted comments on my own wall saying I cared about her. 

I'm forgetting some things. But basically I just want people's opinions, it definitely seems like mania, or at minimum a mixed state? She's COMPLETELY different and she doesn't even see it. I stopped trying to show her or contact her, I'm blocked anyway. 


It hurts really bad to see someone I love so much, hurt herself so badly and throw away our life together in a heartbeat. I'm worried about her deeply."
900,"Ok, so let's open up a massive can of worms...

What do you lot think of using Cannabis as a form of self medication?"
901,I talked to my shrink about missing hypomania and I felt completely shut off he told me that hypomania is an illusive and what I feel during it is not real. Yet my hypomanic state shapes a part of who I am since I am very into arts that state helps me feel very creative and I actually create stuff. But now with medication I feel so dull and lethargic I feel like a huge part of my identity has been robbed from me and it is an awful feeling. My shrink does not get it.

909,"Hi guys,

Obviously, I need help. My girlfriend broke up with me a week ago while she was on a mushroom trip. She said she wants to focus on herself and that I need to do that, too. This is the first time that we’ve broken up and never got back together like just a few hours after. She said that she’s feeling too pressured to cater to my “demands” like updating me if she’s okay or what she’s doing because she’s on vacation. I just couldn’t seem to understand how quick it was for her to do that because just a few hours bedore that, she told me “I am so grateful for your existence.” She was telling me how much she loves me and that she can’t lose me. I am still in shock and I still couldn’t understand. She arrived a few days ago and we talked about it. She said she’s been thinking about it for a while now because she hurt me (physically) and she said she needs to heal... We have had issues in the past and she is kinda right when she said “I don’t want to argue everyday. That’s toxic.” But we have had a lot of happy moments, it’s not always arguing... maybe she’s just too pressured to think straight right now.

I feel somewhat betrayed that she didn’t tell me during a heart-to-heart talk that she was really feeling this way.

Now, here is the tricky part. Ever since she got back from Indonesia, we have been seeing each other almost everyday. The first day was awkward, but the next was great. It seemed like nothing’s changed, but the days after that, she became somewhat distant. She keeps telling me that I should give up because this would never work. She keeps telling me she’s not worth it and that I should go on with my life, but I can’t... because I love her so dearly. She keeps pushing me away, I get frustrated and offended... but I would always come around. I would always choose her at the end of the day. I just couldn’t imagine her battling this thing alone.

I want to understand all of this because I love her, and she said she loves me, too, and that I shouldn’t worry because she does love me... But the way she acts sometimes shows otherwise... she even said she’s just slowly detaching from me. But I don’t believe her entirely because I know that she might be saying these things. especially tonight.

What could be happening to her right now? Could someone please tell me. I am in shambles because we were supposed to go overseas together next year for work and now I’m going to spend Christmas and New Years without having someone to call the love of my life. :(


PLEASE HELP ME. ANY INSIGHT WOULD BE GREAT, BUT I REALLY NEED SOME GUIDANCE ON HOW I COULD BE THERE FOR HER AND HOW TO TREAT HER BETTER."
910,"I have schizoaffective bipolar disorder. And I'm on a CTO. I refuse to take my injection on my appointment tomorrow so I assume they'll be sending the police. Does anyone know when the police will be called? Is it the same day of the appointment I miss, or a few days after?

Thank you"
911,"Well today was the day of the Psychiatrist review.  I had decided to write stuff down in a letter to try and be clear/not forget.  I also wanted to make the most of the appointment time. I am so all over the place at the minute, but one place my mood does not particularly appear to be is too far down.  It seems to be holding itself out of the depths, for now, on 150 mg Venlafaxine per day and 200 mg Topiramate.  As I have said, since the withdrawal of the Amisulpride around May this year I have found it increasingly hard to be 'settled' and to manage/control feelings of anxiety.  There is an edge to me, an inner anger which I have to struggle to control, this being more prominent past few months as well.  Then of course the history over 20 years, the threat of MS, and it coming home to roost with the recent scan results showing lesions etc. Add to that one or two of the stressors we all have and - well I am not a pretty sight just now!  Whiles I am laughing and giggling almost hysterically in front of my autistic son (who cannot deal with all this), then I am flat, tired, but the thoughts just wont stop flowing.  The ideas wont stop forming.  Exhausting.  I wrote so much of the letter, then typed that I could not continue because I was too tired (brain).

So I handed letter over at reception and waited.  Told them he was to read it before seeing me please.  I got in and he had an Advanced Nurse Practitioner student with him.  I knew her.  He proceeded to explain her role, blah, blah!  And I let rip!  I could not hold it back.  I more or less told him to shut the f*** up and let me the patient talk.  Now this was pure anger and out of character for me to present that way.  I was shouting - all about how I could not control my moods, feelings, had been left to deal with it - the 20 year history and the possible implications for my mental health.  This to me was uncontrolled mental illness.  I don't shout at people.  I am polite, patient and warm hearted generally.  Not down right rude.

I  can't write much more for tonight.  He is seeing me again in a month.  I am going to be taking Lyrica for the anxiety.  75mg x 2 per day.  Have to see how it goes.  This might not make perfect sense but best I can manage for now,  I apologised for my presentation."
912,"hey! first post. i have been hospitalized for bipolar and have been told by varying doctors that i am also on the borderline spectrum and am currently unmedicated but was on trileptal and seroquil when i was taking meds. but whatever with that

for a very very long time i can recall past events with zero emotions behind them. i know things happened but i have zero emotions attached. for example a very dear friend of mine took his life six months ago and i dont feel any extreme emotions about this (although i have been told that when i drink in excess i was seen crying about it, but dont remember). i also only think of the future if theres an event coming up that is a stressor or i think something bad will come to me at a certain function. but mostly i am just stagnant and feel nothing all day everyday and dissociate until nightfall. i hardly move and wont leave my bed unless it is absolutely necessary. Today is the only day that matters to me and focus only on whats happening at this exact moment, its like the past means nothing and that everyone in my life yesterday is disposable. Any one else experience this or understand what this is?"
913,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at one of my many inpatient hospital stays. I also struggle with anxiety and something called misophonia. Basically, stimuli bothers me (chewing tapping repetitive noise or movements). So much so that I had to drop out of college. It's one of the reasons I tried to end my life. Anyways, lately, I'm in a bad place. Hardly can sleep and the only thing I can do is weed or alcohol to try and stop thinking about dying. I want to go to a hospital, or preferably a residential center for a while. (I can't hurt my family any longer. also lose friends because I get angry and reckless and I want that to stop while I'm young. and the ability to do day to day tasks is hard because Im so agitated or sad or anxious). The issue is, there's gonna be other patients, so there's gonna be stimuli. earplugs don't do much- I live my life listening to music or white noise even in the presence of friends, and obviously I can't have my phone there. Also, many residential places don't give out controlled substances, and klonopin is the only relief I get. So I don't know what to do or where to go. I want to get help for the issues im having but how do I do that when the treatment center is triggering? I called many places and they all basically told me I'm outta luck."
914,"My husband as of September of last year started having problems. We had a rough time April of last year when we were evicted from our home because the landlord didn’t want to fix the issues in our home. Our basement would back up with sewage and the cheap handy men she sent to fix it the first few times told us that it had Been happening for years. 

They also told us about how the landlord would break into the house and yell at tenants and we found out but had it confirmed by the neighbors when we got to know them that behind the wood paneling of our walls were the home to a gnarly bed bug infestation. We fought with these issues up until our lease was up. By that time the flood had taken out the hot water heater AND the actual heater itself in March and our landlord decided to ignore us when we attempted to pay our rent and took us to court for unpaid rent. Since the issue was not fault of ours and the judge ruled us not responsible for the damage to the basement we expected to be granted 30 days to leave because the lease was up but no we were given 3 days and the day we got the news that we had 3 days was at 3pm and it counted as our first day. 

So we struggled and scrambled to move three adult and four children’s belonging out of a four bedroom house in 3 days. We were harassed by the landlord the entire time basically reminding us if we weren’t out that last day he’d call the sheriff. We had to leave a lot of belongings including everything that was damaged when the basement flooded. We had no where to go and ended up moving in with someone we thought was a saint. I’d never really gotten a chance to go to her house but we’d known her for years. Her home was deplorable. She didn’t clean up after her multiple cats or dogs and everything was just trashed and we found out her water heater had broken down the year prior. We agreed to help her get her house cleaned up as long as she helped so we knew what she wanted to keep and didn’t. She was constantly leaving. Anytime we started to help her clean she would make an excuse to leave. So we could only throw away what was blatant trash which was very little. 

She was a hoarder. She treated our kids like they were stupid and tried to make them clean up after her pets. She got mad that we refused to help unless she was willing to help herself considering it was her house and she kicked us out. We moved in with a couple whom we were mutual friends with and they proceeded to tell us the bad idea it was to move in with her and took us in. 

This whole time we’d been working on saving money to get our own home when we got to our friends house they said it would give them training for when they had kids of their own but everytime one of the kids would do something a kid does they would freak out. He sent my 2 year old to his game room to watch a show while he forced me to watch movies with him on his day off and flipped out screaming at all my kids because that day my 2 year old got into his embroidery kit. Our kids were so emotionally torn up from all of this to where I stayed locked up in a bedroom with my kids all day and only cane out to go to school to keep them away from my kids. 

They brought us into their relationship issues and we gave them the best advice we could considering one thought the other was cheating on him and the other told us he was given a free pass to do so making us feel so uncomfortable. We had a falling out and We left to stay with extended family and the apartment upstairs opened up in January of last year. At this point my husband was torn up losing one of his best friends and felt like he was played by what had happened up until this point. In February his dad found him after 25 years and cane to visit with his family. They came and they spent a lot of time trying to fix my husbands car while I entertained his wife and her 17 year old daughter and their two toddlers. I was stuck babysitting the kids half the time but did sit and talk to his step sister and she let slip they were living in a hotel. I asked my husband about it and he thought I was lying till he asked his dad about it and then it came out that his dad was bipolar and physically and verbally abused his wife and kids and had a significant cocaine problem. My husbands illusion of what he thought his father was was shattered. 

All this happened so close together than it really messed my husband up but he was raised to bury stuff down and don’t talk about it so sometimes I have to pry but with the extensive medical issues I was dealing with I completely failed to realize. He was scared I was going to die. So he started getting just real mean and snarky this past spring and it led to him maniacally laughing about how he didn’t know what was wrong with him and I talked with him and told him to let me know when he needed me. 

He was okay for awhile but then he had another low and was just mean to my kids and I. Screaming and yelling at us which is a no no for me due to my ex husband being abusive to us. He agreed to go to therapy and see if he could possibly bipolar like his dad. He told she said he wasn’t after the appointment and he was prescribed meds for anxiety. I found out months later he stopped taking them because they “didn’t help” and he stopped going to therapy because it “didn’t help” fast forward to last night. He disappeared and we couldn’t find him. I messaged him and he was not doing well. This time he was talking about suicide. Telling me I was the reason for all his issues and bringing up mistakes I’d made years ago claiming they were happening recently. He was so sure that he was right. He claimed that I never listened to anything he said when he talked to me about the issues he was having when in all actuality he has never let me in and would only answer questions if ask. He talked about how everyone called him a failure and that no one ever appreciated him and that any appreciation that was given was a lie. 

I spoke some hard truths and finally got him settled down around 4am. I found out he didn’t tell the psychiatrist about his episodes or the suicidal thoughts when they happen and got him to agree to go again for a re-evaluation but it’ll take at least a month to get him seen. So I’m trying To do a lot of my own research. Can one be bipolar with manic lows but not have manic highs? My brother is bipolar and he swears my husband is too but he just doesn’t ever have those manic highs. Has anyone experienced something like this? Because I have been trying everything I can think of to get him to get help but he wants an instant fix and it doesn’t work like that. Please help!"
915,"Hi, I really need help
I think I have bipolar or something I dont know. Lately I feel like I've been going off the rails. I just had sex with my ex, I've got so many emotions going through me, he doesnt give a shit about me and never has,  I dont know why I had sex with him but I feel more insane than ever. I dont know what to do I think I need help, I csnt explain what om feeling it's like a numbness but intensified I know that makes no sense. I dont know how to explain how I'm fukcing feeling."
916,"Wow, it's been a long time since I posted here.

I have bipolar disorder, OCD and occasional psychosis. At the advice of my psychiatrist, I am tapering my lithium and have stopped my aripiprazole. I just stopped the antipsychotic today and have regained the ability to feel things; earlier, I used to be numb always. I'm on lamotrigine 200 mg, apart from a low dose of lithium which will be stopped soon. Thus, lamotrigine is the only psychiatric medication I'll be on about a month from now.

How is everyone doing here? I hope I'll be here for a while this time around."
917,I have a new dr now & he is soooo much better than the one that I had before because well 1 he actually listens & 2 he wants to do genetic testing & 3 he has promised not to guinea pig me which when he said that it was like magic words to my ears for real! So I will be starting Vraylar soon for my bipolar/borderline personality & have not been on it before. Any thoughts &/or experiences? :thanks:
918,"I know I am not doing too good just now, both physically and mentally.  Having had to stop Amisulpride in May because of the Prolactin issue no substitute has been put in place alongside the new anti-depressant, Venlafaxine.  I have been struggling ever since to be well, and of course now shaking with the shock of the MS diagnosis.  The latter feels like a real struggle to get access to the Neurologist and agree treatment.  Some of my family responses seem a little bizarre - not really acknowledging the illness, leaving me on my own with it and so forth and I feel isolated.  I see the Consultant Psychiatrist next week and I will be relieved to discuss my situation and my need for the right medication.  I know I am not too stable.  Up and down.  Cannot concentrate.  Tearful and emotional.  Can people tell me is it wrong of me to be telling one of my sons No, I am not going to be taking your 2 children (aged 2 and 4 and whom I love very much) off your hands at the moment.  I feel I have at least one very serious illness going on and cannot cope, that it is help I need from them not the other way around! (I have done child-minding for them for 4 years and plan try to help again next year despite MS but the path cannot be one way - is that selfish?)."
919,"My boyfriend has been taking lamictal for a few months now, when we first got together he cheated and confessed he cheated on girlfriends before but he also lived for a very long time without any meds and while drinking all the time so I read up on hypersexuality and worked through it the best I could with him but I was always asking him questions afraid it would happen again. I believed he was doing better now on the meds, he quit drinking and seemed like he had better impulse control.

I noticed he started spending slightly more but thought not to think too much into it. I had a sense something was off but I also thought I may be thinking into it too much. He seemed like his sex drive was lower and would sometimes say he wasn't in the mood when I was. I saw on his phone that he had been looking at porn in spouts and dating websites and found out he was drinking again too here and there. He also confessed that he will sometimes flirt with people he finds attractive. I was completely hurt because I had always checked in and asked him if he was feeling symptomatic or drinking and he would say no. In that moment I lost faith in everything and questioned everything. I was afraid he slept with someone else but he swears he hadn't but I don't know what to believe or how to get him to be honest and that's the most frustrating part. 

I read up on Bipolar a lot and see people describe their hypersexuality as a complete impulse that they cannot control then the next minute I think if he loved me he wouldn't flirt with other girls and seek them out. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around if hypersexuality is a valid reason. Another thing is he is on a 200mg dose of lamictal and recently increased - could he still be manic on that dosage? I want him to get the best treatment but don't know why this isn't working or if he is just lying to me. I feel like I am not special to him because he keeps seeking out people and I feel like I should mean more than them. It feels like he views the world as just a sea of attractive people. I want to work through it but I need honesty and I don't know what to do."
920,I have bipolar 1 disorder and avoidant personality disorder. And maybe it's the avoidant personality disorder.  Because I care so much about  what other people think. But I can control my bipolar symptoms around other people. And it's like the anger and stuff. People in my family well the ones I'm close with. They already know how I can be. So I don't feel I have to hide it around them. But strangers. And even people I'm around quite a bit that don't know my diagnosis. I can control my actions. And I am a totally different person around those people. But my family gets a different side of me. Does anyone else feel like they can keep their symptoms under wraps around certain people?
921,"Hey guys...
I’m new here... BP diagnosed  9 years ago. Have been somewhat stable -ish over the years. Kind of. Lately I’ve been very very down. I hate this so much. I hate when people look at you like you’re crazy or that they pity you. I hate “I’m worried about you”. I HATE THAT. Just venting reaching out to people who understand I guess. I hate not being “normal”. I wish I could handle life. I have a good job and a family but I am barely hanging on 😞"
922,"Hi everyone, I am new to this forum and just trying to ignore the fears and do the daunting first post...
I am 47 and was diagnosed with Bipolar II nearly three years ago (but I have struggled with depression and hypomanic symptoms since I was 14). I take lithium and fluoxetine but this has not been a magic bullet, I struggle with side-effects, relapses etc. etc.
But possibly the hardest thing to deal with is shame - the shame of being unwell, and the shame of things done while I was unwell most particularly. It is difficult to take responsibility for myself, my health, and my actions (and I do) without suffering from guilt, grief and shame connected to it (and I also do). How do I find a better way of dealing with this? Is there a way to process it or reframe it?
I am really struggling at the moment with this very issue, and I would gladly accept any thoughts or strategies that anyone finds helpful. Failing that, I'm just hoping that I'm not alone on the shame train.
Kindest regards,
Victoria"

924,"Hi everyone,

It would be fair to warn you by starting to tell that this will be a lenghty message about my situation right now, about how helpless I feel confronted to smallish life problems. This is my whining moment, as I've got few person to go to for this, except my psychiatrist, and just wanted to share, talk, and empty my bag.

To start, I must say that I was diagnosed as bipolar a coupe years ago, after a particularly bad depression that nearly got me. My world shattered, and I had lost all confidence in myself and my life before seeking treatment, but I won't tell much about how I got here. I started taking my meds (antidepressant+ mood regulators) and started taking responsibility for my life. At that time, I got back up mostly because I had a girlfriend after years of celibate, was busy with my master's degree and concert organization, different projects, and so on. 

Today, I still struggle with the same problems I had back then, when I got my biggest depressive episode. After a manic episode this summer that lasted two months, and got resorbed with new medication, here comes the time of depression again.
I don't really know where to start, because that would need a lot of backstory. I'll just start by saying that I feel very alone. Even though people find me very sociable, and I'm not as shy and socially anxious as in my youth, I tend to feel very alone because nobody comes to me nor invite me to stuff. I get to see quite some friends usually, but lately it has been the friendship desert. I know BD causes this perception, but I can't quite stop the feelings of rejection and the thoughts of being abandoned and ignored by people, which in some cases is true. I also feel alone because I can't manage to find a girlfriend. After a year long relationship breakup last year, I tried to find someone again, but without success, as nearly every girl I tried to flirt with this year ignored or ghosted me. This gets straight to my confidence issues, and I feel miserable not to being able to attract someone. 

The fact is I wouldn't appear as someone to complain on the appearances. I've got a job in the field I like, but it ends up to be loosy and not giving me the opportunity to gain money, hence live comfortably. I've got many friends and know a lot of people, but none will call me from time to time to check up on me or invite me to stuff. I've got many projects, but none seems to work fine enough nor bring me any recognition (even though it's not the objective I have with them). People would say I'm interesting, smart and attractive, but I cant' land a girlfriend, even though I missed some opportunities. It feels like my whole world is shattering appart, and the only one to blame is myself 'cause I end up spending my time in self loathing and destructive thoughts. I can't help but feeling like I do everything wrong, that no one truly loves me, that I'm full of default with everyone and everything, and that my life is going nowhere by now. 
I know I'm letting the bipolar disorder speak at this moment, but I can't seem to make it shut. It got so deep in my mind that everything seems bleak now. 

But I know I have to take responsibility for my actions and my disease. Here's mostly my plan, and why It doesn't work.

- I started to stop smoking (not tobacco) and got one month clear without problem
- I started doing sport again, and feel some benefit
- I try to go out with friends and try not to be paranoid, pushy or needy, even though it's very hard. 
- I try to work as more as I can, even though I mostly feel depressed that I won't earn money
- I try to meet new girls, even though I feel like I don't have anything good to offer
- I try to drive my projects as much as I can, even though I feel overwhelmed and that it doesn't do much for me
- I try to have positive self talk, even though my mind will get back to depressive thoughts automatically. 

I don't know where to go, I don't know what to do. My mind is confuse and I can't seem to explain my situation. Maybe tomorrow."

928,"Hi all — here looking for advice and/or information. My Dad is bipolar (I think Bipolar I but I’m not sure) and he is seemingly treatment-resistant. His psychiatrist has now recommended ECT (about which he has doubts/concerns) but his depression is currently so severe that it led to muscle atrophy and hospitalization. Contrast this against two years ago when his mania was at such a point (and of risk to both he and my mom) that we attempted as a family to secure involuntary in-patient treatment for him (and failed) and his psychiatrist recommended a partial inpatient treatment program, which he rejected. I am at wits end, devastated by witnessing what depression is doing to my Dad and equally angry that he seems unwilling to make any effort/change/etc. to try to get better. I’m considering estrangement to protect myself from what I feel is his seemingly his “choice” to do nothing — but if there was some way that I could help reverse that trend I’m all ears — as I love him so much and just want him to be the Dad I remember, know, and love when his disease is in a more manageable place.

930,"I hate it when people are yelling at each other. I have to endure this at an internet cafe, subway train, and sometimes, on the buses. They argue loudly, scream and shout on the phones, and sometimes lash at me. This gives me the ass. I get so damn pissed that I want to cuss at these fuckers out. But if they do that, they go physical. Right off the bat. Hell, I have to say nothing and endure this shit day by day. There are times I move away, but sometimes I can't. Especially at an overcrowded rush hour in Seoul, South Korea.

931,"My older brother (37) has bipolar disorder and it’s been an extremely exhaustingly long road for our family and especially our mother. He’s done alright the last 4 or 5 years with no major manic episodes. This year he is very much in the midst of mania and he is absolutely tormenting our mother. He messages her constantly stirring up drama (threatening to take his ex back to court for custody which no one wants or thinks he can handle and threatening to keep the kids from us, as well threatening my mother to stop responding to him because things “could get a lot worse for her and she doesn’t want to be in the line of fire” I think he meant his poison text messages from the line of fire comment but the first I take as a threat toward her. He has been violent and threatening to her in the past (me as well but I’m not an aging older lady). 

I guess my question is, he is about to go off. He’s spinning out, after months of trying not to engage and basically kissing his ass to keep him from tipping over the edge, he’s about to. 

What can I do? Is it possible to reason with someone in a bipolar manic episode? He’s already sent my mother a message a few weeks ago, and I’m not kidding, saying he wanted to hurt himself or someone else, (his exact words), so is he looking for us to try to have him placed on a psych hold? Is that what is best for him right now? His prior manic episodes have led to arrests and jail time. Or should I just keep my distance, protect my mother as best I can and let the chips fall where they may? 

Thank you to anyone who made it to the end of this post and I would deeply appreciate any feedback. I’m on the edge of calling him and flipping out over stressing our mother (she has a heart condition) but I’m also concerned that is kind of what he is looking for. 

Thank you again."

When my anxiety gets extremely bad I get panic attacks then I get exhausted and depressed from the whole thing. My psychiatrist thinks I'm bipolar on a low scale
I looked up the symptoms of being bipolar and I don't believe i fit into that category. I am aware that medications can be used for multiple symptoms. Now I'm taking an antipsychotic for bipolar. I'm not confident that it even works. I'm starting think that they just make up diagnoses as they go.

937,"Hello,

I was recently placed on lithium by my psychologist. She told me about how great lithium was, that it got a bad rap, and how it was better compared to *insert a bi-polar medication you've never heard of*. When I asked her about side effects the first time she listed positive side effects like ""growing neural pathways"" and ""less anxiety"" consistently making it sound like this would start happening immediately. When I then specified negative side effects, she printed me off a basic sheet of side effects, and then told me there really weren't any and none of them were too bad. Furthermore, I'm fairly certain she didn't mention things like needing to drink more water or anything about lithium toxicity (I take several medications which decrease the excretion rate of lithium). After a month of really shitty side effects and minimal improvement, I feel like my psychologist did a less than credible job of preparing me for this medication. I am considering whether or not to switch psychologists. 

However, maybe she did do her job. I mean maybe most people don't have awful side effects (but I still feel like it was her job to tell me that was a possibility....). Please let me know if the information she gave was normal and tell me if I'm being too harsh on her. I honestly have no clue what a psychologist should be telling you before placing you on lithium. 
*Side note: Should it be working after a month? 
Thanks y'all so much!"

939,"My girlfriend of 1 year left me, after trying to take care of me despite my episodes, she understood and tried to help whenever she could despite her having BPD, but she had enough and left, this has all happened with my past relationships and friendships, they couldn't take it and left.. I promised her to get on medications again, but unfortunatly before I could we had a big fight and she blocked me on all social media but kept my number, I've been so emotional and my bipolar seems to be getting worse and I have noone to help around me, i'm all alone, I told her she can text me or call me if she needed me but it's been 4 days and she hasn't checked up so I think she's gone, how do I control this anger? sadness? I feel so ashamed because despite her having a mental illness she always helped me, but she said my behaviour was too toxic for her well being"
940,"When I was seeing a psychiatrist and was in the hospital as a teenager, I got the diagnosis of bipolar disorder not otherwise specified with psychotic features. I've never had a manic episode or hypomanic however I have had severe depression and as a teen was very angry to the point of being homicidal and having obsessive thoughts of murder. I was put on mood stabilizers and an antipsychotic which worked well after a failed trial with Celexa. My anger and thoughts have subsided since then but I've had bouts of severe depression in adulthood. A few years ago a doctor prescribed me Prozac and it made me suicidal. I then got prescribed Depakote and it helped but made me feel kinda blah all the time. The med that helped the most was Abilify. I don't take it anymore due to not having insurance to afford it and am struggling a bit now. I have mood swings but they happen so fast it's ridiculous and it's always been this way since I was a teen and struggled. I can be fine one minute then have depression build up throughout the day to the point where I'm planning my own death then have that fizzle out and be fine again all in the course of a few hours. My anger is like that too. I'll have bouts of anger where I am screaming, breaking things, and head banging but then be fine after a little bit. Idk what causes these super rapid mood changes because they happen without warning. Does anyone else experience this? I've tried doing research on bipolar disorder and I think I was misdiagnosed but idk what can account for my severe moods and quick changes."
941,My imagination becomes more vivid. Not so good I tend to connect up things that in reality have no connection.I tend to think  I just me have the answer to everything and I really think I can solve most problems almost like some sort of Oracle It is difficult for me to say this written down it just seems so silly .Can anyone on here relate to any of this? :love: :havingfun:
942,"I saw my doctor Yesterday and was prescribed Abilify 10 mg, while told to come off of Lamictal 50 mg. Lamictal caused me to have severe nausea, vomiting, suicidal idealization, sometimes severe anxiety, dissociate every single day, and to go completely numb. I couldn’t feel anxious, love, angry. I started to doubt my love for my husband. I seemed to feel irritated and guilty at times. It was miserable. But I am so so very glad to be going back on to Abilify. Weight gain seems like a big deal until you’re in the throes of mental anguish.
Anyway, I take my second pill tonight. But as of now I feel completely nothing? I usually feel severe anxiety when I start abilify almost immediately after taking it. But I’m not feeling anything. It’s worrying me that it won’t work. But I’m also telling myself things take time. Also, I just stopped taking Lamictal last night as well, and still no side effects but I was on a low dose of 50 mg. I figured coming off would feel horrible or something because I had such a hard time going on it?"

944,"I wish to live alone. But I have no money to do so. So I get stuck with my parents. Whenever I had a rough day, I just make someone infuriated. I feel like I'm just a brat. I have to keep my emotions to myself and don't have to express my anger. If I do, I end up getting into trouble and all sorts of mess. I can't say anything to them because they go angry.
And every morning is a pain in the ass. We get a phone call from my grandmother every morning, and my mother just goes off in anger. Every morning. I just shiver in fear that I can make it through every morning. My grandmother has a problem understanding people due to her sheer age.

My college demands me that I need a computer that is powerful enough to do assignments for my Computer Science course. But I have daily expenses to pay. And my savings of that money is slowly running out. Thankfully, one of the computer stores here in South Korea is giving a discount. So I asked my parents to buy it myself, before the money runs out. They got pissed and they are worried about moving out of this expensive house. Although my father (who lives in US) told us that he will provide the money so I can move out, but my mother is worried about the expenses; the part of Seoul I'm living in is very pricey.

I shouldn't have talked to my parents about the computer. Although I don't want any payments from them (I'm buying the PC myself), they still got angry due to the statement."

946,"Hi everyone, 
This is my first post so I don’t know how to start. 
My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 months. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder this year (not long before meeting me) and I have BPD. He was prescribed Sertraline but takes it sporadically because he doesn’t like the side effects of it (he keeps saying he will go to the doctor to get them changed but never ends up doing so. Apparently he has an app for next Tuesday). 
We are in a long distance relationship (2 hours away driving) as we go to different universities. 
The first 3 months of our relationship were perfect. Both of us were pretty stable despite having arguments here and there. We both were happy and he didn’t go through any episodes. 
Our issues started a month ago. He had come to visit me for the weekend. Friday and Saturday were amazing when on Sunday he completely switched on me? He tried to break up with me out of nowhere saying that he didn’t love me anymore (when on Friday he had given me a painting he had done for me, baked me biscuits and rushed to see me because he missed me) but then quickly retracted himself and said that he didn’t mean it. 
After he went back to uni, these past 3 weeks have been horrible. He told me he thought he was going through a depressive episode. He didn’t want to talk to me at all, wouldn’t reply to my messages, stays in his room most of the time, but when he does go out with his friend he seems to act normal with them? I’ve given him a lot of space, didn’t pry and just let him do his thing while reminding him that I would always be there for him. 
Last week he called me saying he wanted me to go over out of nowhere. I ended up visiting on Monday. Monday seemed to go great, he acted as he did before. We kissed, cuddled, laughed, smiled, chilled. Then on Tuesday we had a small argument and on Wednesday everything came crashing down. 
When I tried to kiss him in the morning he said he didn’t want to kiss me so I asked why and he just said he didn’t so I respected that. Then he hugged me and told me to enjoy it because this would be the last time. Then he once again said that he didn’t love me anymore and that he wanted to break up. We argued for a couple of hours, where he ended up smashing a glass, flipping a chair and throwing all the cutlery off the counter top. 
He went for a walk, asked me to leave and left me crying at his house. When he came back he broke down crying saying that he had almost made it, that he had made me go through this entire argument and that at the end he couldn’t go through with it. He then pulled me for a hug and started sobbing very loudly. I asked him if he really didn’t love me and he said that “it’s not that”. 
He has repeatedly said that my life would be better without him, during this argument he said that I had been so close to having someone as disgusting as him out of my life. 
He says that he wants to get better but nothing so far. He hasn’t changed his meds yet and he’s on the waiting list for therapy. 
I don’t know what to do. He has switched on me so much that I don’t know what to believe of all the things he has said. Sometimes he acts like he loves me and then he pulls this strong facade to hurt me and make me leave. Having BPD, I feel extremely unloved and rejected when he says things such as him not loving me anymore. 
I’m not trying to neglect his feelings. I genuinely do not know what to believe of all the things he has said and I don’t know how to act. I really do love him and I don’t know how to deal with the situation. I would really appreciate any advice from someone else’s perspective"

955,"Hey. So my boyfriend of 2.5 years won’t come near me. No kissing no hugs no affection, cold distant and detached. We had a baby 2018 and it’s been really stressful, plus he stopped smoking dope after years abuse and had a massive bipolar depression (suicidal ideation etc). We got him back on meds (he’d stopped taking lithium in 2017 so bipolar type 2 unmedicated except for dope). I’ve struggled with his irritation and agitation, restlessness and forgetfulness, insensitivity and arrogance. I see it all as part of the bipolar but he won’t. He blames me. When our baby was first born, I was on my own, I’d moved 200 miles from home, my 14 year old stopped talking to me, I had to give up work and my friends and family. I have done my best to fit in with his family and life but I was massively depressed and lonely. He doesn’t seem to care at all even though he says does and loves me. He’s now on lamactil and sertraline about 2 months, 175 mg and 50 mg respectively. He’s got worse. More arrogant more detached and more cold. No sex no kisses no intimacy and it’s killing me. He says there’s no one else but it’s like I repel him. I love him and am desperate for affection. Bipolar and meds and no more dope, is this the simple reason, I need help.  I’m so lonely"
956,"It seems like I’m not worthy to be here. I don’t have friends my ex’s have done me bad, it seems like I’m the outcast of the family. I wake up wishing I didn’t I just hate it here. It seems like dying would be better 😢"
957,"Hi all

Thank you for taking the time reading trough this message, that means a lot to me!
I am going trough a very hard time right now. I just broke up with my (now ex-) girlfriend, who has bipolar disorder. I am not even 100% what I want to get out of this post, but it would be great to get some perspectives from people that have experience with mental disease and everything that comes with it.

My ex is in her late twenties and was only diagnosed with bipolar disorder a year ago. She is taking her medicines and occasionally visits a psychiatric doctor. She has had a rough life. When she was younger, she has been addicted to heroin, off which she managed to stay clean for several years now. Until the first months when we met, she was also using a lot of cocain, and drinking a lot of alcohol. I guess she did all of this not having to deal with herself and her brain.
She has had lots of boyfriends during the years, some of which have treated her very badly. When we met, she had had a burnout, lost her job and just started with medicine. When we started becoming serious, for her everything changed. I am a pretty calm and caring guy, and she said that for the first time in her life, she felt completely safe with a guy. I am living a completely different lifestyle than the one she was, I don't take drugs and hardly drink alcohol, so we managed to take her out of her old lifestyle. She loves outdoor stuff and I do too, so we went camping often and that felt great. However, there were also problems in our relationship from the start onwards. In the beginning, she sometimes took cocain and called me in panick. I lived in another town, so I had to drive to her in the middle of the night to take care of her. Sometimes the same happened when she had drank way too much, I had to take care of her and she could hardly recall where she was. She always apologised for her behaviour and told me how much she loved me, and that she was so afraid to lose me. Her one side was very loving and caring towards me, but she could also become very angry and quite manipulative. I am a bit afraid of conflicts so this often resulted in her 'driving over me', verbally. In my experience, we fought quite a lot. But in her mind, we hardly fought at all, and the fights we had weren't so bad. I guess she had different experience from her past relationships than I had.

A couple of months into our relationship there had been so many incidents with alcohol that I begged her to stop drinking, and she agreed that she was an alcoholic and needed to stop drinking. I thought everything was going to be better from there on, I was so happy! But I was also naive. Several times I suspected she was hiding alcohol from me. After a couple of weeks, I found beer cans that she had hidden in the bathroom. When I confronted her, she became angry at me for being too hard on her. 'What are a few beers, at least she wasn't doing heroin'. She also started harming herself in this period. Nothing too serious (as in, not life-treatening), but it freaked me out! I didn't know what to do and how to take care of her, but when I suggested to get more help for her she turned it down as being unnecessary. She always convinced me that it was going uphill, which it was. In the beginning of our relationship she was taking cocain regularly and drinking every day, now she was only drinking a few beers when she had a bad day. But I still felt bad about it, having to discover drinks that she'd hidden from me in my own house. When it happened a second time, I couldn't handle it anymore and I started crying. She also started crying, and said that she was just hurting everyone that she loves.

To get to the point: about a week after this last alcohol incident I broke up with her. It was the hardest thing I ever did in my life. Even if we had only been together for a year, we had gone trough a lot together and were very close. She had told me several times that I was the best thing that ever happened to her, and that she was so afraid that I would leave her. And that is the thing I am so much struggeling with; I didn't want to leave her, but I felt like I had no energy left. The combination of bipolar disorder and alcoholism is taking her down, and was taking me with her. Although she had been in much worse situations in her life, for me this was all new and very scary. I have tried so hard to take care of her, but I couldn't do it anymore. So now I feel guilty. She is very sad that I 'just gave up', and I am angry with myself for giving up too."
958,Hey I’m new here! Would anyone be able to message me about their experience with bipolar and compare with mine because no one has any idea what wrong with me and it’s horrible :(
959,"Hi.

Have been diagnosed with bipolar since 21 which now is 20 years ago.

I have just had my 5th non consecutive 3 month episode and I cannot tell you have annoyed I am. It's the usual stuff in some ways, in that it's been hard on my family, I wish it wasn't there etc. At least this time I didn't spend any time in a mental hospital. Everyone was glad for that.

I'm at a point where I don't know what to do. I'm at a uni in Manchester that is the 3rd best in the world for nursing and I'm into my second year, just about made the grade. The thing is now, everything feels different. Majorly. I'm not  sure if I'll get this across but I will try.

I think I've been on the wrong medication for the past 20 years. That is a hell of a statement.

I believe I've been working (bipolar episode or not) in a bubble. Essentially at 70 - 80% effectiveness as a person.

Since this last event has happened all I feel I have literally ""woken up"".

I notice the small things in life and just feel so different.

I wonder why?

Is it a change of meds going to rispiridone, the fact that I am more older now than before?

I just feel a sense of clarity and it is freaking me out (both happily and unhappily as I wish it would have happened years sooner). What am I supposed to do? Just be greatful that I'm 100% on now? It's as much of an answer as I can come up with.

What do you guys think. Has this sense of clarity ever happened to you?

I would love to know as I am stumped (as well as is my psychiatrist).

All the best, ste."
960,"I have a question for you with bp whom may relate to this behaviour (or you with a partner with bp whom you feel has done something similar) - as I am struggling to see how I can be the best supporting partner to my gf.

I have a (rather new) long distance relationship with the most amazing girl. She is bipolar. Unsure of what kind.

I really want to be there for her and make this relationship work.

The relationship started early this summer. Everything went fine until she all of a sudden said things were going to fast and she needed time (actually, she has been the one ‘pushing’ up to that point, why I was somewhat amazed to hear of it). Nonetheless, I backed off, trying to be supportive.

The last month and a half, since that message of needing time, she ignores me for days only to send me a short text on how she misses me every day and loves me or how hot I am- then doesn’t open my replies to that for several days.

She can’t visit me due to work so I suggested I’d come over to her city. She was very excited about that. When I came I didn’t see her.

Any suggestions of what I should do?"
961,"I feel another episode of depression coming on...
Reading is my main escape, and I'm finding it harder to get into my books again.
I just want to stay in bed and sleep. Everything is taking extra effort and I know it's only going to get worse. My only hope is that my meds stabilize me this time (which seems unlikely)
I feel helpless. I can't control my mood. And if depression comes, will mania follow? My manic episodes are extremely destructive and embarrassing.
I hate this cycle that I'm trapped in. I'm trying to cope but it's hard..."
962,"Well my experiment of a new mood stabilizer didn’t work. Well I thought it did but my memory is going out. Unfortunately I didn’t really look into the side effects. Ha... was just wanting off the old medication cause of excessive weight gain. Well anyways things are kinda great. Hypomania is fun. But I guess my husband doesn’t like it. So after I don’t know like a year? I’m going back to being fat. Atleast I know the other one puts me in depression and apparently that’s what my husband wants.

let’s just make my husband happy."
963,"So I see there’s talk therapy. I tried a few years on and off. Exclusively for 2 yrs but stopped because I don’t think it works for me. Am I doing it wrong? I feel more stressed then relieved. More anxiety. More fear. Pain. All the negativity. Every time I talk about the bad things.

what is the point? I just don’t understand! It got to the point that I get stressed out going to my therapist. And stressed out after."
964,"Hi all, wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and may have some insight and advice. Feeling hugely isolated and self-destructive at the moment. I am a stay-at-home mom with a 10-year-old daughter. Life is imploding both inside and outside the house. Was hospitalized for a couple of weeks last year after a months-long depressive phase. Since then I've had some decent stretches but right now things are as hopeless as they've ever been. 

My husband and I have been in therapy for some time and wonder if we're just fundamentally incompatible; my complete lack of interest in sex doesn't help. Our daughter is in a tailspin and recently the police were at our door because of a threat she made at school. She sees a therapist who suspects OCD and autism (the fact that she's hugely anxious is indisputable), and we're in the process of having her tested. I had very few friends to begin with (moved from Canada to US 12 years ago and have only made a few since) and this week lost the last of them due to daughter's behavior around the other mom's daughter (screaming in the other girl's face and calling her a liar). No one seems to really know or care what we could be going through -- by all appearances they've labelled our daughter a bully and brat and written us off. Not surprisingly, I guess, no one has much sympathy for the parents of the ""bully.""

There is no refuge at home most of the time between marital issues, our daughter screaming abuse at us and the increasingly hoarder-like conditions of the house. We have no outside support beyond people I pay to hear me out.  My family is in Canada and I can't be honest with them about what's happening because I know it would worry them too much, especially seeing how they reacted to my hospitalization. Our family is in major crisis and has become completely isolated.

I usually ""find my fight"" eventually, but this latest friendship loss sent me over the edge since it was the last to go and I always took it for granted that this person would be there. Have been unable to find a reason to get out of bed. I've been scouring the internet but find no resources for parents ostracized due to their child's behavior, only ""wisdom"" along the lines of ""if the kid's a bully it's because the parents are bullies,"" case closed. Confrontation makes me panic and I'm the ultimate doormat/people-pleaser, so suggestions that I'm modelling bully behavior aren't really helpful. My husband is pretty mild-mannered as well, so our daughter behaving as she does makes us wonder if there's an underlying diagnosis that could explain some of it. We're certainly not perfect, but definitely didn't teach her that these behaviors are ok. It seems like every day I get an email or call from the school, a Girl Scout leader, or whoever telling me about her latest incident of making a scene by screaming at a teacher, verbally attacking another student, etc. There is no reprieve and this week I just broke.

All of this is to say that I have gone into complete self-destruct mode now that it seems the world has totally gone cold. I had been running consistently for a couple of months and feeling great about my one ""release,"" but hip pain and losing my mind under constant stress put a swift end to that. I don't care about anything and have been ""happy"" to sleep constantly and abuse myself with food and drink when awake.

Sorry for the monologue  -- just a lot of factors at play. Anyone, especially parents of ""that kid"", who can relate?"

I find it mentally exhausting to be around people everyday that it's become a constant battle and I'm depressed and anxious and overwhelmed at the thought of having to go into work tomorrow. In the last month I've had to leave work twice and called in sick because I was a wreck (depressed, uncontrollable crying, irritability, angry, exhausted and just about every negative emotion known to man) My job is my dream job and I worked very hard to get this job and in my small town,I`m lucky to have something that I am passionate about. But my extreme moods are ruining my life and Im afraid I`m going to quit, freak out, lose it, just fly off the deep end) I have 2 moods at this point- Wired and tired, cant sleep or stay asleep and go days with 3-4 broken hours of sleep, a million thoughts coming in at once, nervous, irritable, usually saying things I get embarrassed about, can`t concentrate and remember anything, feel sensitive to sounds and light, on the verge of rage and feel so overwhelmed and stressed out. Or depressed, sleeping, crying, still irritable and agitated but my mind isn't running out of control and I can sleep better. The most stressful thing for me at this moment is work because I work in a very busy, noisy, public facility and it`s taking everything in my whole being to make myself go. Being around people is the most challenging thing and it makes me so depressed to think I have to be around people. I feel like at any moment I`m going to break down and cry (and sometimes I do) or freak out and lose my cool because everyone bothers me and if someone even looks at me, it makes me want to rage. Everyday seems to feel worse and worse and I cant seem to find happiness with anything. I exercise daily (i`m in the fitness industry) teaching classes and training people and it`s so incredibly hard to stay positive and fake happy when I`m feeling the complete opposite. I have an appointment with a doctor in a few weeks and like every other doc I`ve seen in the past I know he will want me on meds for depression, anxiety, bipolar or whatever the hell he will diagnose with me with this time. Ive been on meds several times in the past when I was diagnosed with Bipolar in my 20`s and depression my whole life and had nothing but bull shit side effects and got fat which made me more depressed) For the last several years I`ve used exercise, weight training, eating healthy, not smoking, drinking or doing drugs and living my healthiest life to help me stay med free and it worked for a while but now working at this job (ive been here since last December) I`ve noticed I`m feeling terrible. And it sucks because I don`t hate my job and don`t want to lose it but my mental state absolutely disagrees with it and is making it almost impossible to cope. I`m rambling, not sure what I`m looking for here...maybe someone to relate, stories, advice, thoughts...anything.

987,"I was diagnosed as bipolar disorder 2 patient last year. Previously, he diagnosed me wrongly as I was a depression patient. During that time, I took medication for 2 months, then I felt that Im okay. I tried to change the dosage of the medicine, but we couldn’t find the perfect dosage after had a discussion with doctor. I still remember my last appointment with doctor, we agreed that the lowest dose of anti-depression drug need to divide into 8 parts. Can you imagine that? A small pill needs to be divided into 8 parts, can I directly make it in powder form??
Last time, when I find dr again because my hypomanic state caused me feel irritated, impatient. I honestly told him that I ald stop the anti-depression drug without consultation. He said luckily I stop the drug, as the misdiagnosis of mental illness can cause a lot of problem. For example, if I continuously take the medication, I will be very excited.
Dr encouraged me to take medicine to control my emotions. Well I refused to take the medicine.
This year 2019, I still fight for my emotion. I admitted that medication can help me to ease my pain, but I have a strong intuition that I can cope with myself. I believe I can find natural remedies to fight for my bipolar 2.
Im still alive with a lot of pain. I admit I cried when I think im a loser when counter with up and downs emotion. I admit that this bipolar disorder will ruin my relationship in workplace. I admit that there are multi disadvantages of not taking medication.
But, miracle happened. I know how to accept my emotion, I accept that sometime I will have both opposite states. I know if I don’t that medication I will feel pain. I tried to manage. I try to learn how to acknowledge the states. I know I can harness my hypomanic energy on creativity and improve productivity. I know when I depressed, I can cry, I can write diary, I can rest.

I know it’s dangerous if not taking drug.  There are many people around me always encourage me to take medication. But I wouldn’t accept these advices. Even I am a patient, I still have my own choice.
I have my own choice of not experiencing the side effects of medication. It is my life, I take all the responsibilities. So, stop introducing me medicine."

I was given this many years ago I agreed to it at first when heavily medicated but on the table the first time I tried to say I had changed my mind but was prevented from getting up and put to sleep and treated which I feel was against my will, I was sectioned at the time, I had more sessions I know but cannot remember them,when I was finally released I tried to go back to college to resume my course but a lot of what I had learned was gone and I just couldn't retain the complexity of information needed to carry on added to that because of the section I was on I had my driving license revoked, which was essential had I been able to finish college.

But I feel hate for myself.

I don’t have a therapist or a psych to go to. Kinda at a hard spot in life right now.

someone decided to go lie about me. Saying I wasn’t taking my medications, not seeing my doctors and having a hard time adjusting. The head of the medical team who doesn’t care for me and never met me. Email my doctor all this including we have to move the family. Oh we’re military.

My doctor calls me. He already knows I am medicated cause I’m my file I just recently refilled my meds. I even told him I can do bloodwork to prove it. I told him it was a lie. I’m fine. I didn’t need to see doctors so he wasn’t sure what was going on. So he had to put the head of the medical team back. And settle that person down.

while I panic because what the hell!! This head person believed a lie!!!! Anyways yea. I don’t trust people.

998,"Hi -

I was on multiple ssris and Wellbutrin at the same time.  We tried to simplify and increase one lower one and wooooosh - I got high. Instant manic reaction.  Fast forward to a mixed state and a hospitalization and I am withdrawing from some and I’m on 900mg lithium along with lexapro and Wellbutrin (90 days off Paxil and zoloft as well - yay polypharm!!).

anyone experience extreme chest tightness/pressure from the lithium?  I tried to lower from 900 to 780 with liquid and it got even worse and my body felt like it was on fire (while at the same time being freezing cold).  It’s like a squeezing deep into my sternum.  Thanks!"
999,"So, this last month after I finally got to visit my (ex)fiance in person in Russia, things were going great, but she became sadder and sadder about me going back. Then, she stopped talking for a couple of weeks, and since then had been easily irritated by everything. I became suspicious / paranoid a bit which made matters worse (I asked a lot of questions about things going on). We have had a lot of fights, some over nothing at all. I'm always very patient about it and apologize but she's been very angry lately. Well, today, I had to finally confront her that I knew she was keeping something from me. It was nothing important to me, truly, she was looking for other people to play with online. No big deal. I wasn't even going to take it up with her. But I had a serious convo in which I told her, that I would understand and not care if she spent time playing with native Russians. That it's no big deal to me, just let me know and hey it's totally fine I can understand it, we all have friends. She got mad, told me I was the only person she ever played with and got very defensive saying she wanted to end things.. so, I told her the fact I had seen her post on a community page looking for people to play with, and asked why she didn't just talk to me about it..

Her response was to tell me I'm a f***ing stalker, f you, get out of my life and to end all contact with me. Heh. I didn't set out originally to find her post, mind you. Though I had felt she was acting off, and last year about this time we split up for a month and she did something very similar. Posted looking for new people to play with, even met some in person. 

So now that I threw my entire engagement and everything I saved and worked for away by asking why she was being dishonest (which she says she's not a liar and she knows the ""effing truth"", even if I didn't call her a liar simply asked why she wasn't being entirely honest.).. I have to ask, does it seem like possibly a bipolar episode..? I hate to place blame solely on that. It's not fair. Though she is unmedicated, and it's not the first time she's hated me and left... I don't know if she will be back. And it's killing me. Because for better or worse I love her very deeply. I admitted that I shouldn't have gone online looking through post on a community page... But at the same time, why is me finding it such a horrific thing? Why didn't she just tell me upfront? Why hide it?


I told her that even if she hates me I still love her and will be here waiting, heh. Because I can do nothing else really. I can't just move on in an instant like that. From signing the paperwork to submit to get married to nothing but hatred in such a time frame, it's very hard. She told me last night she was very sorry and said / did things she doesn't mean / regrets when she's angry. So idk. I know she's furious right now. But she won't accept any responsibility in it. It's completely my fault, and me being who I am, I do blame myself. Had I kept my mouth shut, this would have been avoided. I just want some feedback I guess. Sorry, it's rambling. I'm exhausted, depressed and crying."
1000,"Yo yo sums up my mood of late, hope my yo yo string don't break."
1001,"Hi everyone, this is new to me but I've been having a really tough time with all of this. My soon to be ex wife I believe is undiagnosed bipolar 2. We have been married for 6 years but when I met her she was the girl of my dreams. We have 2 kids together 6 and 3. We have had our ups and downs but overall I'd say a fairly healthy relationship other than some post partum depression (or atleast so we thought after my 3yo). Over Christmas and January we had a really good time with lots of smiles. Things went down hill when my daughter had 2 weeks off from school and my wife always had a really tough time with this, she always gets so easily agitated with my kids. She then made a really weird comment about how it would be interesting to sleep with other ppl. I thought this was really weird and looked into her fb account. I found that she was sexting a guy we will call him J. I confronted her and she broke down saying she didnt want to do anything but the idea intrigued her. Over the next few days she expressed the desire but that it wasnt a 100 have to have. I had problems with this but tried to understand. She then got mad that I searched her fb and told me age was going to hang out with a different guy friend. I had a problem with this but she was mad and said she needed it. This guy ""N"" lives with J. So this kept going on for a few weeks and she kept saying that she loves me and isnt going to leave. I then caught her telling J he could come over and what ever happens happens... I confronted her again and she broke down again saying she loves me so much and I'm the best thing that has ever happened to her. And that she thinks something is wrong with her and that she doesnt understand why she has the desire to be sexual and dishonest and that she needs professional help. After this she started talking alot to N and it seemed like an emotional affair was building. I kept asking her to stop, but she wouldn't stop talking to him, as he is now her bf (known him for 6 months). I then got us into counsling. 2 days later she then cheats with N. He is 6 yrs younger, has anxiety and depression and only ever wanted a GF as he only had 1 in his life. He is fairly strange and also has a crappy job. She then told me she didnt know who she wanted... I then talked with her and she decided to pick N over me and her kids. She then said I made her choose. Now she is giving me custody of the kids and the house and only wants to see the kids 1. She now hates me at random times and is friendly at others, sleeps only 3 hrs a night (never looks tired) and is going out all the time. She says things that dont make since like I never see my kids and then says put the kids in daycare so i dont have to watch them so I can get a 40 hr job. She also flips on things she said and stated that those txt messages were mo the old. They were only 2 weeks old. She sometimes starts talking really fast but only late at night and says she is the happiest she has been in awhile and no longer depressed or having mood swings. It's been hell cuz I love her so much but cant believe she is making these choices. I now see a pattern in our life of low depression and hatred for herself and then ups where she would get energetic need little sleep, and want to go do things when she was naturally abit lazy.  I did finally convince her to see a psych cuz I'm really worried about her even if it doesnt help our relationship but atleast for my kids. Last thing to is it's all about her feelings. When my son balled his eyes out I miss my mom all she cared about was to tell me she was mad at me for not listening to her earlier. This has been the hardest time in my life..."
1002,"Hi folks, i've been wondering if this is a common occurrence and what does it mean?

Here's my experience:
During the last decade, i had a couple of undiagnosed and untreated depressive episodes, but managed to overcome them somehow by partly suffering and contemplating alone, partly by talking with my trusted mentor (clinical psychologist), among other things. But two years ago i was going through such an intense depression that i finally had to reach out and consult a psychiatrist. I was desperate, i was close to hitting rock bottom, persuasive self-harm thoughts and all, and couldn't do it on my own anymore. My doctor prescribed me an antidepressant (unfortunately can't remember the name, that entire period is a blur) without giving me an official diagnosis so that it wouldn't go down in my medical history. Three painful months later, my mood started improving, finally. Month later, i felt great. Praised the medicine. Month later, i started feeling as though i was on ecstasy the entire time and was so impressed with my progress even though i didn't sleep and eat at all and was talking, laughing and running around 24/7. 

My ecstatic brain managed to realize that there's something terribly wrong with this state, especially as the psychotic symptoms showed up, and being a psychologist, i recognized the mania. Upon witnessing my insanely elevated and explosive mood, my doctor asked me to *immediately* stop taking the antidepressants and put me on Depakine (Valproate). But it was too late and the drug couldn't catch up with the speed of my full blown mania, which went on for three months. Then i came crashing down again, totally exhausted and burned up, as well as deeply traumatized by my previous behavior, and had to take antidepressants again, although this time my doctor was very careful in his choice.

I wasn't officially diagnosed, again, but he said that if he had to give me a diagnosis, it would be bipolar I. I knew that much myself. But we didn't really go deeper into it and i couldn't accept that i was bipolar just like that. 

So i was wondering - was i bipolar all along and the antidepressants just triggered a psychosis that was waiting to happen anyway, or did the drugs, perhaps too strong for me then, completely threw me off balance and induced a one-time mania? I never had manic symptoms before and haven't experienced them ever since.

Am i bipolar or just had a mental breakdown that manifested as mania thanks to the antidepressant?

I am still wondering about it because i need to make sense out of what happened and know myself better, and don't really have someone to talk about it with.

Has anybody had a similar experience? Or a useful comment? 
What do you think?

Thanks in advance! :*"
1003,I used to be underweight before starting all my psych meds and I'm overweight now. I'm planning to request my psych to stop/taper my lithium. I want to know whether this is likely to cause rebound mania or depression.

1005,"Hello all,

About a year ago, I met a lovely gal online who, originally stated she was only looking for friends but quickly turned into more than that. She was very sweet and we have near identical humor / taste etc, and it just felt great. She was extremely upfront and honest about having bipolar, and that she was unmedicated. However I knew nothing about the disease and kinda just shrugged it off at the time.

We have a complicated relationship Right from the start, she lives in Russia and I the USA. We finally goT to meet in person last July after a bit of up and downs, some of it from bipolar no doubt and some because she had lied about some details of her life. She told me on her own the truth of these things, and stated she just was afraid I'd leave if I knew the truth / lose interest in trying to make things work.

We got engaged and are planning to marry here, if the k1 goes well. She's been handling everything she needs to do to make it happen, she's told me she has elevated sadness / anger from being apart especially after meeting in person, but she keeps pushing ahead. Seems completely sure and serious. She works and lives alone, takes care of herself (she has refused my financial help many times, and living in Russia she doesn't make much money)

So, everything overall seems great. I've never noted when she was manic, tbh, Though I may have just missed it. I've seen bad depression and how she is.

We've spoken about her bipolar, she definitely doesn't act like it doesn't exist, and talked about trying to get medicated because she doesn't want her disease to effect us negatively. I asked about how she is when manic. She stated it scares her, she can be very aggressive and possibly abusive. She doesn't spend money, or do hard drugs but may drink more during. She also stated she becomes hypersexual. I asked if she just takes time off work or how she copes, and she said no. She works even when manic, that she is able to maintain a semblance of control although she may get irritated by customers easily she still works.


Sorry, this has been longer than intended... I am just trying to paint a full picture. From everything I've seen, her disease is, mild, compared to what I read online. But reading online freaked me out. That I may be missing something about her.

 I asked about her hypersexual state, somewhat concerned that she may sleep around. I don't know if she would admit it to me or not. She stated that she often will masturbate many times during such a state, but that even if she has the urge to do more she tends to be able to control this (and, since she goes to work manic, that seems to hint she does maintain fair control?)


My questions are, are there people that really are fairly mild when it comes to their bipolar?  I admit to some struggles of late after reading stories about bipolar and cheating, reckless behavior, and the fact she has lied about some things in the past. She did however tell me on her own, and didn't really necessarily have to tell me everything (some of it she had to if we want to be together). I am just being overly suspicious of everything of late and I hate that I'm being that way. I guess I just want some reassurance that, just because she has bipolar and isn't currently medicated, doesn't mean she will / is doing the worst of the behavior possible or that I can't trust her  / Should be suspicious. I have been bad about it lately, and it's stressing me out. Every little detail I am analyzing and wondering if she's doing things behind my back since it is quite easy to do right now.  

I realize this is kinda, a mess. I am just looking for some input, some thoughts on the situation etc. I love her very much, and up till recently before reading about these things, I never really distrusted her much. She even told me about a date she went on when we had split up, despite not having to. Am I just making my self paranoid based off worst case scenarios or am I right to be worried?

If you read this far, thank you for your time and sorry, haha"
1006,I don't know if this is part of having bipolar. I have been feeling off all week and today the slighted sound is overwhelming me. I also have this feeling that people don't like me. I keep feeling that I say the wrong things. These feelings feel very familiar and I feel on edge and so uncomfortable.

1010,"I’ve been diagnosed BP since high school- over 16 years ago. I have a wife, 2 kids, and a fairly high stress management job. I function well, but I feel like when I hit a stress point I crack and my whole psyche seems like a spiraling storm cloud of just... sadness and emptiness and loneliness... with confusion as to what emotions and thoughts are based in reality. 

I usually avoid the dr until I self stabilize, otherwise I’m afraid altering meds will complicate things.  My wife is supportive but doesn’t understand and is in a way too close and invested to understand clearly.  

Is this cycle of stress and crash normal, and does anyone have some strategies to deal with this overwhelming hopelessness and loneliness and anxiety/sadness until I can at least normalize with the depression and continue functioning until an upswing?

1012,"Hi, 

I'm new to the forum. I was diagnosed with bipolar 9 years ago. For around 4 years I have been on aripriprazole /Abilify. 

My prescribed dose is 200mg monthly depot. I was given by a health professional 400mg.

Has this happened to anyone else?"
1013,"Hi, my bipolar has changed over the past year. I've had multitudes of manic episodes without devastating depression. So honestly it's taken me awhile to realize there's a problem and how it's affecting me. I like being manic. I had to leave work the other day. I couldn't function. I was hysterical and had the most humiliating conversation with my boss. I have had 2 days off and have to go in tomorrow. I'm really nervous and have to ask to adjust my schedule. I don't know how to handle it and am embarrassed about all the ways I've been acting at work over the months. How do you get over the humiliation!"
1014,"Well I'd say in the last 11 months I've had at least 5  (2 this month) intense manic episodes. I should have gotten into a psychiatrist in feb. And probably a dozen hypomanic episodes. This is all so different for me. I'm use to dealing with depression, that's where I always lay. In her bed crying all day. Except those sleepless nights I'd be on cloud 9 and loving life for a brief time. But for 2years I have not layed in bed crying and overwhelmed. I've honestly been enjoying my mania, well I guess just the thrill and euphoria. I have done terrible things, gave someone $3,000 (I'm a poor single mom!) Very hypersexual all the time, walked out on my job because I couldn't function, thought I was having a heart attack, over the top grandiose thoughts, inappropriate talk to my boss, co-workers,and customers, well everyone. I'm at the point now that I'm humiliated and sick of myself. I've been at my job for 6 yrs and I am so embarrassed. I have to go in and face them tomorrow. Yikes! Well my question is how do you regulate yourself. I am alone (I guess my kids are good at telling if I'm manic) I try and get sleep. I know that can send me flying. I just don't know how to deal with so much mania. I am getting in to see a psychiatrist. I haven't been this bipolar crazy for 10yrs. How do you guys deal with your bipolar changing?"

Every now and then i experience mood states I can’t identify.
It’s a highly anxious state where I feel depressed, but my mind and thoughts are overactive compared to my «normal» depressed mood. I get paranoid with borderline delusional catastrophizing thoughts. I get really restless and have trouble sitting still. I get a strange mix of selfesteem where I feel like shit, but still I’m the only one intelligent enough to understand what’s going on relating the catastrophizing thoughts. Everything gets overwhelming and if I by chance get these thoughts out of my head, something new will pop up in a flick of an instant.
When this passes, I end up in my «normal» depressed mood and feel totally exhausted and my mind is slowed down to a bare minimum.

I often go through a wired, optimistic and highly productive fase before it morphes into this state. And when the pure depression hits, it’s almost like a relief to be honest.

Is this purely an anxiety issue, or could this be BP related? Anyone care to share their thoughts?"

1017,"Have you heard of the study done on this? What is your experience with it? If any of you have been following my posts you would know i could have bipolar and i'm trying to gather as much info as possible to help my psych rule it out or diagnose me. My symptoms are very similar to bipolar and just now i saw a study done that says people with bipolar have high uric acid levels. Well, i often pass uric acid stones so i'm pretty sure i have high uric acid levels. Should i mention this to my psychiatrist?"
1018,"For those of you who are bipolar 2, what does hypomania feel like for you?"
1019,"Hello everyone, I’m new here.

I have bipolar disorder. I cannot keep a job and have been on sick leave for 3 months now. I suffer with very bad depressive episodes and even though I am on medication (sertreline 150mg per day), it isn’t a cure, it just takes the edge of. I have decided to apply for benefits as I cannot hold a job down at all.

Please can anyone advise me if I have to attend a work capability assessment for bipolar disorder? I get extremely anxious and sometimes I cannot get out of bed for days.  The thought of having to attend such a thing turns my stomach and makes my condition worse.

Thanks in advance for any help at all."
1020,"I’m recently struggling hard with my depressive episode. And ngl sometimes I think if I just stop thinking about how I’m not depressed I will stop being depressed. I’m just so confused about how to accept this and how to get out of this depressive state. And yes I have been diagnosed with bipolar and all that other basic psychiatric problems (anxiety, ptsd, depression). 

Would appreciate if someone can chat with me now and guide me through this"
1021,"Can anyone relate?

I'm on lamotrigine right now, and while it doesn't expressly make you gain weight, I've noticed my body start to become a little softer..

I had always been a runner, and was cut at about 140lbs at 5'9"". But recently after going back on my meds, I've found I've blown up to 156-160, and I just can't find the energy or motivation to keep running. I think something about the mood stabilizers takes away from the endorphins and ""runners high"" I used to experience. Now I just seem to get tired.

It's really disappointing as someone who always valued being healthy. I still eat a mostly vegan/vegetarian diet, and of course no matter what my mental health is more important than my abs lol. But it's a little depressing to not feel energized anymore. No amount of coffee seems to help

Anyone going through anything similar?"
1022,:unsure::(:sorry::cry: I’m just sad all the time
1023,"First off let me state that i am not diagnosed with bipolar but it is a possibility that i could have it. Working with a psychiatrist at the moment. I do have severe anxiety. Anyways my question is do you ever feel ""tired but wired""? It's like you feel really drained and depressed but at the same time your mind is racing and you have no patience for anything. Like normal things like watching tv gets frustrating for you and you get angry at yourself because you want to sit down and watch some tv or youtube or whatever but your so irritable that you can't but at the same time your too tired and depressed to do anything physical like going for a walk ...etc. This question might be a bit confusing lol i realize that but it's something that happens to me a lot and i typed ""tired but wired"" into google and bipolar was the first thing to come up."
1024,i just saw the video on cnn her child was killed by suicide for mental health needs  It makes me so mad because coach sad i cant help people that i could help . Instead i cant be a peer speciailist because of paper work .   PAPER WORK we are dying an we i cant help because of paper work.. THIS SYSTEM IS MESSED
1025,I just feel like hurting myself
1026,"Stuck in a rut. Depressed for a long time, and have increasing or at least steady anxiety about things that have happened to me in recent past and could potentially happen again in the future. 

No money for beer. No plans for the next month until I'm finally able to start school again and get a job. So been popping mood stabilizers like candy. Probly gonna run out too early, but not in the mood to plan ahead

I just can't do any of the prescribed things people say I should do. They say I should join volunteer groups or social activities. But because of kind of not-recent yet recent events, my anxiety is specifically about being seen in public or interacting with strangers. 

They say I should get counseling but I'm sick of it and it doesn't help me at all at the moment

Positive thinking isn't something I can just turn on, because even though I have a good supportive family, the issues I'm facing are external, and can't be solved by a change in attitude. Hard to explain and I'm not sure I can. But everything feels like too much to handle 

I want friends, but don't have them anymore. I miss my ex girlfriend but don't have her anymore. I hate being alone and it compounds all the negativity I already have

So what do i do now besides drink and pop mood stabilizers. No money for beer and pills will be gone soon. Sigh"
1027,
1028,It’s been over 4 weeks now since I’ve been on the Venlafaxine.  I’ve also just started Lithium.  If the Lithium doesn’t do anything then I have opted for more ECT.  My last course lasted about 3 weeks before I relapse d.  I’m now worried that I’ll relapse again.  Just wondered whether anyone else has been in this situation.  I feel like the living dead and really don’t want to go on anymore
1029,Has anyone been diagnosed this along side bipolar ? I recently have and just wondered if anyone else has
1030,"I have been struggling with my mental health for about 12 years now and I have never been to a psychiatrist. I have been to a self harm support group back when I was 12 as I was forced to go there via recommendation by my middle school. It was either the six week program or I was to be expelled. The funny thing is though I wasn’t even a self harmer and I had never self harmed myself back then. I had wrote in a notebook that I craved blood and that I wasn’t myself. I had an obsession with vampires and I use to actively search for how to become one. I was bullied back then and I was aggressive. I use to sit in my room with the lights off every day after school crying and one time I had this idea that I wanted bangs. I basically chopped my hair up and hid myself in a closet. Over the years, I moved on to murderous thoughts which lead to suicidal thoughts. I mostly have suicidal thoughts now that I’m not a teenager. What brings me on here is that I feel that I have Bipolar and I want help. I feel like I’m trapped inside my mind and all I want to do is scream. I have been seeing shadows, feeling like I’m being watched constantly, I tried to harm myself last Monday, I have went through three different sleep schedules in only a week and a half, and I feel like I’m going insane. I brought up my concerns to my grandmother, grandfather, and mother. My grandmother thought I was doing this as some kind of insult towards her. My grandfather called me ungrateful and said that I was doing it for attention. My mother said I was lying about how I was feeling on the diagnostic online assessments and when I told her I wasn’t she shrugged me off. I just want help. I feel trapped and that I’m falling down a black hole. I can’t take myself for treatment because I don’t have a car, my insurance cards, or even my social security card. My mother keeps them. I’m terrified and I feel betrayed by my own mind. I don’t have any friends because the only friend I had I stopped seeing. I stopped seeing her because I felt I wasn’t good enough for her like her other friends were and when she wanted to hangout I always canceled last minute so why should she continue to talk to me? I can’t talk to my father, even though he has Bipolar and could help me, but I refuse to talk to him. We are not close and he use to beat me when I was a child. I feel so alone. I just want help. I want to be diagnosed so I know I’m not crazy. So my family will stop dismissing me. I don’t know how to go about that though. I’m clueless as to the first step on getting treatment. I’m 20 almost 21 next month; if that matters. Thank you if you can help."
1031,“Mental Illness Shaming” is a term I came up with to describe what is happening in the U.S. right now with President Trump generating even more stigma for an already neglected and marginalized segment of society. It breaks my heart.
1032,"After I completely tapered off my escitalopram on Saturday (with my psych's permission, of course), I feel better than ever! My PTSD thoughts occur much less often, my overall mood is better and I'm less restless. I also sleep better now.

The only problem I have now is that I'm a few kg overweight and so, I requested my psych to start tapering my lithium. I'll be going from 1000 mg to 800 mg tonight and to 600 mg one month from now. Hopefully, that will get my weight to the normal range.

I feel good and fulfilled without any stress -- these are the moments one wishes to cherish in a lifetime. I plan to start taking an online Special Relativity course starting tomorrow."
1033,"Hi,

I'm new here. I used to be apart of a forum way back when and then I had a paranoia attack and deleted all social media. I thought I'd join again because when I was good, it was good. I liked having people to talk to.

Anyway.

When I first met my fiance, I was very open about my mental health issues and he told me some things that I felt like maybe he could understand me. However, that hasn't been the case. Despite what he went through, it was more situational. So to him, being depressed or manic or paranoid or anxious is just mind over matter. Eventually you'll come out of it and to help you along, you have to push through whatever your feeling. He treats mental health issues like overcoming a fear of heights. BLAH. I try explaining that that just isn't how it is for someone with bipolar, but he still doesn't understand. It's frustrating and sometimes we fight.

But it's especially hard when I'm cycling and I know I am because I can feel it. He expects me to talk about it, and I try to, but he also gets very insulted when I can't open up/ or can't explain something/ or when there's no underlining reason for anything I'm feeling / or talking doesn't fix it.

So, I'm just looking for advice. How to I talk about it?"
1034,"The meds make me happy and content but when I look at my life, I can only think I should be ashamed, full of regret and depressed. I don't deserve to be happy and content. I feel like I haven't earned it. The happiness and contentment I feel is fake. It's not authentic. But if I go off my meds I will become sick again. I have to stay on these pills. But I feel like they make me less human. But I guess I'd rather be less human than terribly sick. So I'll stay on my pills...for everyone else's sake."
1035,"I m going crazy with depression. I am not particularly low but I can't do a thing. I have no energy nor willpower to do anything. I am staring at my phone and same pages all over again. I don't eat so that also makes me weak. Even if I decided I want to do something, I can't make a decision. My kids keep suggesting things to do but I say No."
1036,"How do you find Valerian?  Has it helped you?

I can't take Zoplicone nor Zolpidem.

In the past, I was taking an over the counter Antihistamine, but I can no longer take this anymore - It makes me sleep walk!:scared: And I have some nasty bruises because of it."
1037,"Okay I might be in the minority here..

But oddly enough, I LOVE my hangovers (assuming I'm not too busy the next day)

Sounds kind of odd, and definitely unhealthy. Because when I drink, which isn't regularly anymore, I drink a lotttt. Ended up hitting the high abv beer late last night against my better judgement.

And woke up blissfully unable to think. I think since I'm someone who can't turn off my brain, and drive myself crazy by overthinking everything throughout my day and night. The way alcohol numbs and scrambles the brain gives me a great deal of rarely gotten peace. 

And remember, I'm talking specifically about the hangover here. Anyone else experience anything like this?!

It sounds absurd, unsustainable, and definitely unhealthy. But something about it works. I feel physically not great. But my mind gets turned off in a way that even meds cant quite accomplish."
1038,"Just from everyone's experience who takes it. I've been on 150-200 for a couple years for bipolar 2. But I started feeling like it wasn't working for awhile.. still depressed, prone to mood swings. So I stopped taking it.. bad bad idea, lost all control and had an emotional meltdown that affected everyone around me and got me put in hospital briefly.

So now that I started taking it again.. I decided to say fuck it, maybe I should try 300mg. And all of a sudden it's just.. working. I still feel like shit a lot because of life circumstances. But at least I don't feel like my moods are completely caused my my head at the moment. A little bit clearer. Relaxing a little easier. Still difficult but things are a little better

But from everything I've heard, I think 300mg might be a high dose, maybe too high. Don't want health problems or bad side effects.

I definitely will see a psychiatrist soon and discuss it, but in the meantime I was hoping to get some opinions from people who have taken it before"
1039,Wondering if anyone has this too
1040,Not been on in a while... feeling like everyone hates me and people I know are plotting against me I feel really strange and agitated
1041,"I'm going through lamotrigine (a mood stabiliser) withdrawal at the moment. I posted  a few days ago about my trials with inadvertently withdrawing whilst I was taking HRT (the HRT stopped the lamotrigine being absorbed). Now I've stopped the HRT altogether whilst I withdraw from the L in a controlled manner. I'm finding it really difficult though - I have so much brain fog at the moment I can't see straight. And I feel so tired and anxious.

1042,"Hi all. :-) 
I've been diagnosed as having Bipolar for the last 15 years or so. 
I have had an ongoing problem understanding thia in relation to how I see my past, present, and future. I often find myself thinking that the Bipolar diagnosis means that the trauma I suffered in the past is no longer valid in how it affected me since the diagnosis. I think it means that everything ive gone through is just a chemical inbalance in my brain. So then I find myself being very non compassionate towards myself and I can't look at my life clearly. It also makes me repress alot of my feelings towards the people who contributed towards my trauma. I dont want to blame them but I don't want to repress either. 
I know all this sounds very child like and distorted but I can't seem to shake off this perspective. 
Any advise and help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. :-)"
1043,"It all started back in 2015. Fall of 2015. I had a favorite YouTuber who posted great videos. But when I dug through her social media, she was complaining about lack of money, her mental status (agoraphobia), and being rude and hostile to others on Twitter. I was repulsed by her shit and pulled my ass back away from her. I eventually moved my ass away from her and found others. 

But some of them had other similar traits. Not as bad as the first YouTuber, but had some trouble spots here and there.

There were other YouTubers didn't complain, but lashed back at others. There was a netizen asked about another YouTuber's height, and this YouTuber retorted, ""Could you mean the size of your brain because I'm betting it's rather small. I won't be disrespected. Bye."". I didn't get it. It was nothing to be offended about. Even I get ruder messages on Reddit and knows better than lash back like that. Why the fuck she is being bitchy over nothing? She was nice to me on YouTube. We conversed about anime and computers. Why couldn't she ignore like a decent human being? That's being wise.

Well, others didn't lash back, but complained a hell lot. Especially about their financial problems and personal ones.

That's why there's someone who said that idolizing someone can bring disappointments. I wasn't idolizing them; I was just admiring them. I have nothing in Korea. I can travel from places to places, but cannot do any hobbies. I've been to anime conventions in Korea. It's boring. It's not good as the ones in the West. I know that Japan might not put anime as mainstream, but South Korea is nonexistent. This is why I like to watch other anime-loving YouTubers for inspiration I don't need YouTubers who are being jerks. But some knows too better to make a move."
1044,"So I was diagnosed with mixed bipolar is what she said. She didn't really explain that so not sure what this entails. She prescribed abilify, buspar, and wellbutrin. Anyone else have it? What do you go through? She basically asked me if i am more depressed or more aggitated and irritable i said it's provavly split 50/50."
1045,I've been depressed on and off for the last years of my life sometimes I know what triggers it sometimes I absolutely have no idea what so ever. I'VE been diagnosed bipolar after I exprienced some mild hypomania. I'm on 20mg of fluexotine and 10 mg of aripiprazole. I'm not as depressed as I use to be but I don't feel like my former happy self either. I've been doing  regular CBT therapy for a year it's helping but I still don't feel it's enough. I struggle to have confidence to find joy in things and to enjoy what I used to enjoy what I used to enjoy. Life is quite dull I gained more than 50 pounds in one year. Food is the only thing that brings me joy. I feel so angry towards myself and I absolutely hate how I'm feeling. I just want to get better.
1046,"I want to have fun like I used to, but as much as I try everything is fleeting

I am waiting forward to several things in the future, but I am just bored with the waiting

I like having a lot to do (at least when it goes fairly well, which most things do), and I try to keep myself busy, but sometimes there just isnt enough to do it

Part of that is because theres not much on TV, part of that is boredom of video games (nothing particularly exciting for now) part of that is just nothing else going on in general.

Everything is just boring I guess.

I know it's just one of my stages and will eventually not be an issue for a long time, it's just hard doing the waiting"
1047,"Hi All,

I have been off work 3 weeks in July and a week in Aug, which has triggered a sickness review from my workplace. 
They also got a medical report from my doctors who said ""In my view he would satisfy the criteria of a disabled per for the purpose of the equality act 2010 in that he has a mental impairment which has a substantial long term adverse effect on his ability to carryout his day to day actives""

My work would like to get me back to work full time (I want to also), but they want to put things in place to allow for this. But we are a crossroads as what to do with me, working shorter days would impact me financially so they don't want to do that. They have asked me to think about and then go back tomorrow for a further meeting. 

Have any of you had similar meetings? what agreement did you come to?"
1048,"Thank you for reading my message, I have to say each of you I know are battling a very real illness. 
I am so happy to have found a place where I have something in common. Bipolar does not have to be faced alone. 
I am sending my love to everyone who is in this boat. One of many challenges big and great. Something that cannot be minimised or judged through ordinary eyes. I have fought so hard to accept myself and try to love myself as I am. Society tells us to reach the top and fit in, but what if we were made to create our own beautiful place where we belong. Birds of a feather, stick together. I hope you realise how strong and brave you are. 

Here to support and listen

Cassy"
1049,"Normally I don't hear voices in lows. I get intrusive thoughts, I get delusional thinking, but never voices...but in a recent low that was particularly bad I think I actually heard voices briefly. They were just like the intrusive thoughts usually are when I'm depressive: accusing, criticizing, insulting...except I think I actually heard them this time. The others were just like faint whispers I couldn't make out.

Is it possible to suddenly start hearing voices and stuff in lows? I never did before, but suddenly did once? Questioning my own experiences. Maybe I was mistaken?"
1050,"I have a husband who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder two years ago. He has a strange sleep cycle where he goes to bed at about 5 or 6 in the morning, and sleeps for at least 6 hours. He was on Vyvanse for depression, but was taken off it due to his manic episodes. 

Lately, his bipolar-induced insomnia has been interfering with our lives, meaning I spend less time with him every day due to his sleep. I have talked to him about this in the past, but he says he's not exactly in control of the situation, and he is trying to get a hold of his doctor. He also saw a sleep doctor yesterday, so hopefully that would help.

So for those who are bipolar, or have a loved one who's bipolar, what has that been like?  And do you have any tips or advice on living with a bipolar relative and accepting them, because I am struggling a little to understand his diagnosis. I want to be able to support my husband and make our marriage last."
1051,"Idk yet, but after how this week was I am expecting that I am gonna be focus on the same things next week

And maybe even the week afterwards (in case you havent seen my latest topic let's just say in involved in an annoying PayPal dispute which might last up to 45 days after a customer buys something from you)

And if I do I think I'm only going to lead myself into the next week being ruined

But if I can stop with the overthinking then next week should be a lot more tolerable

My girlfriend is currently taking quentiapine 200mg once a day, she's having some issues in the mornings trying to wake herself up and is suggesting coming off of her meds, I've tried to get her to speak to the doctor but if she's feeling like this I'm always public enemy number one so we've had a bit of a fall out over it. I don't want her to come off them cold turkey as she's doing really well at the moment with work etc.

Do you guys have any experience with what she's saying? 

Thanks x"
1055,"I started taking Trintellix last month and went to the doctor again bc it is making my whole body feel like every cell inside me is buzzing. I can’t sit still. The only thing I can do to calm it is to walk or run on the treadmill. And then it stops for like a half hour. 
She prescribed me propranolol to help calm it down, but I haven’t tried it yet. It sucks bc this is the first med I feel clear headed on in a long time. The doctor said if the akathisia doesn’t subside in a couple of weeks we have to switch meds. I’m tired of not feeling “normal”. Whatever that might mean."
1056,"How do you get a bipolar to continue taking their medication when you are not physically with them? 

How do you reason with a bipolar? 

What language style do you use to communicate with a bipolar? 

This is regarding my daughter. Like the title says...its tough. She never lasts in any community beyond 5 months. That's around when people can't have her around anymore. 

When she is taking her medication, everything is beautiful. She functions normally and there is no chaos. But she keeps on stopping them whenever I am not there to make sure she is taking them. 

Talking to her and trying to reason with her is not working. She can't be reasoned with. I've googled until I can't Google anymore, tried different communication styles. It's in one ear, out the other. And this is a grown woman, not a child. I still have hope, but I'm losing it quickly.

1072,"So, I only work out when manic and hypomanic. I have gained alot of weight from picking up binge eating and also bipolar meds. I REALLY need to lose weight and also before I was bipolar I loved working out and was very thin. I would like to work out daily again, and push myself to lose weight. BUT everytime I feel this way it means I am manic because the second depression hits or I come down, BOOM no more working out all my progress is gone and I gain the lbs back its such a disappointment to me and everyone around me. I have tried alot, daily gym, home videos, walks, swiming, I love it all and them depression takes it away and I forget I was even working on my body its so weird and a few days roll by next thing I know I am manic again a month later and I havent worked out once.

WELL Im fucking manic again, BIG TIME. Im thinking of working out, like usual I need to and also lose weight. but I am sick and tired of being disappointed that I cant stick to it, and advice? All I can think of so far is raising my BP meds or just not doing it because this cycle is exhausting."

1075,"It seems I keep digging myself into a hole by opening my mouth and saying things that rub people the wrong way

 and then people assume things and as a result I have this reputation that I am a major jerk (i am putting it very mildly here, but you know what i mean) ; i am unfair, i only care about money

That i cant call myself a ""collector"" , instead i am an ""investor"" for wanting a small sample of cards to not be reprinted; never mind it's not like I am controlling the market, I dont have 100s or 1000s of copies of certain cards sitting around while I wait for the price to skyrocket

And the very same cards i want to not be reprinted (even if they lose value for other reasons) are NOT for sale anyways

And how can i be ""for profit"" if i never make a profit anyways?

If you spend $2000 on a hobby and make $1000 in sales, that is not a profit last i checked

I never knew that wanting collectibles to have value was such a ""taboo"" view ; never mind we are talking a very small sample size out of 1000s of cards printed for that card game

They completely invalidate the reasons why i collect the cards 

I dont care if they agree, i just dont see why people have to be so easy to assume things and decide ""you know what, based off of an assumption i will NEVER buy from that guy""

Selling and trading is kinda important, but I guess all I can do is move on, accept my losses and that some people are ""Haters"" who probably want me to fail by the very virtue that they dont want ANYBODY besides them to succeed"

1083,"I am currently struggling with a situation involving my partner of 4 years.

I was told from the beginning that he has schizophrenia, which I accepted and was something I had experience in due to a past job, so wasn’t something that worried me too much.

Three weeks ago he suddenly stopped taking his meds and was acting very strangely - was getting angry at people and then deciding suddenly he was going to quit his job and start studying. He shouted at his mum because she turned the kitchen light on, he never gets angry so it’s strange for him to get angry anyway let alone over something so small.

The next day when I realised he was acting strange, I took him to the doctors who suggested he increased his meds. Not only did he refuse to do this, he also refused to take them at all - this he has never ever done. I spent the next 10 hours begging/pleading him to take them. Nothing worked and then he suddenly decided to break up with me and seemed overly happy about it, almost laughing at me. He then went off and wandered around town talking to homeless people and laughing to himself. I was in contact with his friend who I knew was going to meet him and they later called an ambulance. I went to hospital and he was in full blown psychosis, he was signing, laughing, running away, screaming...all sorts. It was scary.

He was sectioned and remained in hospital for one week. He broke up with me on numerous occasions during that time, all for different reasons (he doesn’t want what I want, I deserve better, I’m not clever enough for him, he’s in love with Sophie which is a girl he had a failed one night stand with 10 years ago and also became a voice, and now he’s blaming me for becoming unwell as well as making out he’s too good for me and feels amazing without me)

He was discharged from hospital and refused to come home. He has gone to stay with a friend and he is being very cold towards me and very grandiose. He doesn’t want his job, his relationship, his home... nothing of his previous life.

He is usually so loving towards me, and he was recently telling people he was saving up for an engagement ring. We had also been looking in to buying our first home together. It’s gone from this to him showing no love or care towards me at all and almost becoming the opposite to the man I know.

I have been looking up loads about bipolar and I’m wondering if this is a manic episode? He’s on antipsychotics but no mood stabilisers. I feel like I’m in limbo, not knowing whether to move on or wait, or how long to wait. It’s now been nearly 3 weeks since this began and I’m tired, shocked, heartbroken and at a loss for what to do... help!!?!"
1084,"I know everyone is different. I am curious what your depression feels like. 
For me ... I feel sick. It washes over me very quickly like I’ve hit a wall. It’s like am getting the flu and have a fever (which I don’t). My body aches and I am so exhausted. It’s physically hard to move. My head is a fog and feels like it is being squeezed. Emotionally I am just drained. I’m not sad ... not really ... just here. I force myself to work and force myself to smile ... and very briefly I feel like my smile is real and I try to hold onto it. But it doesn’t last. 
I nap when I get home, I’m in bed early and hit my alarm 100 times each morning. Yet I am still so tired. 
It is how I am feeling right now. I hate it."

1086,"The past couple nights when trying to sleep, I couldn't stop moving. Last night was on a whole different level. I kept kicking my legs in bed repeatedly and jerking my whole body trying to relieve this feeling so deep inside of me. It was like I just wanted to crawl out of my skin. I wanted to just die. I seriously considered driving myself to the hospital. My fiance tried to rub my back because that usually puts me to sleep. But I couldn't even stand him touching my skin at all. I ended up just bawling about it for awhile. If there was ever a more right time to kill myself, it was last night. I didn't know what it was until I looked it up this morning. And I don't think I can handle another night of it..."
1087,My therapist has me mood tracking and marking myself on a bipolar point system from -5 to +5. I find that my moods jump frequently.

1088,"I was diagnosed BP in 1994...I managed after a bad period of psychosis to get my life back together!
In 2003 I went psychotic again and smashed up my rented house was sectioned and became homeless. I then started to smoke heavily..my mindset was its a way to die. I now find 7 years on that my smoking is out of control. I am still not happy and my life is not what I want but I realise I am no longer in control of my smoking!
I just wondered if others smoke heavily or if anyone was able to give up? I have been in a depression for 7 years.

1089,"Am I the only one that absolutely hates Hypocrisy above all else?

One of my hobbies is collecting cards; I understand that in TCGs (Trading Card Games) Players are the companies main focus (the company licensing/making the cards) but there are these players that absolutely hate collectors

I hate some of the players for complaining about the cards they cant afford, but being unwilling to actually put forward the work to be able to get them

I pointed out how to me this makes no sense; somebody says ""oh I want ""Blank Card"" but it's too expensive I cant afford it""

At that point you think if people cant afford it; they should either work towards getting it, or accept it is outside of their budget and move on

Instead they keep complaining and hoping for a reprint

This bothers me because #1 they claim they want something SOOOOO BADLY, but when it comes to doing something about it, they complain and wait and hope for a reprint (which shouldnt happen because those cards arent supposed to be easy to get or cheap, otherwise why make them that rare in the 1st place?)

2. Why cant they accept reality as it is; if they are unwilling to do anything to actually move towards their goals, they simply wont have the things they claim to want

If I want anything it doesn't do any good to ask for it, it doesn't do any good to complain

The only way I get the nice things I want is through hard work, nobody buys anything (of significant value) for me, I dont get handouts, so why should people expect me to give handouts?

Why should I work 60-70 hour weeks, buy something, and then somebody too lazy to actually work to get it can just wait and complain and a reprint happens and they spend 10% of what it used to cost?

That makes no sense at all, that isn't doing anybody any real favors (people think it does, but it doesn't teach any valuable lessons, all it does is reward cheapness and laziness)

It is essentially giving a handout to cheap or lazy players, while spitting in the face of collectors that probably spend 5-20 times what the average players spend, and then turns around and sells all of their cheaper unnecessary things, which floods the market and gives players access to cheaper cards that form the backbone of their decks

I also have a very Hypocritical Grandma that acts like she is such a good Christian; but she is racist, homophobic, and charges me as much or more than Uber or Lyft to take me anywhere

One of these days I am gonna stop biting my tongue and tell everyone what I think of them, I might end up getting yelled at by somebody over it; but I feel like people need to be called out on their BS otherwise they act like they are so great and know everything, and somebody needs to give them a reality check"

I have Cyclothymia, it's getting really hard to deal with, but I'm holding on.

I recently got a Lithium concentration blood test, and it says it's >0.1 mmol/l, while the normal therapeutic range is 0.6-1.2 mmol/l

I haven't said anything to my psychiatrist yet, but has anyone had their Lithium levels as low as this? I've been feeling suicidal more often than usual and maybe this is why?

It's just so weird that my Lithium level is so so low, I can't find anything about this on the internet, so I thought I'd turn here.

1097,"Am I the only one that can sometimes be mean when Manic?

I do not try to be mean and I am not going to be mean to people that haven't done anything against me

But then I can just lose my patience for ANYBODY that is giving me problems and I just get to the point that I can be outwardly mean and maybe people that dont really know me see this and assume I am a bad guy by default

But what else am I supposed to do about people that are giving me a crapload of problems I dont need?

My normal attitude of being nice by default can only last so long; and then you have people that would abuse someone's kindness no matter what

You cant always be nice, you cant always be mean, and I have realized some people are going to be the same kind of person people think I am by default, a Jerk that gives nobody anything except for problems

I realize I am a good person, and I intend well, but it's hard to not just regulate myself, but also the things I am prone to do or say when I am in the ""Fed Up"" kind of attitude and just done with giving a crap, and especially the problems people present to me

And on top of that; all the haters that do everything they can to (try to) make sure other people cant succeed

It seems my range goes from trying to win over as many people as I can (kinda important when you have a hobby that involves a lot of selling and trading in hobby groups on FaceBook) and hating myself when any setbacks occur

To being at a point where I am overconfident (a lot of times you have to be flexible when selling things that many other people also sell), mean to people that instigate problems (which probably makes me look bad to those that arent) and just dont give a damn about anything anymore."

In a nutshell, I am bp2 with bpd (sounds like a line from a Bell Biv Devo song) and I have been off meds since I found out I was pregnant.  My daughter is now almost two, and I am iffy about whether meds are in my future again.  I hated taking them, so I really don't want to, but I find the suffering...well,  insufferable.  The pregnancy hormones regulated everything and I felt fantastic almost the entire time.  I didn't know that was a thing!  The docs want to try to snuff me out with pills again, but I just don't want to put them in my body.  I binge drink a couple of times a week to help cope and I am currently very active in looking to STOP that garbage, and with going to medication, I feel like I'd abuse them or start jonesing for more more more.  All in all, I do not want to do either.

1100,"So apparently there is this cruel rule in the universe

Every place you work at has to have that one guy you just cant deal with

Well the place I work at has that guy too; but he is a supervisor and he apparently has nothing better to do than to bother me almost the exact second that a production line goes down 

I work at a factory and on a typical day we have 3-5 lines running at the same time and I am responsible for the 1st half of the production line for sometimes 4 or 5 lines at once (though usually I have somebody to split that kind of work load with)

It is very busy work with a lot of steps to it that include physical labor as well as paperwork and to check production for defaults (critical fails require extra work before we can start production again)

we have machines that help with that, but there are sometimes a lot of false alarms so I have to check many things that actually pass quality checks with flying colors

Needless to say, it is exhausting and I normally go about my day, do my job, and help out coworkers and do extra tasks when time allows (if it slows down and I see a coworker struggling or I am given specific things to do when work slows down)

Well occasionally work is continually slow and most of my coworkers and supervisors realize you cant be completely busy every minute you are on the shift, slow times come along and you can run out of things to do

Well this supervisor will do little else besides wait for me to run out of something to do

Just to say ""do you need something to do""

It doesn't even take long, as soon as there is nothing to do he is around bothering me

I do so much more than my actual job, I am hired to do production work

But I also clean, empty scrap, keep lines running almost every single minute (most of the time lines go down for simple things, and I figured out what most of those are, so if it isnt a machine that needs to be fixed or maintained I can usually do it), help every coworker with anything within my abilities; I have had to spend hours just cleaning Machinery before 

It's boring and annoying, but hey I do it and dont complain about it, and once the machines are back up production keeps going steady, and the company makes however much money from the labor while I make an above average wage and stay busy with very little time to relax, catch my breath, or just slow down

I never complain, I do every task I am asked to do, I work a ton of overtime whenever I am asked to

I dont even think about how inconvenienced a request from the company makes me

 I will agree to it, work, and worry about the details later, I never even worry about how late I may have to wait for a ride

I have even walked outside in really bad cold weather before (fast moving wind and negative windchills), 2 miles down the road after an extra long shift; just hoping to get a ride to save myself from waiting 4 hours longer until the next shift gets out

Is it so much to ask to be treated like a human being and not harassed the moment work stops?

I work for a company, and yet this supervisor acts like I am there to serve or entertain him and I can not stand being treated like I am less than Human any longer

I dont like to get mad, but his BS is making me stressed out and so angry I can see myself losing control if he acts out and gets in my face.

I already have a lot of problems on my own

I do not need this guy to add to my stress and push me over the edge, because if it happens it is not going to be good for anybody

He acts like a God, but if I Bipolar Rage out, it is it going to be like meeting the Incredible Hulk"

See last year i was in hospital. During my stay there, my psychologist told me to befriend this guy because hes well a good guy. Some being the naive sucker for befriending people went ahead and spoke to him. BIG MISTAKE. 

One night after taking medication, i went to the toilet and he followed me into the ladies loo where he pushed me into the cubicle and started kissing me forcefully. Then he proceeded to touch me down there and pulled out his junk. I hated it but due to the meds i just took i was kind of drugged. So i have no idea how i got out of there. I probably pushed and ran.

Now i blocked it out, but as you peeps know ,things have a way of haunting us when we try to suppress them. I feel dirty and cheap especially because he told me ""thanks i really needed that"" the next day and acted like what he did was right. Im confused because im not sure if i caused it for myself. I do know i get abit promiscuous when im manic during a bipolar episode. so im really confused right now if i was assaulted or if it was my fault.i have no idea what to do. I feel so dirty and really angry with myself.

1109,"Hi all,

I'm fortunate to now finally be in a position where I am mentally stable - medication seems to be working, and I'm generally emotionally-balanced with what I presume to be normal, everyday ups and downs.

However, I have this feeling/sense of disconnection that persists regardless of whether or not I am stable. I deeply desire to connect with people, to have that sense of togetherness, but it just seems to elude me. I was tested a few years ago for an Autistic Spectrum Disorder, but was only just above the threshold for diagnosis. I don't seem to have a problem with picking up social cues, rather, I seem to be overly sensitive to and misinterpret them in such a way that causes me to feel substandard and inferior. I also have persistent periods of really low-self esteem, which are amplified during depression, and diminished during hypomania/mania.

I do experience anxiety and a certain level of paranoia, but it's not always consistent.

This feeling of disconnection is pretty much consistent across all of my relationships, including friends, and has been since I was very young. I always felt like I was 'treading on eggshells' in order to keep the other person happy. It does sound a bit dramatic in writing, but I really have no idea where this issue might stem from, i.e., part of bipolar or something else, or where I might go to address it."

I'm currently taking OTC lithium supplement and it helps some. regular sleep, exercise, and meals (especially healthy meals based on veggies) help, too.

I want to figure out if there a cycling in my baseline levels of mood/irritability/energy. in the last couple of days, i rate them on a scale from -10 to +10 just based on my guesstimate.

1114,"So i was diagnosed at 15 (im 40 now)- ""Bipolar Manic Depressive"" right? And ive been on and off meds since then. Zoloft at first, which as far as i remember worked well, then after i maxed out as far as dosage and i felt that it wasn't helping anymore, i was next put on paxil. 40 mgs of paxil a day with 1 mg of xanax in the morning and ( if i wanted to sleep without waking every 2 hours) id take another mg of xanax before bed. That combo i was on for around 6 years in a row and i felt like it helped alot. Then one day my doctor decided she was going to cut me off of the xanax because "" that clinic was no longer going to be prescribing xanax to ANY patients"" was her reasoning. Thats when i learned that i couldn't take the 40mgs of paxil alone- when i did it would throw me into a panic attack. So since i needed the xanax WITH the paxil, and i could no longer get the xanax- i stopped taking the paxil altogether. Its been about 2 years now- ive been self-medicating, as i call it, but thats a whole other post lol. ANYWAY- i was reading some info on bipolar online and i came across an article that said that bipolar episodes (like manic or depressive) last for MONTHS and that a bipolar person will only have like 3 different ""moods"" in a year....? Even the definition of ""rapid cycling bipolar"" was like 10 in a year. Ok so THATS NOT what happens to me AT ALL. I literally go through like 8 mood swings in one DAY when im not on my meds and im not self-medicating (100% sober). Its BAD. So my question is- am i even diagnosed right??"

I don’t want to talk to family and friends because I don’t  want to worry them and plus I don’t think anything they would say that would help my situation....

I can’t stop thinking 100 miles a hour like will I ever be able to have children will I ever be stable enough, can I progress in my career and handle pressure 

Will I ever feel ok ? Sorry for the low mood post just needed to put my feelings down and feel like I’m talking to people that maybe know how I feel .... hope your all having a good day 😊"
1123,"Sorry it's kind of long. I have an appointment tomorrow for my second therapy session. He says I have symptoms of bipolar but not quite sure yet. I erote everything down for him because i forget to tell him things. No family history of mental illness except great grandmother was paranoid schizophrenic.  Here's what I wrote.  Does anyone else get these symptoms? Or do these things? 
 Sleep 3-4  and be energized. Irritable and will make huge scene at very small problems, easily distracted won't finish things I start like even doing dishes. Thoughts race constantly, embarassing and unsafe sexual encounters, go through phases wherr I leave long term relationship even though I don't want to. Always go back when it's over. I will think I'm better than everyone else. Have thought i was an important member of an outlaw gang, but in my head, use drugs and drank everyday, i make up conversations in my head apparently and get very angry when someone tells me that we've never had a certain conversation, get big ideas that I'm goingto go to school to be multiple things. Put me 30,000 in debt doing that. Will clean constantly and keep cleaning same object until perfect.  Extreme love for lifr where you can just feel your heart swell with happiness."
1124,"Hi all
I'm new in this forum 
I have suffered anxiety /depression /OCD almost as long as I can remember .My doctor is useless how would I know if I was bipolar or not ? 
Just lately I'm experiencing feelings that I have never felt before .
I hate myself ...I think everyone is talking about me I have cut my self off from famiy /friends as I feel they are criticising me I am angry all the time and could literally smash things to pieces.I have taken Prozac ,Citalopram and now on Mirtazapine I feel like my head is going to explode I cry for nothing I hate every thing and every one I am just a fat ugly horrible person"
1125,"Hi all, new to all of this but i thought i would share my story in the hope that anybody could offer any kind of advice or relate.

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to send this during mental health awareness week because I was in rehab. Despite this, I didn’t miss out because for me and many others, mental health awareness week is every week and one out of 52 doesn’t quite cut the extremity of this crisis. I understand that my story may be shocking and upsetting to some but I refuse to spend even one more minute being silenced and shamed for a problem that we as a society simply do not know how to address.

I have been struggling with a very public and humiliating battle against addiction for the past 10 years and naturally, as the years went on, so did the transition from being a functioning to non-functioning alcoholic. My functioning days saw times of university degrees, great relationships and hope. My non-functioning days saw periods of hospitalisation due to suicide attempts, shockingly high-risk behaviour in all areas, and complete and utter self-destruction. The majority of my using at this time was done alone because my behaviour was too dysfunctional for company. For perspective, an example of my substance intake for the past 6 months would be 30 units of alcohol and a gram of cocaine (£600 a week) a day on top of the antipsychotics and antidepressants I take daily for bipolar (type 1). I became physically and mentally addicted to all of these drugs.

The day that saved my life came along when I woke up recently after a couple of months of sleeping on a friends sofa bed and realised I had lost everything. This included my friends, family, job, savings, health, sanity etc. For me, this was rock bottom. The moment I realised it was all over.

During one of my hospitalisations, a doctor essentially told me my organs were about to start shutting if something didn’t change drastically. This was 2 years before I stopped drinking. Nothing would stop the burning hunger that my brain constantly craved for alcohol. Not even death was enough to scare me into stopping. As I left he handed me a leaflet for a local rehabilitation centre. It was 2 years later, after hitting rock bottom, that this leaflet resurfaced when I finally excepted the opportunity to begin the journey of recovery.

For the past few years, addiction has not only ruined my life but it has ruined the lives of those who love and care about me. Fortunately, I have been able to rebuild relationships and pay off debts however this illness has caused some more permanent damage that is beyond repair. An example of this includes the grim reality that alcohol has potentially corroded the lining of my bladder. It has also potentially caused me minor brain damage located in the part of my brain which controls memory (due to excessive drinking without eating) but despite this, given the state of my condition, I am just happy to have gotten out alive. It is still INCREDIBLY early days for me but for the first time in my life I can confidently say that I will never touch a drink again. Everyday is a struggle and I am by NO means under any kind of illusion that my journey will be easy. I have had to accept that I will spend of the rest of my life in recovery.

I have decided to share my story /journey because (in my opinion) addiction has a ridiculous stigma attached to it and people must start realising that it DOES NOT fit a certain stereotype and has NO face. I feel incredibly lucky to be living in a time where I can confidently discuss my anxiety, depression or even my bipolar but I am still so ashamed to talk about addiction because I know first hand that it makes people VERY uncomfortable. This only encourages us to suffer in silence, become secretive and often dishonest. We are ALL suffering and battling with our minds so why is this still different.

 This is not a life anybody would choose for themselves, trust me. I’ve made some unspeakably awful choices in my life but I did not choose to be an addict. People are not (generally) addicts because they got carried away with the session, people are addicts because something has gone horribly wrong in their lives or minds, enabling an overwhelming feeling of self-hatred and worthlessness. Addiction is a slow and painful suicide."
1126,"So, I’ve been bipolar majority of my life. Just wasn’t fully diagnosed until about three years ago. Every single romantic relationship that I have  during May time I start to have serious doubts about the relationship. Yes, there usually are stressor before these intrusive thoughts start. I’ve been with my husband 10 years, married 8. I have had doubts on and off throughout our relationship. But the thoughts never stick. I’ve been really stupid with my medications lately. But I started out taking 40mg Prozac full time without a mood stabilizer and/or antipsychotic. I started to have constant thoughts about not loving my husband, maybe I’m just scared to be alone, maybe I want to be alone, he doesn’t deserve this. But I know when I’m not obsessing that I’m crazy about him! He really is the love of my life. He is the only person I would fight this hard for against these thoughts. He’s really supportive as well. I tell him I don’t know why he deals with it. He tells me it’s not me. It’s just something I’m going through. It’s like every time I start to have doubts, complications, or anything in any other part of my life my brain automatically turns it towards my romantic relationship. Does anyone have any experience with this? Or has ever heard of this?"
1127,"Hi Everyone,

I'm on lamotrigine for bipolar, currently at 150mg. I'm curious for others with bipolar what dose you take?

I'm still dealing with bouts of bad depression, though it's much, much better than a year ago when I was first diagnosed and not on medication. Part of me wants to up my medication, but when I last increased from 100mg to 150mg I didn't really notice any change in number of depressed days, but I did experience some additional side effects (fatigue, blurred vision making it difficult to drive, extreme sensitivity to even one occasional glass of wine).

It's so hard for me to figure out how many depressed days is ""normal."" If I can't get out of bed once a week, I feel like that means I haven't yet found the right medication balance. But since I'm very sensitive to medication, I'm also hesitant to risk more side effects.

Thanks for the input. I do have a therapist and psychiatrist and I am consulting with them as well."
1128,"Hi, I’ve really been struggling these past few weeks I’m trying everything to stay positive but I’m feeling my self go down this hole again thinking about suicide I had an episode about 1 month ago and was very depressed everyone thinks I’m fine now but I’m not I’m just really struggling 😭 ...."
1129,"Does any one else experience anxiety around their partner? Sometimes when he’s away I feel fine. I don’t have anxiety. I still have these thoughts about if I love him or not. I still have compulsions. But I sometimes want him to go away so I can not have the anxiety and obsessions I have around him. I want to be alone. I don’t always have intense anxiety around him after exposing myself to him for awhile. But I find comfort being completely and utterly alone. It makes me think I don’t really love him. Which is distressing. Sometimes when I’m alone I just cry hysterically and feel ashamed and wish all of this would ago away. Other times though, I feel nothing. I’ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder for about three years now. But was told I sounded like I had OCD tendencies? I’ve been relatively stable on medication until the end of 2018. I came off of abilify because of weight gain. I thought taking my Prozac would be fine. It causes mania but I’m not reckless while manic I guess. Idk it sounds stupid saying it out loud. I started to take my Prozac maybe every three to five days. Idk it was just when I happen to think about it. 40mg. But I started taking 40mg full time again. But the third day I had severe intrusive thoughts. Panic inducing thoughts. Has anyone else experienced this? I have high anxiety around these obsessive thoughts and sometimes I just cry hysterically when I’m not obsessing. Other times I feel nothing and my mind is completely blank."

1133,"So for one of my hobbies I buy, collect, and sometimes sell, or trade, trading cards (not one of the 3 biggest Trading card games)

Of course when I choose to interact directly with people instead of buying everything from a company as Sealed Product; then I have to talk with them

Sometimes; I guess due to not being 100% stable (meaning in the middle and neither Depressed or Manic) i will say or do wrong things that make people hate me; even to the point that some people apparently refuse to deal with me.

Of course you try to not care and move on; you cant please everybody after all.

But then you also think who is going to follow them?

What if because of 1 person you also alienate another 11? After all 1 person can tell others not to do business with you, and then they can tell their friends, so it multiplies.

Anyone know how to manage this? perhaps there is an additional med I could ask my doctor about to help with this?

I told my doctor about it last time - and she said it's because I take the Ritalin --- I told her that I hardly take the ritalin , and she stood firmly on her point... It doesn't make sense to me if the damn Ritalin is out of my system, why the hell are my hands still shaking.

1137,"Is this a thought disorder/personality disorder? Feeling Detached from my thoughts, hyper-aware and out of control.

I can't stop questioning every thought that pops into my head. It's automatic and just a state of being at this point, it just happens without my choice. It's almost like I'm stuck judging and inspecting every thought almost as if I'm not human. I just want to think without judgement. It's not even normal introspection, it feels so foreign. And then when I decide that I won't let this conquer me and I will handle it and beat it, I have intrusive thoughts immediately popping into my head about how I can't. I don't understand what the hell causes this detachment from my thoughts, almost as if they aren't mine.. I wish I knew how to fix this, or atleast have a reason WHY, or understand what is causing it. It isn't normal intrusive thoughts, it's turning into a legitimate intrusive thought PROCESS, almost as if it's another personality inside me. I can't find anything that explains this or find anything about anyone else struggling with this issue. I wish I could identify it.

It just doesn't feel like the normal anxiety issues I have struggled with all my life. I've always had bouts of negative thoughts and self-doubt, they were always mine. Now I feel completely disconnected from them as if they are coming from a different region of my brain that I have no control over.

I don't want to learn to cope with this issue, I want it completely gone. I don't understand why I can't just find that balance and peace in myself and think like a normal human being or have normal anxiety issues that don't involve some sort of crazy cognitive delusions.

My mother has Bipolar I and my grandmother is Bipolar II. I don't know much about the complexities of bipolar other than the mania and depression that I have witnessed. I don't have mania. I mainly just feel like my mind is always racing and I can't slow it down to properly relax and think things through. I'm very impulsive in both actions and thought, and I don't feel like I have too much control.. I tend to just ACT. But I don't feel any type of euphoria or anything, which leads me to believe that it might be Bipolar II, but I'm not sure.

It started on Citalopram is when it got really bad. I started feeling very disconnected from my thoughts.. And one night I was having a panic attack and so I tried repeating to myself that ""It's okay, you've got this.. It's just anxiety, you've got this.."" And then I heard a voice say.. ""No you don't."" That's all it said. I tried to fight with it by saying ""Yes you do, you've got this."" And it repeated ""No you don't."" I could tell that the voice WAS me, like I wasn't actually hearing voices outside of my head.. But it terrified me that I had thoughts popping out that didn't feel like they were actually controlled by me. I couldn't understand why I couldn't make decisions and these random thoughts kept popping into my head that were the opposite of what I wanted or how I felt. It leaves me feeling powerless and continues to this day.
I mean, it's MY voice.. It's definitely my own thoughts, but they feel detached, like they aren't being consciously thought by me.. They feel more like they are just popping into my head. Very much like intrusive thoughts.

I don't have any delusion that I'm hearing somebody else and they are talking to me. I don't have full conversations or anything, they seem to just be repeating intrusive thoughts.. And other than that, I just feel completely disconnected from my thoughts. Like I think ABOUT thinking, it all feels very strange and it's difficult to explain.
I've always been concerned about Bipolar, but my doctors always said that I didn't exhibit any signs or symptoms and they simply didn't see it in me. But things have changed, because I haven't always had these issues. This is very new, within the last year.

It also feels like I have to ""sub-vocalize"" every thought sometimes, almost as if I am reading them. I can feel my tongue and vocal cords moving as though my body wants to say them aloud. And I catch my mind automatically repeating things that I've heard on TV or things that other people have said, sometimes even my own thoughts. It doesn't feel a compulsion, it just happens automatically.

My Psychiatrist tried me on both Citalopram and Sertraline. Had a bad reaction to the Citalopram and couldn't continue taking it. Unfortunately Zoloft wasn't doing anything helpful. It just made me feel very foggy and killed my memory.. Seemed like it agitated my anxiety and caused low mood/suicidal thoughts with each dose increase/decrease. I could feel myself become agitated about an hour or two after taking it, much like I did on Citalopram. Which is another thing I have worried about, because I have read that people who are Bipolar get manic and such when they take SSRI's, but I've always been on plenty of meds that DIDN'T cause that and I've read about people saying that SSRI's agitated their condition without being bipolar, so I have no idea.

Now they want to try me on Paxil, but I haven't tried it yet. Not looking forward to adjusting just to see if it works at all. Feels like shooting in the dark.
I apologize for the long-winded post, I'm just hoping that it will reach somebody that will maybe be able to relate or think ""Oh man, that's EXACTLY what I have, I know exactly what this guy is talking about!"" Someone with experience and can maybe give me a general direction as to what disorder or illness this might be so I can talk to a professional about it.

So far my only diagnosis throughout my life has been Generalized Anxiety Disorder, OCD Tendencies, and possible Major Depressive Disorder. Doctors thought that I was potentially Bipolar as a child, but could not diagnose me."

1139,"Hi all. I had a hysterectomy last December, which was a terrible experience with a doctor who ditched me to go on vacation and his backup doc was unavailable and I’d been newly on Buspirone for like a month prior. After the surgery, I did not sleep more than an hour a night for three weeks because of pain and the constant urge to go to the bathroom, which no one told me about. This I guess threw me into a manic episode and I couldn’t turn off my brain. I wrote a novel but wrote another one at the same time. It was so crazy. I had all sorts of strange thoughts and experiences I won’t go into but now I’ve been diagnosed as bipolar. One psych in the hospital, where I checked myself in, said so and put me on lithium, but I gained a ton of weight in a month, very upsetting for someone who lost a hundred lbs on her own. Another psych now switched me to latuda. And topomax. Can’t taste anything and I’ve been suicidally depressed and ready to leave my husband and quit my job. I feel hopeless for getting proper help. I’ve been depressed my whole life, chronic depression and GAD the typical diagnoses, but I’m not sure I’m bipolar or that it matters. I just need help and am losing faith that any doc or shrink or drug will cut it. I have been much worse since surgery. Hormone check shows they’re not to blame. Please help!"
1140,"Hi everyone,
Penny here,

This is not the first time I've thought I'm Bipolar, I have many times over the years but as of yet I haven't done anything about it.
My partner of six years said 'Don't you notice your sudden mood swings?' It was said in good faith and we have a good relationship but I've always struggled in secret with mental health issues. I battle depression, anxiety and I've had OCD intrusive thoughts since I was seven. (Unoffical diagnosis.) The first time I noticed my symptoms was at aged 15. I was bullied relentlessly emotionally and physically during school over a five year period. I think this could have been my 'trigger.' I plunged into depression and started harming. I don't really know how I got through this patch but somehow I did. Then at 16 I met my other half who picked me up out of my darkened spiral. Since then my moods shift at lot from very high to very low. Sometimes i hate life and will openly say how i dont want to be here then the next day I could be talking about how I'm going to do all these fancy plans. Recently I think I've been in a 'manic' stage without even realizing. My 'red flag' was when I noticed my recent lack of sleep but how, most of the time I don't really miss it. Even with 3-4 hours a night. The depression and worthlessness can be unbearable and I hate myself for the way I show off sometimes. I get irritated so easily and angry.
 I want to figure out what exactly it is I'm struggling with but the stigma around me is intense. Not with my partner. He'd support me with anything but he doesn't exactly 'get it.' Now that I'm not sleeping I worry things could be getting worse.
Thanks for any support or advice."
1141,"I have Bipoler disorder, Tourette syndrome, Adhd anxiety disorder, Panic attacks, and Depression, and a whole list of helth problems.

1143,"Hello basically i was diagnosed with bi-polar type 2 around 5 years ago, the doctor firstly put me on Seroquel and since being on seroquel when i took the tablets at night within 30 mins i was sleeping as it was so powerful. Long story short they removed me from quetiapine because i gained so much weight. Thats when the problems started with my insomnia i havent slept a full night since i quit the seroquel. Im up all night until like 6am then ill sleep for an hour then thats it back up for the day. THe doctors have tried me on Zopiclone which worked for a week then stopped, they've tried me on phengran i think and that didn't work, they also put me back on a low dose of seroquel 50mg to see if it would help but nope that didn't work either. also been tried on temazepam which worked for a week but had to take me off because they become addicting. So ive been back to the doctors and they prescribed me zopiclone again, so i took the tablet 6 hours ago and im still wide awake. I need some assisntance on what i should be asking my doctor because everything else they have given me just isnt working is there some other drugs i could ask for to try? this insomnia is ruining my life. Also what has happened to my body after the seroquel has left i used to be able to sleep but since quitting seroquel nothing seems to be working. Whats the most powerful sedative i can get from the doctor i just need to sleep im thinking suicide is the only way out of this at the moment"

1145,"We’ve been together 1-1/2 years, but nothing has worked for her BPD. Ketamine, ECT, medicine, you name it. She has broken up with me countless times and moved out twice. On Thursday she packed her bags and out of the blue left. Said she’s not in love with me — 6 hours later she was gone.

This happened around the same time last year — saying I pressured her to tell me her feelings, today saying I gaslighted her because I loved and missed her. She threatened a restraining order when I’ve done nothing wrong. 

She said she often hears voices, has tried to kill herself or been hospitalized several times. She also stopped eating thinking that was a good way to die. I’m at a loss bc I truly love her. She’s said I keep her from having friends but yet she’s never tried to make them. She’s said I gaslighted her and was emotionally abusive and wanted to take out a restraining order against me. Today I texted her and asked how she’s doing. She said “terrible.” Question is, do people with BPD often cycle at the same time of year? I feel like this happens with her four times a year. I also worry bc she has an eating disorder so I’m sure she’s not eating. Do I leave her alone?"
1146,"Hi im new to all this so please bare with me!

2 years ago my husband age 42 was diagnosed with bipolar he’s has and is still struggling to come to team with it! He’s knew most of his adults life he had bad days with mood swings ect since the age of 24/25 

But I kind of made him sort him self out after we had our daughter try and make his way of life better! 
Without felling the way he does! 

But this it where we are today he has started to self harm he’s never done anything like this in his life until last yr! When he has he low/bad days he said he can’t carry on he’s had enough And these thoughts getting more frequent so he self arms to stop him from thinking these thoughts!!! Iv asked him out right has he ever thought about ending it before and he said no in all the yrs he’s has bad episodes he tuck himself off to bed for 2/3 days then on the 4 day he would be getting back to his normal self, but now it’s takes him a good week or so! To start feel ok! Iv spoke to hes nurses and asked if we can come and sort this once and for all, he’s on medication of 500mg Depakote morning and 1000mg Depakote evening been on this for a good 12 months ...plus 20mg of mirtazapine around 3 months because he doesn’t sleep to good he was on quetiapine before that’s he was only on that a few months and that’s when he self armed for the first time so I called his nurse and he was taken off them right away it was a horrible time for him and me! But we got though it, until now and it’s kind of stared again without warming it’s just out the blue I can normally tell when one is coming on but this time I had no idea, we sat down and asked what brought it on and he couldn’t tell me because he didn’t know all he said was I think people are talking about me! I’m need some advice on what is next where do I go from here? I’m not prepared to lose him or give up on him if he can’t fight this I will do it for him! I’m so scared my daughter is going to end up with no daddy if I can’t sort it! And he has so much to live for ... so if there is anybody who can advise me what I can do or say at our appointments please feel free to answer me."

My fiancee has bipolar, we've been together just over 3 years now but I'm struggling more and more. Ive done all my research etc etc and know alot about it, I know her episodes and when they're going to start and everything but it's getting worse, I don't know if she wants to leave me or if it's an episode. 

She'll be fine with me in person but then as soon as I'm at work I start getting texts, she wants to be single again, she's not happy with me, I'm controlling, I'm not affectionate enough, she's bored..... It goes on. 

My friends have gotten bored of me speaking with them about it, sometimes they'll not message back for days of at all. I've no support system, I'm feeling so alone.

1151,"Hello everyone... like the title says, after 2 years of suffering and not knowing what was wrong with me I finally made an appointment to see a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with Bipolar 2. I thought a diagnosis would be scary but part of me feels like a weight is lifted off my shoulders just knowing what’s going on with me and knowing I’m getting the help I need. I have so many questions that I couldn’t directly get answers from simple google searches so any advice, input, or encouraging words would be much appreciated.

My doctor is starting me on very low doses, and I have a med follow up in 2 weeks. So right now I’m starting on 25 mg of Sertraline and 25 mg of Lamictal. Any personal experiences with these medications would be great! 

I also found that there’s a support group right down the street from my job, have these groups been helpful to any of you? 

I feel so isolated and lonely, just posting on this forum or having a good support group with others with bipolar could be helpful."

1163,"Hi everyone,
   I'm new to these forums, so apologies if this seems crass.  I'm going through a bit of a hard time as I'm trying to wade through insurance, referrals, and waiting lists to get a proper diagnosis of bipolar 2 instead depression and ADD.  I was wondering if anyone else had ever experienced something akin to what's been going on with me?  I'm male by the way.

I started having the most powerful orgasms of my life about two and a half months ago, when I started on Effexor.  Not only did the Effexor induce a hypomanic state, but it also caused inorgasmia (not a particularly desirable combination of symptoms). The orgasms were so jarringly different and powerful that I knew something was wrong, and it ultimately clued the psychiatric NP I was seeing that my persistent depression might actually be bipolar.  I just assumed hypomania was me when I was happy.

Anyways, I've never actually explained to anybody HOW these were different, just that they were more powerful.  Again, please excuse me if I get crass, but I'm not sure else I can explain it.  Before, I would ejaculate and that would be the main sensation of the orgasm.  Now I'm able to ride a secondary wave that hits right after ejaculation.  I could feel it before, but it was like an ancillary thing.  Now that wave is the main focus and ejaculating is just something that also happens.

This is far from the only ""type"" of orgasm I was having, but this is the only one that I can adequately describe.  I would ejaculate, start riding the wave and then completely lose some of my senses.  Mostly touch, sight, and hearing.  I would basically just see white for 5-10 seconds and then slowly come back to reality.  I noticed that I was losing my sense of touch because as it came back I could feel my hand on penis and realized that I hadn't felt that for the duration of the orgasm.  The same thing with me hearing, i wouldn't realize that I'd lost it until I came back.

I've been reading about something called orgasm synesthesia and a quote resonated with me, even though I am far less spiritual than the person quoted.  “Sometimes, it feels like an opening of the third eye,” says Tammy. “I perceive many layers of the world at once, the concrete and the abstract together.”

Does this sound remotely familiar to anyone?"

1165,"Hello. 
I have a stressful job and wondered if anyone can help with taking sick time for mental health problems . I'm scared I'll get sacked. I have cyclothymic disorder. In the last 2 years I have lost a brother and sister to cancer. My sister a month ago. Work gave me 2 weeks off but i started getting panic attacks out of nowhere. Doctor put me on sertraline which is horrible. I can't cope with the side effects. I am going back to the doctor tomorrow morning as i cant sleep and dont do anything except sit on my phone or try and escape watching films. I cant face work at the moment. And feel guilty taking time off but my job is taking calls and can be stressful but i don't think work will move me to another department. Bit of a ramble but i have no one to talk to. Thank you"

1174,"I don’t know what to do. Was in hospital earlier this year which was awful as I had to go 80 miles away from home. They started me on quetiapine alongside my lithium which seemed to help but when I got home I felt it was no good for me, having a toddler to get up with at 5.30am, I always had concerns about gaining weight on it long term. Have worked with home treatment recently but all they want to do is force quetiapine. If you’re not going to kill yourself there’s no help.

So basically it’s ok to feel deeply depressed, not eat or sleep properly, have no quality of life and affect those around me. That’s ok. I had to give up work a couple of months ago. I used to be this person who could spin lots of plates, be busy and cope. 

Now I’m just this waste of space who can’t cope with small daily tasks. I’ve got a cpn who can only see people once a month due to size of caseload. Been waiting a week for her to call me back. Absolute waste of time.

1175,"I have bipolar 2, and am wondering if that contributes to my lifelong messiness. I've always been a slob with my surroundings to the point of dysfunction and hovel-like, though there are moments and hours where I can be very focused and accomplish a lot, and at work I can keep it decent as it's obligatory.
 - I know this is a bipolar pattern of hypomania and mild depressive/anxiety stuck phases, perhaps also my self esteem issues joining in, but what I'm wondering is - are neurotypical people ever that messy, or is there basically always underlying mental health issues of some degree?"

It is completely full on manic feelings (almost loosing touch with reality) and then to the deepest parts of depression. Is this my Bipolar Disorder, or is it something else? And in that case, what is it defined as? Does it have a medical term?

I hope someone will be able to give a complementary answer to my question."
1179,"I was diagnosed BiPolar about 8 years ago and have tried alot of different medications, but am currently on Lithium, Duloxitine, Lamotrigne and Pregablin (which is the most recent addition to my cocktail).  

Even before I started on the Pregablin I started hearing things - not always voices, but a repetative noise and sometimes repeated sections of songs.  Its not just the words its the full music.  But lately this has got considerably worse - louder and all day, including affecting my ability to get to sleep.  I also find it hard to hear people talking to me because of the noise in my head.

Its not tinnitus - I have that ringing/buzzing in my left ear as well due to partial hearing loss.

Has anyone else had similar experiences, are the sounds related to the BiPolar?

How do you manage it?"
1180,"Hi all,

I have been together with my girlfriend for about 6 months now. She has been diagnosed with bipolar last summer, I don't know which type to be honest. Now that we have been living together for about 2 months I start to notice the sympoms and how they affect her behavior. I love her deeply and her to be as happy as possible, but sometimes challenges arise. She has a history of substance abuse (several types of drugs), self harming and eating disorder. Currently she is doing great at staying away from drugs and she is eating well, I think the fact that she has been with partners that also engaged in substance abuse and living irregular day patterns have had a very negative influence on her, and that it is good for her that I am kind off the total opposite of that. I live my days structured, living in a clean house etc. 
The thing is that even though she doesn't engage in drugs anymore, I am worried about her drinking patterns. She is more or less drinking a couple of glasses of wine every day, with more extremes when going out when she drinks a lot. On some days this causes her to forget taking her medicines, and ofcourse the day after having a hangover and usually more anxiety than normally. I am worried about her and can see from an 'outsider' perspective that this behavior is harming her, but I don't now how to talk to her about this. I am proud of her that she is not taking drugs anymore and drinking less alcohol than she used to, but I am still worried. Reading about bipolar I have learned that one has to take this mental illness serious and that drinking large amounts of alcohol is definitely not good. How can I approach her in a way that doensn't make her feel judged or attacked? I want her to know that I am proud of her that she is doing better than before, but I am still very worried. 

Thank you <3"
1181,"i'm sure this is something that's often asked, but i really need some help and advice. i've been dating someone for over a year, and when we first met, i was in a state of normal functioning and wellbeing, but as our relationship has progressed, i have begin to become incredibly depressive and experience terrible exhausting mood swings, which has put a huge strain on my relationship.

i think they're better off without me and that we should just break up, at least until i work on my issues, but they always say they want to stay and be here with me. that's just really hard, knowing that i am draining the life out of them , so it only makes me feel worse.

how do i leave without hurting them? i'm leaving to better them and i just want them to see that -- i love them, but i'm deadweight.

1182,"Hello,

Been dealing with mental health issues for years. Kept trying to fix it. Wife asked me for answers and as you all know its not as simple as that. Gave me 24 hours. Deadline passed. I don't want to go to work. Feeling pretty terrible.

12 years down the drain. 

Some advice would be nice. Anything would be nice. Some sort of hope. 

Really fucking pissed off. I understand that those of us with mental health issues go through some shit. I just didn't expect to be abandoned. Broke my phone so I can't hear her bullshit.

I have been on antidepressants since November because my anxiety and depression almost caused me to quit my dream job. It took a while for the medication to start to work but once it did I have obviously been feeling a lot better, minus a couple of periods of feeling very very down and feeling like harming myself (clean for about 9 months). I have recently noticed myself becoming much quicker at work, I'm busy all the time and I am never at home, even my boss asked if I had moved out. I impulse bought a hamster (I also impulse bought a fish two years ago), I suddenly spent a lot of money...as in hundreds of pounds...when I hardly ever like to buy anything unnecessary. I have also been drinking a bit more than usual, I have had waaaay more energy and have been sleeping more like a normal person rather than 11 hours a night. But suddenly I have crashed again, I have been feeling very down and as if there is a weight on me for no reason... I'm just nervous and I don't know what to do because if the doctor tells me that it isn't what I think it is then what do I do??!

1193,"Hi there,

I may be gripping at straws here, but I don’t know. My husband and I have been married for 10 years. He is ADHD, diagnosed as a child. Not totally consistent on his medication. We’ve had a good marriage, not perfect, but good. We bought a house together while young, he went through a criminal issue not long after, gained a lot of weight and eventually had gastric bypass, and then we sold our house and moved. All pretty normal.
He’s always been a pretty needy person. Would get jealous when I would be out spending time with friends or stuff like that. Like would be upset when I wasn’t spending all my time with him. I chalked that up to that’s just how he is. My job I’m in now I got pretty involved in. Being in management in a small business I was often working long hours, having to stay late, etc. Especially early in my time there. I have worked to make a change and some boundaries with this. We were pretty open with communication in the things we need. Did the 5 Love Languages, did some marriage counseling, but he didn’t like it because he felt his faults were always being picked at. 
This last year things magnified. He started a new job last August. He is also pretty involved in his activity. When all of this went went down he started accusing me that I don’t make enough time for him. Our work schedules are different. I made sure I was always at home the evenings I didn’t work so I could spend time with him, especially since I don’t have weekends off. I have made big changes in the things he had asked of, which he said he noticed.
The other thing is he began an affair during this period. He’s always had lots of female friends, and never an issue. But him and one began hanging out one on one, not telling me. It came to a head when her husband contacted me that they were screwing around. I confronted him, they cut contact as she was going to work on her marriage. Things got a little better, though he was still a little more down than normal. Understandably. Somewhere they picked up some contact again. He had been asking my best friend for advice and other friends too but leaving out any details that made him look like he was doing something wrong. Basically everything I did was wrong, I wasn’t trying. Even though he said many times I was. My friend said it was like he was trying to justify his actions that what he was doing wasn’t wrong.
Fast forward to February. He tells me he is looking at apartments. We talked a lot about this. I was supportive of him getting some space, as it’s something I did once during our marriage. But we had a clear cut plan. He went back and forth for a while. I told him staying with a friend was a better, cheaper solution. He would agree. Then wish-wash on it. Finally one day went and signed a year lease on another apartment. Our plan remained the same. Work on our relationship, and then at the end of my lease I would move there. Right after he moved he suddenly decided to go no contact. I went along with it. At the end of that, he showed up at my house and said he had filed out divorce papers and I just needed to sign them. I responded that if that is what he wanted I would have a lawyer get in contact with him. He balked, got a little angry I would even dare suggest a lawyer. I told him we had planned to work on things and now all of a sudden he just wants me to sign off like nothing? Doesn’t work that way. He then decided yes, we really need to work on things. We were making good plans, things were feeling good. He cut all contact with this other woman. She blocked him. Things going well. A week later she unblocked him to send him a message. I told him that it probably wasn’t the best time. The next day he came back and said he didn’t want to work on things, we have nothing in common, there’s no spark, Never was, a lot of harsh things. And now here I sit.

I never considered a mental issue until my friend said it seemed like a manic episode. He signs a new lease, starts a new life essentially, tries to get me to just sign divorce papers. Anyone that was trying to give him rational advice...not even stuff about trying to fix things, just rational advice about his affair and what he was doing... he would cut them out. Didn’t want to listen. “Doesn’t see it that way.” Was the repeating term. He has jumped around to different activities over the years and completely cut out out the precious one, but usually after a time period; would miss it and go back. I figure that’s the ADHD. He’s done the same with friends too. Now with me. 
I reached out to his most consistent friends and they agree he has not been himself lately.

I’m worried because just signing divorce papers is not how things work, plus I think there would be regret later on. I know I have not filled any out. That’s not what I want. And I’m worried because he doesn’t seem to be fully thinking out his decisions or letting people help him. Even when his mom offered good, rational advice, he stopped talking to her.

Thoughts? Comments?

Thanks for any help."

1196,Just started twitching and wretching as I am two days into an insomnia spell. I just had major surgery three months ago and now THIS.
1197,Please provide feedback and how you handled it.
1198,"First of all, what is the difference between those two? Are they one and the same?

Secondly, let my try to lay down my situation as calmly as possible (even if right now I’m in the midst of a potential panic attack that I am suppressing)... To go straight to the point, I stopped taking my meds for almost 4 weeks already. I am a female, 25 years of age. I have bipolar disorder type 2. My most recent medications which I stopped altogether (and to be honest quite abruptly) are the following: Lithium carbonate, Aripiprazole, and Fluoxetine. I am not fully aware of the consequences but I did do my own research at potential withdrawal effects of stopping psych meds such as these. Like having relapses of mania, dips of depression, nightmares, tightness of chest, suicidal thoughts, panic attacks, irritability, etc. One condition that I noticed I get whenever I try to suddenly stop taking my meds is an itchiness all over my body that shifts from area to area of my body. I am itching so bad as of this moment but am avoiding scratching too much so as not to get wounds. I do not get hives from my current itchiness. My last two though had hives and red patches, but I think it was because I over scratched at those times and that I know better now. Has anyone ever experienced this? If you have, what reliefs have you done (and please don’t say taking your medications again)?

More info and background about me: I honestly don’t trust my psychiatrist lately. She is nice, but why is it that what she says medically is different from what my endocrinologist says would put me in a better mood and such. It is very frustrating. This is one reason why I decided to stop my psych meds without consulting her. Also, personally, the fact that I am dependent on these medications to make me feel better or “back to normal” makes me feel terrible about myself and even depressed and anxious at times, hence, I’ve been trying to stop. And this is my longest streak so far.

Now, hear me out further before you judge me as closed-minded or whatever... I am open-minded about this and what you guys have to say. This is why I’m laying this down in public at this forum... because honestly... I am seeking for help somehow... which you should understand, is a very difficult thing for someone like me... and I would rather get help from people who understand me at a level such as yours since we have the same disorder and such.

Disclaimer: I don’t advice people with bipolar disorder to just abruptly stop their meds on their own like I did, coz I tell you... It will feel somewhat fulfilling at the start coz of the initial mania you get at the start of quitting, but then there’s this sudden dip and dive into depression and anxiety, and if you don’t have the support group or will power to choose to live and fight the good fight, then this could be a very hazardous act against your health and a painful scene for your loved ones."
1199,"This is likely to be a long post, and I am sorry, but I would really like some reassurance and impartial opinions. 

My ex boyfriend and I were together for 5.5 years, and were friends for about a year before that. The beginning of our relationship was in person, but the latter half was long distance, but we saw each other frequently and talked everyday. 

Since the beginning of our relationship, it was indicated he may have mental health issues, but nothing ever really happened about it. After about 2 years of dating, I found out that he had been lying to me about being friends with a girl and had hidden their friendship. We had a big discussion about this, and how he felt he had to do this as he didn't want to disappoint me, he showed me some messages and I felt (and still do) feel certain it wasn't cheating. This was our first big fight and red flag about his mental illness. We talked a lot about it, and he told me that he struggles a lot, and that he really loved me and wanted to get better. 

Fast forward through our relationship, there was significantly more ups and downs (but overall the relationship was good, we communicated, were happy, and it felt right - there was a lot of love there). He still struggled to be fully honest with me, although he never lied about anything malicious (it was always silly things like that he had ordered pizza instead of making dinner or had put on a little bit of weight). This led to us having a massive conversation about us, and for the first time nearly breaking up, neither of us wanted that and he made it very clear that he wanted to be with me and loved me despite all this. He told me that he was hanging out with people that he didn't care about to drown out the voices in his head and that he felt guilty even talking to me because he was letting me down and wasn't good enough. We agreed he put me on too much of a pedestal and that this needed to be solved to go forward in our relationship. He has a lot of issues with his mother, the root of all this (had to lie a lot in his childhood to avoid more abuse), and he started to go to therapy alone and with his mom as well. We discussed a lot about this and he really opened up and seemed to get better, the therapist after some months diagnosed him with cyclothymia and he was doing well. He removed this idealised image of me, and things were going well, we had lots of chats about his childhood and he opened up to me more about things he never had, and had never told anyone else (he suffered a lot of abuse from family members). We had a lot of good chats and things felt good. He was recommended to go on medication, but never followed up, and I didn't want to push him as he seemed to be doing well. 

Things then went downhill again when I started seeing some mystery payments he made on venmo to a friend, he eventually told me that they were buying him alcohol (he was 20 at the time and lives in the US). Looking back now, I realise this followed the death of his grandfather, who he was very close to and possibly triggered it. He told me he was using this to deal with everything and that he was really out of it and anxious and disassociating. He started going back to therapy and things got good again, he was finally being fully honest with me. He got a job, college was going great, he made new friends, and things were really good between us. This carried on for about a year, we saw each other a lot, talked a lot, and seemed happy. I never for a second doubted that he loved me, he was sweet, caring, thoughtful, and a great friend to me. We also had a very healthy sexual relationship throughout this whole period. We got along like a house on fire 90% of the time. I was very understanding of everything he was going through and made it clear to him I wanted to be with him and stick by him and he felt the same. He went through the loss of his dog at this time, his only saviour during the abusive years, and reason he has become a vet, but seemed to deal with it really well and I 

Fast forward to December 2018, we had been talking a little less for about a week as we were both busy with work prior to the holidays, when we were going to be together. Everything seemed fine, he was making plans and we were discussing things about family presents and things. Then next thing I know he starts to freak out about the distance, I sort of dismissed it and told him we shouldn't worry, we would be able to close it soon (I think this was triggered by me getting a new job). He said he was being silly and cares about me, and he just doesn't want to disappoint me and hold me back. 

The next day he started being really distant and slowly replying, I asked him what was wrong. He said he had to think, and then an hour or so later he sent me a long text saying that he loved me so much and always will, but he can't be in this relationship with his current mental health. I was shocked, literally two days before I thought things were fine, he said something just snapped and changed. I tried to call him and he didn't want to talk, eventually we spoke and he said he is confused about life and felt he needed to make all life decisions about his future now. He wasn't good enough for me, he was holding me back, and he didn't want me to wait for him to get better. I told him that I loved him and wanted to support him, that I will always care and if it is really what he wants we can break up but I will always support him. He said he didn't really want to break up, but felt we had to. 

The next day we spoke again, and he told me he doesn't love me anymore, and then stopped talking to me and starting hanging out with this girl, we will call her Bryony. He is spending all this time with his friend Bryony, and she stayed over at his house he wouldn't respond to my calls, and I just told him I will give him some space. Eventually we speak again, he is nice and normal, he tells me multiple times he has no feelings for Bryony and it is just nice to talk to her because she distracts him and he doesn't have to think about anything. He says he loves me and doesn't want to break up, but feels like we have to because he isn't healthy. He again says he is unsure about everything, we decided to give it a break for a few days to give him space to think. The trip to see each other was cancelled as he didn't want to see me while he wasn't right. I left him and didn't message him until he contacted me again, we spoke and had nice conversations like we used to and then he would snap and refuse to talk to me again. Eventually it got to the point where I had to stop fighting for it, I loved him so much, but I couldn't deal with the rollercoaster. He told me he needed to be alone, and couldn't heal while he was with me as he didnt want to let me down. I agreed with everything, as much as it hurt me, and told him that I will always be here and love and support him if he wants to be friends down the line. He said he loved me and didn't want me to be permanently out of his life and we could talk when he felt he was in a more stable place and he would contact me. I told him that I cared about him and always would, and wished him all the best and thanked him for a great relationship. He responded with nice things about me, saying things like I was irreplaceable and made him happy, and he will miss me. 

We hung up and that was that. I had suspicions that he had bipolar, but obviously myself cannot confirm as I am to a professional. This officially ended at the beginning of January, and since then I have messaged him 5 times. Firstly to tell him I had sent him his belongings, and he needed to collect them at the post office (to which he didn't respond). I think a month later asked if he would mind sending my stuff, he said he was getting it together. He still hadn't sent it so I asked him again about it, he also owed me money, but as it was a large amount I told him that he didn't have to pay me that back until he had enough. However, he sent me the money, but did not send my belongings (even though he said he would). I texted him twice after that, about 3 weeks apart asking him again if he would mind sending my belongings. I told him my parents would also be near by and could collect it from him. He did not respond to either of these texts. 

Throughout this time he still followed me on social media, and watched all mine and my friends stories (something that he didn't frequently do before), he didn't remove me from anything and still viewed the stuff while ignoring my texts. I ended up removing him myself as it made me sad to see this when I couldn't talk to him about anything, he still to this day follows my spotify account despite unfollowing my playlists and deleting ones he made me. He then removed all pictures of me from his social media about 2 months after. 

Throughout this time he moved in with Bryony I found out from a mutual friend, and they got a dog together. I couldn't believe this after he made it so clear he had no interest in her, but I tried to just let that pain pass me by. I just hoped he actually was getting healthy. 

Finally, this weekend my parents contacted him which he responded to and then stopped, he was very cryptic and then my mom arranged to meet his Dad to get my stuff (which my ex said he would just leave on a porch!). Then out of the blue yesterday he decided to meet my mom himself with the stuff, and he called me. I genuinely thought I would never hear from him again. 

We spoke for around 2.5 hours about a lot of different things, he began by apologising for how he treated me. He told me he is seeing professionals and that he has been diagnosed with Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar, and PTSD, and was now medicated for them. He then proceeded to tell me he never loved me, which hurt so bad to hear. This is what I held on to the whole time, that even though it ended so painfully and suddenly we still loved each other in the past. I remained calm and we discussed this, and he essentially said I was just a support system that he was sexually attracted to (sidenote though maybe relevant he was only sexually attracted to me during our relationship, and is now only sexually attracted to Bryony). He told me he is happy and healthy now, he refused to tell me about Bryony at first only hinting about the fact he may have been in a relationship. I told him I knew and would appreciate honesty, he told me he had moved in with her right after to keep each other accountable for going to therapy (they both had bad childhoods he said) and that it developed from there and now they were dating, living together, and got a dog together. He told me this hadn't happened until 'well after' we were over, which made me chuckle since we haven't even been broken up for 4 months after 5.5 years together. He asked if I would ever meddle in his relationship, which I felt very offended by since I haven't contacted him. He was saying this stuff about never loving me, but told me he was thinking about me a lot, that he couldn't listen to certain songs that remind him of me, that he cared about me a lot and wanted to know how I was doing. He seemed so excited to talk and asked me to keep talking every time I went to leave. He noted how nice and comfortable this conversation was, and I agreed, it felt like talking to an old friend. He told me that he thinks about me fondly (but then at another point says he didn't pay attention to my life or social media, and then talked about things he had seen on them). He acted weirdly coy, he said it didn't bother him at all to think about me with other people, that he thinks he will marry Bryony and that this is real and forever, unlike us. Then again back about how they thinks about me and knows I am kicking ass and doing so well, and will have found someone so much better than him (emphasised that a lot). 

At the end of the conversation he suggested being friends, and I said I would like to be friendly - meaning we could catch up and chat occaisonally but it would never be the same. He was on board, then flipped. He told me I have done nothing wrong but I will trigger him and that it can't happen anymore. I was disappointed after having such a nice conversation which felt like friendly - we chatted about life as we used to and were both making jokes. The call disconnected, he apologised for that via text, and I said that I would like to be friendly, but either way I respect his decision, that I was grateful for our relationship and that I wish him all the best. He didn't respond, and that I think is that. 

I guess - I don't want to be back with him ever, and I knew that since we first broke up. But I am concerned about him, I am unsure if you can really be healthy and move that fast (Bryony also got out of a 1.5 year relationship when ours ended, and she has not been single for more than a week since she was 15), moving in an getting a dog seems a little rash? 
Do you think it is possible that he never loved me when he treated me so well - he supported me, cared for me, was a friend, was attracted to me etc - often pointing out little things that he loved about me. His friends always noted that he was so much happier around me, and he also had a specific tone of voice he used only when talking to me and his two trusted family members, even looking at photos the way he looked at me was one of love. 

I guess i am just lost, I am looking for any guidance as to this situation and where I stand, perhaps advice of how to move forward from this - its affecting my own mental health. Can we truly be friendly? I am just lost and any support would be appreciated. 

Many thanks in advance."
1200,"Hello,

I'm pretty new to this forum, and just starting to use it.  

10 years ago, I was diagnosed with, General Anxiety, Social Anxiety, Depression, and Panic Disorder.  Looking back on life, I probably had manifestations of them long before that.  Treated them for years, but kept gradually getting worse.  So I went to a psychiatrist last year, instead of just my general doctor and I was diagnosed with bipolar 2.  Now it's been a whole new treatment process that I've been having to get use to now.  Mood stabilizers vs. anxiety/depression meds, etc.  My psychiatrist also just started having me see a therapist.  According to the the therapist, even though I have issues to work out, I never had what would be considered a traumatic event in my life.  

The part I'm so confused about now, is when I get manic or depressive, is it a chemical reaction, or some hidden emotional issue I'm reacting to at that time.  Does anyone else have experience with this, or have some guidance?"
1201,"Hello,  

I am failing out of nursing school and I don’t know what to do. I want to be a nurse but it just doesn’t seem possible for me. I can’t help but to wonder if I’d be having this issue if I didn’t have bipolar disorder. I can’t relate to anyone in my life because no one I know is failing out of school. Any advice? Similar situations? Reassuring thoughts? I’ll take anything at this point. Thank you :)"
1202,"I am so emotional right now, thinking of killing myself soon, I cant take this anymore nothing is working or helping I have been suffering with SO much people dont even believe how many issues I have half the time, this being one of them.

1203,"I hate bipolar, I'll start there.  I keep doing this thing where Im in the darkest pit of a depressive episode and I think the world is against me.  I think my friends and family conspire against me or are hiding bad things from me.  So i confront them.  At the time I feel like my messages mean well and are concerned, but when I wake and read them i see they are laced with distrust and paranoia.  I've just lost a close friend.  To be fair, my concerns were well intended, but he lashed out and started calling me names and being generally rude to me.  A disproportionate amount of disrespect in mine and my boyfriends eyes.  This isnt the first time I've lost someone over this kinda thing.  And I'm scared it won't be the last.  Sometimes I wish I could sew my mouth closed and suffer in silence."
1204,"I have another mental health diagnosis as well, but for some reason, I just can't except this one. I am so scared and angry I dont know what to do, Im medicated and I dont want to be. In the past I got very aggressive and went into a psychosis, it was thought to be meds now people are saying its bipolar I am so scared that I could hurt someone again if thats the case. I think mental health medication has fried my brain.I also gained 100 lbs in one year I use to be skinny I cant stand this Im thinking id be better off dead. I have been meditatiing every day for 28 days streight, going to the gym, increasing water. nothing stops the mood shifts and I just cant do this the thought of becoming violent or killing someone/""snapping"" keeps playing in my head. I dont want to, I just think, what if I went into psychosis and didnt know what I was doing or had no control(that happend once I tried to stab my bf and would attack him daily in black outrage and its unlike me and came out of nowere, it started as mania tho)"
1205,"I was diagnosed with bipolar several year's ago. I have severe mood issues and I realize that things can change in early to mid 20's involving mental health. I feel that I have psychotic symptoms but not to the point where it's nearly as concerning as my hypomanic/ depressive moodswings. I often feel paranoid and maybe a bit delusional, Not extreme delusions and I'm able to differentiate what's real and what's not with usually no problem. I just wish it would go away. Having said that, some guy (works for a provider of MH services) walked up on me while I was smoking a cigarette and said he was looking for me. One thing led to another and he scheduled appointments for me, even offering me transportation to and back from my appointments. Glad he came through."

1210,"Hi. I recently moved, and now I feel like things are falling apart. I have schizoaffective disorder, so my psychotic symptoms are present all the time as well as bipolar symptoms. I'm struggling to find a job and find community in a new place. I know people here but I can't stop isolating myself, sleeping a lot, and getting stressed out over small things. I have laundry piling up and we're almost out of groceries and I just feel useless. I'm getting bad at taking my meds regularly which means I'm much more symptomatic than I used to be. I don't know what I'm looking for... I just feel useless."
1211,"Don't get me wrong I hate being bipolar.  We all know the days we hate it.  Days you find yourself jumping on your bed in front of cops, hospitalized, manically washing your walls or days on the couch.  Days you let your dishes pile up, your garbage over flow.  All you want to do is cry or scream.   Separately or both at the same time.  

This is not what I want to focus on.  I want to talk about the things we love about being bipolar.

I love when I hand in a paper to my professor and she says...wow, no one has ever looked at it like that.  I like it when I don't blend in.  I like being custom built.  I don't want to blend in.  I am rememberable...not for being bipolar but for being me."

1213,"10 years I’ve been dealing with this black cloud in and out my life depressed weeks months, then highs for a short period I love the feeling of being high everything seams so much more colourful is it wrong for me to say that... but then I crash....

I’m not sure how to feel about being diagnosed with bipolar it’s label people are scared of ... even my mother in law when I told her of my diagnosis said that’s not good that’s proper crazy people syndrome."
1214,"I was talking with someone I had just met, mental illness had impacted both our families and our lives.  She said she had heard of a form of bipolar disorder where there was no high.  No mania, no hypomania, the person would feel only depression.  Is there such a variation where bipolar disorder has only one pole?  How does it differ from unipolar depression?"
1215,"Hi,


I’m wondering If there are different forms of bipolar disorder that don’t exactly match the official diagnosis criteria. I’m talking about subtler forms, and forms that aren’t often associated with the idea of bipolarity, but eventually turn into it later on or are better off being treated with mood stabilizers etc. I’ve been going through some issues for the past four years, it all began from an episode of obsessive earworms caused by hearing a song that I really liked. The earworm episode lasted for the entire night nonstop and it was really disturbing and caused a period of anxiety that I still haven’t completely recovered from yet.  I think I was too stimulated by the feelings of joy or whatnot from hearing that song, but what makes me consider bipolarity isn’t just due to the severity of the episode, but also because of my temperament.

I’ve always had a depressive temperament since I was young and this eventually turned into something of a creative temperament later on, in which I spend a lot of time in my head, fantasizing and engaging in creative pursuits, and feeling deeply about things.  Through research I found out that the creative temperament is linked to bipolarity. I’ve always had a depressive personality, and ever since I developed what seems to be full blown anxiety and depression (I’m 19 years old, this all first began when I was 15), I became more easily susceptible to strong feelings, like getting deeply excited about things I would usually like, but never had such a strong reaction to, or being more easily moved or emotionally swayed. I’ve always been extremely imaginative, and loved to engage in fiction. I was also shy and prone to feeling deeply, but ever since mental illness has entered my life it feels as if my emotions have been more “loose”. My mood has shifted completely; I’ve lost what it feels like to live normally, my mood is just varying levels of exhaustion and other symptoms would plague me as well, like rapid heartrate, and they would plague me deeply to the point where I can’t shake them off easily anymore. At times I would feel like I have energy at night, other times I’m exhausted. Most of the times, my energy levels are all over the place. All of this, including my depressive and weird personality just feels like a biological illness.  I don’t know if this would be considered bipolarity after taking into account my temperament, and my behaviours since I was young.  I also have an autistic older brother diagnosed with bipolar disorder (may be a misdiagnosis, but regardless, he has pretty random and pronounced mood swings).

I’ve also been called different or weird by others, and as of now, I have few close friends and I feel that I am quite socially awkward. I also feel that I may have some schizoid tendencies, as I’ve never really felt the desire to make friends since I was young, preferring instead to be alone, thinking that I’m just introverted and that there’s nothing wrong with that. But now after all the sudden, unexpected downhill spirals in my life, I don’t know, and I’m concerned.

Sorry if this was a ramble, I wrote this while feeling incredibly exhausted. Any insight would be appreciated."
1216,"Hello, sorry for how bare bones this is, I just wanted to get my thoughts out there before i forget (i have memory issues along with my own mental disorders not related to Bipolar)

Starting from the beginning, im sure my dads always had mental trouble, frequently depressed and angry . I was a child and so i don't have much to go on other than ""there were a lot of times dad just wasn't right"". His brother died 3 years ago and i think something just triggered his symptoms to become so much worse.
he would crawl around on the floor and yell and fall asleep in the middle of standing and im sure other things but it was 3 years ago he just acted wild , we thought it was low blood pressure or something at first but over time we just accepted it as thats what dad does now. Over time things must of gotten better, but recently something has triggered it to become more intense than before.
He now

screams
slaps his belly like he's playing the drums
headbangs and ""sings"" (he's a guitar player)
screams ""ow!"" and ""fuck!"" at the top of his lungs constantly
runs around the house
starts to fake cry if we react in any way thats not positive
he snaps semi out of it when i touch him and try to get his attention now and then but slips right back under to not ""being there"" anymore
laughs wildly

he's had an episode every day for a week, sometimes multiple.
whiles he's having an episode. We can usually tell when ones going to happen because he starts mumbling and heavy metal singing quietly before starting to slap his stomach. He's also an insomniac and just cant sleep more than maybe 2-3 hours a night before going to work in a factory
We're very poor , and my mother going to jail is the trigger(she's out right now on bond and the episodes are so frequent and she's so stressed with everything going on its a bad combination) for things to get worse this time. None of our family are very kind to us and i know the worlds on his shoulders, i just want to be able to help in some way.

I feel like im being abusive for not just , sitting back and accepting and being happy 24/7 about how my house is. I don't know how long my mom is going to get and he's the only person bringing money into our house now (he couldnt hold a job in those 3 years as he was grieving, and so he's had to take a terrible job with no insurance whatsoever )

He has never been diagnosed (none of us have despite us all having obvious somethings)

Im sorry this is so jumbled i needed to get my thoughts out quickly before i forgot something and had to come back and clarify."
1217,"A girlfriend is currently going through her 4th or 5th manic episode since 2006.  All the usual symptoms are there:

having higher-than-normal energy levels
being restless or unable to sit still
having a decreased need for sleep
having increased self-esteem or confidence, or grandiosity
being extremely talkative
having a racing mind, or having lots of new ideas and plans
being easily distracted
engaging in risky behavior, such as having impulsive sex, gambling with life savings, or going on big spending sprees.

Every episode seems to have been triggered by medication.  This time around she decided to tackle a post-nasal drip issue and started taking antihistamines, which I've never seen her take before.  This all happened while she happened to be staying at my small apartment.  I got to a point where had to ask her to leave.  I offered to take her back to her usual hotel, but she insisted on walking out in the dead of night.

Staying at my place allowed her to to save some of her social security money, but she quickly went through that with her spending sprees in the past month.  She insisted on staying at a DoubleTree at at least twice the rate of her usual hotel.  She's convinced herself that her usual hotel, the entire hotel, has a mold issue.  She's dropped hundreds of dollars at places like Nordstroms, Macy's and L'Occitane.  She went from having $1,700 in the bank to being $1000 in the red.  She got her first credit card in years and maxed it out.  She's down to hawking heirloom jewelry from her safety deposit box.  I paid for some of her hotel, and I believe the only other friend of hers still supporting her gave her some money, but I can't afford to do anymore.  Many would argue I should have never given her any money in the first place.

After not sleeping for weeks her body is also falling apart.  She's already had 3 ER visits for bronchitis and can't afford the medication.  

She seems to find a reason for me to come out to her every day.  Last night she left messages asking me to drive 10 miles and bring her the coat she left at her most recent hotel.  She was a block from the hotel and eventually got it herself.  I'm probably going to go out today and bring her a piece of her jewelry she left here.

Given her history I've kept my continued association with her a secret from my family, except for one sister who's a retired nurse and who's advice I value.

Many have advised me to just walk away from this, and I can't say they're wrong.  I've made the mistake of continuing to listen to her voicemails and read her texts.  I'm probably better off simply not knowing.  Part of the problem is I just don't know how this ""tough love"" approach is going to end.  What we should expect from it.  The other friend still supporting her wants her to get medication for the mania, but she's been resistant to medication so far and I know it's also not that simple.  That there's a lot of trial and error finding the right medication."
1218,"Of course, this is directed at those who don’t mind sharing. What caused you to be hospitalised? Was it always when psychotic, or before those features started showing? Can you be hospitalised before psychosis starts setting in? If so, what sorts of things can lead you to be hospitalised instead of psychosis?"
1219,"I have a partner of 18 Months who has bipolar 2. I have been reading alot online to understand this condition as best i can.

I haven't brought this conversation up as yet w him as I was hoping to get a better understanding from people who may be able to share some advice or experience. I'm trying to understand why promiscuity happens with bipolar and how do we prevent it happening and how do I learn to trust and not assume it could happen.

1220,"Hi all. I’m writing to get some opinions on a confusing situation that has come up. I’ve suffered from depression off and on for practically my whole adult life, but my mental health situation has changed in the past couple of years. As for the depression, I’ve taken all kinds of anti-depressants over the years, but they never worked very well (indication of bipolar disorder maybe?). But to my knowledge I’ve never had a manic episode. That all changed 18 months ago.

I suffered the symptoms of a full-blown hypomanic episode that ticked all the boxes. Awake for up to 72 hours at a stretch, couldn’t stop talking, delusions of grandeur, all of it. This went on for at least a couple weeks, maybe more. I wound up in the hospital for 6 days where they brought me down.

I informed them at the time that I had been drinking large quantities of alcohol. I also suffered symptoms of withdrawal unrelated to the manic thing, which they also addressed. What the doctors DIDN’T know, or at least weren’t fully aware of, was that I was also taking xanax along with the alcohol. I’d been hoarding it for some time, and had started taking large amounts.

That would seem to account for my severe withdrawal symptoms, but what a psychologist recently suggested was that that xanax/alcohol mix could also have caused the mania (rather than bipolar disorder itself).

Since that time, I had one more what I would call minor hypomanic episode. Awake for a couple days at a stretch, and some hints of that ramping up feeling of boundless energy, but nothing so severe as the last time. That, too, was accompanied by alcohol/xanax withdrawal (I’ve also sought help for the addiction problem and it’s under control now). Other than that, no hypomania in my life that I know of. I also don’t engage in inappropriate shopping, never really have. I have engaged in a lot of reckless sex and, of course, substance abuse.

So, the question is, could that set of circumstances lead to a misdiagnosis of Bipolar II that I now have?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts. I’m very curious about this.

For the record, I’m currently on a mood stabilizer that seems to work well, so bipolar or not, I seem to have found medicine that works better for me than anti-depressants."
1221,"What goes up, must come down, here we go again, first the skipping along,happy ,joyous highs.
Then comes the tiredness, so it starts to take hold. Sick of this rollercoaster man. Have a meeting coming up to tell me what I already know. Arhhhhhggggg"
1222,"Hi,

I'm new here, I've been trying to navigate this and have done a lot of research but my situation seems a little different from others I have seen so I like to get some insight from people who have been there on my side or people who have done this kind of thing themselves.

I'm going to try to keep it short(ish) but please bear with me cause I have a lot to say.

My boyfriend and I have been together for a little under a year. I knew from the start he was bipolar and it was something we bonded over because I have my own mental health struggles, we disucssed it a lot and suported each other. Everything was going well, we were talking about marriage, moving together, etc. He is pretty high-functioning as far as bp goes but is not currently medicated or going to therpay (although we had been discussing the need to do both and he was willing, just hadn't yet.)

About two and a half months ago he had a run of bad luck and a lot of things stressing him out, and was getting very overwhelmed. He kept telling me this and was getting more distant (fewer texts, not seeing me as often) which was partially due to his now-busier schedule (we do not live together). During the entire month of February for one reason or another he kept being unable to meet up with me. His mood seeemd to pick up a little right in the week before this happened but...the second weekend in March his communication became much worse, and I could tell he was detaching. (this is a thing he has done in the past, not just to me but others.) He was still telling he loved me and being affectionate, calling me etc. That particular weekend though he responded much less and with much shorter texts, basically letting me know he wasn't doing well.

That Sunday I lost it a little and due to my own issues I let him know I wasn't doing well either and ended up bombarding him with texts. He finally responded on Sunday telling me he was ""there but not there"" and didn't know what to say. The last thing I got from him was a message apologizing for not responding earlier and saying he was with his child. 

That's the last I've heard from him to this point. It has been three weeks, I have called him, texted him, no response. I have not been super naggy or critical or anything like that, I apologized because I realized by going off a little that weekend I had probably added to his being overwhelmed, I have told him I love him and I'm there, and I've tried to give him space.

Unlike other situations Ive seen online though, he never said he wanted to break up or anything like that. He has, like I said, disappeared on people before but has come back. We didn't have a fight before this and right up to the night before he disappeared he was telling me he loved me.

It's hard for me because I don't think he broke up with me, but I don't know what's going on with him (I am confident he is not harming himself or anything like that.) going to visit him is not an option, he lives full time with his child and he would not take kindly at all to me just showing up, it's not his personality.

I know it is common for those with bp to disappear and not respond to messages etc. Has anyone been in this situation where you were essentially ghosted by a SO but there was no indication of a fight or a break up? (he is not the type of person to just break up with someone this way, we had issue related to him wanted to break up due to his bp before (thinking I shouldn't have to deal with it, etc., and he didn't discuss that via phone or text at all, he's a very in-person kind of guy)

I'm trying to give him more space and just let him know I'm here, I'm not mad, I still care, but at some points I wonder if I'm fooling myself. I am trying to take care of myself as I know that's important, I have a therapist appt scheduled in the coming weeks.

I guess I'm just wondering, has anyone been there? Is it possible he's just shutting me out due to depression and he'll come back around? For anyone that shuts others out during a bp depression, what was your thought process?"
1223,Don't know if it is bipolar or Easter or the stress I'm feeling but I've a strange urge to harm myself.  Am I suicidal or plain crazy?
1224,When you're feeling depressed what do you need and want from the loved ones around you to say and do that may be of help?
1225,"Has anyone been on Topamax for treatment of bipolar, If so and you don’t mind,could you share the side effects you experienced? positive/ Negative."
1226,"So in the last year I've been diagnosed with bipolar 2 disorder. Its been in my family and I've suffered for years before diagnosis..
So really what I want to know is do other people suffer with shame?
I am so ashamed of all the crazy and sometimes scary things I have done while manic or rapid cycling over the years.
I've been on the right medication finally since May and now I'm feeling like myself for the first time in years I can't shake this. I try not to but keep thinking of things I have done. At the time I have fallen out with family,friends,you name it. People are forgiving and some have stood by me so are just glad that I'm getting the help I need now. But other people I'm not close to probably think I'm a lunatic and selfish person. And seeing them in social settings gives me anxiety..sometimes I wish I could write it on my forehead..like that wasn't me,I was really really I'll.
Any advice in coping? Thank you"
1227,"Hi all!  I was recently correctly diagnosed as BP2. My Dr. put me on 200mg Wellbutrin SR, 100mg Lamictal, and 15mg of Remeron at night. I've been on this new combo for a week. All meds before were the same except the Wellbutrin. Prior to this, I was on Effexor.  
My depression was horrible for almost three weeks. Since starting this trio, I have felt giddy, slept very few hours at night, but don't wake up tired, have boundless energy, and more focus than I've had in awhile. Anyone else been on, or currently on this combo? Or thoughts about if this is normal? Any info appreciated!"
1228,"As you may know... i have an on off relationship with a bipolar partner. 
It has been rocky since day dot. I love him dearly... but I don't know how to deal with the hot cold up down. One minute he wants to marry me the next day we're apparently in the friend zone. Nothing I seem to do or say is right or good enough and im being constantly compared to an ex partner or he'll say he can't make me happy because he cant bring anything to my world as he is unhappy and has nothing financial to contribute.  I dont care for financial status and just want him for who he is but thats not good enough. One day I mean everything to gim the next I'm contributing to his unhappuness.... we keep going round in circles with him believing he cant make me happy because his world is not perfect.. .. and keeos bringing up past relationships. .. I'm starting to wonder why he is still hanging on.... i don't know. It's a never ending issue.  Sometimes i feel it best if i leave and allow him to drift as he's done the past few years. ...."
1229,"its something i wonder about occasionally.
my best friend had bipolar (lets call her Rachel) and we got along so well. i would always say that she understood parts of me that nobody else did.
and now recently my sister put herself in the mental hospital, theyre treating her for bipolar too.
it runs in my family. apparently my moms aunt has in, and possibly my grandma.
it just. makes sense.
i always used to just think i was “deep”. more alive, more sensitive than other people. just emotionally intense in these strange ways that nobody else could understand.
i remember the first time it happened. i was in freshman year of high school, hella depressed, and i had been for a while. i was very shy and had no friends.
and one night, like a light switch, everything f*cking changed. my entire existence did a flip switch.
i felt myself as part of the universe. i felt so much love. i loved everything and everyone. it was so beautiful. i would cry almost everyday, at absolutely everything. i just felt so much love. life felt free, open, forgiving, beautiful. it didnt bother me anymore that i had no friends, or sat by myself at lunch. i had the mountains, the trees, the sunshine,, and that was more than enough.
a few months of this. i started going outside, all the time. looking into environmental protection and meditation. i felt special, a universe child, like i was chosen for something extremely existentially meaningful.
a few months later, this feeling died down. i became my normal self again,, yet very upset and frustrated i couldnt feel the things i used to feel.

next year, sophomore year. it happened again. music became my life, my soul, everything. i wanted to be free. i hated society. i would dream and scheme every damn day about these grand plans of running away. just getting on a bus and leaving. having no identity, just living. my heart would literally race and i could feel the blood pump through my veins. i still had no friends, other than Rachel. this intense passion, it raced through me with all its vibrant colors. reds, oranges, yellows. bold juicy and sweet. i wanted to travel the world. i promised myself that i would live a genuine life. it terrified yet excited me. #nosleep

junior year, same sh*t. but this time it was drugs. the excitement of new experiences. i had so many friends this year. everyone loved me dude. i was real as f*ck and fun as f*ck. sneaking out, partying, drinking, everything. i loved drugs. my parents were pretty strict, so i lied to them about everything. one time i purposely rammed my car into a pole, just because my friend in the passenger seat said, “slow down, dont hit the pole” and i didnt like being told what to do. me n Rachel did some crazy sh*t this year. our other friends thought we were “sketchy” and “wild”, we were like the dynamic duo.

senior year was weird. senior year was f*cked. i thought i was going to die. if i did get mania this year, it was not happy mania. it was screaming, yelling, constantly pacing at work, feeling trapped in every aspect. my mind would scream at me constantly, repeating the same sh*t over and over, i couldnt make it stop. i got into an emotionally abusive relationship and i had something like psychosis (i thought my soul was poisoned, so i avoided everybody because i didnt want to poison them too). Rachel was in psychiatric treatment the whole year(for her own problems), and i lost all my other friends. all i could talk about was existence and death. i would sleep any chance i got. senior year was the color black. 

im in college now, its getting better. last year kinda sucked(depression?). 


i still sometimes get mental breakdowns but not nearly as much as i used to. they freak me out. one small thing can happen that throws me off entirely. nothing makes sense. i feel lost. i go crazy..thats what i call it. i get these impulses vividly. . my mind swirls like a whirlpool and i cant deal with myself. these episodes usually only last a day or two.


i dont know. when i get depressed, i sleep. i have no energy for anything. everything feels heavy and forced. when i get sad i think about my family. i think about the light in my little brothers eyes and i cry because he is so innocent. i cry about my mom, my dad,, their lives are almost over. are they happy? is my family f*cked? its not fair. nothing is fair. society is lost and meaningless. i feel the pain of everybody around me. i think about ryan(old friend that committed suicide)and i think about my past. 

im not sure. everybody around me assumes im always happy. i actively and consciously try to only bring good vibes. i try to support and listen to people. i want them to feel acknowledged and heard.

im more balanced than i used to be. hormones are balancing out maybe? i also live in a more stable environment now, with stable and supporting friends. sometimes i miss the intensity. i hope im not going numb.
i appreciate my life and where its at right now. i remember that this is temporary, one day my life will be nothing like the way it is now. and thats life. its pretty f*cking short.
idk.
its not like im like this all the time. i definitely have my normal days. and i dont feel things nearly as intensely, for as long, as i used to.
so who knows?"
1230,"What are your tips for aggression well manic?  (hitting, yelling, saying mean things)

not everyone has this symptom but people do so please don't respond with ""people with bipolar aren't aggressive, I'm not!"" I deal with it and its very isolating to others who also deal with it by saying that. It has been proven that mania can cause irritation and aggressive behavior and rage attacks."
1231,"hi there all, just wondering what the hell is wrong here? anyone ever feel this way ?  feels so much more severe than all 3 previous depressions that i've had, and they where supposedly severe as i became agoraphobic but this time seem to have lost much of my personality , feels far more severe and i'm now basically mute.

all started after psychotic episode....
 
im 29 male, 7 months ago my life changed beyond recognition following a psychotic episode...brought on by smoking weed daily for maybe 1 year.... the episode was characterized by delusions and paranoia, ultimately i was sectioned after family members grew increasingly concerned ... this however is not the problem , its how i have felt since coming out of hospital...

. i was on resperidone for 2 months and hoped it was this causing my'zombie state' now on no medicine .... i was taken off it quickly due to constant lethargy , i call it a zombie like state, pure apathy is what i have every day since this first started around 6 months ago after psychosis ended.... i have zero emotions , no anger, no sadness, nothing at all , no moods , just endless apathy that is destroying me slowly :

i am totally agoraphobic now where i was socially very active prior to the episode, i have become a complete hermit that is indifferent to everything even football that i loved before, i enjoy nothing and respond to nothing , find it impossible to feel any enjoyment in anything , i have no moods whatsoever and this doesn't change no matter what i do , i feel unable to hold conversations further than saying hi an how are you , i avoid people i used to call friends , i talk only to my mother who cooks me meals and i wash up every day , its difficult for her , i speak only when spoken too , i feel beyond down about all this , i feel totally debilitated and it feels so much worse than my previous depressions (3 of them where i felt rubbish but didn't lose the ability to talk /feel/think/ feel sad etc ' it feels like i have severe brain damage or something its very hard to find the right words , feel like ending my life , 

anyone know what this is i'm experiencing? a lifetime of this would just be a form of torture, the doctors and psychiatrists say possible bi polar , but this feels so different to the depressions i've had in the past and is far far worse than anything ive ever experienced... its been 6 months now .... anyone with bi polar or anything experienced this ? sorry that this went on  and on.... any ideas what this could be ? can it be sorted out? many thanks , doctors seem unsure so i try to find hope here."
1232,"it's official as of two days ago, I'm diagnosed with bipolar type 1 with psychotic features... I'm honestly scared of the stigma behind bipolar. Who else has been violent with bipolar? If I smoke weed I become violent, or if I have Lexapro or citalopram... it scares me so much I don't want to hurt anyone or worse... I'm medicated but scared. My psychologist said it's unlikely to be violent without the use of drugs with mania. On lexepro, I went into such back mania with hallucinations that I tired killing myself and my boyfriend and went to jail, thats how we found out im bipolar... I also have OCD and anxiety and Im SO panicked about the idea of ""blacking out and killing someone"" Im so afraid of the lack of control. I stopped smoking, no more anti depressants and Im on Depakote now.. Im meditating daily.. I feel like an abusive girlfriend. When manic I attacked my bf daily for 3 months, Id beg my therapist to help me, they wouldnt I was so scared, and still am even though Im better. I hit him the other day, first time in 6 months since going to jail, Im terrified the cycle is starting again... I wanna scream"
1233,"Hi I am 42 and for most of my days I've experienced bouts if depression and anxiety. For last 15 years I have been on 6 different antidepressants and none have really touched my depression and anxiety which come and goes. When I feel ""normal"" I feel really good and positive then comes anxious thoughts and bouts of depression that lasts a few weeks or more then comes my good mood again. I am now curious after speaking to someone who was the same and diagnosed bipolar 2 that maybe this could be my issue rather than the depression. I am due to see a psychiatrist next week regarding my neds and wonder if should highlight this to her about possibility of BP2. Does it sound like I could have it or am I just searching for answers?"
1234,I have bipolar disorder and am in hypomania. I just feel so damn alone and just need someone to listen. my mind feels like it never shuts off its always thinking and then overthinking.I dont have any real friends because im terrible at making and keeping friends. I constantly feel like a screw up and I have gotten to the point that I think it would be better if I just become a recluse and stay at home in bed where I cant upset anyone and I dont have to interact with anyone !!! I just need somebody to listen I feel like this is my last ditch effort !!!
1235,"Does anyone have this issue with their sleep during mania where their eyes are so heavy and sore from lack of sleep, but you just can’t get yourself to sleep? 
Like you can feel the exhaustion and your eyes burn and feel puffy, but you lay in bed for HOURS and before you know it, it’s 7AM and you’re ready to start the day with eyes that sting all day? 

I’ll get so exhausted through the day sometimes, but nothing shuts off and as much as i want to sleep, I just CAN’T. I can close my eyes through the day to ‘rest’ them for a few minutes, but I can never get to sleep. I’ve been in bed tonight for the past 4 hours and NOTHING. I’ve grown an obsession with soap and basket weaving and watched countless videos on them. 
My eyes hurt so much and it feels like I can sleep. But I close my eyes and I’m suddenly wide awake and need to open my eyes — and then they start burning again. I’m so frustrated. This is ridiculous"
1236,"I have been living this rollacoaster ride, thinking it was normal to sleep for 4-5 hours a night for weeks and then 'catch up' by sleeping 18 hours for a few days ...feel full of energy and enthusiasm for everything and then feel a wave of despair and sleep a week in bed questioning reality and the existenial meanings of life ...

In my worst moments I've tried to fight the emptiness with anything that would bring back the high ... Drink, drugs, anything for an rush or high to stop plunging into the void ...

This cycle has been very self destructive.... But I'm now thinking I have a better understanding of myself and the waves and how to ride them out without the chaos ...

I have some PTSD symptoms and I'm coping with anxiety and depression at the moment, could all of the above just be those things ? 

So I just wondered does it sound like bipolar II, and when did you know you feel like this and how long did it take to get a clear diagnosis ?

Thanks for reading and any insight would be great thanks x"
1237,"When I feel super happy and I want to start eating better, going to the gym and taking care of myself, find religion/god/spirituality, I can't tell if Im just manic. I can't keep up with it, it comes in cycles with depression. I will start doing all these great things and get motivation and then it only lasts 2 or 3 weeks and become depressed and it all stops. I feel motivated again, but I don't even want to try and better myself with a diet and working out and hobbies if it's only manic and it's just going to go away in a few weeks. Im also experiencing heightened anger, violent behavior, and impulsive shopping. I desperately want to just stick to a healthy routine, I want to find a religion, lose weight, stay invested in hobbies and eat well but it only happens in cycles."
1238,"I saw my therapist on wednesday who spent the entire 60 minutes trying to get me to realise I'm 'vulnerable' and 'need treatment' because of things i told her I've been doing and about the bird cameras. She called my doctor's surgery and made me promise to get an appointment asap before my scheduled one (this coming thursday). i saw a different doctor to my normal one the following day after therapy and spent 20 minutes with her rambling about things. i don't even remember the appointment that well. i never speak to my own family, never mind a complete stranger (which she was i'd never saw her before). but i had no problem talking to this doc 

She made me an appointment to see her and a CPN on the 16th (so less than a 2 week wait since that initial app. with her). I also see my therpaist this wednesday and my regular doctor this thursday. it's just so many appointments. i feel like it's all a waste of time. i feel fine, i think I was overreacting the other week and i'm okay. There's nothing wrong with me. I think. i don't know anymore

I can't sleep. my mum is getting angry with me, too. it's been over 2 weeks since i started feeling like this. Stringing these sentences together has been difficult, lots of deleting of random unnecessary sentences and words. I'm in the midst of planning 2 books right now. I'm struggling with punctuation because i'm typing too quick to remember but it's still a great idea to write these books. one will be a collection of short stories and the other has robots in it. it'll be fantastic. 

i want to bake cakes. i've baked dozens of cakes for the last couple of weeks but this time it'll be entirely from scratch. i also have a new business idea involving fossils, i could make a start on that tonight. :LOL: It's 1am at the minute and everyone's in bed so I'm trying to resist the urge to karaoke and put on a Marvel film (i will reenact the entire film loudly from start to finish). I think i'll settle on baking. I'm also 50/50 on whether to sign up to a dating site. i went to download one yesterday specifically to hook up with someone, but alas periods. :scratch:

I don't want to see this CPN next week. i don't want to waste her time and i feel like I'm going to. I don't know what to do about it. I'd much rather not see her but i don't think I can cancel it. i don't know :BLAH:"
1239,"Hypomania hangover. Do you know what I mean? I came up with that term long time ago because it describes it so well how you feel after hypomania. I don't mean crashing down but the moment you realise hypomania is over. 

You feel stupid and empty. All the colors have suddenly faded. You don't know what to do because the news feed of your mind is empty. Yes, empty, not a single idea what to do next. So you stand in the middle of your living room and wonder what just happened? Where did all that energy go? How can it just disappear? You feel tired and heavy. Crushed over by a manic wave. 

Anybody feel me on this? This is where I am at the moment."
1240,"I have a few friends who have pretty much since my last episode when my marriage ended who pretty much told me to get over it and told me to piss off.
I feel an urge to let these few people know that their behaviour is disgusting. That I want to write them a letter especially my so called cousin by marriage 'Amanda' she calls herself a Christian ummm...interesting.
Its sad as because of her my lovely cousin 'Jason' almost killed himself because of her. And then me who spent so much of my time wasted on her. I gave her so much of my money taking her son 'Lucas' (not their real names) every where I took them places, all my energy and time even though I didn't really have it to give.
I was warned about her from my Nana but I decided to ignore her words.
But anyway should I write a letter or is it just another waste of my time and energy"
1241,"Mine are bigfoot, missing ppl cases from national parks and zombie apocalyptic situations.
What are yours?"
1242,"Hi everybody and thank you for reading. 

I am diagnozed with bipolar disorder type ll. However doctors now think it's type l because my symptoms are so severe. I haven't got almost any symptom free periods in my life. This rollercoaster ride seem to be non-stop and the ride's been on for over 20 years. I am now 34 years old so do the count. 

I was misdiagnozed for unipolar depression a long time. I only got this diagnosis in 2017. Since then I've riden so many laps on this rollercoaster ride that I feel nauseous. 

I've been hospitalized twice during the past five months. Both time I stayed in six weeks. I also was week in a hospital in summer. Now I am sort of balanced but I've got lot of good energy. During my latest stay in a hospital my depression turned into hypomania overnight. It happens every time. 

Now I am literally standing on my toes. I am constantly analysing my mood and waiting for a crash. I can't trust this stable mood to continue. I can't trust something good could happen to me. 

Is there anyone whose illness is similar to mine? Episodes changing fast and often? How long it takes to establish a stable and symptom free life?"
1243,"I guess I am being reckless. But I have been on 900mgs of quetiapine for many years, the thing is if I wake up in the night I am non-functioning I am like a zombie I cant move my body to even get out of bed. At a friends house and I was talking in my sleep so she was concerned checked up on me she couldnt wake me up she said all she got was my eyeballs rolling back in my head. I was in hospital a while back and someone came in my room I was awake but I couldnt even talk. Feel like I am over-sedated. So I have decided to halve my nightly dose. I  am actually doing ok. I have woken up in the middle of the night wanting to go too the loo and I havnt made it. Do others feel like me. I mean when I actually do wake up after my sleep I feel fine its just I cant get out of  my quetiapine induced sleep whilst it has its effects on me"
1244,"It's kind of a sobering thought in some ways, I think to myself, if it came down to abandoning ship and there's one life boat and only room for one more person, do you save me, the bipolar guy who is a bachelor, doesn't have any kids and is pretty much lazy and good for nothing or do you save pretty much ANYONE and EVERYONE else before that? 

The clear, rational answer seems to be that I ought to be the last one saved in any situation. Pretty much anyone and everyone else in society is more important and critical to society than I am. Same when it comes to pretty women, I look but I don't touch. I know the pretty ones are for the firefighters, soldiers and pretty much anyone else but my worthless ass. 

I'm a couch potato, a failure and the lowest common denominator. Why do I even take up space on this planet? Some younger person with much more vitality and a better future would better use my space. But I take my space out of selfishness. I feel like I should give it up, but I won't. I won't because I'm selfish."
1245,"I do not understand why/how my depressive episodes hit so intensely. I can handle life, I can handle my responsibilities, I can handle juggling relationships and work. Even though I will feel fine, it slowly creeps up and pulls me down so quietly I don’t have time to fight. I haven’t been able to sleep because of this feeling of dread and depersonalization. I haven’t been able to show joy in my relationship that I am very much happy in because this voice (negative conscience) is just telling me that our relationship will not work out (we’re getting married soon). My depression has a way of tearing apart my foundations and rooting in the decay it leaves behind. I am truly tired of the fight."
1246,"It's that time of a year when my brain is putting me on alarm mode. I thought this year would be different because ECT helped big time with my anxiety. However anxiety is coming back. And if anxiety is coming back I know depression will come back too. 

How do you guys experience anxiety and how do you cope? My anxiety is based on false fear but my brain think the threat is real because it's learned to react that way due to previous events in my past."
1247,"I've just discovered that I'm pregnant. I have been medication  free for a year. But I have been""well"" (symptom free) for three years. Everything is going really well in my life, I am pro life, so of course I'm going to welcome this child into my family.
But, there is always a risk of another episode, I'm not dwelling on that, but I know it is a very real possibility."
1248,"So after a working diagnosis of borderline personality and detachment disorder its official I have bipolar type 2. 
Thing is Im off the Martizipane....that caused two back to back insane manias. Off the promethazine as that did nothing for my anger and rage and am left with quetiapine for my mood stabilizing and anxiety......its doing nothing for either and my mood is solo low after the mania.
Wtf am I supposed to do until I see him again in 3 wks. ......"
1249,"I don't know how to cope. I have become physically violent, I don't respond well to medication it is what made me have my first ever manic episode and violent behaviors. when I came off meds everything seemed fine and then the other day I self-harmed and hit my boyfriend in rage. I also have OCD so I'm having tons of intrusive thoughts and ""what ifs"" ""what if I kill him"" has been the worst and hardest I'm breaking down mentally."

Feeling very anxious and the longer it goes on the more risky I start to feel.
To make it worse I started a new job this week and I am struggling!😳😳😳😳"
1251,"Does anyone have rapid cycling with bi polar or depression.?

I have been treated for clinical depression and anxiety for many 
years.

I saw a final report from a clinical psychologist in the ‘90s.
This included rapid cycling.
My moods can change daily and sometimes several times in one
day.
Nobody haas mentioned bipolar.

Information or advice would be greatly appreciated."
1252,"My life is such a disgraceful mess. I feel like no one can possibly understand me. I'm my own unique disgrace, living in a world of isolation which I can't share or discuss in detail with anyone. I'm ignorant, always jumping to the wrong conclusions about things, thinking I know or understand things that I don't, out of touch with others around me, always the last to know anything and overall I feel like the village idiot. There's one in every village and I seem to be the one in mine. I hate me. I hate my life. I'm an embarrassment to myself and everyone around me."
1253,"I saw my doctor last Thursday. I probably shouldn’t have tried toning down my mood and things but I didn’t want to prove my mum right about me having another episode. i did mention to my doc that my mum thinks Im having one, to which she replied with ‘why’. I only mentioned a couple things. Mostly just the spending and not sleeping. And my doc said it’s not my mental heath because i “have insight and can talk about it.” :confused: 

I went into detail about my hypersexuality and how bad it is and i told her Id hurt myself accidentally *down there*. To which she gave me a prescription for sudocream and told me to take a baking class (I ranted about baking at 1am) to meet someone. She knows I’m terrified of making friends, never mind dating??
My doc is usually really good (she was the second person i told about my abuse) but I feel she quickly brushed it off. 

My sleeping is now down to 5 hours at most. Last night I fell asleep around 1AM (after baking cakes ofc) and i woke up at 5AM this morning. It’s 6AM and I’m washed, dressed, got makeup on and Im ready to go get a coffee. :tea: My college has really suffered. So has my voluntary work (which is a requirement for my course). I didn’t go in last week. I was writing down all my ideas and needed to go out shopping. I’m making a Pom Pom rug now which is pretty fantastic. I probably have about 11 pieces of work due in this Thursday and Ive done 2 of them. :colours: I’m supposed to be going to college today but i have so much energy i want to go to the museum. 

I’m so pissed with my doc. Ok yeah, i hid most of my symptoms. But I told her about some. At the very least she should be concerned about the hypersexuality because im so freaked out over anything sexual usually, but yet im more than ready to climb some guy like a tree while I’m in the middle of eating with my family. Maybe im just overreacting. She makes me feel like I’m overreacting. My mum’s completely done with me she doesn’t know what to do with me anymore

I see my doc again next week so i think maybe i should tell her what the hospital said last year about me going there if a suspected episode is happening. But I’ll probably hook up with someone by then and ruin my recovery. Oh man i don’t know. I see my trauma therapist tomorrow but I’ll probably try to cover up my symptoms. Tomorrow also marks the 2 year anniversary of my rape in 2017 (which happened when I was having an episode like this,, but more severe)."
1254,Has anyone ever been misdiagnosed? I was misdiagnosed in my early 20s with schizoaffective disorder. And years later with a different psychiatrists. I had Neuropsychological testing less than a year ago. And I was re diagnosed as bipolar 1 disorder sometimes with psychosis. But most of my medications stayed the same. With the exception of one new medication especially for bipolar mania.
1255,"Hi I'm new to this, but I wanted to share my story as I'm struggling with the end result now myself.
I met a Spanish girl and we hit it off immediately, a worldwind romance, booked a holiday together on our first date, very quickly moved in together. We both had very good jobs and had an apartment in Smithfield. 

Early on she hesitantly told me that she had previously dealt with depression and anxiety and took medication for it. She suffered with a chemical imbalance carried down by her mother. I had never dealt with or experienced anything like this before but I immediately told her that it wouldn't be a problem for us and I'd support her no matter what. So after 1 year together with zero issues, on New Years 2018 I decided to propose, which I did and she said yes. We're both mid-thirties so while it was quick, we were both in a position where we knew what we wanted. 

Shortly after this due to her feeling very happy and well she contacted her doctors in Spain and they decided to slowly reduce her medication. After one week of gradually reducing her medication the problems began to start. So upon noticing this she gradually returned back to her normal dosage. 

Unfortunately, this didn't help and despite my attempts to help she fell deeper and deeper into a hole. She went sick from work and would spend most days crying. It was very difficult for me to leave her to go to work. I would come home to her crying. I would have to leave early and run home when I couldn't contact her due to her expressing her desire to end her life. Eventually her father came over from Spain, stayed for a week and then took back to Spain with him. 

For 5 months I stayed in the apartment alone while we decided what was happening next. And then it was decided she would be more comfortable in Spain. So as she was feeling better she got a job in Madrid. (Shes from Alicante) I was to move to Spain and we would try to make a life there. I took a TEFL course to teach English and had been taking Spanish lessons. I left my good job in the bank and I organised everything we own to be shipped over to our new apartment in Madrid. I arrived and started Spanish class until I received my PPI equivalent. 

While she was working her confidence still wasn't at 100% but she seemed ok and more positive. I had traveled to Madrid 3 weeks previous to arriving for good to check out the area and the apt. Unknown to us we had gotten pregnant. 3 weeks later we took the test and it was positive. So her docs had her stop all medication and then problems started again. Same thing as before going deeper and deeper into a hole, crying all day, wanting to kill herself. I wasn't working now so I'd get her up, dressed, wash her, feed her while trying my best to reassure her everything would be fine. 

Eventually she left Madrid and went to her family home. I again had to organise the shipment of all our possessions from Madrid to Alicante. I arrived in Alicante and for 3 months looked after her there. Doing everything as before. Getting her up, having to dress her, drag her out for a walk everyday which she'd be thankful for afterwards. Every single day she'd have at least 1 hysterical crying fit. Her anxiety would nearly have her crippling over. Very hard to see. 

During this 3 months her feelings towards her family and myself changed. She loved no one she said. Said she didn't love me anymore and I should leave. At the time, she was so down, crying, hysterical and throwing tantrums, that while it was hard to hear from her I dismissed it as the illness and that she would feel differently when she was feeling better. 

The medication and therapy wasn't helping and a decision was made for her to have Electroshock treatment and to abort the baby. So on the day we were to find out the gender we instead had an abortion. Then a few weeks later had the first ECT treatment.

Amazingly the ECT immediately showed positive signs. And further ECT's pulled right out of the hole she was in. She was then diagnosed as Bipolar type 2. She went from the lowest low to wanting to everything all of the time. Driving lessons, gym, out with friends. This was a relief to witness. 

It was hard enough for me to get a job as an English speaker in Madrid and so near impossible in Orihuela in Alicante. We made a decision that I would return to Dublin and I could get my job back. I went with the impression she'd follow when she was feeling a little better. 

Instead, in the nicest way possible she broke up with me. I can't even be mad at her as she is the most likable person I've ever met. I can't go to Spain and she won't come to Dublin as she is afraid to leave her doctors.

I've been in relationships before that ended for some reason but never have I been engaged or had children so for the relationship to end this way is heartbreaking. I just feel I gave everything, did everything I could and went further than most might have. I'm finding it very difficult to accept and I don't think I ever would but I have been having suicidal thought myself hence me writing here. I'm not sure this is even the right place I should be writing this. 

So I still speak to her everyday and she still tells me she loves me which as you can imagine is hard to hear. I feel like she's put my life in reverse. I know I should keep active but I have zero drive, I don't want to do anything. It's another month before I start back in my job. 

In the meantime she's bought a new car, starting a new job in 2 weeks and it feels like she can so easily move on from this like it was nothing.

I don't even know what I'm expecting from this. 

Thanks in advance :)"
1256,"So I was with my psychiatrist on Monday and came out feeling exhausted.
On Wednesday I wake to an explosive manic episode.
Must have slept about 4hrs across 4 days....my eyes were so painful and swollen....but as usual I felt amazing.
Rode the wave hard and enjoyed it as I usually do....makeup and hair were amazing.
Have woken today to a hard brickwall of nothingness.
Here I am as low as can be.....so am interested to know....how long do your manias last and do you always feel them coming??"
1257,"I was diagnosed bipolar II as an adolescent and have been attending therapy/psychiatry on and off since around age 7.
I'm fairly easy to provoke based on my mental state (obviously?) But for some reason when Im provoked and just mentally exhausted from a long day I get violently overwhelming urges to self destruct.  I'll get a tidal wave of heat and energy and anger swelling through my limbs and racing images of all the possible ways I could lose it on myself, like I want to fight me. Just today I got this way and within about five seconds of feeling reactive to what was said to me I found myself self harming. Luckily I have tomorrow off and won't have to answer any questions about it. But I just can't seem to stop myself in these moments. I try to take care of myself as best I can yet it sees that my subconscious wants to destroy me?
Does any else out there relate to this? And if so what ways have you found to be successful in stopping these incidents?"
1258,"I don't know anymore. I've never had a serious relationship with a woman. I've never really known what love was or been able to feel the emotion as far as I can tell, even in my own family environment with my parents. I want to think that I have had a rough life, but then part of me says, I grew up in a first world country, never in dire want of anything in my life such as food or shelter in the way that many people in poorer countries experience. Have I had an easy, ""privileged"" life, and therefore deserve some hard knocks or have I had my licks and therefore deserve some good fortune for a change? It's like I don't even know what to think about my life. I want to complain but I feel like I should be thankful instead. I'm 51 and bipolar, I've lived with bipolar disorder since I was 24years old. I've always been lonely. I've been miserable at times. And I feel like I've had a it easy in life. It's like I can't even win when it comes to a complaining contest. I can't even have that much in life. Yet I have so much that I have more than others."
1259,"So I haven't been to a psychiatrist in about 3.5 years. I was actually in partial hospitalization then but then I moved out of town and didn't have any more follow up treatment. I have only had one manic episode that lasted around 3 months since then, but my depression has been steadily getting worse over the last 2 years. I'm to the point now where I can't even concentrate enough to read and it's starting to effect my job, let alone unable to get things done around the house. I had my first appointment with my psychiatrist almost a week ago and she put me on Lamictal (which I've been on before). The thing is, just the act of getting back on medication has made my anxiety spike and I'm afraid it's acting like a trigger. It's bringing up a lot of memories that I don't want to think about from some of the worst times in my life. I can feel myself falling into more of a mixed episode because I tend to focus obsessively on one or two things (categories of interest) and I do a ton of research (surprisingly I can do this for hours on end yet can't pick up a book for pleasure? :mad:) Is this a situation where I should call my doctor? I'm scared it might turn into hypomania or full-on mania. I've only been married for a little over a year and my husband has never experienced an episode. I've never really been able to even discuss what happens when I'm manic for fear of him judging me. He's my safe harbor and he makes me so much more stable. I think that's really the only reason I had been more even keeled for so long. Any advice or suggestions would be amazing."
1260,"I am never manic, possibly hypomanic but for only one month or so, just 3 times this past year.  I have suicidal thoughts, there seems to be no hope.  My depressions are so long and bad I feel that when I don't feel depressed I am very happy about it (hypomanic?).  I definitely am more social as I am not at all when depressed.  It only lasts a month.  I feel like myself, my husband is so happy, and then back down. 
 
I am diagnosed as MDD with GAD.  Could it be bipolar if I am only well such a small amount of the time?  At least this past year.  Could be getting older makes things worse.  I am 69."
1261,"You know how they teach you about your early warning signs, I've been waking up early, but that's because I go to bed really early, but it used to be one of my early warning signs.

Everything else is going ok in my life. I mainly have to get up to use the bathroom at night. No other symptoms.

Tell me, would you be concerned or do you think it is normal?"
1262,"Greetings and salutations!
Okay so last year I went for an assessment (for over 2 hours??) and the doctor ended up saying they'll wait for me to have another (hypo?)manic episode before diagnosing me because I have a lot going on with my PTSD. Now I think I've just started another episode - it's day 5 now. But I don't know if I'm just overreacting or whatever. 

Yeah, I tick literally every box already. But I don't know if it's severe enough to see my GP over it for another referral. Last time there wasn't impulse buying, but now there is and it's kind of getting worse each day. I signed up to online catalogs and ordered a bunch of stuff on there and I've almost got credit cards 4 times in the last 3 days (my mum had to physically take my laptop away). Probably the most ridiculous thing I've bought so far is an interactive Edna Mode doll because I needed it (I'm 20 jesus christ but it's so great). I'm struggling with money so bad right now and I'm just buying dolls and candles and other junk - which isn't junk when I have to buy it? 

I can handle all my symptoms, I quite like this mood. But the issue I have is the absolutely insane hypersexuality. Okay it's going to get real deep now but last time i had an episode i ended up getting r*ped pretty violently. Wow Im now a debbie downer in my own post nice going Spence. So I have PTSD from that and severe childhood sexual abuse, plus a lot of other incidents of sexual assault/abuse as I grew up. Any other time I'm like a walking poster ad for sex aversion. I'm terrified of holding hands, never mind anything beyond that. But I've spent the last 5 days sending guys things and arranging to meet up (I didn't go. I got distracted with baking at 1AM because priorities. Amirite?). To avoid having one night stands I've been keeping myself ""busy"". A lot. :whistle: - oh lord i didn't know there were emojis until i added this one. They're so cool :boo:). 

Okay so i want to see my GP about the hypersexuality stuff because the PTSD part of my brain is telling me it's a huge no-no and I'm pretty sure if i don't see my GP then i'll end up doing something which will set me back in recovery. But i don't know what to say to her without sounding like i'm asking for a diagnosis or anything. 

I forgot the whole point of this post now. I think I was probably asking how I could speak to my GP (tomorrow maybe)? Like what I could say to her? I don't even know what I'm supposed to be telling her actually. Maybe i was asking about whether to ask for a referral for an assessment/diagnosis now? I don't know. This entire post has just gone downhill since I noticed the emojis :eek2: 
p.s this is my favourite one. Just an fyi::floggingdeadhorse:"
1263,I feel a bit shy to ask this. Does anyone else masterbate a ton while going through mania? 🤫
1264,"I open a Twitter account a few days ago and have been following along with the Michael-Jackson debate.  It didn’t take long before someone suggested he had bipolar disorder.  I decided to count how many times someone diagnosed Michael with Bipolar for a couple of days.  Five times..I didn’t give any input on the matter, but I found it very amusing. Imagine all of the posts I didn’t see since I only on twitter in the morning and a little bit in the evening. So if you didn’t know it already Ladies and Gentlemen, all of the wanna be psychiatrists on Twitter have spoken...Michael must have had bipolar disorder.  😂"
1265,"I thought maybe after been split from my ex for a year I might want to meet someone.
No, I'll backtrack a few people in my life,a couple of friends, psychologist and even support worker suggest this is a good idea.
Why do I have to have someone. 
Is anything wrong with not finding another mate.
I aren't one for one night-stands (ha,I dont think I am)
Can't I just be left to my own little world. Maybe I'm boring I am from other peoples perspective. 
If I am happy? Or contented with  having a very quiet low key life then does that mean  something's wrong with me.
I like the peace of just it being me and my dog."
1266,"I had an intake appointment today and as I described my symptoms to my therapist, she brought out a bipolar assessment sheet. 

After I finished filling it out, I told her that my mom and sister both were diagnosed with bipolar, but that I didn’t think I had it. Obviously I don’t really know that but, I sincerely don’t think it is the issue, or if it is, it is not the main problem. At the end of the day I trust the mental health professionals more than I trust my own judgment.

She understood, but also said that I meet criteria—on paper, I assume, because we also talked about how proper diagnosis may take some time. I have my next appointments scheduled so it’s just a matter of waiting. I am also going for a psychiatric evaluation.

So, yes, is there anything I can do on my part as a patient to prevent misdiagnosis? I try to be clear about my feelings and experiences and how others describe me, even though I don’t understand everything about myself."
1267,"I don't post no where near what I used too... a few personal reasons keep me away.

but im' sat alone trying to work out why? why me? why this illness?  I know no one can offer answers.

I would do anything to change this, well I say I would but I didn't.  I threw it all away.

I am so low, day after day.

:(

so lost. people care, I'm really lucky I just don't get it any more.


sorry i needed to vent."
1268,"That maybe we are the normal ones and everyone else is crazy?

Seriously, our depression is a result of us not fitting in and feeling isolated by the society. In a world of manics we would never get depressed.

How can normal be so lazy and slow? They must have problem, but since they are majority it becomes ""right"" to be like that.

If we didn't have the depression, we would be superhuman. It is an advantage to be manic but our lives are ruined because the majority of people can't keep up and therefore just lock us up and rid us to protect themselves."
1269,"Hi guys

I don't really know what I am suppose to say right now. so I'll try my best to share my story. I'm a 24 year old college student on her last semester of college. I am actually suppose to be be studying for a test that I have tomorrow, but I can't help to be depressed. I've been like this all day. I was so happy yesterday. 

I have not come to the full acceptance that I might be bi-polar or have manic depression, but a colleague suggested based on the personality changes I was experiencing I might be. She told me this last year in 2018. I never really thought much of it, but now that think about it my mother had depressive stages too. 

In October 2017,  I had a miscarriage at 5 months with my ex fiancé. I was in my Spanish class when the bleeding began. I bled and had contractions all the way home. I cried, and hours later everything was out of me. For the time being I couldn't help and sit there feeling lifeless. The next day I carried on like nothing happened. Went to work and classes. I had exams that week so i didn't give myself the time to heal. Then, my fiance and I split. I couldn't have a pity party but i remember crying myself to sleep and acting like I was fine the next day. I did that for a while until the holidays came around than I started drinking.

I drank so much within a few months my liver started having issues in March 2018. Nothing major, but when I went to go see a psychiatrist they told me to monitor and reduce my drinking. Looking back now I never allowed myself the time to heal properly. I just kept taking classes during the spring, summer, fall, and repeat.

Now, it's 2019. I'm taking 18 hours for my last semester, interviewing for jobs, and hold an executive position for a non profit at my college. You could say I am over-whelmed at times. I am noticing changes in my every day character during my depressive stage. I'm worried that will transfer into my professional life. Does anyone else have these issues at work? how do you deal with them? Is there a way you communicate to your peers when you are over whelmed? How do you keep up with the work load during the depressive stages? 

If you read this far, I appreciate you. I haven't talked to anyone in my life about my issue. Three people in my life have noticed that I might be, so any feed back you could give me is a big help.


Thanks in advance,
Rose"
1270,"TLDR: I believe I may have experienced hypomania but find it difficult to tell it apart from just feeling happy, or having BPD symptoms. How mild can hypomania be? What is it like to have both BPD and bipolar II?

My therapist is considering bipolar disorder as well as borderline personality disorder for my diagnosis.

I kind of disregarded the possibility of bipolar, as I have an intense fear of abandonment, chronic emptiness and many other symptoms of BPD that I believe affect me more than anything else. My moods can also change from moment to moment, and normally it is trigger specific. 

However, I do notice a distinct up and down that seems cyclical as well. Overflowing feelings of confidence, feeling irresistible and flirty/being hypersexual, being more sociable... it doesn’t last for long, and I basically always eventually fall into a deep depression. However, during these “episodes” there are BPD traits that remain.

I don’t know what is normal and what is not. I don’t know what is cause for concern and what is not.

I find myself anticipating something akin to a hypomanic episode, or let’s call it a “high” since I don’t know if it’s hypomania or not. I find myself feeling like it will happen again, even though I am currently in a very deep depression. 

Does anyone here suffer from both?"
1271,Hello! Looking for any insight to help. My 19 year old son is showing signs of being bipolar. He went to a psycholigist today and also his primary care provider. They both said he needs to go see a pyschiatrist although they did not diagnose him I feel that is what he will be diagnosed with. We have never been strong advocates of medication but from what I have read and heard from friends and those in the medical field that it will be an important part of him staying stable. Anyone have any good/bad experiences with medication. I know everyone responds differently but just wondering what your experiences have been with medication. Thanks for any input.
1272,"My mom died December 26th.  I'm permanently broke, I hadn't been home since 1994.  I never really called, just rarely.  Even now, picking up the phone and calling is something I can't make myself do, and I don't know why.  Maybe because I can hear the aging in everyone's voice and it's something I never wanted to face, I don't know.  But she died, I couldn't go home either before or after because I had no money, and she had to content herself with knowing that we were thinking of each other often before she died.

During this time I lost my doctor.  He quit the practice.  I found a new doctor, but (US shitty system) my insurance company was changing the next month and that doctor didn't take that insurance.  Another doctor in the practice does, but that appointment is in early April, so I haven't seen that person yet.  I really don't have a doctor I can easily reach out to as I have no established relationship yet.

I got an early retirement disbursement unexpectedly, so I have some money set aside now.  I got all my bills caught up, and I was able to buy a car.  A car means that I can actually go places, rather than having to rely on paid transportation, which means never being able to afford to go places.  I had it two weeks and it had a mechanical problem, so into the shop.  I had to constantly call and sometimes just unexpectedly walk in for an entire week before the place I bought the car from would get me a rental while they fix my car.

After I got the bills caught up and put the rest of the money aside, my husband hit me up with two $400 medical bills this month.  Not one, two.  I did not want to touch savings, so I've had the financial stress of trying to absorb $800 of unexpected bills.

A car means a better paying job, so I started applying, only got one response.  And didn't get the job.  And then job hunting crashed and burned big time because no car again.  Emotional roller coaster up, and then right back down.  Apartment hunting also got majorly delayed, I have until the end of the month to decide whether we are staying in this dump another year or not, couldn't go looking.

I kept getting into verbal altercations on an online game I'm on.  My memory is poor in general, but now it's non-existent.  I'm tired all the time.  I put the clues together two days ago, that I'm not just being reasonably irritable and ADHD brain and overworked.  The stress up and down and up and down has taken its toll, and I probably need a medication adjustment.  But self-evaluation, I'm not in crisis mode, I can safely wait until my early April appointment.  I'll be okay.

And then.....a few hours after making that self-assessment, I got a text from my dad.  My grandmother, my last living grandparent, is in the hospital.  He sounded calm and nonchalant, which from him means nothing as he's good at not showing emotion, but the particulars sounded scary.  Could be okay, could be very bad.  This is his mother, and he just buried a wife of 45 years, and now he has to deal with this.  And it seems that my gut instinct is right, today he said the doctor told him they may have to discuss hospice arrangements in the next day or two.

I've got a bit of money, I'm using it.  I already planned on using some of it for my mother's memorial.  But there's so much to do.  I've never had to drop everything and go to the other side of the country immediately before.  I've got to see if work will drop me from the schedule, but I gotta get hold of HR and she was sick today.  The store manager was sympathetic, but HR has to approve it.  I've got to figure out travel websites to get a plane ticket, hotel and rental car.  I've got to find a way to physically travel to the airport.  I've got to figure out current airline regulations and what I can and cannot take with me.  I've got to see if my daughter can get time off her job too, because they haven't seen her since she was 9 months old and if I couldn't grant my mother's wish to see her, I want to grant my grandmother's and my father's wishes.  I've got a million little details all tied up with packing (What do I do about a computer?  How do I manage to wash clothes mid-week?  What are we going to eat while over there?)  My memory is so poor that until my husband said something I had completely overlooked our need for food while over there.

My husband heard me considering potential dates, based on what work allows, and he said ""I'm going to be alone for a week?""  He works crazy hours so I've been shouldering most of the running of the household.  His hours aren't going down that week, so I have to do something about that.  TV dinners likely in the freezer, easy laundry and cleanup stuff.  But I can't think of what all the house needs to keep running.  He's diabetic and has been dealing with a foot infection, I've been changing the dressing twice daily, but he'll have to take care of his own bandaging while I'm gone and I'll have to teach him how before I leave.

This has just put my brain into overdrive.  I'm forgetting things as soon as I take my eyes and hands off of the triggering object.  I'm crying.  I'm too excited when things go right, too angry when they don't.  I've got so much to do, but the longer I wait, the more chance I'll be arriving to a corpse.  And if I wait too long, I won't be back in time for my psych appointment, and I HAVE to be back for that.  I can't move it up because I have to go out there, it will be very hard for me to live with myself if I don't.  I got a call about my car today, it'll probably be ready the day I want to leave, so I gotta sort getting it and returning the rental.  Flight prices, I can't really afford to fly on a Friday through Sunday, so it's either pull a miracle off for Thursday or wait until Tuesday, which might be too late.

I'm tired.  I'm scared.  I'm sad.  I'm overwhelmed.  I'm stressed out.  I just want someone to come in and make it all better for me, someone who can tell me where and when to show up, so that I just have to give my hugs, say my goodbyes and I don't have to think about anything except the important stuff.

I will be very glad when my doctor's appointment arrives.  I really, really need it.  I just have to make it from today to that appointment with all this mess resolved in a way that I can accept.  I just don't know how to do it and stay stable enough to function in the process."
1273,"So I've been battling depression for as long as I remember.  Currently on wellbutrin but things have continued to fall apart. My wife has been extremely patient in trying to help me and has been looking into the possibility of me being bipolar.  I've been listening to podcasts, watching videos, and looking into it a lot and it seems fitting.
A little about me,  I'm 30yr old male, self employed for about 3 years. My business does well, but I go back and forth from thinking its going to be extremely profitable to ready to give it up.  Recently I've been having days where I'll literally sit on my computer watching conspiracy theory videos on YouTube. Then the next day I'll spend the entire day working hard, ready to turn everything around.  Mixed in with a night's of heavy drinking just to drown out everything until I pass out.  My anger has gotten way worse too but it's usually general self loathing with spikes of extreme and that usually leads to me breaking things or punching holes in walls.
I've tried a few times to end my marriage,  convincing myself I can never make her happy and she'd be better off without me but she refuses to give up.  The biggest issue lately has been the argument of kids,  I want to want to make a happy life together but I just can't see it.  I'm constantly leaving my wife confused and frustrated because I go from needing to be the life of the party, texting anyone in my phone I can think of - to wanted to stay home alone, shut away from even her.  I never seem to think about the big purchases I make, as soon as it's something I decide I need to get, I've already bought it.  I can get so caught up at work I'll go until early morning, until my body just passes out from exhaustion or I drink until I can fall asleep.  Once in a while the paranoia kicks in ( I try not to tell her because it sounds crazy to even me) .  Once I looked around our house for like an hour thinking she had hid cameras in the lights or something to spy on me while she's not home.

I'm not sure what to think of everything,  I've been trying to get into a psychiatrist but it's taking forever.  I've met with regular therapists a few times and nothing ever comes of it. I think everything sort of makes sense with bipolar II maybe?  I don't seem to experience quite as much mania, but maybe hypomania? Maybe it's something completely different and I'm just making it fit to try and make sense of it.

As people who know more about it all do you think it fits? I'm hoping to get into a psychiatrist this week but I needed to talk to someone until then."
1274,My Dad and sister have bipolar disorder. Were they born this way?  Could I develop bipolar or would I have already had signs of the disorder?
1275,"So I've been rather manic for the past few months but in a good way. I've got to know this guy whos been good to me (dosen't know i'm crazZY) but now my stupidly bad depressions hitting like a ton of bricks and got me questioning the relationship and if he likes me anymore. All he said was I don't know how to respond. I guess this is just it then, the crazy hits again and drives everything good away. I really really hate my damn life. I cant keep friends or anything, my whole life."
1276,"because i can relate to it so much heres my story

when she says ""Do you see me? Do you see?"", people saw me yes, but with disgust, ""Do you like me?"", no one liked me, the only ones that did were my family, ""Does anyone care?"", again no one but my family, ""Unhappiness"" all the time, i had a friend in elementary, in middle school i said hi, what did she do? walked right past me and i was upset all the time, not because of her, i had no friends i tried to talk to people but my social anxiety kicked in so i was basically an outcast, then along came depression, they had this counslor from somewhere to see me, i thought i must be crazy, i don't know, had her until i got to high school, so back to middle school, i was in a deep deep depression, and i started hurting myself, my teachers were noticing which i wasn't expecting, i tried to hide it, so one teacher told someone so i got tested and they diagnosed me with depression, and bipolar, and they were saying my brain was unbalanced, so i was put on medication, my family was surprised because i never did this at home, its because i didn't show them what i was feeling, one time i did self harm at home but they didn't notice, i still have the scars, i tried to commit suicide another couple of times, but i failed, then came high school, i was put in this focus program, i was showing signs of suicidal actions and thoughts, then came the time i tried to kill myself again, they caught me in time, and that one time they sent me to a facility, it was horrible but of course it was my fault, i didn't know but they drugged me heavily, it was bad, got out in two weeks, the people there thought i was on the spectrum but i wasn't, and my doctor wanted me to get tested like a mental assement, and i have mmr,. ""my father, my father"" not in a happy way, because i found out when i was 18, that the guy my mom is with wasn't my dad,..my dad, sighs, did something bad to a little girl it wasn't me, hes been in prison i dont know if hes out..i really don't care, thats my story and hers its sad to hear, and r.i.p, sorry about my grammar i also have a learning disablily"
1277,"hi all 
i have recently been diagnosed with pychotic depression i think its also called depressive disorder.im not sure how he diagnosed me with this as i was only in there 30 minutes and he didnt exactly ask me many quistions.I suffer from manic episodes also.is this diagnose simular to bipola and is it a long term illness what i suffer with.much help needed thank you"
1278,"I've been working on getting my medication properly evened out for the past 11 years, as I have Bipolar 1. I'm on a lot of meds. Like a lot. Last stay in the psych ward (there have been 6 stays so far) I was on the most in my unit. Not very proud of it. However I've made a LOT of headway! Only thing is, my manic spells have been almost brought to a hault. I don't even remember the last time I've gone fully manic. My doctor sees this as a great feat! But now I'm just left with the crippling depression. I'd rather be manic then depressed any day, yet my doctor seems perfectly happy to keep me depressed as long as I stay away from mania. I miss my mania!"
1279,"I have bipolar 1 but this is about the major depressive side. I also posted this on the depression board. Looking for as much info as possible!

I went to my doctor today to put my foot down, because we've pretty much cleared me of anxiety and manic episodes, but the depression was just as bad. I've been sinking in the black hole for a while now and I couldn't take it. My doctor gave me this bullshit shpeil about how ""everything you're on should have taken care of that"" and insinuated that I'm just unhappy. Now this is where I'd like to divulge that I AM A PSYCH MAJOR. I LITERALLY STUDY DEPRESSION. I KNOW WHAT IS AND ISN'T DEPRESSION.

Long story short, he decided there was one thing we could try. It's a new drug called Rexulti. It's an add on so I'm still on my current anti-depressant. It's an atypical antipsychotic. Thing is, he said, the results so far seem positive, but its still so new, their still researching it and have absolutely no idea about long term effects. I will be the very first patient that he tries this drug on, and basically an experiment. I will be reporting to him much more frequently to monitor results. I've read a lot of personal reviews of this drug, and a lot of them are SUPER positive! BUT the main reasons some aren't are either, it didnt work for them (always a posibility), it made them gain a ridiculous amount of weight (Any anti-psychotic will do that, including the one I'm already on), and heres the kicker, onset of seizures, mostly grand mal. I have a history of absence siezures with the occasional grand mal, but I've been MOSTLY siezure free since starting dilantin. I'm worried aboutthat. I'm also worried in general since since so little is known.

My main question is, anybody know anything about this drug? Thank you!:D


P.s. for those keeping count, that ups my meds to klonopin, effexor, seroquil 50mg, seroquil 300mg, dilantin, and now rexulti. I'm only 23 god help me when I'm old."
1280,"Hello I’m new here, I’m 26yrs old and my mother has had bipolar since she was a teen so I’ve experienced her illness my whole life, from her going completely psychotic to deeply depressed and being in and out of mental health units. 
I have recently got my own home, I have a 6year old daughter and am currently 31weeks pregnant. I still see my mum on a daily basis and help with cleaning, cooking, shopping, appointments ect... I’ve always been very supportive of her. However one of the problems I’m having is that she kicks off when I want to go home and guilt trips me into staying at her house, she doesn’t manage her money well so then she lives off me, which to be quite honest with I can’t afford to do, when I mention it she gets angry with me and throws in my face how she brought me up, but I then struggle to pay my own bills and do what I need to do because she thinks she’s entitled to every penny I get. At the moment she isn’t well, which is very stressful for me being so heavily pregnant. With all the cut backs to the NHS I’m finding it difficult to get any support and just don’t know what to do anymore. I’d never cut her off, but I don’t know what to do about her being so possessive and controlling over me as well as her spending all my money. I have a partner, we don’t live together as of yet and all she does is put him down when he tries to help me as much as he can. Sorry for the long post and moaning, I just don’t know where to turn to anymore ☹️"
1281,"Ok I'm supposed to be moving with my boyfriend of almost a year and a half. And we are having bad luck regarding the move. Which is bad in itself. And it has been very discouraging. But we are looking now at other options for places to live. And we found one duplex and another apartment complex we are looking into. Here is the issue with me. I have a mother who is pretty much critical of everything I do. And I have lived with her for 35 years and have been dependent on her a lot. But now I've reached a point in my life. That I want to become fully independent. That's why I'm moving a good ways away from my family. But my mom has always treated me like a child as well. And my mind always tells me. That if she is against something, or negative on it. Then I can't do it. And it keeps me from trying sometimes. And she doesnt have much encouraging to say to me on moving. It's just always how I'm not going to make it. How I don't realize how hard it's going to be. And her latest fussing at me. Is because the place we were going to rent was going to be $600.00. And she thinks we are crazy to pay that much rent. Even though we are splitting the rent payment me and my bf. And where he lives rent is higher. So they don't have many places under $600.00 for rent. She made a suggestion that she would get us an apartment in her name. But then we would have to pay the rent. I don't want that. One I want to do it all for myself. And second she will just later use it against me. And throw it up in my face. When she tells me I don't realize all that she has done for me. So when my boyfriend mentioned this duplex to me the other day. He also sent me pictures. I shot it down immediately. Because I just kept thinking. There is no way my mom will be on board with us renting a duplex. Probably just because it's a duplex. And if I don't get what I think wants for me in renting a place out of my head. I will never find a place. My dad told me I could be moving in the white house. And she would still find something wrong with that. And something she doesn't like regarding it. And I know deep down he is right. There is no pleasing my mom. She has to many stipulations and exceptions when it comes to a place for me. I'm not going to find a perfect place that meets all her standards. And even though I'm an adult. And in the end any decisions I make are up to me. My mind still convinces me that some how she could tell me no on doing something she is against. I guess it just comes down to I let her influance my desicions way too much."
1282,"It's hard to explain ... but I'll try ... as I have understood the impulsive actions and feelings can be quite strong during mania/hypomania. That sometimes leads to sudden choices that sometimes are regretted afterwards. 

But I am wondering if these actions and feelings are the persons true feelings, that are just oppressed by social rules during normal periods?

For example ... if my boss is an idiot I want to call him an idiot. But I don't. Because I realize that wouldn't be a good thing to do. But even if I don't I still think he is an idiot....

And a bipolar person dumping partners and/or having random sex - is that what they actually would want, but stay away from until the disorder looses the barriers? Or is it something they actually do NOT want to do, but the disorder ""leads"" them into it?

I hope no one is offended, because I am truly curious."
1283,"Hi to all

My name is Dez and I been suffering with Bipolar since 17 but I think it was at a earlier age but didn't know about it.

I really need some advice as am in the middle of a PIP claim and need help how to fill out the form how my illness affects me.
Can I please ask all members who have claimed PIP in past or present for any help please.  Much appreciated."
1284,"I'm just wondering what questions or tests people have had to learn what that they had bipolar disorders? 

As it's been suggested I could have bipolar II ?"
1285,"can't see any way out.

not been this low for a long time.

if anyone has an answer?"
1286,Feel in the talkative mood but I've already pissed off most of my friends so who will even listen? And talking to myself get boring after a while;)
1287,This may not be the place for this. But I'll start off by saying I have bipolar 1 disorder and avoidant personality disorder. My boyfriend has mild autism. And I'm not even sure that's relevant at this point. But I guess it is. I've never been on my own as far as living alone/being independent. I have lived with my mom for 35 years. And all we did was fight most of the time. I didn't realize how miserable I was living with her all these years. So now I'm living with my brother. Well with in the last year and a half. I met an amazing guy. And he is definitely the one. And we have been dating long distance now since we met. He has mild autism and I feel as if it's more of a problem for him then he lets on. But anyway we are supposed to be moving in together. And I left it up to him to find us a place. So he went with his moms landlord to rent a place through. And we were supposed to be moving in February. But it got pushed back. He claimed the landlord got confused on the dates. And the man throught it was march. He is an older man almost 90. And I was upset at first about the delay. But was ok with it. Well this week the guy was supposed to get someone to fix the roof. So it would be ready for us to move in. And my bf hasn't heard anything from the landlord. And he has called him over and over. And finally he went to his house and left a note on the door the man wasn't home. And everyone in my family keeps asking me when I'm moving. And I feel so out of place at my brothers and like such a burden. And I haven't seen my bf for 5 months now. Because we knew we were moving in together. So we were waiting and saving money on making a trip to see one another. Sometimes I just worry my boyfriend is not doing all he could be doing to reach this guy. And we don't even know if the roof got fixed yet or not. Then he confesses he doesn't know the guy all that well personally but his mom does. And the only issue she has ever had with him. Is that a wall in the basement collapsed by snow last November and the landlord hasn't fixed it yet. Which makes me think the roof is probably not even fixed. But my boyfriend did say this man is forgetful because of his age. But it's making me so depressed. Wanting to move and not being able to or not knowing anything. And people in my family keep asking me when and I don't know what to tell them anymore. I mean I know it's not my boyfriend's fault. But I'm just mad at him. And worried he is not doing everything he could be to get a hold of this guy and find out something. I have been majorly depressed when I think about it. And I have a feeling of impending doom. And a terrible gut feeling in the pit of my stomach that it's all going to go terribly bad. Which maybe it already has. And my boyfriend just keeps saying he is depressed over it all as well. But I just wonder if he is taking my feelings into account. It's also my first tome on my own. And I feel like if we don't get in this house. Or if the move keeps getting pushed back. I will become a bigger and bigger disappointment to my family.
1288,How is everyone's day going? I starting getting random anxiety a bit ago but it isn't too out of control.
1289,"I often walk my dog in the woods and can think of nothing other than 'this would be a good murder spot' or 'some is behind me following' the whole walk...amongst lots of other equally disturbing scenarios.
Lets not forget the age old 'smash my car into a tree/wall/pole...etc etc etc its like I am constantly on the watch for the nearest item to hit at full speed whilst driving. 
Does anyone else fantasize of anything morbid etc??"
1290,"I know now that I am not alone...

there are others who take me in the night

i try to forget but they take me in the night

IT'S NOT DREAMS

bipolar is not a sickness

it's a portal into another world

they will take me again tonight"
1291,"a lot of my sleeping life does not seem like it should

I am certain that I am taken each nite I can feelthe displacement

I never really wake up like any other than too tired

I can feel a shift like twice awaken asleep

I know I go somewhere

else"
1292,Seems contradicting to a relationship based on trust.  The title should never be used.
1293,"I don't want sympathy...

I doubt I even want empathy.

I don't want anyone to say or write anything.

I am alone... I have been alone on purpose

some people talk about violence.

I have had endless fights with the police I was in the street and they were there too...

the cops are always there they put me down and they hurt.

I have to ask myself ...what the fuck is wrong with me

I nearly killed my dog for fucks sake...

I made probably the calmest phone call of my life.

..please come and save him the little fella.

and they did and I will never forget the way he whimpered and tried to look at me in the eyes... but my eyes were dead but not too far gone to save him.

yes I am capable of murder and hurt... BUT?... I am stuck with it.

my bipolar takes me too unlucky awesome and disaster...

all that is left?...

is complete shame and utter distaste for myself...

and why the fuck should I continue?

all I want to do is make up for all the pain I have caused...

and I am running out of time"
1294,"Venlafaxine, I've been on the drug for 9 years now. I have doubts this drug ever helped with depression. Its like my pdoc gave it to me, it didn't help so just kept adding to it, 
Still on it,its quite a nasty medication if I take it a few hours late, missing a dose is horrendous. I wonder what its doing to our brains"
1295,"I have had diagnosis from Bipolar 2 to MDD/PTSD/GAD. Tried a ton of anti-depressants which usually leave me on the side of some sort of hypo-mania like symptoms. The thing is that, I only have those symptoms when I am on an anti-depressant. My mood is kind of erratic while not on meds but its not clear cut bipolar...to me anyways.

So, I'm just curious if anyone had similar issues with having MDD all the time, but it changes while on meds? The symptoms I usually have is feeling euphoria/high, agitated, wanting to crawl out of skin. I'm still very much stuck in depression but 'High'. No desire to do anything, no typical things you would think of from someone who is in a hypomanic/manic state.

Currently on luvox on seroquel which helped a lot with anxiety in the beginning, but not a lot with depression. It feels like it stopped working though so looking forward to trying something else. I still get the occasional high/agitated feeling when I take a dose of luvox. Doctor says that happens to people with PTSD but, I cant find any articles about that.

Also, I tried lamictal and was at 300mg and didn't feel a difference, but that's all I took at that time. Doesn't feel like cyclothymia to me, so what does that really leave me with in the bipolar range? I'm gonna try to let my new doctor know more about this in detail as I guess I wasn't clear enough with the last one.

So, just seeing if anyone can relate to this and maybe give me some hope to find out what the hell is going on with me.ty"
1296,I currently suffer with bipolar although my symptoms are at bay I’m told by mr psychiastrist my medication being taken regulary(I’m on sodium valproate 1500 and haloperidol 10 mg ) mood stabliser and antipsychotic I’m wondering if I come off my meds and smoke weed will I become unwell again as relatives are telling me if I ween my self of the meds when the drs think it’s right I’ll be able to have a smoke again obviously not in excess but sometimes this has got me apprehensive however other relatives are warning me to stay clear but I’m already dabbling with weed and have done since my teens I only stopped when I was 19-21 I am now 22 and have been in hospital multiple times but I feel this is due to people I consider close to me telling me the meds are bad for you etc and me taking it on board but now my stance has changed and I feel like the meds are helping me but I still want to come off them and experiment with smoking weed will that ever be possible ? And I also struggle to cope with out it as my family members particapate in smoking weed freely as I have moved to my fathers house up north this has got me more involved in smoking as before it wasn’t so in my face I just want to know the facts about smoking weed after you’ve come off medication
1297,"Does anyone else just have phases where you hate the actual face off of some.....like it doesn't matter what they say or do.....the very fact that they are existing in my space winds me up. 

I find this very distressing and prob the worst part of the whole illness.

For no reason at times I hate everyone and everything. 

Please tell me Im not alone!! 
How do you guys cope with this pure unadulterated rage?"
1298,"So today I went to see my new psychiatrist following my crisis back in Feb.
I anticipated perhaps a 45min slot however 2 exhausting hrs later I scurry out....full on headache and swollen eyes to a parking ticket. 
That was essentially my day in a sodding nutshell. 
My psychiatrist has requested I stop Promethazine and end my Martizipine (have come down off it the past two weeks) and increase my Quetiapine. 

So I will now attempt to follow this and survive the next three weeks until I see him again. 

I am absolutely bloody petrified. And don't forget the stinkin parking ticket."
1299,"Hello all, I have bi polar Disorder and have been on lithium for over 15 years. Whilst medication works fine I am becoming more and more concerned that I have no emotional feelings whatsoever. I always knew that this would be the case but now becoming a very bad issue for me for reasons I cannot go into. So much so that it is affecting my wellbeing, life, relationships etc. Should I now consider changing my meds?"
1300,"I am a 46 yr old mother of 2 teenage boys, married 23 years struggling with my Bipolar disorder because I am unemployed actively searching and have too much time to be anxious. I am not manic and don't think I am depressed, I take meds and have a great caregiver in my husband, but I need an additional support system. I am not the person I was before I had my two breakdowns and being unemployed has really hit me hard. My confidence is shaken and personality is almost ""flat"" now, I hate it. I want the old Lula back and need someplace to share my struggles and get feedback and give feedback to others like me."
1301,"I mis-read the thread about carers as careers and decided it might be a good topic.  My daughter is in a pharmacy program and she may finish by age 40!  There were a lot of tough years but she did get married, decided not to have children (a tough one for others out here with BP-1 diagnosis).  Anyhow, I hope she makes it in the real world as a pharmacist.  Studying is another world.

What kinds of careers do you or your loved one with bp disorder have?  Or, if sadly a career hasn't worked."
1302,"I'm am currently 3 months pregnant with my 3 child I got my diagnosis of bipolar 2 in 2011. My older 2 I didnt have a diagnosis of it as I had them in 2007 and 2008. 
Ive been told I have to have a parenting assessment to see if I'm capable to look after the baby. I'm absolutely terrified that my baby is going to be taken off me once he or she is born. As my older 2 live with ther dad as in 2012 things got that bad I couldn't cope with anything anymore and I tried to end my life. So as a result in that I had social work involvement and they were fine with me still being the solo career for my older 2. But my ex partner took me to court when he found out about it and he was award temporary residence of the children. They have now lived with him for 7 years and I have regular contact with them have them for all the school half terms as they live a far distance away from me.
I'd love for them to come back to live with me but we have never been back to court since as I've never wanted to disrupt there lives as they are settled in school and have there friends. So me and there dad have kepted it as they live with him but I have them school half terms and speak to them on the phone most nights.
I've come a long way since I tried to end my life 7 years ago I was just in a really bad place and at that time I kepted it all to myself and couldn't face telling anyone I was struggling. Ive worked on my bipolar and been doing really well with it taking my meds and going to my appointments to see the psychiatrist when I have them. I now know when I am struggling to go and seek help by the services out there and have always gone back to my GP when I have been discharged from community mental health services. To get a referral back to the services.
I'm just terrified that because of my past it will go against me when baby is born and baby being taken off me."
1303,"Hey guys,

Just curious, do you usually have a high that's follow by a low, or a low and then followed by a high? I read that most people have highs (manic) and then a crash after (depression), but it seems I usually have a low period and then boost out of it.

And also, does your highs usually seasonal? Seems I also feel down in winter and get a boost in spring or summer."
1304,Hi everyone. This may be a stupid question but I was wondering if Casinos were allowed to hire bipolar people? I do NOT have a gambling problem at all but I am on disability and looking for possible future careers. My boyfriend pays for most things but I live with my dad and tired of being dependent. I don't get much on disability. Wondering if persuing a career as a casino games dealer would be worth it? Does anyone here hold a job with bipolar disorder? Thanks!
1305,"I don’t know about all of you, but I’m sick of the news media jumping to the conclusion that every person walking around with an AK47 shooting people is mentally ill.  And that’s ALL they report often with no basis in fact. They don’t talk about the fact that people with mental illness are usually the victims of crimes, not the other way around.  People with mental illness cause less crime than the general population. All they are doing is reinforcing the stigma.  It’s no wonder people are afraid of us."
1306,Has anyone found a bipolar medicine that doesn’t cause weight gain? Also positive or negative affects you’ve had and what meds caused those?
1307,I was watching a documentary on mental illness and there seems to a connection between mental illness and a traumatic childhood. I had a very traumatic childhood. Anyone else?
1308,"Hello! I (29M) started dating this girl (29F) towards the end of January, and she knocked my socks off. I’ve never met someone so amazing. Everything was great, aside from her having several depressive episodes, and when she told me she was diagnosed with Cyclothymia when she was 15 it all made sense. I told her I’m okay with it and that I’m here to support her, I did quite a bit of research myself as to how to better support her. 

2 weeks ago, she sent me a message saying that it would be best to continue our relationship in a platonic manner due to her having conflicted feelings. She asked if I wanted something more casual, and said she doesn’t think I’d be down for that because I’m so caring and amazing. I asked if something happened in particular that changed her mind, because she was crazy about me prior to this. She even said that she hasn’t thought about dating someone long term in ages until she met me, even planning to go to events together, basically she seemed invested. I told her that I’d be okay with making things casual/slowing things down, and she responded saying that she’s afraid things are moving too fast and It takes time to get to know someone. I told her I couldn’t agree more and that we should meet up to talk, she agreed. 

The next day she sends me a message apologizing for being a jerk lately and invites me to sleep over at her place. I go over to her place and she tells me that 2 hours prior to me arriving she was crying on the phone with her mom for 30mins because her mom’s boyfriend left her. She also said she’s been having a rough week, and I could tell by her expression she was emotionally exhausted. Before I got to her place I was expecting we’d have sex but from her expression I just wanted to comfort her. We did kiss but that’s it.

The next morning I leave her place, and a few hours after I left she sends me this message:

“I’m so sorry for having to be this blunt, but last night confirmed my concerns. I don’t think we’re sexually compatible and after the incident that happened during out last sexual encounter I’ve lost that type of attraction to you. I know it’s really harsh to put it in those words but I don’t know how else to say it. I wish it wasn’t the truth because you’d be an amazing partner but I can’t fake those feelings. Thank you for everything. I’m sorry I’m a coward and am doing this by text. I really hope you find someone who makes you happy.”

The incident she speaks of happened 3 weeks ago - we were having sex and she asked me to ejaculate on her face at the end. When I was about to orgasm, I tugged on the condom but it was so tight it snapped back, some lube from the condom went on her face we both laughed and I ended up ejaculating on her stomach. She seemed perfectly fine with it, and the rest of the night was normal. She was still flirting with me and even wanted sex a second time. 
After seeing this message I honestly panicked and tried calling her a few times to talk, she didn’t pick up and she blocked my number. She blocked me on Instagram as well. We didn’t speak for a week after that, so I sent her a message on Facebook last Monday, she doesn’t have me as a friend on there, she just ignored my message. It’s now been 2 weeks since we last spoke. 

I don’t know if this is relevant, and just to give you an idea of what kind of person she is, I should mention that she’s only been in 4 relationships. All of which the men have cheated on her. The first relationship she had was 7 years and it was emotionally and sometimes physically abusive according to her. When I took her out for Valentine’s Day, she said I’m the first person in her life to take her out on this day. 
I eventually found out that she's incredibly kinky, she has toys, costumes, has been in a threesome, obviously way more sexual experience than me, but I was okay with that. We spoke about it and she said she's okay with me being inexperienced, and I told her that I'm down to try anything. She did say that she's only orgasmed twice in her life, and the first time wasn't even from sex. I came to terms with that and didn't let it affect my performance, but I can understand why she's so kinky based on that fact, she's been exploring all these ways to attain an orgasm.


I’m honestly incredibly confused by this entire situation, does this have anything to do with her being cyclothymic? She just seemed so into me, we were bonding so closely. She did mention things were moving quickly a couple of times, and she did say she has a tendency to run away when things move too fast, but she didn’t want that to happen with me. Any help would be much appreciated, thanks!"
1309,I need support and advice. My boyfriend hates me now he's having bipolar episode. I have my own manic depression and meds. So I dun wanna lose it whilst trying to be a solid sport for him

1314,"My daughter was diagnosed in her early 20s.  She had symptoms in her teens but we thought it was ""just"" depression and after waiting for an AD to work she would get very high and we thought she deserved to be better.  Until she took Effexor and became psyhoticly manic.,

After years of hospitalizations, ups and down s, and 4 different schools she went back to her original goal, to be a pharmacist.  She is now 38 and continues to do extremely well in a pharmacy program.  She is in her third year.  She has gained a LOT of weight due to her meds but I have learned to just accept it.  She has.  I do not know what these meds are as now her husband has replaced me as her closest confidante.  He is very supportive.

I am somewhat apprehensive about her being done with school and out in the ""real"" world.  She seems to thrive on studying.  But we'll wait and see.

Anyhow, a success story, becoming a pharmacist at age 40!!"
1315,"I thought my struggles with bipolar disease felt like I was a never ending  piss in the wind. I guess now all I'm doing is pissing in the wind while getting an extra persons perspective. So basicly same shit different day. All you can do is look for the silverlining bc sometimes that's all you got. Open to whatever, share or just tell random non related stories. On a serious note skitophrenia meltdown was horrible and very dark and so on. I understand why Skitzophrenic s and targeted individuals tend to be similar or 2 sides of 1 coin. I'm not sure what it was exactly other than extremely powerful example of what even a burnt out wasted mind like mine is capable of. Very scary!"
1316,"I never thought I’d be saying this but I need to gain weight.  After coming off olanzapine I lost the 50lbs I gained and the weight still keeps coming off without my trying to lose it.  So now I’m trying to gain some back, but it doesn’t seem to be working.  Any suggestions?  At this point I’m a little concerned."
1317,"As the title says, if you went on antidepressants as an undiagnosed bipolar how would they affect you?"
1318,"Dear friends,

For years after my manic episode, I couldn’t write or talk about it. But I finally got up the gumption and published a short piece about it in a national magazine. It came out this week.

I won’t lie - coming out has been scary - but I’ve done it bit by bit and reclaimed my dignity in the process.

I’m taking a risk, but I want to have an impact.

1320,"Some may or may not know,I used to be an RN,
I loved my job,but I couldnt cope with too much pressure.
Its not ok that as much as I appeared to have been supernurse as soon as I walked through the main doors to the car park my legs turned to jelly,so bad that I seriously considered having to crawl to my car. By the time I got home,I couldnt stop shaking racing thoughts,straight into panic mode,go to bed zero sleep back to work to continue the same old pattern over and over.
I am at the line between normal and being underweight,way back then I lost about 10 kilos, dispite eating loads
Too be quite honest thinking about this as I say it,my mouths gone dry,and i feel bit scared.
Silly psychologist thinks I can go back to that???
I suggest not
Nurse aide or caring for people in their own home anymore than that I think not.
Its like she seems to think I will be capable of ...anything
I'm not I never was,
Nursing is a massive responsibility
I don't want that ever again
I would rather stack shelves at the supermarket
We all have to be realistic

As a student I did extremely well,bit deep down I just didn't have that something when it came to crisis mode

It feel like shes putting pressure on me to be something I arent"
1321,"Hi i’v Been living with bipolar 1 for about 20 years with two major manic episodes in my late twenties, stabilized on depakote 1000 with just one major relapse 5 years ago when I tried to quit my meds (8 months psychotic mania). Got back on meds and on tracks and now I’m doing well, and I also quit drinking and pot 15 months ago after years of binge drinking. So that’s good. However if I’m now sleeping very well at night going to bed and waking up early after 7/8 hours sleep, I still need excruciatingly long naps in the pm. Previously thought this was due to hangovers and staying up late, but not anymore obviously since I’m sober now. Sort of need 2 to 3 hours sleep in the afternoon or I am just wiped and useless. Seems a bit long. Does anyone on depakote have this? A little concerned too cause I read someone saying they tend to oversleep before manic episodes and that sort of rang a bell. But then it seems to be pretty consistent with me. Working from home makes it easy too. I’d like to know your experience with depakote and oversleeping though... thanks!"
1322,I developed late onset bipolar in my late 40’s triggered by an antidepressant. I have had two manic episodes one with a psychotic break.  I did not receive treatment either time because there were no mental health facilities where I was living at the time.  Both times I did not KNOW I had bipolar because I was never diagnosed.  I was wondering if you have a manic episode knowing already that you have bipolar disorder does it make a difference in how you act? Do you understand what is happening to you?
1323,What are the odds of getting manic again even if you’re medicated?
1324,I wish I could get motivated I just can't the less I do the less I want to do. Mental health wise I'm pretty good.
1325,"My oldest brother is a paranoid schizophrenic.  I would ask him this question but he is unmedicated, would never admit there is anything wrong with him, and lives in another state with his phone service cut off.  I have bipolar disorder and even if I were unmedicated I would have periods of normalcy in between the episodes.  I was wondering if it’s ever like that for my brother?  Does he ever feel relief?"
1326,"I don’t know why I started thinking about this today but when I was manic/psychotic I thought Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash were communicating with me through emojis on my cellphone.  Elvis Presley I can see, but Johnny Cash???  Never thought I’d laugh about anything from that time, but I’ll make an exception for Elvis an Johnny.  😂"
1327,Are you getting any side effects from Saphris? It's supposed to help me go to sleep but half the time it does the opposite. I don't know how I finally fall asleep at night. I feel trapped and it makes me want to shoot myself. I take Cogentin to counter this side effect which again doesn't work all the time.
1328,"Four years ago when my psychiatrist put me on olanzapine I gained 50lbs.  ( I’m a tiny person who usually weighed in at 98lbs.). Also made me sleep all day and made me feel “flat”. Also, diabetes runs in my family so the weight gain was risky for me.  For whatever reason he wouldn’t take me off of it so I stopped on my own.( I still take lamotragine and latuda).  It took a few years to drop the weight and I feel much better off of it.  My psychiatrist loves to boast at how well I’m doing...a great success story yet has no clue that I stopped the olanzapine. I usually don’t tell ANYONE that I stopped but figure I can be totally honest here. Olanzapine turned me into a fat, cognitive impaired zombie who slept all day.  I don’t recommend it."
1329,"In my everyday life and in general people tend to describe people experiencing mental illness that they are their mental illness,
e.g megirl is bipolar. I aren't my illness.
Its the same as someone saying megirl is diabetes.
No I have an identity
Yes I suffer from bipolar and BPD
I am a dog lover, I am female, I am a new Zealander.
Thats who I am.
I aren't insulted by peoples comments I dont like to be defined by my illness.
A friend the day told me her son 'is bipolar' I corrected her and said hats not who he is.
I said it kindly and she was most apologetic. She hadnt realised her mistake.
Hope that helps

1330,"I built good attitude of work such as self-motivated, cheerful, leadership, enthusiasm, energetic when I am in good mood.

But I am down, I just cant performance well.

I have an interview tomorrow I feel nervous. I think I have no strength instead having multiple negative traits.

But I need job. I cannot just give up myself.

How to have stable performance when I am not in a good situation during interview?"
1331,"I am bipolar, and also have generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD. I take 6 pills a day for these illnesses, and I am not always comfortable with telling people about this information. Yet people in my family keep telling their friends all the information about my hospitalizations, the medications I take, what they do, and basically everything to do with what I have been through. It makes me extremely uncomfortable to have random people knowing my whole story without me even meeting them. I don't know what to do, and when confronted, my family will just tell me that it's their business to share, because my mental health affects them too. It is true that my mental health does affect my loved ones, but that doesn't mean they should be able to tell anybody they want about my medical records and my personal informations. It's extremely frustrating and I just don't know what to do to cope with the fact that these people, who are strangers to me, know extremely personal information about me without telling them myself."
1332,Does anyone else have no friends because of their depression?
1333,So I think I might be at the start of another episode and I've got an appointment with my gp for it but I'm worried about how honest to be with them. It's a gp I haven't seen before and I know that shouldn't make a difference but somehow it does. I have a thing about not wanting to take medication and I'm worried if I tell them everything I'll either end up back in hospital or ill be forced to take the medication. My other big concern is that if I do tell them everything they'll think I'm exaggerating. Any words of advice/encouragement would be greatly appreciated!
1334,"Hi guys, this is my first time posting on here but it’s been brought on by some events that have happened in my life recently.

I wanted to know if anyone else here gets absolutely sick to death of people that pretend to be understanding of mental health conditions but in real life are the worse culprits when it comes to being judgemental? I’m finding it difficult to deal with as I’m still trying to understand how to deal with my condition but have almost “fake” allies, people that I thought I could trust but actually turn out to be the most judgemental and most self preserving people of all. They’re the people that “like” mental health posts on social media but will avoid you in the street. 

I love the idea of mental health issues becoming a topic of conversation but not if it’s used as a tool to aid selfish productivity. I want to challenge these people but I know I’ll be made out to be crazy. It’s absolutely infuriating."
1335,anyone talking?
1336,"This time last year I was struggling, my then husband was becoming very  controlling,unsupportive making nasty comments, didn't realise how bad things were at that time. At that time I started abusing alcohol against ,then took a large overdose.

I certainly couldn't see myself as being sick??"
1337,"Hi all, This is my first post on the forum although I have cruised around on the boards which I have found invaluable. I am currently tapering off my medication on doctors recommendation, was taking 100mg and now taking 75mg for the  past two weeks. Had zero problems starting the medication, all was fine, but tapering is quite another matter:low: I have researched online and seem to come back with answers over the mental but not physical withdrawal, I have had a migraine for a week, insomnia, blurred vision, twitches and general aches, just wondering if anyone else had gone through this and come out the other end? feeling pretty down:cry: Thanks everyone x"
1338,"I've recently been diagnosed, and I found the whole process really stressful and feel kind of defensive to be honest, but I'm trying to look at it all objectively. One thing I do notice about myself that's been described as a bipolar trait is that the way I dress changes with my mood.

At certain times in my life, for example, I wear bright colors, suit jackets over paisley shirts, ties, vintage fashion. Largely I found the fabrics appealing but felt also that they signaled social availability, and when I have tons of energy I want to interact with other people. Sometimes I notice people with bipolar wearing costume jewelry, like mardi gras beads on ordinary occasions.

Does the way you dress change with your mood?"
1339,"Hi everyone, 

I am new to this forum for BPD or any forum really...My counselor and shrink had mentioned it might be good to have the support from one since I was recently diagnosed with BPD a year ago. I don't have any outside support because from what it sounds like I've had the same issue as most on here of people getting fed up with the negative, mentally destructive, hurtful behavior I have demonstrated to all of them...I have been on medication for the past year and I have been getting a lot better emotionally, logically, and more aware of my surroundings of how I treat people. So I hope I can get some help or advice on how to maybe get those people to realize things are getting better and changing. 

I've lost my family, friends, my boyfriend is afraid to stay around, and his friends and family don't want anything to do with me (which makes this harder for him). I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years on and off. He has ADHD, but I am the one with BPD and it has been really rough on him. He's tried to help fight through all the problems I've caused and he has lost so much trust in me and the faith in me to change. His friends and family tell him that they want nothing to do with me or have me around; that he is welcome over, but he's not allowed to bring me. I've treated him very very poorly and it took me almost loosing him for good and attempting to commit suicide for me to wake up to the fact I need treatment. Once I received treatment, things have changed a lot with me and it's hard for him to see that. He's hurt and I want to be able to fix it and prove to him he doesn't have to be afraid anymore...

Does anyone have any advise for me on how I can get him to see things are changing or more that I can do to show him things are changing? And does anyone have any advise for him on how to cope with the situation and dealing with the hardships we have been through to continue or improve for a bright future?

Thanks for reading :)."
1340,"I am sitting here, all day on my ass watching sitcoms. Trying to fool myself i am ok. The occasional laugh distracting me for part of a second. As usual, i pretend i am ok. Deep down, i want to cry so much but its been so long i cant make it happen."
1341,"I've been dating my boyfriend for a year, we live 2 hours away, he has bipolar 2, diagnosed years ago. He has only been on a low dose antidepressant as far as treatment goes, he also has a drinking issue. I wasn't aware until recently about his bipolar and this happened as a result of me finding out about his infidelity. Currently, we have been seeing each other once each month and I always had some concern about us being committed to each other on his end, he always said that he only wanted me every time I asked and reassured me that he was in love with me but there would be many nights he would go out drinking with sparce txts between us, it made me feel suspicious. 

i ended up finding out one day he was with a girl through her social media, i confronted him about it and he said she was a friend only but i did not buy it, he eventually confessed they had sex. he began telling me how he feels manic every so often and explained he doesn't have control over certain behaviors and told me that he will gamble and spend tons of money and sometimes be awake for 36 hrs straight and that once he comes down from being manic he feels depressed and guilty and doesn't know why he did any of the things he did while he was manic-this was all stuff i never knew and i was worried but so so so confused and extremely hurt. i didn't and still don't understand why when he was feeling hypersexual he didn't come to me for it. he explained he had no feelings for her and stopped talking to her after i found out. i asked him if there were other girls and he said that there had been 3 others since we were together. i felt sick to my stomach. 

i began researching about bipolar and found out how antidepressants can trigger rapid cycling of moods and how mood stabilizers are a recommended treatment so i told him he needs to see a psychiatrist and he agreed. he begged me to give him another chance and i did, i was very concerned about him and wanted him to get help, i love him so much. we communicated the whole day every day ever since then and i felt slightly better about the improved communication due to everything. he saw a psych, started a mood stabilizer and was set to go back to the dr. in a week but he never went. time passed, he put the appt off and a month later he still hadn't seen the dr. but he began to tell me that he was feeling less hyper on the meds, he would often bring up on his own how he noticed they were helping. i thought this was a great sign but concerned he hadn't seen a dr. yet to follow up. i figured the pills need to be increased with dosage because usually meds are started at a low dose initially to see how the drug is handled.  

as far as my trust went, it was not very good. i constantly questioned him and we would argue, he would say that he felt better and i don't have to worry. we got to the point where we were arguing all the time. i didn't trust him, i just felt like he was still with other girls. i felt insecure about our distance but also because of his cheating. some time passed, my trust hadn't changed, he hadn't seen he dr. i noticed he started staying out very late, sleeping very little, drinking more and this became more regular. we were arguing all the time, he said he was drinking more because he felt guilty about cheating on me and that i don't trust him, he said that i will never trust him. i started feeling like i couldn't stop obsessively worrying he would cheat especially while out drinking. i began to feel like i was crazy and ruining our relationship, i blamed myself. some time passed and i started asking him did he really feel better on the meds and he said he did. i began to feel like i was nagging him constantly and sort of stepped back from asking. then last week his behavior became more apparant it was manic, he told me one day he felt antsy and had to go out, he ended up going to a bar for over 6 hours, he didn't text me that much, it made me think he was cheating. i got upset, explained i knew something was up, he sounded very hyper on the phone, his thoughts were from one idea to another in an instant. i knew he was manic, i told him i was worried and i think he is manic, he said that he wasn't manic and that he feels better. i made plans to see him and we saw each other. he didn't seem all that off to me when we were together, we had fun. i talked to him about my trust concerns and asked if anything had happened since he slept with that girl, he said no. he told me that i am the only one he wants and that he wants to spend the rest of his life with me. i asked him if he was talking to other girls and he said no. i ended up looking at his phone and finding out he was txting with girls. i confronted him and we fought, he said long distance is too hard for him. i went home. he began non stop texting me and begging me not to leave him, he said that he still feels manic and began telling me that he has been gambling and staying out until 6 am i had no idea. i was so worried and i told him he needs to see a dr. he was so guilty he went out drinking that whole night. we've been talking ever since i found out and i've been asking him a ton of questions, i feel hurt and confused. i explained to him how it feels like talking to girls consistently is not a manic behavior (i feel like hooking up with someone is more manic than talking regularly but it confuses me honestly) he said he doesn't understand why he does it, that he has no feelings for them and i just hope that this is due to bipolar because i don't want it to be that he is just a cheater. he did tell me he cheated in other relationships but i figured if it is bipolar, he was never treated so it didn't surprise me in that aspect.

i read about how antidepressants can cause rapid cycling of moods even with a mood stabilizer and i don't know if he might need to wean off the antidepressant and just remain on the mood stabliizer or maybe he just needs to switch mood stabilizers or switch to a different one. i feel like it could be so many things and i want him to feel well.

he ended up saying it's not the distance, he was just frustrated that he failed. personally bipolar is something i am still fairly new to knowing about and i worry that our situation may not be due to bipolar and i don't want him to use it as an excuse so i wanted to see what other people who have bipolar would think about all of this. i want to work it out with him, right now i just feel extremely confused and hurt. i said to him that we should just date other people to make it easier and he said he doesn't want that, i thought he would agree to it on his part and i'm trying to be understanding but i feel so hurt."
1342,"Hi
I don't post here very often but I was wondering if anyone else is on Lamotrigine? I've been on it for coming up two years but I'm really sick of it. The somnolence side effects - drowsiness, feeling zombiefied, motor coordination difficulties, confusion, hypersomnia, difficulty concentrating - are really doing my head in and making work so much more stressful than it should be! I really need my wits about me at work and it's almost impossible on this drug. As well, it really hits me if I forget to take a pill. If I miss one dose I feel like someone's put me on about 100 sleeping pills. I can barely move. 

Anyone else having these problems? I have always doubted by cyclothymia diagnosis because I'm sure my only symptom is anxiety but I'm still a bit scared that they might be right - I mean, they're the doctors after all! If I was to go off lamotrigine and stay off all types of pills after that and it turned out I was cyclothymic, how would that affect me? My mental health has improved substantially over the years and I'm better now than I ever have been, though I'd put that down to life experiences and maturing and learning new perspectives more than I would the pills. I don't want to ruin all my hard work by quitting the pills, though, if it turns out they are helping to keep me stable!

1344,"Heeeey,
I suffer from Bipolar Disorder type I and I have never been able to get my symptoms under control by medication prescribed for my Bipolar even after being tried on a handful of different pills! 
I was prescribed pregabalin about 2 months ago to treat my pain in my face caused by nerve damage and have noticed ever since my moods have stayed level, I thought at first it was the 'high' feeling from it being a pain killer or whatever, but noticed that my mood was really high, but just in the middle (I would say like normal but I've never had an inbetween in my whole life, so not really normal to me 😂) so I googled Lyrica the brand of pregabalin I have been taking and read that Lyrica is also sometimes used as an anticonvulsant. I remember taking tregatrol to try and treat my bipolar, which didn't work but I also remember that being used as an anticonvulsant! Had a Google and couldn't find any research or anything like that on Lyrica being used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, but I'm sure this is literally treating my bipolar!! If anyone is taking an anticonvulsant in there treatment of bipolar what is the name of the medication you are on?? And has anyone taken Lyrica or any other brand of pregabalin for a reason other than mental health and noticed a change in there bipolar disorder?"
1345,"Hey, I was diagnosed with bipolar II two days ago. I'm admittedly having trouble accepting I have this. To me, it feels like I have ADHD with intermittent depressive spells. But none the less, here I am, diagnosed with bipolar during a 25 minute skype conversation with someone I never met, given meds I didn't think I had asked for. I'm super anxious about going on medication for this. I wasn't planning on doing that. I'm afraid they'll make me gain 100 pounds and make it impossible to enjoy sex, all the while eliminate the energy I appreciate having.

Is anyone here familiar with Abilify? What's that like as a mood stablizer for you? should I just vanish from the lives of my therapists? How do I wrap my mind around a new diagnosis like this? How do I get a second opinion? I have no idea who to even ask these questions to."

1347,"I literally do not know how to start this?? So i have this friend, one of my only friends, she is an online friend. I talk to her every day very very often. I am bipolar, it is a recent diagnosis from just a couple months ago, but i have had depression and anxiety for a little over a year. Right now i am facing a very odd problem. I will be talking to her and then she will have to go, which i am fine with. After a little while i get so unbearably lonely and uncomfortable not talking to anyone that it is too much to handle, so whether or not she responds, i just blab to her (which she has always been okay with). I feel secure knowing that at some point someone will read my messages, so i will text for a little while and then eventually hours could pass of me trying to get my millions of thoughts out and she will come back, and then i will feel extremely comforted. Then she will have to leave again and i will feel like a wreck AGAIN. This has become a consistent cycle every day. You know how people with BPD have a ""favourite person""? This is so bizarre and extreme that it is like a different version of a favourite person but fit to match my bipolar? Sometimes i think she hates me but i NEED to be around her, sometimes i am so obsessed that i never want to stop talking to her. I break down over text to her, she knows me very well and what my tendencies are, but just now for a few hours she had to go and i was MISERABLE. Then she came back and i didnt feel great but i wanted to talk to her, so i did, then she had to go because someone needed her help, and now i am back at the same ""ohhh my GOD WHAT DO I DO?"" because the loneliness is soooo overpowering that sometimes i get suicidal, sometimes i want to unfriend her because i think she does not care about me (which she does, she cares about me deeply and is truly an amazing friend). I am soooo stuck, i do not know what to call this, sometimes i try to push her away and sometimes i try to let her come in real close, What in the world am i supposed to call this??? Is this normal?? To be torn apart every day because you cannot speak to this one person when you want to every second of every day?

1350,"Excuse the long post, but I am at a complete loss and have found myself turning to the internet and forums for answers.

My DH and I have been together for eight years, engaged for four and married for just 16 months. My bf and fiance were loving and kind and treated me as any woman would want to be treated. 
He proposed three years into our relationship, and we were engaged for a further four, I am married at 20 and divorced at 21 and was nervous of embarking into marriage again, after four years we decided to elope to NYC and get married, which we did in September 2017, I was 32 and he 31.

And that's when things changed. 

In January 2018, he started going out, a lot, drinking until the early hours of the morning and started an inappropriate friendship with a woman from work. So much so in his drunken state, he called me by her name on more than one occasion. His Google search history showed obsessive googling of her social media profiles, tracking her flights back from a holiday with her fiance amongst other things.

DH has always been a spender, a project starter but never finisher, but never an angry or abusive person.
In March last year, he came home at 5 am, he had been at a strip club, somewhere I had never known him to be frequent, and had spent almost 2000 on dances. Days before ground was to be broken on our extension.
I confronted him. He spiralled into a depressive state and said he wanted a divorce. This shocked me to my core; he said he didn't love me anymore and wanted out. We spent an entire day talking about it, and he changed his mind, a mere 12 hours later. We pressed ahead with our extension, as he insisted it was the right thing to do and he'd had a 'wobble', and he was sorry.

His friendship with the coworker continued, I tried to speak to him calmly and air my concerns about his friendship - I am ashamed to say I practically stalked him as I knew it was more than just friends.
DH got angrier and angrier, verbally abusing me - highlighting every insecurity I had about myself and trying to convince me I was going mad, even when I had printouts of hotel bookings. The closer I got, the angrier he got, yelling in July, that he wanted a divorce that I was effing crazy.

He pushed all his family away, who for all of our relationship he had been very close too. He didn't want to speak to anyone. He just wanted to go out and have fun and kept saying to me 'you think the party has to stop - well it doesn't'. He bought DJ equipment and started talking about going to Ibiza (he never used the equipment).
Multiple times he would accuse me of 'preventing his fun' when had gone out on benders and stood me up when we were supposed to be meeting for dinner, that I was bore etc. He would call me at midnight and ask me to leave keys under the doormat as he'd forgotten his and didn't want to come home. When I refused and said that was stupid and irresponsible, he would get verbally abusive and tell me ""a good wife would do it"".
He told me the drinking was an 'escape' from life; he even looked into andehonia as he said he felt nothing most of the time.

On more than one occasion he would tell me he 'wasn't happy' and a voice in his head was telling him he could be so much happier if he left me. He would tell me that the voice tells him he never loved me and that he shouldn't have asked me on a second date. He would leave for two-three days and then come back again. Willing to work on our marriage.
In August he asked for a more formal break to get his head together, he moved out for four weeks dropping several thousand on a bachelor pad on Airbnb. Much to my absolute horror. 
At the end of the four weeks, he said he was sorry, he never had an affair, but he could see that it looked like that, and he blagged his way through all my questions about the hotels etc. Making promises that he openly admits now, he can't remember what he said.

He came home, and we started again. We managed three months (walking on eggshells) with him in what I would say a subdued state - neither manic nor depressive before it started again, and in this time he changed jobs.
On January 4th this year, he said he was 'unhappy' again, and he was going to get counselling. I told him I was getting slightly sick of being sighted for his constant unhappiness and that the grass wasn't greener on the other side and he needed to try and water the patch he was on. 

A week later, he admitted he'd had an affair with the coworker, no it wasn't going on anymore, and they had ceased contact. He said although he felt bad about it, he didn't really feel much else. I was flabberghasted after all the torment and gaslighting the previous summer that had almost sent me to a facility. We agreed to take a break while we worked out what to do, and he could stay in the house, as he had said things like ' i am so ashamed' and 'i'd be better off dead', and I couldn't ask him to leave.

He started counselling to help him understand why he had cheated as he said he had no feelings for this woman, she had strong feelings for him and he just went along with it as it made him feel good.  A week later he went on a business trip before he left he put his wedding ring back on and pulled me into a hug. When he returned from his week-long trip - he was like an excited child, he told me he'd missed me, and he loved me, and he was so so sorry, that he wanted to make things work, we had our first proper conversation in 8 years of our relationship - about everything. He wanted to book us a much needed holiday and quickly got to work. He went for his third counselling session on Tuesday. On Wednesday we booked two holidays.

All of this week he's been excited, happy almost hyper, all he wanted to talk about was our holidays with one in four weeks, one in August and I just about managed to get him to slow down and not book a holiday in September too. 
On Saturday evening we went to bed like usual, he did seem a bit down, closed, pensive, and I had asked him if he was OK, which he assured me he was, he was just tired. We even talked just before sleep that we were going away in four weeks and couldn't wait.

Then on Sunday morning, I was woken by him kissing me on my forehead at 5 am and telling me through tears, he was leaving me and that his counsellor and him and had decided he didn't love me and he should end the relationship - for good this time. He said he doesn't' love me; he feels nothing towards me at all. He packed his bags and left, and I haven't heard from him since. Bear in mind counselling was Tuesday and he booked the holidays on Wednesday.
Now.. I appreciate this a long and winding story, and there are many explanations I am sure, and maybe just maybe someone can fall out of love whilst they're sleeping..  but having done my research, spoken to my GP this morning, his mother and my mother, we do believe its likely to be BPD.

I would, however, love to know your thoughts.. and also, what the hell should I do - I already know divorce is the sensible option, for my sanity. I've lost so much weight from the stress and had a body rash that won't go away - I don't love this man, I love the man I married. Dr Google tells me that marriage can actually be a trigger for BPD.. which would tally up with the timeline.

I am heartboken, confused and lost. 

Thank you for listening/reading."
1351,I just want to ask if it is possible to have several hypomanic episodes and to not be bipolar? Can that be possible?
1352,"Good morning everyone,
    I've been in a manic state and felt like i didn't need medication but i picked up what i was prescribed and i never took the meds. I was prescribed Latuda 80mg. I started taking them because i could feel my depression creeping back and i was afraid to isolate myself like i usually do. I feel as though my jaw is really clinched tightly all the time, oranges taste funny to me now, my blood sugar is always high no matter how much weight i lose or how little i eat, and i get these headaches in the frontal lobe of my brain. Ive only been taking the meds for about a week. Are these side effects normal or should i consult my doctor asap? I feel like i bother people a lot with this question lot and to be honest i can feel the medication keeping the depression at bay. Any info is greatly appreciated! thanks!"

My question is when he goes to his grandma’s  every other weekend he Often forgets to take his Abilify those two days. Yes we have tried to remind him but it turns out to be a real struggle. My question is the fact he “misses” those doses every other weekend is it really a big deal?
1354,"So I'm here to hopefully get some advice about what my next step is, although I am not diagnosed with bipolar I'm certain that I do have it, my family has a long line of mental health issues and other things that attribute to my belief (sorry if assuming this upsets anybody, it is not meant to).

I've been to the doctor and as much as my depression and anxiety will let me I keep in contact with him but each time we have a session he explains that its due to life situation and that once that improves then we should see a change, whether it be the medication working or generally my mood beginning to improve.
This makes me feel like there is no hope and that nothing can be done, to the point I've tried to kill my self a few times recently sheerly due to lack of hope in what could/will be, the problem being that the times I am ""up"" enough to call or go and visit the doctor or do something constructively positive in my life I always tell myself to enjoy the good mood and have some fun, I know this is wrong but I do not know how to take myself away from that and be responsible.

Without going into detail I have had a bad upbringing and for certain that has something to do with my situation mentally and in life its self, I know that people will have been in my situation before and was hoping that anybody could give me an insight into what its like for your problem to seemingly be brushed aside due to the assumption of another person, and if anybody has not so much a solution but something that will help me deal with or cope enough to see this through.

I do not have family around that will support me, I feel this is due to me not accepting the help that was offered and acting like it was all fine, I do not have parents around to help me either, I am on my own in regards to my situation and hope that'll be taken into account if anyone has a comment about this."
1355,"Man has it been an interesting and rough winter. I've had my share of dark depressing days/nights. There have been great times but there have also been lots of hard times and bad memories. I always feel anxiety going into September/october because I know I have a rough few months ahead. Now that we're near the shoulder of winter I feel better. 

About 4/7 days a week I experienced some kind of personal tragedy and even a few family tragedies as well. Ninety percent of my devastating memories happened during winter. This last August-October I was especially anxious and I was not ready for another hellish winter. Not to mention we got literally 10x the snow and precipitation we got last year where I live. Last year you could go hiking and the ground was dry and bare for the most part. It was a very dry mild winter. This year we've had so much snow I have gone weeks/months without seeing any bare ground. The last time the ground wasn't covered in snow was sometime in mid November. Anyway how has your winter been?"
1356,"I hardly ever come on the forum these days
I missed being here around like minded people. I had tough 12 months but too everyone's suprise here I am doing really well.
I look back and think I cant believe I am here.
This time last year my husband and I split. I didn't how I could survive without him. 
I wanted to end my life I had decided that this time I am going to do it there will be no ringing for help this time.
I was going to get so drunk then take all my pills then that's it. I had the means to do it but this time I won't chicken out. I  believed that this time I can't live without my husband. Luckily my support worker made the decision right their and then to admit me. So under the mental health act. I am so grateful that I am here living on my own theres just me and the dog. 
I didn't realise how negative and controlling my husband had become. No wonder my mental health was declining. It wasn't till I was on the ward that it became clear how my situation with my husband actually was. 
I could have ended things but here I am so more relaxed than I have been in years and years.
Incredible. 
My pdoc and support worker were baffled why I hadnt told them how things were at home. I didn't realise until I was on the ward that their was a reason I was struggling
Isn't amazing the damage one person can do.
My ex had been a rock to me but yeh I guess these things happen"
1357,"DIVORCE BIPOLAR PARTNER 

Lost my wife to this in 2010...and was in for the long-haul to get her back. but she never came back, something else did, and didn't love me, care or wanted any connection to me. I tried for years and was taken to breaking point by this person who had no emotional response or action to my distress. She has been sectioned a few times now and our daughter (who is now 16) has seen it all in her mother and got services in to take her away.

In short I had an 8 yr marriage of much happiness and then a descent into hell with someone who was not connected to me whatsover and no marriage at all for the next 8 yrs - emotional torture is a pretty accurate to what happened. I seperated 1 year ago and now explained that I want a divorce.

I have money to give her that we had from 2010, when we were a couple....then my father up and died and in her Mania when our marriage did not exist (but my fathers inheritance came to me). My wife wants half of this now, and I am torn, as she has not been involved for 8 yrs with me, lifted a finger or acted to save or heal any pain, ran from all doctors I set-up for her (or) fought with them.

What are my legal rights here - I have quite some money to had over, but to hand over half to someone who has tortued your mind to make your existance worthess in life upsets me greatly. I do wish to hold money back for our daughter to go to University and to make an inheritance for her.

I am not trying to be an arse here - its just half my marriage was with an absent partner and bipolar/mania destroyed the family, her and me in the end....what advice can be offered to me to make a peaceful resolution here and not go the lawyers route.

thanks in advance!"
1358,"I've been diagnosed only months ago with bipolar affective disorder. I am on meds and am taking them regularly. I dont feel much of a change in my behaviour as of late. I did notice that I am a bit calmer now.

What are you're experiences with your disorders? I could use an outside perspective."
1359,"Hello everyone! 

I am new to this forum because I'm hoping that this community can give me advise on what to do. So this is a short version of the situation : Someone I know and care about has Bipolar Disorder, he is not doing well, he has broken off our contact and to the best of my knowledge ... he doesn't really talk with family, friends or colleagues (I think he has also been going in less) - let alone about the things that are plaguing him now. However, he did go to the doctor and has a prescription (is that how you call it in English?) so that he can start with a psychologist. 

How can I show support without my care being too much? 
I wonder what kind of experiences you guys have with such a situation? Like, what works for you in periods when you feel bad and don't want to be in touch with others because you can't hide how much you hurt? Does it really work best to just leave you alone then, and when you feel better again ... do you prefer to reach out on your own? Or did you feel supported if someone would maybe sent you an easy text once in a while? Or just have someone ask you how you are feeling? 

He and I haven't known each other for very long at all. But in a short period we did spend quite some time together and we seemed to really connect emotionally & mentally & physically. He had already said early on that he has BD and that he was kind of in a rough patch, also due to some big events in his life in the past years - definitely not all of them good. While we were dating, he came to realize that his BD was worse now than he thought at first. He also became more determined to prioritize his well being. And he realized that our intense contact was too much to keep up. 
I also want to note that ... I get the impression that he doesn't want to share his deeper, darker, sadder emotions and tries to suppress how he feels - unless he feels happy. Ofcourse I love seeing him happy, but I am really here to also know his heavier thoughts & emotions. I have never been romantically involved with someone with BD.  But one of my best friends for over 10 years has BD and I realize now that her friendship & openness has taught me a lot about BD and about loving a person for all of them - not just the easy parts. 

So he's going to focus on himself, on his treatment and on stabilizing. We agreed to not be in touch for a while and that I can later reach out again. He will then try to estimate if we can be in touch through texts, but I expect that we won't be seeing each other for a while. 

Because he and I haven't known each other for that long, this is the first time we're dealing with this. I don't know how I can reach out to him in a way that really seriously abides by what his mind can deal with right now. 
 
That being said, I really care about him, I hate knowing that he hurts so much, and I miss him. But my need to let him know that I care ... is also influenced by the thought that he feels so lonely and that he is keeping other people at bay as well. 
Also, I have never met those other people, so I can't ask their advice about previous times when he felt like this. And obviously, I can't ask him. 

Wow, my story around these questions became a lot longer than I planned! 

Anyway, thank you for your responses, I'm looking forward to learning from you! 

Love, Gemsy"
1360,"Back in March 2018, I was diagnosed with Bipolar II, which explained my heights and depths when it came to excitement/anger and sadness, respectively. I was placed on Lamotrigine (100-150 mg) and it helped about 80% of the way. I’m still having episodes of anger that, when I’m unable to calm myself down, cause me to act out (tear up papers, temptation to throw things, etc.). I haven’t hurt anyone, but my greatest fear is just that. I’m still searching for a therapist, but in the meantime: does anyone else go through this? How do you cope? Thanks!"

1362,"They have changed my  venlafaxine brand and now getting serious side effects

I have been on effexor for many years, I was on the venlafaxine capsule. Since ?May this year they have changed effexor to enlafax its in a capsule form also but it has 3 large beads inside, whereas effexor has minute beads.
Anyway i have been noticing that in my bowel motion is the whole capsule still  intact when i have inspected the capsule its is completely full of white powder.
Also since the change of brand of the venlafaxine i have had an increase in traumatic nightmares and at times night terrors. I also wake in the night my bed is soaked in sweat. This is getting worse. The other night my pj's were saturated my bedding even my top sheet and top blanket.
I have been to the gp in regards to the sweats i have had all the blood tests they could have been done they came back fine.
I found even when I  first started on venlafaxine if i missed a dose or too it later than i normally would i got the sweats and nightmares, which had stopped for a long times now.
I told my mentalhealth support worker about the capsule not being broken down he wasnt very interested.
I am positive this is the cause
Has anyone else had a similiar experience"

1364,"I'm new here, wanting to talk with people who can understand me.  I'm not new to bipolar disorder though, diagnosed 1996 after years of no one realizing what was wrong.

Sometimes I think I have it mostly together, about the same as most folks, sometimes I feel like I'm hanging by a thread.

I was in good shape for a long time, but US health care system, I lost my job, lost my insurance, ran out of medication, and crawling back from those unmedicated months has been tough.  Right now my biggest fear is getting a new doctor, appointment in about 2 weeks, my old doctor is quitting the practice.  He was really good, he got me from barely stable to really stable, and then getting me back to stable when life decided I needed trampling on.

My current cocktail is lamotrigine, quetiapine, and lithium.  I'm starting to take melatonin on a regular basis because as strange as it sounds I'm starting to have trouble sleeping.

Anyway, hello."
1365,"Hi everyone,

I just found this forum and want to use it as a place where I can discuss some of my problems and hopefully find a way to deal with them. Also, I hope I can help others as well, as I know well that mental illness is really tough to deal with.

I was diagnosed as bipolar almost 10 years ago when I had an episode and ended up in a mental hospital. Ever since then, I've done everything I can to keep my life on track, including no longer partying and drinking, eating better, exercising more, and sleeping better. Although I used to be on medication and seeing therapists, I found this was really draining and not very useful and I just wasn't myself when I was on meds, so I stopped doing those things. I know some will criticize me for that, but I've been reasonably well for years without them, and I'd rather have a bit of mood swings rather than lose my creativity, energy, and personality entirely to medication.

Lately though, I've been feeling quite down, and I'm starting to lose the control I've had over my life, so I'm trying to reach out to have a support network that can keep me on the right path. I find the hardest thing to do is to tell those around me about my problems, as they will just consider me crazy and leave me or I will become a burden on them as they try to help me. So, instead I'm reaching out to people online who will understand what I'm going through and hopefully won't judge and may even be able to give me tips to help me through this. In return, I'd be glad to offer my support and help wherever possible.

That's all for now. I'm looking forward to your responses."
1366,"Hello everyone. I'm a 19 year old girl, I'm a student, I'm a waitress, I'm a girlfriend, I'm a daughter, I'm a sister, I'm a friend, I'm extremely bipolar. I was diagnosed almost a year ago. I struggle with extreme depression and bouts of destructive mania. I have yet to be able to figure out my cycles yet. So far within the last year I have had two complete meltdowns. Just completely losing it, basically blacking out, fighting everyone around me (its been my family both times), extremely injuring myself in the process. In these moments i feel unsafe, terrified, and completely out of it. Both of these incidents occurred during mania, consequently bringing it to an end and propelling me into depression. I've kept a journal since right before the first breakdown. The second one happened only 2 days ago. Today I went and read my journal from beginning to present and realized I am repeating a pattern. And it feels so hopeless. I'm depressed, I start feeling optimistic, I pick myself up from the depression, I slide into mania, I spin out, I fall again. I feel like I cant keep going on like this. My family, friends and boy friend try so hard to support me, and it feels like Im doing is hurting them over and over with my erratic and unstable behavior. I say the most hurtful things when I crash. I bruise everyone around me and every time I can tell they look at me a little differently. I know that one day I will lose them all together. I take medication, I go to therapy, I am trying everything humanly possible to be a normal person and yet I still get completely lost in this illness. I feel like it owns me at this point, it takes whatever it wants, and it is taking everything."
1367,"Today started out sorta bad for me. i got into a little argument with my mom. Nothing major or hurtful was said we were just frustrated with each other. Right after the argument i got back into bed and wanted to isolate myself so bad.

I had positive and negative thoughts all at the same time lol but i was only in bed about 15 minutes before i decided to have a sit down with my mom and really talk about it. turns out she was upset about something else and took it out on me. so i just wanted to leave this here to share something positive"

1369,"My doctor bumped up my lithium from 1050 mg to 1200 mg a few weeks ago. I feel much better now: Colors seem brighter, I feel less depressed and anxious.  In addition and quite surprisingly, I also feel less angry or more forgiving to people who have hurt me in the past.

Does anyone else here have an experience of becoming less depressed when their lithium dose was increased?"
1370,"Good Day everyone. I was diagnosed 13 years ago today with Bipolar I and II or as the doctor called Mixed. I was 20 and now 33. My symptoms were extreme. I was hospitalized for a year due to the extreme symptoms I had. For the first little while, the meds had very little effect on me. The dosage of my meds were changing every 2 weeks. After 6 weeks, things were starting to get stable. At 3 months, the meds and dosages was starting help a lot. Then 6 months, I was 100% stable and on meds and the dosages that kept me that way. But they wanted to keep me in longer due to the extreme symptoms I had. So, after another 6 months past, I was finally released and got to home. 

It was a extreme tough year but I managed. But what I didn't realize, how hard it was going to be to get back into society. As I lived in a small town, so word gets around fast. I had next to no friends left, people would ignore me, put me down, etc. It was very emotionally and physically exhausting for me. And I could feel myself slipping back in the dark place I didn't want to be again. I started going to therapy, 3-4 times a week, for about a year. Then 2 times for another year and now 2 times a month. Things started to get easier. Started to enjoy life again. 

But one thing that was never easy nor be able to get into, is a relationship. As I said, I lived in a small town, so word goes around fast. I could never get a girlfriend. The only women that would talk to me was my mom, cousins, aunt, and co-workers at whatever work place I was at. If I tried to approach, a woman i'd get instantly rejected. This was something very difficult to deal with but I tried my best to be positive. Which was hard to do at the time. Even with meds. 

So that brings to the present. I have moved to different cities to live. Even today, I still get rejected by every woman. I do mention that I am Bipolar due for their safety. Maybe it's a bad idea. I'm not sure. 

So, I was wondering if anyone has any suggestions that could help me out with this issue. It almost seems like I was meant to be single forever but I don't want to think that."
1371,Does anybody experience inability to let go of thoughts? I get a thought and it seems as though I just can't finish it.
1372,"Hi I’m looking to add value to the mental health community because I am a part of it as I suffer from bipolar 1 disorder.

1373,"So a few years ago I had an incident with my gallbladder/kidney stones and was ridiculously painful so I went to the ER finally after 6hours of pacing around my living room. I dont/didnt have insurance to ER was really my only option and it was the first time I visited a doctor for non-work related reasons (physicals for certain jobs etc). They couldnt find what was wrong with me after  few tests but said the symptoms were most likely a kidney stone and gave me tips to pass it while perscribing me percocets.
I was dumb and in pain so I followed the instructions for the pills and ended up using all 10 in a matter of about 24hrs. Then I ran out but I felt the pain was probably gone anyway so I went to sleep and wokeup with shortness of breath, nausea, and extreme weakness.

So I went to another ER after this continued for the full day (felt like I couldnt breathe), they took blood tests and said my oxygen levels were fine and it was all in my head. He started asking about me and my mental state I guess, and I told him a couple things about how I felt I always had a constant migraine ""aura"" or like after-images of everything I looked at for a few seconds, and like a gradient i could see almost like a movie that i've seen for as long as I could remember but I ignored easily except when bored as a child. Always had good vision (only person in family without glasses), so it had nothing to do with that. Then I felt i'd gone too far and that he'd say I was schizophrenic and hit me with a tranquilizer dart where i'd wake up in a psych-ward.
He asked me if ive taken benzos, and he explained what it was and that it was for bi-polarism. Told him I tried seroquel as a teen and it was one of the worst experiences in my life as I stared at a wall thinking I was dying from sun-up to sun-down and that I wanted nothing to do with it. He told me it was related but not exact and called xanax; I knew about xanax because some of my acquiantences were addicted. To me they were the skinny yellow pills that even a sniff of would put me to sleep. Also I felt they were dodging responsibilty for saying it was ok to take 2 10g percs every 4 hours or so while symptoms persist, I may be wrong about exact dosage but it allowed me to finish everything in a day. So I said no thank you and went on my way.

3 years later i'm thinking the doctor was on to something as I read more about bipolar disorder. Before the kidney incident I had a very stressful job (to me atleast) because it was transportation and being on time everywhere from 4am to about 9pm. I would wakeup every morning with my heart pounding thinking I was hours late and that the alarm was probably ringing for hours and it was like that commercial where the guy wakes up late for work is screaming throughout the day til he sleeps. Couldn't focus too much on anything unless I found an obsession for a few weeks/months, could be very charming (flirting without even realizing it until its reciprocated, quit wit instead of getting angry over something) one moment and incredibly anxious to get all these people out the way so I can do everything that needs to be done and never leave the house again.

After getting fired for the 2nd time in a year and a half because I despised the socializing ""meetings"" and what I considered ""fakeness"" all around, i'd get fired for bad behaviour or some other excuse to not have my negativity (quiet one hour and very talkative another, with almost no filter) around.

I switched to a PT job so I could study some certifications and skills that would allow me to work more independent and hermit-like, and I also started self-medicating on green xanax. Taking about a third of the bar a day made me feel more focused and more inner silence. Instead of the racing thoughts about EVERYTHING (which would pretty much leave me in my thoughts not taking any action cause ""what if"" and ""this is more important though""), I could focus on certain things I felt like I wanted to do some of the stuff I was thinking instead of just philosophizing about it. I buy from a drug-dealer, obviously, since I turned down the prescription from 3 years ago. I always had extreme tem"
1374,"Is Zopiclone safe to take when Bipolar?

I'm currently receiving care from the crisis team, and one of there Doctors have prescribed me Zopiclone to help me sleep. I'm just wondering since I haven't seen this Doctor and I don't know if he knows my medical history and the fact I am 'suspected' Bipolar, if this medicine is safe to use. On the leaflet it says not to be used if suffering from depression and or any mood disorders. Therefore I'm a bit hesitant to take it. I would hope by now that these things are obvious and apparent to the doctor else why would I be under the care of the crisis team. 

Hopefully seeing him tomorrow or Friday anyway....but any help in the mean time, I would be grateful thank you."

1378,"just came back to see, wow all new look.

hows everyone?  I'm not great."
1379,"I haven't been officially diagnosed, but my psychiatrist thinks I might be bipolar after dealing with mood cycling and two acute psychotic/manic episodes last year. I'm on lamotrigine and it's done a lot to stabilize my moods, but I'm still having a fair amount of fluctuation from one day to the next. Some days I feel pretty good and productive and optimistic about life, and other days I don't really care whether I live or die.

I'm getting better at not taking my emotions too seriously and trying to continue along with taking care of myself and moving toward my long-term goals regardless of how I feel, but I've been having a really hard time lately with decision-making.

Part of the reason I've been struggling with my mental health has to do with issues in my day-to-day life. In trying to make improvements (as slowly as I can to keep stability), I have a hard time feeling any continuity in my choices. For instance, one week I will talk to my husband and know very clearly that we should move to a calmer neighborhood to help my mental health. We'll make a plan for it, and I'll feel good about it in the moment. Then the next day I'll wake up panicked, knowing that there is no way I could handle moving right now.

This has been happening over and over again with a variety of decisions in my life, and the result is I end up not really changing much at all and still being in the same situations that are adding to my depression, anxiety, and detachment. It's starting to put strain on my relationship, as my husband doesn't know how to handle the way I change my mind all the time. And it scares me that what I want seems to change so fast, that I can be so sure about something in one minute and feel completely opposite the next.

Can anyone relate to this? How do you handle moving forward with your life when you are constantly doubting your own thinking process and when how you feel and what you want keeps changing so fast?"
1380,"Hello,
I’ve just joined this forum in the hope of receiving some advice if possible.
I recently befriended a young lady who was 18 and is living with her bipolar mother.
She is diagnosed but refuses medication and smokes pot to ‘relieve her symptoms’.
Her daughter is so kind and caring but she is constantly on edge and it seems like the slightest thing can set her mum off to berate her and call her all sorts of horrible insults. I’ve heard it for myself and it’s upsetting.
My friend shows all the typical signs of being brought up in this environment. Anxiety, no self worth, fear of doing the slightest thing wrong, trying to please everyone, self doubt and taking on board the insults regularly thrown at her such as she is worthless. In contrast when her mum is experiencing better days she begs her not to leave her.
My friend is the loveliest and most considerate and empathetic young woman I have ever met but she is so unhappy at home and is in a constant state of anxiety. 
I desperately want to help her and build her confidence. I want to make her realise she is so bright and her environment isn’t healthy and there is so much more to life.  But she feels guilty at the thought of leaving and her mum, when not in one of her manic episodes, makes her feel it’s impossible to leave.
I just don’t know how best to support her but equally I can’t just watch this amazing young woman being destroyed and made to feel worthless.
If anyone has any advice i would really appreciate it. I adore her and she’s such a lovely person that I just want the best for her. Do you think she would benefit from counselling? 
Thank you in advance, Rachel xx"

I accompanied my son today for his Interview. Since being called in.November his Bipolar has gone haywire. Worried sick hed lose his benefits. Deep depression and then manic. Feeling persecuted.
Anyway I picked him up. Drove 20 miles to interview. He took with him letters from Psychiatrist CPN Enablement Officer etc supporting his diagnosis.
We sat down with assessor, my son chatting away to her, explaining his diagnosis 3 yrs ago and a court order to hospitalize him.
She leapt up........""LEAVE""  ""LEAVE""
This interview is suspended. You are a threat to me. I will not continue !!!!
We need Security. I tried to say he was NOT a threat, the order was 3 yrs ago. She would not listen. My son walked out stunned and bewildered. I tried to talk with her ....LEAVE !
Was her reply. As I walked out she locked her door. This action was disgusting and humiliating. I am almost 70yrs old and my son 46. Im sad and lost what to do. I did phone CAPITA and make official complaints.

1382,"I'm new here, I just made my acct to post about this. Bipolar 2, OCD, anxiety, ED.
I'm really scared that I'll never find a job that I like. I wish I could've gone to college but I thought I'd die before I left HS, and then as I was in the last few months of HS, I figured I'd die by age 21 or so and it'd be a waste to scramble to get into college. I remember sitting in my car in the parking lot after walking out of school for the last time and sobbing because I couldn't believe I actually made it but also oh my gosh where do I even go from here.
Well I graduated in 2016, and 3 months later, on my birthday, I started a job doing data entry. And here I am, 2.5 yrs later, still doing data entry. It's good just because it's easy and I can cry and panic at my cubicle without getting in trouble or causing such a deficit in my production that management notices. Low pay though.
I'm married (yes, very young, I know) and I have a quaint little apartment with my boyfriend and 2 birds I really love and a church community that I'm happy to be a part of and a loving family. I take my meds and see a therapist, so even if I never get a satisfying job, I should be okay, right? Like I'm just expecting too much, a lot of people have jobs that they don't like. That's life.
But I would really love a job I could enjoy... I'm scared of going into debt by trying to go to college and my passions are foreign languages, history, linguistics, literature, art, music. Besides being bilingual (not natively) and having a knack for learning other languages fast, I'm worried about finding a career in any the fields I love. There really isn't much that I'd be interested in pursuing that doesn't require a bachelor's degree minimum if I ever want a career in it. And, just being objective, the specific jobs I like are pretty unrealistic.
It just seems like it all cyclically leads into me being stuck in an empty, boring job that sucks the life out of me. And I'm worried about my mental health, being stuck in a mindless, monotonous job for the next 50 years because I don't have the education to go anywhere else. I'll go crazy. And then if I somehow do get a job I'm passionate about, I'm worried my issues will ruin it for me on a day that I'm too distraught or depressed or anxious or whatever to interact with people like a normal person.
I'm just so upset that my bipolar disorder screwed me out of a normal high school experience that included a plan for college which leads to a good career that I actually like. I can't see a way out of it besides debt. I wouldn't consider asking my parents for financial help since, although they offered when I first graduated, I didn't accept it and then I moved out the next year. So I feel it would be unfair to ask them for help once I've already moved out and married, even though they still offer to pitch in for some of the bigger doctor's bills and stuff like that.
I'm just so scared and stressed and frustrated.
Has anybody else gone through this? Going through this? I just need to know somebody else knows what I'm saying."
1383,"Hi everyone, apologies for the length of this post! I had a lot to fit in and didn't really know how to word it briefly! I'm not sure if anyone else has experienced this but for years I have been attempting to get an accurate diagnosis of what conditions I suffer from but to no avail! Personally, I believe I have Bi-Polar, adult ADD and Generalised Anxiety Disorder...I have suffered with my mental health since my early teens and was diagnosed with ADHD as a child. I am now 28 so I have had a good 15 years to really look inside my own head and come to my own conclusions. I'll start this by describing my experience of my conditions and give a basis for the conclusions I have come to on what they are!

I base the fact I believe I have Bi-Polar on my varying up/down moods that have no rhyme or reason. It's not like i'm permanently depressed and like wise, I don't have a permanent smile...but then who does? It's the extremes of the states which I experience that suggest to me I have BP. For instance one day I can be feeling like there's no hope for me and that I may as well give in trying to achieve anything in life. That iv'e f***ed up too many opportunities and relationships in my life to make amends and find any sustained happiness. Even on occasion feeling so low I have had thoughts of suicide, although thankfully, I have never gone ahead with these. My low days are often accompanied by severe fatigue and tiredness. I have always struggled with sleep but I can often over sleep when i'm feeling like sh*t or i'll just generally feel lethargic. More recently, I have been experiencing audio/visual hallucinations - (voices/sounds & peripheral disturbances). Although, I put these latter features down to recent life events and un-naturally high stress levels, as opposed to symptoms of my BP!

Then the very next day for some unknown reason i'll wake up feeling full of beans, with an overly positive outlook on life. literally feeling so excitable and upbeat that i'm twitching to get things done and that my life is all on track...there's no need to worry about anything and that no matter what i'll still achieve the things i'm aiming for. Simply because it's what iv'e set my mind to! I don't become arrogant, it's more like having an un-founded sense of confidence in my life situation and my own resolve to achieve my goals. It's almost like iv'e forgotten the way I suffer with my mental health and infact forgotten the way in which I struggle day to day with so many aspects of my life...From my relationships with family & friends /debt /education /my mere existence on some occasions...and yet none of these concern me at all. I'll have a positive take on just about anything!

I also suffer from bouts of severe anxiety and this can be very un-directed...I simply feel very jittery, and with a sense of dread that something ominous is about to happen. I become very solemn, quiet and I isolate myself, avoiding going out unless necessary and not interacting with people. This rarely happens when I am on a high, although I do sometimes feel a sort of butterflies type anxiety during my good days but i'm that up that my brain bypasses it and I will usually just go about my day un-affected.

Lastly I believe I still have ADD as I struggle to concentrate, I often talk to much, I struggle to organise, I fleet from one interest to another, I forget crucial things like appointments and even things that have happened earlier in the day, unless I am prompted. I can also get very excited and involved in something one minute and then be indifferent about it the next. I fit pretty much all the criteria for adult ADD and yet like with the other two conditions...Doctors/psychiatrists appear reluctant to diagnose it specifically.

I have been diagnosed with ""Depression"" and ""Anxiety""...not even Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Iv'e just been told my anxiety is a secondary symptom to my depression! Whereas I am almost certain that this ""Depression & Anxiety"" are themselves symptomatic characteristics of underlying specific conditions! Telling this to supposed mental health professionals however, is for me like talking to a brick wall. The most I have got out of one of them is ""It is very possible, although, unlikely that I have these conditions"" and that ""They are very difficult to diagnose as a lot of the symptoms of different conditions overlap"".

These statements may very well be true...However, I find it somewhat unprofessional to be aware of the potential of one condition and then to neglect further investigation and diagnosis, in choice of diagnosing another...simply because the symptoms are similar? In my experience the overwhelming majority of doctors are taking the ""safe option"" by diagnosing ""Depression"" when their patients have one or more conditions that present similarly! Now that's not to say that depression is any less of a serious condition. I understand it is a very real and debilitating condition, one that millions of people suffer with to varying degrees throughout their lives. I just personally believe a great deal of doctors are ignoring many aspects of the conditions their patients present with and are taking this safe option all too often.

By this I mean they are glossing over the finer details in the way in which their patients symptoms present and are making the assertion that anyone feeling down is ""depressed"". Meaning people are being made to suffer with underlying conditions that are not being correctly treated, as they are promptly ushered out of their clinicians offices, with a prescription for one of several generic SSRI's. - (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitors) - ""Anti-Depressants"". This for me seems highly dangerous?..As using these as treatment for all manner of conditions, based on the fact said conditions exhibit features of one!... is not treating the condition! As such, I imagine many people, myself included are effectively going un-treated! 

I am not sure how many of you can relate to this or have experienced something similar in your interactions with clinicians? Which is why I have started this thread, I hope it will encourage people to talk about this as I can't be the only one who has experienced it to this extent? I feel it is something that should definitely be debated and hopefully those who have had positive interactions with mental health professionals and or simply got the correct diagnosis...will be able to provide some support and idea's on how to proceed for those who continue to struggle every day to get the diagnosis they both need and deserve!

Thanks guys!"
1384,"I was reading how scientist can tell that  you are in depression by voice change and other characteristics that do change while someone is  up or down.
      Then I thought about my case and what changes. I am bipolar type II plus some rapid cycling. i.e change in movement - activity, tonality, environment preference ( more dark and quiet environment and thought, what if I record those and be able to see small changes before it is too late. So I did mostly using my mobile, some apps and some excel, and to be honest the results showed these  curves on the most of the factors measured, were going downhill- towards depression  Days Ahead from the day I checked that I am feeling depressed , on my mood calendar.

- What really changes between up and down?
- Can you measure it, and save yourself from the next cycle?

I’m noticing some erratic behavior at times and I don’t feel comfortable prying or asking questions this early. I’m hoping to get some insight from others familiar with different mental health issues. He has a history of:
- rage/anger
- feeling self-righteous
- alienating family and friends
- failed relationships, either deserting or being pushed out
- substance abuse
- obsessing over conspiracy theories
- strong faith, then breaking away from faith
- sleep problems
- urinating in strange places (possibly sleepwalking?)
- falling in love quickly and attaching, then distancing
- exercising poor judgment
- depressive states
- excessive energy 
- trouble connecting socially at times
- vanity
- claiming to have seen demons or that someone is possessed 

Do any of these sound like bi-polar? I’ve not witnessed a bi-polar episode so I’m not sure what I’m looking for. Thank you for your help."
1386,"hello, 

i got a friend who was diagnosed with BD2.
she turn to 18 years old this year.

is it true that she could develop huge urges for shopping and sex during her hypomanic episode?

she doing sex for money with strangers or anybody willing to pay her, she keeps wants more money for her to go shopping spree, she started doing this since last year when she was 17.

she taking meds regularly, but keep doing it.

is it possible she got the idea to do it during her hypomanic episode but started to like it and keep doing it?

i was shocked when she agreed for unprotected sex for some amount of money. i tried to stop her, talking about STDs and stuff, but she not going to stop.
she also said this is her choice and had nothing to do with her disorder.

any idea what i could do to stop her to become full time prostitute? or before she catches any of those STDs.

her family dont know she doing this kind of things. and i dont want to betray her trust."
1387,I'm just reaching out to everybody. I'm also curious if anybody's ever had depression and anxiety the same time? I'm wondering if it's a mixed episode. I feel all this anxiety and depression at the same time. It's really hard to describe. I'm not angry or anything I feel kind of depressed having trouble sleeping and eating. Has anyone had a mixed episode or agitated depression or anything like that? Thank you
1388,I am being treated for bipolar 2 an d i was prescribed Divalproex. I've been really bummed lately cause i really don't want to take any meds at all. I took them for 2 weeks and i got a little out of my funk but i missed an appt with my doc on accident and because it was the 4th missed appt (i have been going to this doctor for about 5 years) he would have to let me know if i could still be seen there. So i stopped taking my meds until they got back to me and i got really depressed and didn't leave my room for a couple days. since then I've been struggling again with the idea of taking meds again. They got back to me and told me to refill my prescription but now I'm not sure what to do.

1390,"Is anybody out there a unipolar manic (or hypomanic)? Or do you know one? Or have you ever met one? (I haven't.) Is it really possible to experience just the ""high"" end of bipolar?

If so, how many episodes have you (or the monopolar manic you know) had? How severe were they; was psychosis involved? And how euphoric were these episodes? Was any anxiety, irritability, paranoia, agitation, rage or outright depression mixed in? (I'm wondering whether unipolar manics don't just experience their dysphoria and depression mixed into the mania?) Is it really pssible to live a life free of major depression? (Or minor depression for that matter?) (I'm so manic-depressive, I find it hard to envisage life any other way!)

If there are any unipolar manics out there, I'm interested to know what their personality was like before the condition first manifested. Do they have hypomanic or hyperthymic personality traits anyhow? And what is their functioning like between episodes? Do any manic symptoms persist into normal life?

Details please!  :drool::boo:"
1391,"Dear members,

I am from Germany and looking for help and support. Unfortunately, I cannot find many information on german webpages, thus I signed up here to get some support and your assessment.

Current situation is quite complicated. My ex-girlfriend broke up 2 months ago as she lost feelings. But before, her behaviour changed and she wrote weird things via WhatsApp. But let me explain everything in detail:

I was in a romantic relationship with my girlfriend for 5,5 years. We met with 18 (she) and 19 years. We were a very good team. Never had to argue and always had fun. During these 5,5 years we also lived together in a flat while studying. Approx. 1,5 years ago, I got my Bachelor's degree so we decided to move back to our parents in our common home city. She does not have any friends (!). Just some mere acquaintance (just males). But I never had a problem that she met with these males. It was all just on a friendship basis.

Time passed, but unfortunately she had bad fatalities in her family. Her lovely grandma, living a house next to hers, died. 4 months later, her father had a very bad stroke and is now disabled. Whole family situation changed, she was in the hospital every evening during last months. He will not came back home and will need full-time care in a nursing home. 

3 months ago, my girlfriend suddenly wrote weird things. To that time, she did not need to sleep any more. She wrote poems during the night. Something she has never made before. Suddenly she also said that she is not satisfied with our relationship. I thought, a 2 weeks break could be an option in order to find together again and thinking about feelings to each other. We agreed on neither seeing or contacting us during these 2 weeks. But just some days later she wrote whatsapp messenges to me. I tried to ignore these and wrote a letter about my feelings to her and printed out some pictures of us. She got it and said that she had to cry while reading it.

She also wrote that she does not deserve me and how I interpret our break and if we are still in a relationship. I answered ""yes"", of course, but she responded as follows:

During the past weeks she does not see any limits and just need 2-3 hours of sleep at night to feel well. Everything does not matter and she is very impulsive. I do not deserve everything what she has done and is doing. She feels unpredictable and has a suddenly complete change in her moral and behaviour but she feels very happy. She dodged paying the fare: something she would never ever do!!! She wondered and informed in the internet about that. The consultant said to her that she might have symptoms of bipolar disorder.
After that she came to my home and broke up. She also said that she cheated on me (just in her mind) with a mere acquaintance because she is having a crush on him. That is the reason she wanted to break up as she does not love me anymore.

I was severly shocked and decided to make an appointment at a psychologists - I thought she needed professional help as she also tried to get help but just with an internet hotline. Suddenly she did not have any disease insight. She feels well and do not want that this will stop. ""After every high episode will also follow a deep episode - but now she is happy to have such a good mood despite the very bad family situation."" She wanted to enjoy her mood and her mere acquaintance is a good deflection. She now meet him more frequently.

Weeks passed and she wrote very hurtful things and wrote that she still have a crush on him but still see future with me. She had lack of emotions, was cold. At least that was my believing.

Last week she wrote that she wants to have contact with me again but just on a friendship basis. That's her biggest wish. I responded that I cannot have just a friendship relationship and never will be able to just be a friend. Because I will always love her. We are not on the same level with our feelings and I do not want to suffer from this situation. I have not seen her for 2 months but we wrote WhatsApp messenges.

Now I do not know how to go on. First question is, if she really has bipolar disorder and currently is in her mania and thus fall in a manic love that will disappear when she get depression. I really hope that she fall in love with me again. She said, that she is often missing me but just as a friend. I do not know how to treat her. She really hurt me but I still love her. 

- What do you say about that history? 
- Do you think she has a bipolar disorder? 
- Should I wait for the depression? 
- How much time can pass after a depression starts after a mania?

Thank you very much!"

1393,How can I help calm down my boyfriend when he's having a mood swing?
1394,"My boyfriend and I have been dating 7 months he is unmedicated and has constant mood swings

He constantly says hurtful things and doesn't understand what he did was wrong or apologize unless I explain to him how what he said hurt my feelings. Otherwise he will act like nothing happened.

We argue constantly over mean things he says or when he acts unemotional or with lack of empathy

(When he does understand what he did he's very affectionate and apologetic)

The periods in between instances like these he claims he wants a family, he loves me more than anyone he's ever met and that he loves my daughter unconditionally.

He can't afford medication and he's scared if he gets back on medication he will be a zombie like he was when he was medicated as a child, but he has warn me down to where if he says something cruel I can't help, but cry.

I really want this relationship to work, but I can't handle him if he doesn't get better. I try to be understanding because I know it's because he's bipolar and it's his illness not his personality, but it's hard to handle it anymore."
1395,"I have come to realize as of late that I am in a truly helpless situation (I know that sounds melodramatic, but there really is no helping me, aside from somebody handing me thousands of $ and I have never received a hand out and never will).

And the 5 years of suffering at my last job basically means nothing right now as I'm gonna be made to pay thousands of $ I dont have to a credit card company (I realize a lot of that is my own fault for getting the credit card and then using it up that much; but there was also a case of fraud where I was charged way too much for stuff I didn't even get and the credit card company sided with the people that charged me for the stuff I didn't even get).

Once they start taking money (which I cant help, I have to keep working I dont have time to go to court or the money to pay an attorney; the credit card company is counting on this so they are gonna make me pay substantially more than I actually owe as they are going to court and once the judge signs it all I can do is keep working and some day they will be paid off) I will be financially worse off than I was the last 5 years at my last job; so yeah they erased all the progress I had because they will not work with me and all I can do is wait and see how bad it really is.

But anyways, the point is, through this all I am a terrible person right now that is no good to anyone, the best thing I can do is distance myself from anybody online and try to not let my emotions show so I dont drag down the people in my real life as well.

These large corporations dont know (or care) about the struggle the average guy faces and the best thing anyone can do is not put themselves in this situation I am in.

I will never use credit ever again, I was naive to think it was a good idea in the first place and even though a few mistakes is what really screwed me over, I am still essentially to blame for putting myself in this situation.

Man I cant believe I was so stupid."

1401,"I think I'm eating too much. My medication is supposedly the least weight-gain of them all, but I don't believe it. I've gained a lot of weight these past three years.

I used to be at 98lbs. Now I'm closer to 150 (our scale broke so I don't know for sure). I went from a comfy size 0 to a size 8.

I know my alcohol issue isn't helping. But I'm trying to eat less and I feel like it isn't working. I'm trying to count calories but I keep losing count.

Today I had a packet of ramen, a couple sodas (for the caffeine), a handful of goldfish, an energy drink (I work til late), and just now I had three eggs instead of two. I also had alcohol (a spiked tea from the convenience store). I don't even want to know how many calories I've had today. And I still want a popsicle... we don't have any fruit for me to eat, no veggies. We ran out.

Sometimes I do well. I eat some goldfish, a soda, and a salad. Those days I feel okay. I know I don't eat well but I don't have any money to buy groceries, I depend on my roommate and he does the best he can. He's amazing. I feel so guilty...

Sometimes I'll have breakfast and dinner AND a snack, plus alcohol and soda... it's too much.

I can't quit drinking. It helps keep me from hurting myself. How do I eat less to make up for it?

It's out of control. I just eat too much. How do you guys control it? What do you do to eat better?

I've also been shaky (maybe due to waking up at 3am after 2 hours of sleep).

Does anyone else take Cymbalta? Are you having/have you had these symptoms?

I'm going to give it a shot anyway. I've learned to let things even out before writing off a new prescription as not working. But I want to know if the sleeplessness and sickness will stop...

1410,"Hi 

I am new here, so I will go into my past in a little bit of experience. 

I have all ways had MH issues
March 2017 - diagnosed with Dysthymia and emotional dysregulation 
September 2017 - cyclothymia and anger management 
March 2018 - traits of emotional unstable personality disorder (BPD) 

Referred for an Autism assessment, joined the waiting list March 2018, expected assessment date March/April 2019. 

I have been on medication in the past, but not currently on any. 

So I have two things I would like to discuss, treatment and support from NHS and then the second one how I cope with my issues. 

So I have had real issues with the NHS and my local authority, I am current attending CBT, which is going ok, but I have had issues with this in the past as I was given two councillors who didn't work for me and didn't help me, I had to fight for 4/5 months to see a third one, I finally saw a third one, after one of the first two left the service. But at the moment I am thinking of stopping this due to the help I am getting. 

I had an assessment at my local PCLS service last week, as a new assessment, but they did it as a review assessment which wasn't meant to happen. I went into the assessment with two mental health nurses, they didn't even introduce themselves, one just sat in the corner, watching, not talking, which I felt was very odd and uncomfortable, the assessment was a waste of time, I have received my outcome letter and it was poor, they got basic information wrong and didn't offer any support, just referred me back to my doctors, who are useless and if I go back to them for advice they will just refer me back to PCLS. 

So onto the second thing, I really struggle with mood management and mood swings, I can get a mood switch any time, it flips like a light switch, sometimes I can explain my mood swing, but sometimes it's caused by nothing. It can last for an hour or days, my last one started Monday lunch time and ended Wednesday night. I have coping strategies but they don't all ways work, most of my mood swings are down ones, so the only way I explain it is I am two different people. Normally I am a nice person, can cope in day to day life, with some small struggles which is where my potential autism comes into it. 
But when I am having bad mood swing I am can be a bit aggressive, very short with people, if people contact me who are trying to help I will get rude with them and tell them I don't want any help, I have since realised this is why all my friends have backed away from me so lost all my support, I have also lost two jobs because of this, I have tried to explain to both employers about it but they just didn't care or understand. So as you can understand its very difficult. 

I get very stressed and very frustrated with people and the situation I am in. 

Would appreciate any thoughts or any help on my issues, your welcome to ask any questions if you have any. 

Thanks"
1411,"anyone up for talking for a bit?


I'm not great.

about anything, you pick a topic?"
1412,How long does rapid-cycling last ?
1413,"Hi everyone 

I'm new here so hope you can offer me some of your insight. 

I've been going out with a bipolar girl with schizoaffective disorder for two years. At the start of our relationship she called it off because she thought it was too much 'pressure'. 

I realised she didn't have her bipolar under control and after she agreed to see a new doctor and subsequently a new psychiatrist - she became much better - all with good results. And we fell back into a great and loving relationship. 

As I'm sure you know too well - there was still some rapid-cycling times when she was not 'right' as such and sometimes - as she put it - her brain 'wasn't right'. During this period she would start to question many things in her life - sometimes including me - however I always offered her reassurance and continued to care and love her. 

Over the past couple of weeks things have spiralled down slightly. She suddenly wanted some reassurances from me regarding what we want for the future - inparticular moving in together, getting married and having kids. I told her that 'yes' - these are still all on the cards (a lot of these emotions were triggered by her going to a girlfriend's wedding, having her 38th birthday and her grandmother becoming ill - all quite understandable). 

When talking to her about all of these though - I could see she was having trouble processing it all. She kept shaking her head, telling me she wished her 'head would stop', that she 'hates this feeling' and then sleeping excessively afterwards. Her home was also a complete mess which I know by now - is not a good sign... 

Two days later - more questions regarding the above - again I reassured her where we both stood. And at work the next day she told me she wasn't good again - I asked if she had any doubts about us and she said 'no, - why - should I? That will make me think about that now'. 

That night she didn't want me to come over and when she got home from work she just slept right through to the next day. 

The next night I went and saw her and again - she was excessively tired and not good at all. She was glassy eyed, dissociating and she was even showing me the scars on her wrist where she had once tried to commit suicide - although she told me she'd never do that again. 

Again - she was banging her head - and shaking it - saying she 'had all these thoughts trying to get to the front'. 

She went to bed and I had no contact with her until she texted me saying she didn't want to see me that morning - but wanted to talk later in the day. She said she hadn't been to sleep - went for a walk around 2am and then drove a considerable distance because she 'needed to think'. 

When I met her later she told me she thought we needed a break - and that she 'needed space'. She also said she loved me but wasn't 'in love' with me anymore. She's also continually bringing up that I don't love her or find her attractive anymore etc. 

We discussed all this calmly but she said she 'wished her head would stop'. 

I have given her the space she asked for and haven't contacted her for three days. 

This was a girl who I saw and spoke to every day - and now - nothing. 

Any thoughts on what is going on? Am I handling this the right way? Is there any danger in leaving her alone now? 

Thanks for any kind help - I 'd really appreciate it. 

Regards Scott Patterson"

1415,How is it like when cyclothymia starts for the first time?
1416,"The darkness consumes me . It's horrible the lonelyness of this place just eats me alive. But it's in that time alone and dark that I relive everything in my life. I often wake in the night screaming from the night terrors , they've increased the sleeping medication to reduce it we'll see how that goes. I hurt in places I didn't know existed and this depression is just destroying me i've sunk into a place I haven't known before I never knew it could be so god dam dark. My body doesn't function cause infections and being so damn thin has destroyed so much if me and damaged my organs and they still won't repair, They one day I'll get better I don't believe there lies. You can't fix something when half the pieces are missing. I hurt constantly. I regret so much the biggest one never being able to take my life as I wish I could I always got that wrong I don't know how but I did someone always saved me but the thing is they didn't save me they only made it worse. The voices are so bad I am constantly reminded that food is just going to make me far and that I shouldn't eat. They tell me how bad of a person I am and how i deserve all of this can't say I don't believe them .  The daily routine here never changes , I prefer to lay in bed. My therapist is a **** for a start he's male, nope I don't want to tell a man how a man ruined my life . I lie in bed most days I don't want to shower I don't want my medication but I take that. I hope they will make a mistake and give me to many and kill me. It's so dark here all I feel is darkness, I'm consumed by if and it's killing me but my body still has to be here cause I can't even get hold of anything in this place.. I hate this world and this life I hate everything In it. I don't remember what happiness feels like I can't remember when I have ever been really happy. My brain lost its shit as such a young age I don't remember having all my shit together . I want to run but even then I don't have the energy to do it .

Why can't this end . I hate this world . I hate this world. I hate my world  I hate this place but I also hate the outside . Can't I just die now."
1417,Does lithium make episodes of hypomania and depression from bipolar last less long?
1418,"I have bpd, but I suspect to have bipolar II as well because I have had episodes I have never experienced to these past weeks that include euphoria and depression. I mean I can be euphoric where I'll talk, I'll have ideas, I will not be able to sit without moving all around the apartment, and moments where I have depression, I wish I was dead I'm tired and life seems too hard for me. Can you guys help? Have I bipolar II?
My psychiatrist doesn't care about me so she doesn't answer to my questions and I can't reach for another one because I live in a small city, so there aren't many psychiatrists.."
1419,"We took the dogs for a run in the park and then left them in the car while we made a pit stop in the store. IT WAS NIGHT. It was not hot. Some dumb young woman came up to me and said, ""I almost broke your window. You left the dogs in the car without cracking the windows.""  She even had them make an announcement in the store which we wondered if that was our car.

I got so angry. Dogs and children die in cars during the day, not night. 

All my background on love thy neighbor and deal with people in a loving way just went out the window. I was just so angry that she would suggest we are not good to our doggie children. I'm so angry I can't eat dinner. I have so much adrenalin. And I completely forgot to be kind to this idiot young woman.  And now I can't stop thinking about it. The argument goes on and on."
1420,"Hi everyone! 
  I'm new to the forum, I have struggled with mental illness for quite a while and don't have many people in my life who understand mental illness. I'm hoping to make some connections on here. I have a diagnosis of ADD, Anxiety, Depression, Bipolar disorder. Finding the right medication combination has been a challenge for me. I have tried Cymbalta, Effexor and Xanax, with no positive results. When I first started seeing a psychiatrist, he suggested a very low dose of seroquel, but I have heard nothing but negative things about that medication so I decided not to take it. So basically for the last 2 years i've been taking 0.5mg of Clonazepam 3x per day. My bipolar disorder has been taking over my life the past few months, I quit a really good job out of no where and making other rash decisions, have been getting little to no sleep, etc. I can't take it anymore, i'm going to see my doctor tomorrow. Does anyone have any reccomendations for a mood stabilizer that has worked for them? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

1421,I love it right now I love physical pain it is amazing it is the best feeling ever cause it's real . Also it makes me feel closer closer to the end . That would be nice . I feel like I can't get death right and that makes me so angry I even fuck up killing myself imagine that . So I keep thinking about possibilities but I guess I'm not sure what one is best hmmmm I could try a couple . Also I wonder what happens after I think I'll be having dinner with Satan like imagine it sitting and having dinner with all the bad people in the world . Maybe   ...   All the bad people got into heaven instead cause don't you just get forgiven anyway . Hmmmm so I've been thinking and really I need to go and just go on holiday or something or maybe just maybe I should disappear then if I went on holiday and I killed myself noone would know . And then they'd all be like a mysterious things about me and wondering where I am . That would be interesting I guess. I think when I die I want to be cremated don't bury me with the bloody creatures no thanks . I also wonder what happens next. Hmmmm all I want to do is self harm it's all I have done all day I'm running out of skin I swear.  This life is horrible it really is
1422,"My meds are no longer working. Every night I can't fall asleep until 1am and then I wake up at 3am and think, ""WTF""."
1423,"Not sure if this is the appropriate forum, but given my condition, I think it is.

I'm a 26 year old guy. Last year I was diagnosed  with type 1 bipolar with psychotic features, along with schizophrenia and pstd. I was in therapy and on medication. I was doing pretty good and my therapist said she didn't think I needed therapy anymore (though I think her decision was impacted by my losing medicaid and not being able to pay for the services), and I stopped taking my medication a few months ago because they made me feel like shit.

Over the past couple weeks, I have been having some pretty strong anger issues (along with others, but the anger is the most prevalent) and it keeps getting worse. I've always had issues with anger, especially in my late teens and early 20s, but I got it under control, or so I thought. Now they are coming back. Pretty much everything sets me off, though I have realized it gets worse at work. I've also realized that part of the reason I get angry at work is because I'm getting fed up with watching my coworkers standing around and letting be do the vast majority of the work. But while getting upset about those things is normal, I don't think it justifies the rage and even homicidal thoughts I am dealing with.

It's not just the anger. There's also other issues. And I know, the first thing I will be told is to go back on my medications. But that's just not an option right now. I can't stand the way they make me feel and how muddled my brain gets. I also can't afford them And I can't have my brain muddled right now as I am finally back in college and need to be able to think clearly. If I go back into my depression and get suicidal again, I will try to get back on my meds, but for now, I can't

1424,"Dear all,

would anyone be interested in establishing a cyclothymia sufferers support network in London?

I know sufferers are all involved in thier personal battles with mood disorders, wrestling with medication, CBT, families and partners. I think there is a notable absence of support for this condition which is poorly understood especially given that sufferers are capable of normal functioning even without medication in some cases. But, we live our private livees surging from one mood to the next. CBT itself has a limited impact on mood changes, except in helping us to understand the things that may drive us from one mood state to another.

i have searched the web for adequate resources and support groups but have found none specific to this condition. I am currently contacting a few local chairirites and groups in London to look at the possibility of establishing a meet-up for cyclothymics. Please feel free to contact me with any ideas you might have.

Please sign up to the cyclothymia and mood disorders group (group12) and open any discussion and post ideas you might have.

best wishes

1425,"I've done a ""journal thread"" here before, in 2016, under another account the name and password of which I can't remember.  It went very well, and all the support I got from the community really helped.  I'm going through another period of change right now, so I'd like to try it again.

For the record, I started out just posting these to Reddit's r/bipolar as a series of separate threads, but I'd like both collect them in one place and see what kind of feedback I get here as well.

Here's the first entry.  It's the simplest:

Friday, 11/23/18:

All my life, I've been too depressed and anxious to hold down a job, and I just ruined a new relationship with a beautiful, awesome woman who checked all my boxes: I had a panic attack after she didn't return my texts for a day, I told her, and she dumped me. I don't blame her. This is a wakeup call.

I've been miserable every day of my adult life, but it ends today. I'm going to have my meds adjusted and get back into therapy. I'm not going to be like this anymore."
1426,"i can't stop..

anything is setting me off...


i really do think I should ""exit""   I can't do this pain."
1427,"Hi Everyone, I am Nancy from Ontario Canada. I am 33 years old.  I am new to the forum. My only reason of becoming a member is to share my success story and encourage you if you are suffering from Bipolar or other mental illness. My bipolar disorder was/is really really severe, but if I am doing so well right now, I think anyone is potentially treatable. 

When I was an infant, I was one of those babies that cry all the time. When I was a kid, I was described as very shy and introverted. I had a lot of phobias, I was afraid of spiders, bugs, rodents, darkness and ironically, death. My mental health got worse by the time I was a teenager. I was very sensitive and neurotic. It would take me forever to get over a negative encounter whereas someone else in the same shoes might not care at all. Between 16 to 18, for countless nights, I would stay awake for the entire night for no major reason. I always had this enormous amount of mental energy that kept me thinking all the time. The pace of my thoughts was always very fast. Being an extremely negative person, I always thought of people and things in their worst. When I turned 18, I started to date someone for the first time in my life. At the time, it was very special; I was happy, excited and extremely obsessed. When the relationship ended after just 4 weeks, the clinical symptoms of depression began to unfold and my journey officially started.

The very first symptom was insomnia. No matter what I did, how I tried, I could not fall asleep. Part of my brain was really tired and exhausted and I was yearning all the time, but the rest of my brain was wild awake. The pace of my thoughts was firing like a machine gun, I could not stop thinking. Even taking 5 sleeping pills before bedtime, I couldn’t even get a nap. There were a lot of physical symptoms, I felt like my heart was beating fast, I had this huge headache 24/7, and a strong phobic feeling over nothing.

Two weeks without any sleep, I started to have suicidal desires. At first, it was only on and off, I wanted to die but I wasn’t thinking about how to actually commit suicide. Four weeks of not getting any sleep, the nature changed. I started thinking of ways to do it. People described it as a “suicidal ideologies, or suicidal thoughts”, but that was not an accurate description of its nature. It was more like a need to die, a biological need. It was even more powerful than the needs for food and water. During my latter days, I could not even feel if I was hungry or thirsty. I could not even feel if I wanted to go to the bathroom. It was a completely debilitation of my brain.

The only thing I was interested in doing was Google searching for different ways that people had committed suicide or reading stories about how people got killed. I was hoping to receive some kind of “inspirations” from reading their stories, because ironically I was afraid of all the pain and suffering before death. Finally, there was one day, I found a bottle of pills in my mom’s drawer, it was used to treat my insomnia and there were 60 pills inside. I consumed the entire bottle before bed time and lost consciousness after 10 minutes. The next morning, I actually woke up. I was really dizzy. I lost all the strength in my body. My brain was numb by that much dosage. I got sent to the hospital. It turned out that the medication was very mild. It did not do any lasting damage to my body and my brain. I simply stayed in the hospital for three days before being discharged back to the community. I was prescribed with anti-depressants, but after taking it for a week, it appeared to be ineffective. I was still unable to sleep and my symptoms got even worse. So I stopped taking them, which turned out to be a huge mistake, because for any types of psychotropic medications, it would take at least 3 weeks to kick in. I felt like at the time no one gave me any education about my condition, not even the doctors in the hospital. My family doctors were all focusing on the cause of my depression, which was that breakup. 

At the time, I was in grade 12, I had to write my final high school exams in order to graduate. I had no mental capacity to do any reading and studying, thus I knew I would not be able to go to university. That was just another layer of big stress. Many people in my school heard about what happened to me. Prior to my depression, I was a very negative and judgemental person. I really despised people who resorted to suicide. Ironically, that was the exact reaction I received from people in my life. No one understood why I would kill myself for someone whom I dated for only 4 weeks. My parents tried everything to help me or talk me out of my depression. But when I saw that they were down on their knees begging me not to hurt myself, I told them that I hated them because they brought me into this world and I was not supposed to be born in the first place. At that time, I felt like I had lost the ability to love and sympathize. I was devoid of any types of human emotions. I was a psychopath. I even thought about killing my parents because they were protective, they were watching my every move. Now that I hear stories of mentally ill people committing horrible crimes, I can relate to their mentality. They are not born evil. Killing one's self is a really difficult commitment, by killing others, they leave themselves with no choice but to end their life, better yet, the police would do the job for them. Suicide by Cop is definitely real and it's the most legit motive behind every massacre. 

The morning of June 20th, 2003, I got up with a plan to commit suicide, my parents had already done everything they could to prevent things from happening. I tricked my dad by telling him that I wanted to get some fresh air outside. Later on he said that for some reason, his mind was a blur at that moment and he had no idea why he would believe me whole-heartedly. I made an attempt on my life, my dad tried to stop me. Afterwards I was conscious and I remember the exact second when I knew the damage I had done. But I was surprised that I was nowhere near death after what I had done. It was a pure miracle that I didn’t sustain a brain injury or any internal traumas. On my way to the hospital, the ambulance did not even sound its siren.

Three days later, I was seen by my psychiatrist for the first time. He began to put me on a whole bunch of medications. The amazing thing was, I started to feel sleepy and drowsy after 2 weeks being on these medications. I was able to fall asleep on the third week. As the pattern of my sleep was gradually restored, my symptoms of depression were dramatically improved and by the time I was discharged from the rehab hospital, I realized that my depression was treatable. If I had been medicated in time, I would never have jumped. I asked myself, how would I be able to live with this regret for the rest of my life?

By the time I was out of rehab, I was already 60 lbs heavier. My mom took me to a barber and got me a really short haircut, I could barely recognize myself in the mirror. Prior to being in a wheelchair, when I saw someone with a disability, I just thought their legs don’t work. But in reality, there are so many other medical complications. A spinal cord injury would also affect a person’s bladder and bowel function, there is also the risk of osteoporosis, blood clots, pressure sore, and what bothered me the most was nerve pain. I had to take strong pain killers at night to fall asleep.

As expected, for the following four years of my life, I was living in hell. I had no self-esteem and no hope for the future. I was filled with regrets, resentment and hate. I eventually went back to school, but it was really hard being one of the few people with a physical disability. On top of that, I had to face people from my high school, who knew about my past. I was jealous of my classmates who had friends, who were invited to parties. I was just a lonely loser. This time, I had a legit reason to be depressed.

In 2006, I was once again admitted into a psychiatric facility after not sleeping for 7 days straight. I was hallucinating, delusional and insane while I was in the hospital. After observing my behaviors and symptoms I was then formally diagnosed with bipolar disorder. When I first got injured in 2003, the doctor thought I had depression, but they didn't know that I was actually manic before my depression (during my 4 weeks romance, I was extremely manic and obsessed). During the three years post injured I was placed on anti-depressant, which was the trigger of my second episode of bipolar disorder. 

I later on learned that, for people with bipolar disorder, we are born up to 20 percent more neurons in our brain compared to an average person, and those neural activities are particularly excitable, which explains why I was always overflowing with mental energy even when I was a child. In 2007, my psychiatrist switched me to a new medication for my condition. It was Lithium Carbonate, a predominate treatment for bipolar patients. This medication was like poison to me. My acnes were so bad that my face was literally disfigured. Kids in public would get scared when they saw my face! I had sores breaking out everywhere. To cope with all my stress, I turned to eating and I was really overweight at that time. I was really depressed to a point where I wanted to give up again. But what really prevented me from ending my life this time was seeing the suffering I had caused on my parents. Also, I had become a Christian at that point. Though my faith was so small, I believed that God would intervene eventually. 

In 2007, my doctor switched me to a medication Epival, it was actually a predominant treatment for Epilepsy. After a month being on Epival, I woke up one day and felt like a completely different person. I was just happier. At first I was confused and I didn’t know why. As I continued to take that medication, my mental health was getting better and better, and for the first time in 22 years, I realized what it was like to be a “normal” human being. The way I experienced my inner state, the experience of being a human, was completely different compared to ever before! That was the major turning point in my life. 

It's been 11 years, I have not had another psychological breakdown since (no matter how tough life gets). More amazingly, my personality changed. I am now a very outgoing and positive person, the quality of my sleep is superb, I don’t have phobias anymore, and my creativities, artistic and musical abilities have also been enhanced. I am able to reach my potential as a human being because of the right medication. My life now is beautiful. Though I have to use a manual wheelchair to get around, I am a very happy and productive person. I love my job, I love speaking to raise awareness about mental health among high school kids. I am so grateful that I am not meant to die on that day and I was given this second chance. I praise God each day for His ultimate salvation.

I am still taking Epival (500mg) and an anti-psychotic medication called Seroquel (125mg) everyday, unconditionally everyday, most likely for the rest of my life. But I have no problems with it, I do not experience any side effects, aside from the fact that I cannot bear my biological child. If you are going through Bipolar or any other mental illness, here are some insights to keep in mind: 

1) Mental illness is a medical condition, it's an illness with our brain, just like an illness with other organs in our body. In such case, in my opinion, medical intervention, i.e. taking medications, is the only effective treatment. When someone has diabetes or kidney disease, they would not hesitate on taking medications as prescribed, but people with mental illness are so reluctant to take medications and they think that they can just tough it up. It' beyond a person's will power to overcome a mental illness. I believe that most mental illness is a permanent condition which cannot be cured, but can only be treated. I won't be able to maintain my sanity without medications. But I have no problems with that. Just like someone who is born with Type I Diabetes, they need insulin for life. Nothing wrong with that. 

2) It is very hard to find the right type of meds and the right dosage. For me, it didn't happen until 4 years after my injury. and it took another 2 years to figure out the right dosage without giving me side effects. It's a journey that requires patience and working with your psychiatrist. If one type of medication doesn't work, don't lose hope, keep on searching until you find something that does. 

3) in my opinion, people do not need to have a motive to commit suicide or kill someone. This is a big misconception. Their motive is merely the fact that they are medically sick. Others in your life should be more aware of this. Instead of focusing on your external problems, try to treat your mental illness first. When you are mentally healthy you will realize that you are a completely different person when it comes to handling all the affairs in your life. You will do things and say things that are more rational and logical, you will be a more interesting person to hang around with, you will find that being happy and positive is effortless.  

4) improve your overall physical health. Beside taking the right medication, my mental health dramatically improved by the time I lost 40lbs by swimming everyday and eating a healthy diet. If you are a smoker, a drinker or if you don't have a healthy and structural lifestyle, try to quit your bad habits first. If you have a healthier overall body, your mind may clear up at the same time. 

I really hope you can share my post with help others, I am not looking for fame or attentions. I just want to help. Leave me a message if you have any questions."
1428,Hi there haven’t been on here for a long while today has been a nightmare everything has came flooding back from I first tried to commit suicide I have struggled for 8 months on this horrible medicine that had made me feel fat and up and down I can’t seem to get any help anywhere Im currently homeless with three kids staying at family’s which is a strain I don’t know where to go from here the council don’t care I’m drained and have them feelings of giving up again how do I get any help ?

1429,"It's been five years since I 'broke up' with my ex who is bipolar as well. I have not moved on and I can't stand to see her happy or with someone else.

 I think she was with someone I despise and I have this feeling she wanted to hurt me. She told me she hates me but I know she loved me. I ended it with her even though she was my only connection to a social life so basically everything and every feeling I had was tied up with her. 

I felt like I died after that. The whole relationship keeps running through my head, the good and the bad. All day long all I could think about at work was what happened. I can't help believing that I'm just a victim to everything and I have no control over anything. 

All I want to do is self harm.Just drown in my own sorrow. If I didn't want to save face I'd be covered in scars from head to tow. I don't give a shit about myself.

 That relationship fucked me up so much. I don't know which way is up. I can't live like this. Every morning I wake up and say I can't keep doing this. When I finally leave my job I will find some peace. Maybe I'm delusional but it's like a cancer. What should I do before I start considering suicide...again?"
1430,"still rock bottom, still thoughts of suicide..  

not sure how much more i can take."
1431,My partners daughter stopped taking the prescribed Topamax for her anxiety about 4 months ago and has now been prescribed Lithium by a different doctor. Since on Lithium she is now worse. She is incredibly defensive and demanding and has weeks where she can't leave her appartment. The Topamax seemed to at least help her mood swings and allow her to have a social life and a job. She stopped taking it because she said it made her feel weird after being on it for a few years. Now she has found a new doctor that prescribed her Lithium and her issues are much worse. She has quit two jobs in the past three months as she says she can't work with people in general now at all. Since she is an adult we dont know how and if we can talk to her doctor about her treatment as it doesn't seem to be working. Has anyone had issues with Lithium and how can we talk to her doctor? My partner is having a hard time with this as she now blames him for not being able to find a job because he won't buy her a new lap top so she can job search on instead of going to the library and using the facilities there. She is making demands for things she should be providing for herself as in doing her own dishes and cleaning her apartment. She says she can't care for herself like she should and he has gone over to help her clean her dishes a couple times now. She says she doesn't want to work with people any more but she doesn't want to be alone and we are confused by this. It's really sad to see her like this as she used to be happier and much more self sufficient before the Lithium. Any thoughts would be very welcomed thank you.
1432,"@ 7 am this morning, I made a plan.  I chose a method and a day to take control on my none life. my exit was set

@  9 am i broke down and creed like a baby


@ 10 am I forced myself out for  a coffee with my daughter

@ 2 pm i'm starting to get low again


today has been a roller coaster of hope and disaster"
1433,"My sister talked to her med doctor yesterday and the doctor told her that she can stop taking her lithium cold turkey. I feel like this could potentially have negative side effects. The doctor said that because my sister is below the therapeutic range, the lithium is having no effect right now, and therefor completely going off of it will have no side effects. What the doctor is saying makes sense to me, but I just feel like it's better to ween off it gradually, just to be safe.

She was taking 750mg for about 10 years and a few months ago went down to 600mg because her heart rate was too low (48). Going down to 600mg seemed to have improved her heart rate (now it's around 60), but it also brought her below the therapeutic range. So now the doctor is saying to just go off of it.

Do you agree that she should go down at least somewhat gradually? Or is the doctor right about it having no side effects if she just stops completely?"
1434,I am so hypersexual right now. I'm having thoughts of being with multiple women and seeing their bodies etc things like that I really want it so bad I can't help my thoughts. No one here to help me can anyone give recommendation opinion.😕
1435,"I never know how to properly structure these questions because I feel like there's just so much background information and I don't really know what's relevant and what isn't. However, I will try my best.

Back in 2004 my brother suffered a severe panic attack and was placed on 20 mg of Paxil and it helped him immensely but over time he really didn't consistently take the medication and there were times where he would just go off of it and go back on it for one reason or another. He was feeling pretty good for a while but he would still have anxiety and some panic sometimes whenever he was in a vehicle when someone else besides him was driving. So back in very early 2016 he heard about Lamotrigine and that it could possibly help him control his anxiety better. After he started taking it for a little while he began to feel energetic, maybe even manic, and need less sleep. Within no-time he found a job which he had never really shown interest in getting before. But the Lamotrigine made sleeping difficult still so he began to take 2 - 3 mg of Ativan multiple times a week in order to sleep. Now, here's where the mainline of the topic comes into play, back in September 2017 my brother's mood began to change. He would cry and become more depressed than he ever had.

We've tried several configurations of his current medication. Taking more Paxil and Lamotrigine or less but trying to cut down on the Ativan as best he could manage in case he was going through a sort of withdrawal from it, things like that. He won't stay ""normal"" for more than a few weeks at a time without also being ""bad"" for a weeks or even months after. To be fair, he did a lot of permutations of his medicine within a very short period. As crazy as this sounds he did some sort of alterations more that 10 - 15 times within a two-month period. Back in early April he tried Lamotrigine Extended Release so he could have it in his system all the time instead of just taking 100 mg once a day. When he did that he said that he felt GREAT, almost as if he was manic or hypomanic, he wasn't depressed or anxious at all and he didn't want Ativan. But he COULD NOT sleep whatsoever, he slept for a few hours in the span of a week. After not sleeping wore him down he switched back to the regular Lamotrigine and his sleep slowly returned but then he become EXTREMELY depressed. Then he tried Abilify for a little while but he could not sit still and complained of his brain feeling ""cloudy"" or ""underwater."" So he stopped the Abilify. He stayed depressed and checked himself to a mental hospital where they gave him Ativan and 10 mg of Ambien every night while starting him on Latuda. But the doctor's there didn't actually send in the perscription so he got off of it. And he was far worse coming back from the hospital. But he tried to recover until he had an OCD obsession about his body and tongue and then he flipped out again and went back to Ativan because it helped him. Then, about 8 weeks ago, he tried to switch from Paxil, which he's been on for a long, long time to Celexa. He did a cross-tartration of slowly going down on one while going up on the other. And he felt better for a few weeks again, better than he had since September 2017, but had some OCD and anxiety that freaked him out so he tartrated back the other way and now he's back on Paxil 25 mg.

He feels now like he ruined his one chance at being normal again and he ruminates on trying to get back on the Celexa again. But he also freaks out thinking that SSRIs are keeping him bad and making his condition worse and harming his mental state.

Every single day since September 9th, my mother and I have done our best to help him.

He absolutely FREAKS OUT worse than you could possibly imagine.

I repeat, WORSE THAN YOU COULD POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

He runs around the house yelling and screaming 24 hours a day of us just ""letting him go"" and how he ""missed his last chance to get better."" He says that he's ""only human"" and that anyone would wish for death after a year of near constant struggling.

I'm afraid to give him Ativan because sometimes I highly consider the fact that he took 4 - 6 mg of Ativan a week when he was better and taking it throughout the year sporadically as a possible cause as to why he's so terrible now.

Or maybe he's just currently withdrawaling off of the Celexa.

He has anxiety, depression, obsessive thinking, suicidal ideations, muscle spasms, hand trembling, and worst of all he's been unable to sleep for days.

He doesn't want to die.

He WANTS to get better.

I just don't know what to say or how to explain it.

We very recently went to a brand new psychiatrist and I was explaining everything to her as best as I could since my brother was freaking out in her office.

She said to not micro-manage his medication anymore and to not take Ativan.

She said that when he stabilized as much as he can to begin taking 2.5 mg of Zyprexa.

So he'll be on 25 mg of Paxil, 100 mg of Lamotrigine, and 2.5 mg of Zyprexa.

Is there any insight that anyone can offer?
Please, I don't want to lose my brother but I can't watch him suffer anymore."
1436,"Does anybody else suffer with agitation? I have been crying, shouting and  generally having a bad day, making it bad for other people too. Frustration and not my usual relaxed and easy self.

Adverts about homelessness and starvation, animal cruelty and war, it doesn't make me reach for the phone but the vodka."
1437,I'm feel trapped all I can see and remember is the bad things that have happened in my life. I can't remember or see any of the good. Because of this I don't want to be around anymore. This has been going on for quite some time now. I feel alone like no one else out there knows what I'm going through. I could be in a crowded room and I still feel like I am all by myself. It is so hard only being able to remember and see the bad things memories that have gone on in my life. I don't know which way to turn what direction to go home family life included. My whole life is just a nightmare. Can anyone give feed back?
1438,"Hi there, I’ve just joined this forum.
I was diagnosed with bi polar when I was 27 I’m now 34 but have been in and out of psychiatric wards since I was 17.
I have barely worked in my life due to not being able to be consistent.
I have been with my partner now for 4 years and I have only worked 9 months in that time. She is very concerned as is wanting to start a family, I just feel quite honestly that I can’t cope with work or pressure of looking for work any more, It feels like a full time job looking after me and I feel like I should just be able to spend my life keeping me a live and happy in the moments I can. But then part of me feels this is selfish and maybe I’m supposed to be on my own and being in a relationship is too much also with the severity of my condition. She is supportive but I just find she can’t understand when I explain how tough it is to work and she’ll say you can do something really simple like washing up.. I do understand her anxiety.. just maybe it would be easier to live the rest of my life alone and taking care of my self and doing what I can to enjoy my life.

I experience 3-4weeks of suicidal depression and then 10days of high trying not to go too high and that cycle is on constant repeat..

Can anyone relate or has any thoughts.

Thanks for taking the time, just been feeling a bit alone with this recently, gonna try and go to my local bi polar group this week.
Best wishes"
1439,"hi guys, I don't post much because of a few issues.... but i need to reach out.  I don't think I'm safe.  I have  anew S idea and on a pro-S site it says it works very well..

need to get more ""stock"""
1440,"I guess I say everything wrong and do everything wrong. No one wants to talk to me anymore off line or here on this forum. Hope people can forgive me for whatever it was that I did. Like i told you all, all I do is screw things up no matter where I am. Sorry."
1441,"Well I don't really know how to start this or what I aim to get out of registering and posting here but I do know I have to try to do something - anything -different before I lose it. So this might get long winded but I appreciate anybody who reads and replies. 

This predictably may get a bit dark.

First of all, I don't need a diagnosis to know I'm an alcoholic and I'm about 99% sure I have bipolar (type II most likely but I know the alcohol goes a long way to clusterf***ing any normal symptoms and cycles). My aunt and a cousin (not from the same aunt) were both diagnosed with it. I think my dad may have had it as well, but never got help/diagnosed. He was very unstable and unpredictable, though. I suspect he died of heart failure during a manic drug/alcohol binge. He was 48...Sometimes he would act and live like a teenager and other times he was just an unpleasant asshole with severe rage outbursts. Very few memories of ""normal"" with him but my family is cesspool of mental illness so I'm not sure I have the best perspective on what normal really is - of course normal is relative but you know what i mean.... Idk about my mom...she's about 3 fries short of a happy meal to be sure, but either I don't know her well enough (plausible) or she just has some serious personality issues.

Anyway, the nut doesn't fall far from the tree....My adult life has been an unmitigated disaster. I think the reason I've ignored my symptoms and didn't recognize them in my dad were ignorance bred by a sick combination of pride and religion. We were viewed as black sheep that just needed more Jesus. Mental illness was not really considered by my family, at least none that couldn't be overcome with faith/prayer (and I beat my head against that wall for way too long with no result - surprise surprise!). They also had a really bad habit of being enablers so all the years of unemployment and dysfunction, I always had a place to stay to continue ignoring my issues.

Well, I'm an atheist now and since then, the enablers have all died off, and I have brought myself up to speed on mental illness. Long story short, I guess that's how I ended up here after many more years of suffering and chaos. Alcohol used to take the edge off of the depression, but lately it's starting to have the exact opposite effect. Granted, it did nothing to make my life more manageable, but it at least used to make me feel better.

Now I'm 35 and this has been one of the worst years of my life. No reason in particular that I can see. The only thing that really keeps me from killing myself is a lingering fear of death and failure. Trouble is, when I add alcohol, that fear often goes away and since the alcohol is no longer taking the edge off, I now find myself in a place where I am regularly a significant danger to myself. This year I've gone from only suicidal thoughts and plans, to attempt (well, unless you count all the times that I would binge on drugs and alcohol and not really care if it killed me and nearly did several times). A few months ago was the first time I had specific intent and went for an object that could harm me.

I know that I don't actually want to die, though...I just want to stop suffering. Between the hangovers, physical exhaustion of depression, pride and addiction (not to mention when I'm manic, I don't believe I need help)...it just feels impossible to take the next step. I've tried to call a couple of doctors but nobody will see me without a referral and I have such a limited amount of patients for ""the system"" right now that I just give up after a couple of calls. I guess what my ideal situation would be is find a psych and hopefully make a plan to get sober that can work around my job (yes, I somehow miraculously employed right now but I'm holding on by a thread- like all the others, I will either lose it to inability to get out of bed, or I'll go batshit crazy and quit or get fired). Then once I'm sober, facing the rest will be a lot easier I think/hope - will be able to take meds and whatnot safely.

Idk what else to say for now. Feel free to ask me anything - I'm an open book and don't really care about anonymity on this topic...Again, I really don't know what I will get out of posting here but in any moment we have a choice and in this moment i'm chosing this instead of worse things and trying to convince myself that it matters either way.

I guess I'll ask a few while I'm here...
1- Why is it so goddamn hard to get help? It seems like it should be the easiest thing in the world because the people who need access presumably aren't functional enough to navigate it, if they're even lucky enough to know they need it.

2- I'd love to hear any experiences from people who have lived this long with severe mental illness - how did you eventually get help or realize you needed it?

3- I've seen it said many times that bipolar gets worse if untreated. Assuming that's my issue, I can objectively say, yes whatever is wrong with me is getting worse, but the sites that mention it, don't really specify in what way it gets worse. In retrospect, I can't see much difference in my cycles...just worsening depression when it hits. Depressive episodes for me last a looooooong time, usually on the order of several months, up to a year or two (this is the type II part) and I may get a few weeks in a given year of hypomania and about every 3-4 years, full-tilt mania where I make sudden life changing decisions like quitting my job and moving across the country to start a business and spending myself under the table, drug binges, and putting myself in dangerous situations to meet random women on the internet. My behavior varies a lot but can get pretty self-destructive in those times without intending to or realizing it.

Anyway, I'm going to cut myself off here. I probably have more questions and i'll ask them but I'm exhausted now. Cheers <3"
1442,"Sorry in advance for the long post...

I'm not sure if I'm in the right place or if this'll be welcomed here, but I really need some discreet advice. It wasn't until recently that I considered that my wife could be bipolar because the symptoms don't seem to be severe, but this comes from 6.5 years of marriage and dealing with certain issues.

A guess first off, my wife is very prone to drastic mood swings. She could be happy and cheerful one week and then depressed and threatening to leave me the next. She has a sarcastic, fun, and witty personality, but she becomes depressed and anxiety riddled when stress is above normal levels. I've spent a good majority of our marriage being a battering ram for her. I've been to counseling, joined groups, and had mentors to try and be a better husband and father because of the shortfalls my wife has told me I had. But after years of trying to self-improve, I feel like my wife's attitude toward me has not changed in the slightest. It seems that no matter what, she'll be happy with me for a short period of time, but then will act like I'm the worst person in the world for months on end.

Before we got married, her dad told me that she didn't handle stress well, but I didn't understand the severity. She's prone to panic attacks, anger, social withdrawal when stress is high. She'll often talk about death or running away during these times. I don't believe in a million years that she'd be suicidal, simply because I don't think she has that tendency anywhere in her DNA. During high stress, she's screaming and stormed out of the house, threatened to leave me, and wished she were dead. Because of her personality, she doesn't shut down, but she'll work herself to death until whatever stress she's dealing with is gone. She also battles severe fatigue, no matter how much sleep she gets.

I guess the kicker to all of this is that the majority of people we know would be shocked to hear some of this. She hides things very well publically (she actually has a professional acting background). On top of that, she doesn't really talk to anyone (including me) about internal issues she faces.

As someone who's battled depression and anxiety myself, I'm worried she's struggling with something mentally. I'm not really sure how to go about getting her help if she is. I don't think she's living life anywhere near where she could be. She just doesn't seem to enjoy life at all a lot of the time. We have a wonderful life - beautiful and healthy kids, a beautiful house, wonderful family and friends, etc. The hardest part about this is that I'm pretty sure she'd explode if I suggested that maybe she needed to talk to a therapist or psychiatrist. I've very vaguely made suggestions in the past and it never goes over well.

I know this is kind of a ramble and I apologize. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I just want my wife to enjoy life and be happy. I'd be happy to elaborate further if needed.

Thanks so much."
1443,"Hi everyone, I have just recently been diagnosed with BPD, however I have been living with this condition for nearly 5 years now. With the help of therapy I have really learned how to control my extreme emotions but I'm still finding it difficult to develop emotional attachments. 

I have been seeing my boyfriend for a little over a year now and he is amazing, supportive and extremely supportive to my emotional needs .. my friends call him the perfect boyfriend ! But I am still finding it hard to connect emotionally .. there are times when I feel a rush of emotions and my heart melts just being by his side but other times I can't stand him next to me.. I feel as if I'm suffocating , I ignore his texts, push him away when he kisses me or hugs me . These emotions leave me extremely overwhelmed and unsure .. I am so confused and scared as I don't want to let my BPD ruin something good .. it's currently 2am I'm a wreck and my body is flooding with emotions .. I feel like I need to make an Important decision but to scared to even think about it 

Can Anyone can offer some advice or similar experiences?  I would be extremely grateful"
1444,"It's funny how one day your so low that you think the sky is falling. The next day your on top of the world, cleaning and enjoying life.
I confuse myself"
1445,"I try to substitute confusion with diabolical intellect...!

I try to make out that I understand things that I have no clue about!

...I have been suicidal for too many years!...I sure do recognise the ways of giving up!...

I'm really not sure what I want to say right now...

I sure do appreciate those lovely people who have shared their time with me tonight...

I sometimes need to get reckless to feel normal...

I am ashamed about just how much I do this...

I am not looking for comfort...

it scares me just how much I am beyond that...

it's probably best that I sleep now..."
1446,"my father passed away 2 years ago, and needless to say with his bipolar, tendencies all thru my life, i dealt with a lot.  constant moving almost every year to a different state, affairs, non participation in my life or my childrens, just so much more that make me angry.

  I inherited his condition, so i have been dealing with that almost 30 years which was when my wife drew a line in the sand and said get help or i'm gone...i got help. 

 At the time of his death, he had COPD and lukemia and the last 2 years were very difficult for him with the transfusions, hospitals, chemo, etc..and i always wanted to be there for him eventhough he wasn't there for me.   There were times i would call mom to say hi and she would call out to him ""your son is on the phone, do you want to talk to him?"" of which he replied no thanks.  

so many dinner cancellations, so many holiday no shows, just so much to list.  So many dance shows and sports events for my daughters, it just goes on an on.

I know after all of this, and what he went thru, I just can't forgive him even 2 years later, and the thought of him makes me really upset.  I can't even look at a picture of him. 

My mom has been handicapped since i was young and in a wheelchair the last 10 years.  She now lives in an assisted living.  my work is full of stress, my life is full of anxiety at times, i am just so overwhelmed.  You know when you get to that point when just daydream...maybe i should just injure myself  and maybe things will be better?  of course i know the answer, but maybe being in a hospital bed, maybe away from things may have some comfort. 

 Or, just get on my motorcycle, fill up the tank, fill up the wallet, and just go.....but what about a job and medication.  Damn, it just goes on sometimes doesn't it......but in the end, i still hold him responsible for making my illness what it is, i just can't help it.  i am no pity case, just tired of the battle in my mind...it really wears you down."
1447,"First of all i'm not expecting anyone to diagnose me nor am i trying to self-diagnose myself. I am going to go to talk to someone professionally about my mental health soon but for now i just wanted to ask this question to get an idea of where my mental health could lie. I'm 22 years old and since a teenager i've suffered with anxiety and social anxiety. Also i've struggled with paranoia in the sense that i always feel like people are attacking me. I find hidden meanings in certain sentences peoples use around me even if it's a totally non-hostile environment. This has caused a lot of my relationships to break down and i've lost friends over it. I have mood swings a lot and they can be quite severe but i'm not sure if they fit the bipolar type of mood swings? IT can change very quick for me and usually the reason is very subtle and something that i know if i said it to someone else they would think i'm a bit mad for changing my mood that quick over something they probably wouldn't understand. I often have times where i feel ""high"" like i'm on drugs and i get all these ideas coming into my head and i just need to talk to someone about them. It's usually a family member i talk to when this happens as i have social anxiety so i only really feel comfortable around them. I pace up and down and start rambling on about these ideas and it can be hard for me to get my point across sometimes because i speak too fast and my thoughts feel all jumbled up. I also have anger issues and have had pretty intense outbursts in my teenage years and even recently (within the last year and a half). Also for the last year and a half i've been overcome with an extreme amount of guilt for different things i've done in my life. This guilt haunts me and i constantly question my own morals. I can start feeling guilty for even little things too and make them out to be worse than they are. I also get alot of intrusive thoughts. I hate when i get these and i know it's my anxiety causing it. (or at least thats what i think). My mind comes up with the worst possible things i can think of and i try to push them out of my head. I end up feeling really guilty for even having such thoughts. I would never act out on these thoughts and have no desire to they are merely just thoughts that come into my head. i also go from low self esteem to really cocky at times too. I have a lot of ups and downs in my mood as well and find it very hard to finish things. I also think people are out to get me a lot or when i was a teenager i used to constantly think my friends were plotting against me to push me out of the friend group."
1448,Has anyone got and advice i can pass on to the school to help my daughter
1449,"And if so... how common is that and if you are bipolar what physical symptoms do you experience. I think i could have bipolar but i'm not sure. Since i was around 14 i started suffering from health issues like fatigue, pale skin, cold hands and feet, bad skin, red washed out looking skin.. etc. Basically i looked and felt like i was doing hard meth all my life when my health was down (which was most of the time). I'm 22 now and it's more up and down now and the health symptoms changed a bit, i get pressure over my liver area and lower back pain and stuff now too. I have low gut immunity but a part from that my doctors can't find anything wrong with my physical health so i'm starting to think there's something with my mental health causing this. My mood changes when my health is down too. I get depressed (especially in the morning), irritable, angry, no energy to even make a phone call it would take so much effort, hard to remember details at times too, just functioning lower in everything really in general. I feel like and look like a crack addict when my health is down it's really hard to deal with because even when i'm feeling better i'm always worried about when i'm going to crash. My diet can affect it big time. If i drink alcohol it can make things way worse too. Does anyone with bipolar relate to this or should i be looking elsewhere for a possible cause? Thanks."
1450,I've been told that I look like I'm going to kill someone. It was funny in high school but now I'm going to back to school. The last thing I need is for people to think I'm going to shoot up the place. I need to make friends if I don't want people to get me the wrong way. I try to talk to people but I'm so introverted. I'm 245 lbs with muscle and never talk. I always keep to myself. I find it easier that way to focus. I also have an inferiority comflex. So it's pretty tough fitting in. I want to actually succeed this time. I'm nervous about what I'll do with down time on campus in between classes assuming there is time in between. I'm commuting. I haven't been to community college before so I'm a little anxious about how it will pan out. I also have paranoia. I don't want to be judged or made fun of. I also have a learning disability which is also another curve ball. I'm kinda like wtf right now. Any words of wisdom?
1451,"Here comes the train!
That's basically me, every single morning. Now I am (probably) not bipolar, or at least never diagnosed. I did some research and it's in a lot of ways not the same as what I am experiencing, yet in a lot of ways it is. I'm here to gather some knowledge and advice on how others handle their own situations, and also am curious to what others think is different to my situation in contrast to being bipolar.

So back to the train. I cope with ADD, and my best way of describing the, to me, most important part of that: I wake up, a train of thoughts starts rolling. It doesn't stop, ever, as long as I am awake.
Now what this means, is I am constantly busy guiding this train in the right direction, whenever my available consciousness takes over. This consciousness seems to be triggered by emotions, whenever I feel something about something I get focussed.

I don't control everything, I just get pushed in a direction, good or bad, and I'll have to deal with it. Dealing with it takes a lot of energy, and when too many ""possible negative sidetracks"" come into play, I get lost and I fall into a deep pit. I can fall from a (very) positive state, into an extremely depressed state in a matter of seconds. A very recent example: I was having a great day, did nice things with nice people, worked on things I want to work on and all in all this day was great. Then in the evening I was sitting with friends and had a nice conversation about random things, when suddenly one of my friends said something about a nice tinder date. This was my trigger: I've been single for a long time, which sometimes is a big deal to me, and other times it isn't. But tonight fate has decided it's the biggest deal in the history of human kind, and my whole day was done. I had to leave instantly not to break into tears immediately. This time it was ever bad enough to keep me down for two whole days. I couldn't stop the train from constantly sidetracking to anything related to relationships and it kept me down bad, no energy to push it in a positive direction.

Then some days later, a friend said something funny that triggered the positive route, and that was my escape out of this whole thing. I felt I had to energy to grab onto this positivity, and I've been feeling great again for several days. 

So that is one scenario of the things that can happen. This time it was pretty extreme and it happened over the span of several days, but this can also happen within an hour. I feel good, someone says something about, I don't know, soccer? My brain for whatever reason quickly makes connections to a moment I was close to a soccer field (yes it can be this far fetched), when I wasn't feeling well because I had a fight with a friend. This happened years ago and is not relevant to me in any way, but the feeling is negative and off into the abyss the train goes! Caught off guard, not able to recover on my own. Then I have to search for positivity somewhere close to me, and someone can do the same the other way around, by just saying something about candy (or whatever) and maybe it'll trigger the positivity route, who knows! My brain seems very good at making random connections, some even say I might be fairly intelligent!

So my question, is there anyone out there who can relate to this extreme quick fluctuation in feelings and thoughts, and knows a way to deal with it? It affects my energy, my concentration, my social abilities, and most of all my self confidence. I need a way to counter the way down, but I'm clueless. There was a time where I could simply steer the train, I felt so strong in my mind for that period, but it seems gone and I am clueless to what to do.
And also, not for diagnostics or whatever, I am just curious, how does this resemble bipolarity and how does it not?

Thanks if you made it all the way down here!"
1452,"I will try to keep this brief.  I was always depressed and my senior year of college (a year ago) I had a major psychotic break where I literally thought I was flying through the universe.  I was hospitalized in for two weeks, and I have been trying to fine tune my meds.  I am working closely with my Pdoc, but am getting very discouraged.  Any input would be appreciated.  Could be Schizo affective per PDoc

Lithium is what brought be out of my mania, and I have been on 900mg er every since.

I have gone thru Latuda. Could only get to 60 mg.  I took with food, but still felt ill most of the time.

Cannot take Lamictal due to headaches.

Tried Vryalar and I felt like I was crawling out of my skin.

I am now up to 4mg of Rexulti as of last weekend.  My Paranoia is the highest it has been since my hospitalization.  Saw my Pdoc Friday and he said too soon to tell on the increased dosage and I can go from 7. out of 10 to 3 out of 10 in a matter of minutes.  He added a small dose of Lexapro to help with my depression.

Rexulti has been the best drug from a side effect profile.  If I could rid myself of the paranoia I would almost be normal.   

Does anyone have any suggestions?  Really appreciate it."
1453,"I would've never thought my son would be involved in a crime that will give him 20to 30years. All I keep thinking about..

I'm reaching out for support please."
1454,"I have walked through life hoping for good to happen wanting to learn and be good like everyone else. Every path I have gone down has led me from bad to worse. I have never succeeded only brought hardship on others. I constantly see the look of disappointment in the eyes of everyone around me. I don't belong anywhere, I don't even know who I am. I like someone and she doesn't even know I exist I'm there to her she knows me and talks to me sometimes but I don't exist to her if that makes sense.  I'm not good enough for anyone. I fail at work when I was yonger i failed in school I failed at sports which i thought I was pretty good at especially martial arts but i failed there too. I don't belong anywhere."
1455,"Does anyone else feel like they've come to a dead end, like there's nothing else to live on/off of. I'm currently on leave from my job because I was hospitalized for the fifth time a month ago. I have intensive outpatient program three days a week which is not nearly as much time that I would like because I have literally nothing to do all the time since I'm not going to work. I have no hobbies. I literally do close to absolutely nothing. I mean it's pretty pathetic. I picture looking at myself and I shake my head with disappointment. I can't be helping society this way. It feels like my hands are tied. I want to be productive and feel like I have some sense of purpose but I'm not supposed to be working (the day after getting out of the hospital for a manic depressive episode I went back to work like an idiot. It sucked and was the worst). Also, I want to go back to school but I have to wait until January which feels so far away. I kind of just feel like what am I doing?! with my life?! I don't have anyone to talk to besides my family and other patients, doctors/clinicians. I feel like the life I want to live is so far down the road. Anyone else have these feelings?"
1456,"I don't fully understand the term but i am sleeping excessively. I am on less medication than i have ever been and ideally will be off all eventually. I think i can manage stress now but if i can manage work, that is another question. Right now, how do i sleep a more reasonable amount of time? I am sleeping 11 hours each day, sometimes more. I spend some hours very tired too but feel too tired to sleep at those times. Do you have this problem?"
1457,"How do you come out of it when every ounce of your soul has evaporated, leaving total emptiness where there was once life? How do you summon the strength when your thoughts portray only weakness and you won't even put up your guard when you see the punch coming? Waking is misery. Even trying to lay there in bed awake feels awful, but somehow it is oh so slightly better then accepting that you have to go through another day. Another day of nothingness. Another day of avoidance. Another day of worthlessness, accomplishing nothing. Just getting by. Slowly letting people down, many who aren't even aware you are letting them down. You are no help to anyone. You avoid contact or conversation at all costs. You spend a lot of time alone in your car, as you can allow the numbness to set in when you dont have to fake it at home, or at work, or with a friend. Your face hasn't cracked a genuine smile in months, nor have your thoughts found a reason to be thankful, though there are thousands to choose from, if you simply weren't blind to them; your muscles haven't wanted to be used beyond the basics and you lash yourself with the whip of guilt reminding yourself that you are able and so many are not. You pathetic sloth. Get up! Get going! Make it happen! Yeah right. ""Fake it 'til you make it"" doesn't ring true for you anymore. Tony Robbins' words fall on deaf ears. All the things you know you should do simply do not happen. You avoid. You hide. You eventually make it to bed, some times remembering to eat, some times not.

1458,"Hi I know you guys don't know me. But I feel like sharing a bit. I hope nobody Minds. But the last couple of weeks I was going through some sort of dysphoric mania depression thing. But hopefully it's coming to an end. My doctor added antipsychotic and it seems to be helping somewhat. I hope it lasts. I'm actually starting to like things a little bit again. 

     When I was young  I read Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I just rediscovered the BBC television show from the 80s. I'm actually kind of enjoying it. Which is something I thought I would never be able to do again.

    Just out of curiosity are there any other sci-fi fans out there? I've read quite a number of sci-fi and fantasy books. I was just wondering if there was anybody else interested in that?


   Sorry about the grammar. I'm horrible with it."
1459,"I am very hypersexual right now, I can't stand it every thought my actions desires I want more. Can anyone help? Can anyone give me ideas to do to help curb this?"
1460,"I went from mania to psychosis because of drugs. I called 911 like 25 times in a few months, lost all of my friends for good, and was wandering around homeless for a while. I thought people were psychopaths and I was part of a police investigation. So I started weird fights with friends. I’m incredibly grateful I have come back from it, I feel like myself again. The psychosis was drug-induced so I basically just had to wait it out and my mood is controlled by medication now. I just feel like a freak everywhere I am. Like a neighbor is either scared of me or pities me, like strangers saw me at my most crazy, like people know about my worst secrets (they all happened in public) and it’s just a matter of time until anybody I meet will be told something about me by a friend of a friend. I’m able to push these things out of my mind usually, I am just happy to be alive and able to feel joy again. That is not a small thing for me. But I just had my heart so broken by all of this. I saw people at their worst. An example is a hospital security guard who took out his gun while escorting me off the property (for trying to sleep there). It’s hard not to be mistrusting or slightly nihilistic from some of it, but I try to hope I’ll make a friend. Basically I go to a recovery group meeting where people want to bolt away from each other afterward so I’m going to try NA meetings 
Iono there are no clubs I can think of joining
It’s hard to make friends as an adult and basically I’m like a red flag factory as far as trying to get a date so iono I’m just not liking the trapped in the in between feeling"
1461,"Hello everyone,
I have been diagnosed with Bipolar with psychotic features. I am legally disabled I suppose and cannot work full time because of this. My main question is, do any of you with anxiety or bipolar or any other mental health problem struggle with loud sounds, lights or textures? And also, I cannot watch adult television, movies or even read the novels I use to love because it will put me into an emotional breakdown...

Do any of you deal with these symptoms? My therapist and doctor haven't given me any help with it yet."
1462,Just saying hi to everyone. I'm having a hard time at the moment I've been bipolar and stable for almost a couple of decades now. But recently everything seemed to unravel. I started messing with this stuff called kratom to keep me hypomanic so that I could work without feeling majorly stressed. I think as a result of using it for close to a year I kind of crashed. As a result I'm taking Risperdal again. For the pass few days I was having such agitation. But I think the added Med is helping it subside. I have a walk in appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow. Right now it feels like I'm interested in nothing and that I'm a burden to my wife other times I weep uncontrollably. Anyone else out there ever feel like this? Just feeling a little scared and lonely. Do you think this could be helped? Sorry to bother everyone. Thank you

Her father was extremely abusive to me for so many years but I was so scared of him taking my daughter away from me because of my legal status back then. Basically my ex husband disrespected me and control me so much. 6 years ago I decided to leave him because I couldn’t take it no more, I’ve asked my daughter to come  with me but she chose dad instead. At home I only could do what my ex wanted, he even controlled the way I was raising my daughter. I always stayed home, I was a PTA mom, taking her to the park, I cooked, cleaned up, etc. No drugs or bad example for my daughter. But daughter is emotionally detached from me, she has even tried to hit me. She’s brainwashed, she’s all I have, the person that I love the most. Should I give up?? Should I continue trying to gain her love??? The only times the reaches out to me is because she wants something. I knew in my heart that my ex was trying and still does make feel that he’s the only parent, that I have no right over her because I’m not mentally stable. I’m heartbroken. Today I’m a citizen I’m not fearful of him taking her physically away from me but all these years he was able to brainwash her. I apologize for my grammar ( English is my second language) thanks.

1471,"Hello everyone,
I recently got diagnosed with hypomania over the Summer and have been taking Lamotrigine 100 mg for two and a half months now. I like the way its been stabilizing my moods and the difference its made. However, I really can't seem to understand or differentiate what is a hypomania and when I am ""experiencing"" it.  It's really confusing to me and I overthink things. I have not spoken to other people with this condition and this is actually my first attempt trying to connect with people about this that also have it. To be honest, I have told some people in real life and a common thing I have heard is, ""I feel like its more common than you think"" or ""Everyone is a little bipolar"". It's annoying. 

I was diagnosed based on my sleep patterns ( I would work a lot and have energy, be sociable with classmates and stay up really late to study with them and then wake up really early energized). I also took 9 different medications without any success and most of them were SSRI's.I had bad side effects when I took them and my symptoms of depression would get worse, along with thoughts of suicide. I can't remember why else my psychiatrist believes I have this.


This is mainly how I feel:

-Thinking people are purposely trying to make my life miserable.
- I work a lot to make me feel like I have a purpose.
-I often think people hate me because I don't really have friends.
-When I do hang out with people, I feel like an outcast and I don't know what to do. I often dissosociate from people around me and conversations.
- When I have mental breakdowns, I feel very anxious/desperate and suddenly reach out to people and cry and ask for advice and tell them how I feel. I also call suicide hotlines because of how intense my feelings are. I often find myself getting over it and then act like it was pointless or like I'm over it. I also get feelings of regret and I get back to normal. I know some friends have distanced themselves from me because of this.
- I convince myself that I shouldn't go out because people hate me and everyone thinks I am ugly and fat. I can't stand to even look at myself and I often get very obsessive with my looks for hours and I stay up to perfect a makeup look.
- When my boyfriend and I broke up, I couldn't stand being alone and I was very depressed and had intense thoughts of suicide, so I went on tinder and met up with someone new two days later and had sex with him within 4 days. I also had sex with this new guy on my boyfriends bed and brought him into our apartment when he ws staying somewhere else. There was a point where my ex wanted me back and I had so much fun having two sexual partners I could go to. I would have sex with one of them early in the day and then go to the other person later in the day and have sex with them too. I felt very alive and excited during this period of my life. 
- My boyfriend's family doesn't like me because I once drove 2 hours to their house see him and reach out to him after he broke up with me and blocked my number. I was working at the time and made an excuse to get out from work early and I impulsively drove over and kept making fake numbers to reach him and when he turned off his phone, I began to call his mom and text her. 
- I am not consistent with anything. I often drop classes because it's easier than trying. I plan to do things and I can't get myself to start, much less finish.


I can't think of anything else at the moment. To be honest, right now I feel like what I am writing is stupid. It's just how I feel."

1473,"Hi,

I've been relatively stable for quite a while but recently started having real problems with irrational and intrusive thoughts. It's affecting my day to day life and is seriously doing my head in! I'm usually pretty good at distracting myself, or disregarding such thoughts but these are particularly stubborn. Does anyone else suffer with similar issues, or have any tips to help cope with them?"
1474,"I just finished a month of intensive outpatient and now I'm back at work full time. I'm really angry because my life isn't the way I want it to be. The frustration is so deep. I'm supposed to be doing good, supposedly, but I'm not good. I hate my job and have no other choice but to stay there for now. I want to quit but what else would I do with my time? Plus how would I get another job?. I flipped out on our delivery guy because he made fun of me one time a while back but when I was gone I realized what he meant when he said what he did. Normally I wouldn't do that but with my sensitivity and low self-esteem I lost it. I have no one except for my therapist to tell me everything is alright or I'm doing good. I just don't see how I got myself in this situation. Were all those hours of group therapy a waste? I'm so unhappy. If I could just reach out and find that I'm not all alone it would make all the difference. Am I still sick or am I just pissed things aren't coming together sooner etc? Am I seeing clearly or is the world coming to an end?"
1475,"does anyone else have this problem? i find myself not being able to ""feel"" much emotion i don't think it's because of medication, i do get some emotion inside but it doesn't potray itself on the outside and it's causing a strain with some friends and family, i'm not really sure how to change this??"

My friend is bipolar.  She is presently having bigtime issues with a mental or cognitive fog and is asking for help from others who have experienced the same thing. I can verify that in the 3 weeks since I last saw her: her memory and mental acuity is noticeably ""off.""  She is presently on: 500mg of Lithium, 200mg of Seraquil, and 0.5mg of Clonozepam.  She also has had a really bad cold if that matters. Has anyone experienced this before? Do you know how to ""fix"" it?

1480,"hey all

my husband just got sober and has been sober for 9 months.  (YAY)
We just had a conversation about my bipolar and he basically said he's just now beginning to notice the severity of my situation and he suddenly feels confused a bit, and not knowing how to relate to me in my various states.  I got my diagnosis 1.5 - 2 years ago and so we've known about it, however I guess due to the fact that he's sober and more acutely aware of stuff, he's seeing it now.

Any advice for spouses, books for them to read, articles for them to read?  I've tried to describe some things to him many times but I think he needs some fresh information.
He also seems convinced that I ought to try medication but I'm against it.  Don't want to effect our marriage badly but that's what is happening.

Advice on how to deal with a spouse who is well meaning but doesn't understand exactly?
Thanks in advance

1481,"Hi everyone, 
I'm dealing with bipolar which is yet ""unspecified"" because I didn't stick around in therapy long enough to get my full diagnosis... because they wanted to put me on antipsychotics.  That was about a year and a half ago - fast forward to now, I've been through SEVERRAL debilitating cycles of depression where I've questioned if I should just go to my regular physician and get on anti-depressants.  I've of course heard that's due to make bipolar worse, but I DO NOT want to go back on antipsychotics.
(I'm 31 years old BTW)  (so I've grown up dealing with this bipolar and many other issues and coping ""okay"" and at this point I am wondering what to do because I feel as if I am at an impasse.)

Some other shit has come to light, like the realization that I also am struggling with body dysmorphia (not formally diagnosed but it fits and explains so so much) and that I KEEP having weird obsessive anxious thoughts about how I've burdened people, social anxiety problems, and borderline eating disorder type thoughts have begun to come back in... not to mention how freakin suicidal I can get on about a monthly basis.

Sometimes, I have a VERY hard time believing that 'normal' people live in some 'normal' way other than how I am living.  My almost completely 100% staunch BELIEF is that I'm living in the same type of brain everyone else is, but that I just happen to be REALLY PAINFULLY BAD, just SO BAD at dealing with life.  In this manner of thinking, seeking medications and intense treatment sounds like a good idea, because if I'm really not coping, and I can get help, I really should.
BUT!  Other times, I can accept that this is just how I'm made, and I can do the best I can with how I'm made.... that I AM doing the best I can with how I'm made. And it gives me a sense of pride to be able to go it alone, or take care of myself BY myself, or even to self medicate in one of the various ways I've developed these elaborate coping mechanisms over the years. 

There's this thing, this sensation that I am butting up against, which is - at this point - do I actually seek help?  Or do I just let this spiral out of control, maybe decide to stop eating, maybe go back to ignoring my mental health and just using those comfortable coping mechanisms I've used for the last ~16-17 years???
The former would ""apparently"" offer me a better life, but there's this creepiness to me, and a paranoia almost, that this ""better life"" they're offering me is just this overblown overrated life of being watered down and plugged into normal society.  (I'm an artist, that's the key aspect of my identity, and I desperately DON'T want to function in a ""normal"" society.)  
The latter would likely lead to more self isolation, and I'd be guaranteed to continue to have the same ups and downs as I've been having, but I handle them how I want to, and I am in charge of myself that way.  And I get to stay safe in the warmth of how I've always lived my life.

Anyone else feel this way?  Felt this way?  What happened after that?  What choices did you make and where did it take you?

Perhaps the paranoid delusion that the psychiatrists are trying to steal my creativity with seroquel and stuff is a bit much, but honestly, it's a HUGE fear to me.  I desperately don't want to lose that, and the ONE time I took the stuff, I had nightmares of this drug stealing my soul all day and was basically paralyzed for 24 hours.  Any input is useful.

1483,"Hi everybody!
I took lithium for less than 2 months and leave it.
I notice symptoms of hypothyroidism, cold hands, dry skin, thin hair, insomnia, weight gain, a little difficult to swallow.
However my blood test has done well with TSH at 1.05 (although before lithium it was at 0.5) which is a good result as well as T3 and T4 at normal values.
It has only given a little cholesterol (which is also a symptom of hypothyroid).
Could it be that you have hypothyroidism despite the correct tests?
Is hypothyroidism caused by lithium really reversible and how last long?"
1484,"My depression started several days ago ( although my wife insists it started  a couple of weeks ago).  It has quickly spiralled at an intense pace.  I am psychotic with visual and auditory delusions.  They are acute and constant.  I get know peace.  My wife is so stressed she is at her wits end and does not know what to do.  I feel so guilty about this and it underpinned my suicidal thoughts which i would have acted on given the chance to.  I also voiced that she would be better off without me me not being around.   In the end i had a nurse sitting at my side 24 7.  Moreover i know that my  Bi polar will  mean further admission with similar symptoms at any given time.  I don't think that i can cope much longer especially it is only 10 weeks since my last stay in hospital.  This is know way to live.  My wife has really adhered to her marriage vow( in sickness and in health) but i feel she should have better than this.  I want to be the husband that she deserves.

Things are so dire that my CPN visited today and is coming back next Monday.  in the meantime my pdoc has prescribed Diazepam.

You see here one after another examples of polypharmacy and are year after year going around and complaining about the same adding to all the side effects that are adding to them and yet still rely on their ""medications.""
So difficult to understand that one has psychological problems that are mainly due to the social environment and that drugging is not going to be solved at the most relieving for a while to get worse afterwards?

I don't necessarily believe that this was a bad thing to have hypersexuality. If my husband had been interested, it could have worked out fine and there'd be no monthly crying from guilt. So I don't know that it was really bipolar. No one introduced me to Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous until years later. The question remains :  Would I have taken SLAA seriously without being slowed down by lithium ??

1489,"Hi all

Newbie here.

I have had BP as long I can remember but I only confirmed it myself in the last year.

My life has been erratic to say the least, countless jobs, making more enemies than friends, a life of bad decisions.

I always put it down to my drinking and other nasty stuff that I was doing, but even when I was managing to live clean at times it would always creep back.

Previously I went through years of treatment for ADHD and realised that the drugs only made me worse, stimulants certainty do not agree with me, so I came off.

I have no idea why it has taken so long to confirm that it is in fact BP (maybe I have both ADHD and BP but I would say BP is the main factor) only really taking into account people dropping hints through strange ways (making points but not directly saying it to me). 

Taking this on board, I discovered my life has improved greatly by ditching caffeine. Caffeine has been the trigger of most of my drinking episodes all my life. I was living a life of mania and also the lows that come with it.

I thought that was the end of it, but unfortunately not. I now go through these phases of really clean eating/ living and gym but after a few months, even without a bad day my mind craves mind fixes just like it did when I was going through mania and I will go weeks through an episode till I can snap out of it.

It's like there is no stopping it, I can only delay the inevitable.

Are BP meds worth it?

I have heard in some cases they make people worse in the long run.


Thanks

1496,Hi. I’m new here. Hoping to make some friends & feel less alone..
1497,"I am considering getting electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Is it effective, and how was recovery for you? Did it change you in some way? I mean to ask if it changes your personality and functioning. Are the changes permanent?  

I don't want to go back on meds because of the side effects and because I doubt that they have really worked. 

I stopped taking olanzapine 3 months ago after gaining weight and finding out about its effects on cholesterol and lipids. And also because I feel like I still get manic symptoms on the drug, though more subtle. 

Even on olanzapine, I was obsessive and impulsive, collecting overpriced shoes from online sellers. I just had to have them. I constantly checked the sellers apps because I felt compelled to do it. It wrecked my finances as I was not able to set any money aside. It disrupted my work because I'd be checking browsing and messaging sellers during work hours. 

There was also a man whose Facebook I kept checking over a period of time, I met him briefly on an online dating site. 

I used to be on serotia and sodium valproate. I slept well but I still had manic symptoms, again in the form of shopping and collecting. I was collecting luxury candles at the time and was unable to set money aside. I was buying them very quickly, I've had to give some to my sister because I had so much. I wasn't burning through all of them either.  

I have been reading about lithium and how it is the gold standard for treating mania. But I hear it is toxic and causes weight gain. 

Like mania, my obsessions and impulse to collect subside after a while (usually several months to 2 years). Then they start again. They also change. Collections I've had in the past have included expensive lingerie and high-end makeup. It's always expensive stuff and I feel it's because I get delusions of grandeur when I'm manic. 

I have not told my psychiatrists (I've had two over a two-year period) because I was afraid that they would just up the dose, making me feel more sluggish during the day and making me gain more weight. 

And also because I doubt if I can tell the difference between normal and abnormal behavior - I think that maybe I just need to know how to manage my finances, and that it isn't mania."
1498,"Its probobally been 2 months since my last 'high' point. I know BP2 has transitionary moods but this is just ridiculous now. Being on a downer for 8 weeks is no fun anymore and i'm struggling to find inspiration from anywhere be it creatively or motivationally.

Currently, my brother as very obsessive and worried about his medication. He's read a few articles and studies online that if you're Bipolar that it's not very good to take an SSRI. Apparently it's said that they can cause even worse issues with people who suffer from Bipolar. The problem is that my brother has been on an SSRI for anxiety and panic disorder for many years and he wants to stop them but he feels like he's trapped.

He's to the point now where he feels like his Paxil and Lamictal may be hurting him and making his Bipolar worse. He's very, very, very, VERY obsessive about it. He feels like the medication has been slowly ""poisoning"" him and making his condition worse.

I just don't know what to offer anymore.
I try to calm him down but he become ABSOLUTELY HYSTERICAL sometimes and calming him down is nearly imposssible.

What can we do?"
1501,"Hi all,

This is hard for me to type as I feel a slight betrayal on my part, but it's genuinely how I feel and it's a tricky subject to put into words. I'd appreciate your time to read and give me your input.

My close family consisted of my mum and dad and brother and I. My mum left us when I was 10 and my brother quickly went off the rails and has been in and out of prison since.
I have other family (Auntie, Cousins, Grandparents etc) but my dad made certain to keep them as far away as possible. I've never really had a relationship with them and  I've felt very isolated.

My dad is bone idle. Not just a bit lazy or even very lazy, but absolutely BONE IDLE to the marrow. The man does nothing and never has done. He never does housework and never cooks. He never does DIY and only washes his own clothes because I refuse to do them. Since I was 12 it's been me that's done it all, and now at the age of 35 I'm sick of it. He has no hobbies, no interests, no friends and barely speaks. I've spent my life protecting him from those who slagged him off, telling them he is undiagnosed autistic, has depression, has anxiety issues etc. The truth is, he has non of these things, he is just utterly (and self confessed) bone idle.

The thing that annoys me the most, beyond everything else, is that our house is falling apart. He's lived here for 40 years and has never done a single piece of DIY in all that time. I've done it all. The brick work outside is crumbling, the paint disintegrating, The front door is rotted, the roof has holes in it and leaks inside, and don't even get me started on the back. I've NEVER seen another house this bad and it's embarrassing.
The inside is a different story. It pretty clean and tidy and well decorated and that's all my work. I've been fixing things since I was a child and all the while this person just sits there watching. I'm still doing it today and the issues are getting worse after years of neglect. He is the only person I know who would just sit there and do nothing while water is dripping on him from through the roof. He quickly shuts down any discussions over DIY (or work of any sort) and loses the power of speech if you mention things that need doing. It's highly frustrating trying to engage with him over such things. I've felt masses of pressure over the years to do housework and fix things often whilst trying to hold down a full time job.

Anyway...
I've had terrible depression and low self esteem and was diagnosed with Bipolar in 2010. I've bounced around from job to job struggling with my mental health and questioned everything in my life to try and find a cause and getting frustrated just thinking I was broken. I love working, but can't seem to cope under pressure and because of this I'm stuck here with him at the age of 35 basically doing all his rubbish.

I think he is the cause of my problems. Has the pressure put on me through my lazy father a form of abuse? Been eating away at me and causing me to fall?

What are your thoughts?

Thanks so much, Boba x"
1502,"How do you make sound decisions when you are in the throes of mania and/or depression? 

Long story short, I applied to a high-paying job in another city and got an offer. Then I got overwhelmed by the prospect of relocating, finding a new apartment (which has not been easy), leaving family behind, and paying more taxes. 

It occurred to me that I had been/am in a manic episode, which is why I had grandiose plans of moving to a new city where I know absolutely no one, and with little money in my savings account (another sign of mania -  I have not saved any money in the last 6 months). 

Depression also kicks in. I feel afraid, anxious, and unable to make decisions. I have been stalling by asking the employers many questions about the offer instead of just signing the contract. I am not proud of this. I think that it's starting to rub them the wrong way - the manager did not respond to my last email. 

I think that I have been rapidly cycling over the last few days.I am afraid of relocating to a new city in my current state, and yet I am afraid to pass up this great opportunity. I feel unable to decide. When I try to weigh the pros and cons of each decision, I only get racing thoughts and no conclusion. My feelings about the situation are constantly changing. I feel excited about relocating one hour, then feel helpless and pessimistic about it the next.  

The situation has not been resolved. I'm getting paranoid thoughts that the employer will rescind the offer.

I stopped taking meds in June, I tapered off over a 2-week period. My old psychiatrist is fully booked until the end of the month. I might see a psychologist over the weekend but from what I gather, psychologists don't entertain bipolar sufferers who are off their meds. 

I feel bad because we all have to make important and time-sensitive decisions, and yet I feel unable to in my current state. I am aware that I'm inconveniencing the employer."
1503,I was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder bipolar type but I feel like I just have the bipolar disorder because I don't here voices or have any kind of hallucinations or anything.  What does this really mean?
1504,"I have no idea when I posted last a lot has changed.
My husband and i split up, just out of the blue he decided that he wanted to end our marriage, He didnt want to consider a temporary separation or counselling...so anyway here we are 3 months on.
A few days after his decision to end our marriage i just couldnt cope i felt so defeated overwhelmed and I couldnt see how I could live without him.
I ended up in the psych ward I  felt like I couldnt carry on and I felt so scared as I truly believed that their was no reason for me to carry on. 
I truly believed that I was a burden to everybody I am sick of people worrying about me because that causes me more pain I wanted out.
My support worker who had only seen me a couple of days earlier and was so concerned he admitted me and on admission the pdoc said that she was considering placing me under the mental health Act. I knew that was coming and I actually felt safe being admitted and i got all the support and help I ended up in there for 4 weeks.
So  we sold our house I found a wee house for me and the dog who I have been able to keep.
I love him to bits. (the dog!!) :)
Its only now that I realise how controlling my ex had become. Constantly criticising me..complaining about my stomach making gurgling sounds. Blocking his ears while i am drinking my cup of tea because sometimes i might swallow a bit loudly.
Complaining if he needs to put petrol in my car  for instance. The list goes on and on
When I was on the ward the nurses were blown away by some of his behaviour towards me, My support worker and pdoc  were like how come we didnt know about all this I guess I couldnt see how bad his behaviour had got and I guess i was in denial.
Its obvious now the reason that my mental health hasnt been that great.
It still feels strange that I didnt tell anybody I guess i just didnt want to see it.
So living on my own is a new experience but doing ok
I do miss my ex but certainly not his attitude towards me
I do have bad and good days but thats to be expected i suppose"
1505,"So tonight my brother has decided to start Olanzapine (generic for Zyprexa).

So he'll be on 25 mg of Paroxetine, 100 mg of Lamotrigine, and 2.5 mg of Olanzapine.

Are there any suggestions or anecdotes anyone can offer before he gets on it?"
1506,"I started with med probably 3 1/2 months ago. It’s been very effective.
I have a coupon for a year with my co pay on my insurance capped at a reasonable price. If it wasn’t for that I couldn’t afford it.
Anyone else on it and found it effective?"
1507,"Hi, just joined the forum seeking advice from those that have experience with mental illness.

It's a reasonably long story but I will try to keep it concise:

-As a teen my sibling developed severe anorexia, which then led to her developing manic depression. All doctors that dealt with her said it was the most severe case they had seen. She attempted suicide, tried to strangle my parents in the night, she would jump in the same spot for hours on end. It completely tore my family apart., and it took a long time to get her any help (she could hold it together for short times when doctors assessed her). Eventually she was sectioned. For the next few years she would be in and out of psychiatric hospitals always for roughly 6 months to a year.

-In a psychiatric hospital she met her now husband, a severe schizophrenic. He has delusions that he is a world famous rockstar, on the run from people out to get him, and that he was raped by a woman of nobility. He has severe hallucinations every day, 
and is also an alcoholic.

-As a couple they lived together completely funded by her husband's mother who is very wealthy. Neither of them worked. She bought them a home, and gives them a lot of money. They are completely ungrateful and vile to the woman, and verbally harass her all the time. They are very bad with money and spend thousands on useless junk.

-Any way, a decade ago my sister became pregnant, nobody believed she could have children after devastating her body with anorexia. She was verging on a manic episode whilst pregnant, and didn't even realise she was pregnant until 8 months when a doctor told her (she was huge, obviously pregnant.) My family all dreaded what sort of future this child would have raised in this environment. Anyway the mental health team deemed them fit to look after a child (God knows why) and life continued on.

-Now for a few years after giving birth, my sister showed remarkable improvement. No manic episodes that would have her sectioned, just little bills where she babe have very oddly. Her husband on the other hand has become increasingly worse. Never sleeping, and obsessing over an imaginary woman. 

-This year things have escalated, her husband has become very ill, the little boy is exposed to all of this, hearing his father's rants. My sister has become increasingly manic and aggressive towards her husband and is exhibiting very strange behaviour: making up bizarre lies and verbally attacking everyone in the family.

-So that's the current situation a young boy is living with a seriously ill schizophrenic who is so out of reality that he let their rabbits starve to death. And a mother that is seemingly on the brink of a massive manic attack. Every day now my sister calls my siblings with some bizarre rant or behaviour. We just found out she has been living in an expensive hotel with her son, to avoid her husband. All paid for on her mother in law's credit card!

-Anyway the family is at a loss for what to do. My father has always buried his head in the sand pretending she is not ill etc. If my mother ever comments on my sister's health then my sister absolutely goes at her (she always hates her when she is ill) and won't speak to her for days. She verbally attacked me recentky after I asked why she brought a stranger to our home and demanded we put him up for the night (literally a stranger). My sister's mother in law is quite an odd woman and just keeps funding their lifestyle and complaining about it. 

-The mental health team in the area is useless, and so are social services, they don't see what the little boy is exposed to because my sister hides her and her husband's mental illness and neither of them accept that they have mental illnesses. My nephew is regressing more and more into himself, trapped in this awful environment. 

I can't foresee where all of this is going, but nowhere good. Sorry for the long essay, but it's hard to paint a picture of quite how bad this situation is. I don't think I have even nearly done it justice.

Any help or advice would be absolutely brilliant."
1508,"My thoughts are all over the place at the moment. Basically racing. So, I’m sorry if this sounds disjointed.
I’ve been down off of the last mood stabiliser for 1 week, psychiatrists orders, apparently, my diagnosis of cyclothymia and BPD, “Medication isn’t working and won’t work.” I’m still on an anti-psychotic but things are changing.

The past 3 days my mood has gone up, I can’t really control my thoughts and my actions and somethings I don’t even remember doing. I just feel like bursting out laughing at random things and I can’t shake that feeling no matter what the situation. My brain is screaming at me to go outside that the house is going to collapse. I’ve just had an incident where I’ve thought my mum (who is currently witnessing everything that is happening) that she put something in my drink, I thought she had drugged it as it has an aftertaste of one of my medications... I did ask apparently she hasn’t drugged it but I can still taste it.

Day one of this episode, I called my mental health worker up who told me, “This was normal and I shouldn’t see it as a problem.” For the first time since I met her (about 4 years ago) I became so irritated with her we had an argument... Normally I’m not a person with a short temper but I’ve found just how slow things are in the outside world is just becoming annoying. I tried to push that what I was feeling was more than, “happy.” (She mentioned as well “I should just be glad that I’m happy.”) She gave me the feeling that that’s all she sees this as is just me being happy rather than me being that elated that I’m actually singing and dancing through the streets. “I don’t know what you want me to do.” Was the most common thing she said in this conversation. I thought these people were there to understand and help?!
She asked how my mother was- it’s not fair on my mum but whenever I get into difficulty (Go up or down) they tell me to go to her and for her to deal with me, rather then them help and do what they are probably paid to do. I replied, “My mum is worried,” Now my mum who has more experience with me in my various states then they do, I got told, “Oh she just needs to be educated, then she’ll see this isn’t a problem.”- Her daughter won’t even get in a car because she believes she’s going to be in a car crash and can’t stop laughing at the thought of it, she shouldn’t be worried?

Before the medication I was diagnosed with Bipolar then they changed it to Schizoeffective before they changed it to Cyclothymia and BPD. I’ve tried arguing in the past that the medication has helped and that they were right with there original diagnosis although I’m not arguing with the BPD diagnosis- they literally through the book at me with that one. However, there idea of, “You have severe depression but the manic side isn’t bad enough for bipolar,” I feel is wrong (despite the fact I’ve read cyclothymia= mild depression+Hypomania. Bipolar type2= Moderate/severe depression+Hypomania. So I have no idea what’s going off there). Coming off the mood stabiliser this is the worst, “Hyper,” State I’ve had in years. 
I have had my mum argue for me, but my mental health worker and the psychiatrist just tend to go on what my notes say (even though they only get updated once in a blue moon as my worker only sees me every 8 weeks) rather than on what the real life accounts are saying. 

I have no idea what to do, it just feels like I’m not being listened too or believed."
1509,"first post here.  

I suffer from bipolar depression.  I take latuda, lamictal, and lexapro.  I also am a recovering alcoholic and drug addict.  The only thing that a do is smoke some cannabis. I’m trying to stop smoking(day 3)it but it seems to be the only  thing that slows down my mind and helps me sleep

I haven’t been happy in years. If fact I can’t remember a time when I was.  I’m so done with emotions and feelings.  I want them gone for good.  

My psychiatrist and therapist are great but it doesn’t seem to help.  I’m changing mds and therapists with help from my current ones as maybe a change............

I’m don’t think I’m suicidal, even though I really would rather be dead than deal with this any longer. 
I have a plan to do this though.  an  od.  I’ve used needles before, cocaine not opiates, so no fear of that.  

I am a master at hiding my true feelings.  My mom doesn’t even even pick up on them most days.  I don’t live with her but we have a close relationship.  We talk most every day."
1510,Hi there. I have not posted in a long time but tonight I am having some bad thoughts. I'm trying not to engage with these thoughts and images but it just won't go away. I don't know what has triggered this but felt if I reached out they may go away.
1511,"I’ve been on Seroquel aka Quitiapine for 15+ years.  I’ve been out of a job for 4+ years.  I’m also on citalopram, bupropion, and lithium.  I’ve had low energy, low self esteem, and very poor motivation.  I’m very sad and I’ve been crying on and off with humility and shame that I’m not a very successful person and a failure.

I’m a big Christian and I’m very close to god, every time I pray and read the Bible I get a very brief bubble of positivity and motivation.  I’ve been wondering through research if my Bipolar disorder has been mistaken for ADHD and other things.  I’m 31 and I was diagnosed with Bipolar at 9 years old. From 2007-2014 I was a huge pot smoker which could have very well changed the chemistry of my brain.

I’m no doctor, but would an Amphetamine like Adderall have any chance of helping me?  I’ve done meditation, I’ve done therapy, I have PTSD and a history of major depression, HOWEVER, suicide has never been an option for me, I have too many great friends and family who love me and something I know I’ll NEVER DO.  Let’s get that straight.  But the suffering is super REAL.

I’m on my last leg and I don’t know what to do.  I need help and I don’t know where else to go.  I live in Colorado, USA and this was the first forum that popped up on Google.  We might have different views, we might have different life styles, I’m an American Patriot who’s asking ANYONE for help.  I appreciate any advice in advance that can help me. 

With respect and an S.O.S. 

Billy Huebner, please please please help. Ask any further questions that can be helpful"
1512,"hey sorry again, I'm struggling...  I have a weekend of isolation now, no cash to do anything, no friends to share anything with...  

being dragged more and more into thoughts of suicide as an answer to this.  40 years of depression is enough for anyone.

:(

I do hope you guys are safe."
1513,in a really unsafe way.   scared of my own actions.....  life is rubbish and I don't want to do it any more. I don't cope with these feelings.
1514,"The one thing I need is a connection that matters with someone.  A friend. But I am an introvert and I am a loner. Making friends was easy when younger but now I'm 50 and its hard. Hard because I dont like going out and meeting new people even though I need to. 
 Family ony seem to care when they need something from me.  Colleagues are just colleagues that, just like me, are only there because they have to be to get the wage.  I am broken and alone and realise that I am defeated.  My strength for living is sapped.  I exist. 
It is not good for man to live alone. How do you make meaningful friendships when you can't even leave the house. I hate life but I know I could love it. I need to get a grip but cant find the inner resources. 

Life it seem is for winners, but i realise that I'm not one of them. I am a loser. I am defeated."
1515,"Hi,

I am asking on behalf of someone.

I not sure if this is the right place to ask my questions & if you cannot answer perhaps you could sign post me to some where I can get the answers I need.

So it is regarding hypomania or mania.

What is the difference between them both? What symptoms would be classed as mania and what symptoms would be classed as hypomania?

Can someone possibly have either of the above if they're having racing thoughts especially at night time, sudden decline in their sleep for example go from sleeping very well to suddenly having a few hours (2-4 hours) of sleep, lots of energy but have NO signs of increased speech & NO elevated mood instead they're very irritable, short tempered, restless, feel like their brain is going to fast & like their brain is going to explode, also cos their brain is going so fast that they're getting angry with others around them cos others are at a slower pace. 

Also a embarrassing thing for the person is their sex drive has shot up which is unusual for them as they are usually the opposite.

Also can someone be so restless and have ao much energy that they can't sleep and like I wrote above have between 2-4 hours a night but feel exhausted even though you have so much energy and are restless and cant sleep & have really bad racing thoughts?

This situation has been going on since 24/8/18. But like I said there is no signs of increased speech or any signs of a elevated mood. 

This person feels they cannot go to their local MH team cos they feel they do not get listened too and not taken seriously."
1516,"Hello all. I have had a few delusions in the past but nothing minor like this. I'm unsure if they are anything to be concerned about. Almost always I hear voices in my head. I will sit for hours just talking in my head , zones out. It is causing relationship issues as my boyfriend is complaining that I just sit here and shut down. 

 I have recently had a few issues. They typically happen while I'm paying down at night (usually shortly after). I know I am not asleel during these times as ill be steadily having conversation with my SO often. The first thing that's been happening is the past few weeks I have had very lucid dreams. In on instance I woke up, got out of bed and went upstairs (I live n a basement) as I had sworn I heard my mother calling me from up there. I came back down and saw that it was 5 am. My boyfriend stated that my mother wasn't there. I will be laying here and hear him speak to me , but when I ask him what he said he says he didn't say anything. I hear him clear as day though.  Another thing that happens frequently is I will have my eyes shut yet see very vivid images . It's like watching a movie in my head.  When I speak about them I call them 'visions' they randomly happen , even during the day. They are always random and not born off of anything that I have been thinking about   

Can anyone give any insight on this ?"
1517,"So a while back in March I think it was, I began getting agitated with the world around me. Might have had something to do with being off medications for few months. I was upset because I want to marry this woman and I was 29 years old and was pretty far from that goal. Maybe I'm further now. So it all started when I thought up of an advertising campaign for Kia Motors, actually for a dealership called Steven Kia, a local dealership. I pitched them the idea; I come in dressed as the devil and the dealer owner says ""Customers come in here buying Kias for thousands of dollars less than their worth, to us our customers are the devil! And we're prepared to make a deal. So we're selling our souls! 2018 Kia Souls for thousands of dollars off MSRP. It was going great they got my contact information and it looked like I was going to do a commercial. I thought it would be great if I could get a driver's licenses that said ""The Freaking Devil as my name but the lady at the DMV didn't see it like that. She called the cops on me. So I had one call to the cops. The next day, I was at my apartment, and I live in a student housing development and there is this giant wall there, that people can climb up. I saw a drunk guy climb to the top of this 40 wall and roll up on a party and nearly fall to his death, so I complained about it. Except I was very rude. I started off by asking them ""Are you having fun playing candy crush"" and I tore into them about what an awful job they were doing that they called the cops on me, filed a false police report saying I lunged at them. I'd like to see the survalence footage of that. I'm sure the real footage would play well in a courtroom for me, but I'd bet if it came to that they'd burn the footage. So now I had two calls to the cops, and the next day I go play a jingle, and advertisement I made up for the Dayton Tavern. ""Oh my goodness! On the menu"" and it was so good. A lady came up to me outside the Dayton Tavern and blessed my performing ability, she was really impressed. Nothing wrong with that. What was wrong is she had a face that looked like crystal meth hadn't been kind to her, and I raced to get her away from the restaraunt where customers could see her. She had jaundice in her eyes and a solid bottom tooth. When I took her back to the Dayton minimart the guy, the owner gave me a look like he had just lost a customer for life. I had immediately found a problem with his store, see the lady was living in the apartment complex/minimart and I noticed how messed up and dissaranged his store was, I remember remarking how inexpensive his 40 malt liquor was and how he had a single condom next to some batteries across from the register and how the black and milds were in reach of children. I didn't want to make him shit his pants but I just about did, see I had been putting up with so much crap I just had to unload, and so what he did is file a false police report on me. Pretty shocking allegations he supposedly has on me. Lets just say that 70 crystal meth lady turned into a 7 year old granddaughter. I tried to get the cops the next day to take that lady to a hospital and they ended up taking me to the hospital.

Now I didn't want to be there, seeing as I had no insurance I thought my only option was to be an asshole and have them kick me out. Hospitals don't work like that. Once I started causing trouble I couldn't stop. 20 days later I was released from a state hospital that houses the criminally insane, my neighbor was a Neonazi, guy down the hall was probably a murderer. I don't even drink. What was I doing next to these people?"
1518,"My brother is 45 years old. He is a CRNA and makes very good salary. I say this because it factors in the situation. I am 56. Ever since I have known him from about the age of 5 he has had deep issues with depression. He would go into moods that were so dark he would fall on his bed and not move for hours. You had to leave him alone. At one point when he was about 30 he was at his job while going to collage for CRNA at a paint factory. You are in any factory supposed to wear safety gear. He would not put his safety glasses on and when the supervisor asked what it would take to get him to put the glasses on he said ""super glue them fucking there.""

This almost got him fired. He then becomes very afraid of losing his job and starts to beat himself up as self destructive. He then seems to get a grip for a short while. Once he got enough credits to get his nursing lisc while still going for CRNA he popped back into his destructive self and told the paint factory he was a nurse and they could shove their job where the sun does not shine. 

While in CRNA school he had some kind of melt down with the school and they kicked him out. He scrambled went into his I need to get a grip on my life fall back position and found another school and made it through. 

He is very hard to be around. He was diagnosed with boarder line personality disorder. He went on meds can not say what ones. He also has and I am guessing here but I am sure its some kind of Narcissistic personality. Every one is an ant below him and are almost not worth them living. He can only be around one person at a time and they are his main friend. If he jumps to another person than every one else is scum and he will look at them with contempt. 

I will say he is better then he used to be when younger but not good. Well he became a CRNA and was working at his ""dream job"" making very good money. He went out and spent a lot buying a sports car, new Harley even though he never rode motor cycle, and lives a high life. He will have to tell you every time he talks to you how much he makes, and is saving for retirement or what his house cost. 

So the first CRNA job he was doing a epidural for a woman who had a dead fetus and it was going to be removed. He did not know this and he also did not know she was one of the Dr. Wife. He went in and told me someone told him how fast they could do one and he has no bed side manor. I still don't know what happened but she wanted him fired after that. According to my brother the Dr. has a lot of pull and got him fired, well they let him resign. He got another CRNA job about 35 miles away and that was about a year ago. 

Yesterday I got a call from a number I did not recognize. I am having AC/heat pump issues, and was expecting a call from them and thought this was it. It was my brother and he was talking in his deep depression voice. I asked what was going on, he said I am in a mental facility near my house. I checked myself in. I asked what is going on? He said he got into a argument with a Dr. in front of a patient and he kept escalating it. The Dr. is demanding he is to be fired. He lost it. He has about 8 guns, two rifles ar15s and several hand guns. I am a gun person so I am not anti gun at all but I do recognize this is the time to remove them from his access. 

I asked what I can do, and does he need me to take care of his pets ect. The faclity is taking his phone away and gave me an access code to get a message to him. They also asked me to remove the hand gun from his car and home. I said I would do that today. 

So this is in a nutshell. I am not sure what to do. So any help would be appreciated."

yeah... bipolar. my diagnosis says 'severe' and they aren't kidding. it is severe because meds don't work, therapy doesn't work, the wards don't work. the last option they're suggesting is shock therapy or Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to try and see some results. that's the worse thing they could do to it, as it can leave me brain damaged, memory loss, I fear doing that i will forget how to do art, i won't think twice of it."

He would rather watch tv and relax and I constantly want to be on the go doing different things and doing something every minute of the day. I am not sleeping like it’s 3.30 in the morning right now and I am not tired cos I got racing thoughts and so much energy and I am getting irritable and angry and I want to tear my skin off. During the day is hard with the energy and the irritability but night times are worst and I hardly sleep and I am up all night doing things on my phone, doing my studies, planning things for my birthday party, planning for my holiday next week. But I feel awful cos this energy is uncomfortable and I feel like I don’t want my body and mind right now cos of how uncomfortable it feels and the anger is building up and I am getting more and more irritable by the minute. I have no one to tell & my husband is not helping & we are just arguing and he telling me I need to be patient cos I ask him to hurry up cos he not doing things at my pace he is so slow and it’s get me irritable and he saying I got a bizarre way of thinking cos I want to be busy every minute of the day apparently people are not busy every minute of the day. I am getting irritable cos he likes watching tv a lot and I can’t sit there I gotta keep moving! Sorry this turned out a long post!"
1524,"I want to marry this one woman but she has the wrong idea about me. 4 years ago, I was working at Walmart as an electronics associate, and there was this woman who worked with me, I'll call her Jocy. She liked me at one time, and I was totally in love with her, but my doctors told me I had schizophrenia and I didn't think it was a good idea to tell her how I felt about her. I repressed how I felt about her and she would walk up to me and I would say something of utter stupidity like ""I HAVE A BEACH HOUSE! YOU SHOULD COME SOME TIME!"" and I would try to stuff those words back into my mouth, but I couldn't because they came out and words don't work like that. and she sat me down, given her quick wit figured something was wrong with me and said ""You're a special kind of special"" which was devastating for me to hear because I was trying to prevent her from ever knowing. 

Then one day I told her this joke that didn't just bomb, it Hiroshima'd and I was at the epicenter, and I didn't know how I could ever recover.

She left not long after that and I felt so disappointment that I started throwing up every day. I couldn't take my medications and even though she could probably guess my feelings for her, but the fact that I didn't tell her how I felt meant I was repressing feelings, and when you do that they become stronger. After vomiting up my medications for a month, I knew I should have told her how I felt but I kept saying to myself ""I can't I'm crazy"" and then it was like I didn't understand the concept of crazy. I was like ""I'M CURED! I CURED MYSELF RIGHT NOW!"" Then I texted her because we were friends on Facebook and I was completely out of my mind for not having slept for over a week. I told her all this embarrassing stuff about myself and at first she thought it was all a joke, but I kept texting her and then she blocked me.

At this point, I figure she probably blasted off in a rocket ship and is living on Mars, so I need to be a stowaway on Elon Musks rocket when he goes to Mars."

1534,"Living with bipolar 2 isn’t what you’d imagine. It isn’t a rollercoaster of emotions, or a slow paced children's carousel, it is periods of suicidal ideation and drug abuse. I wasn’t what you’d call a happy child. Despite getting everything I ever wanted and being spoiled by my parents, I was an angry child. The classic tale of emotional abuse and a mentally ill mother really added onto my lonesomeness and my flawed idea of life. Thrown away by the idea of love that I never got from a mother, I set out to confide in others. I was what you’d call a hopeless romantic, hoping someone would pick me up from my house with a bouquet of fresh red roses and hold me until I could feel again. Prior to being diagnosed, I wondered why I was sad for no reason, though I never questioned why I was happy. See, my middle school years weren’t spent at playgrounds or swim meets, they were spent in my bathtub, crying away tears of heartbreak that hadn’t even occurred. I was a pathological liar. Lying and manipulation had become my goto and is what kept me running. I lied about everything, from where I was from, to lying about having deceased dogs and family members. This is something I was doing for the purpose of entertainment, lying made me feel like I had some control over people’s emotions, I wanted them to feel bad for me. Their sadness, their empathy, it gave me a sense of comfort, as if someone cared. In my high school years, I explored the classic marijuana and partying phases, where I’d go off with my so called friends I’d change every year and party away into the night, dancing like a complete idiot and going home to bawl my eyes out to sleep. I was what you’d call a rebel child, nothing like my family or even my extended family, just a completely lost girl wondering what was wrong with her. After my first real heartbreak, I couldn’t bear the idea of life anymore. It was at this moment where I thought I had found love or was worthy of love, but it was all too good to be true. At fifteen years old, I was put into the hospital on suicide watch after telling my mother I was going to kill myself. It was there and then when I had found out what was wrong with me. The doctors diagnosed me with depression and had me put on antidepressants which ultimately triggered a manic episode about a month or two later. It was then when I knew. It finally made sense, all these years of pain and suffering all leading to one thing, bipolar disorder. I was frightened by the name. Bipolar disorder, disorder? Am I sick? I surely felt sick by the sound of it leaving the psychiatrists mouth. The diagnosis started a journey of going on and off medications that left my moods and my body in complete haywire. Trying new things, getting pressured by my parents to invest in yoga classes, it was all too much to handle. One thing I did achieve from the diagnosis was something I’d been looking for since the day I could judge this world, closure. I finally knew what was wrong with me, and it was finally time to start acting on it. There is no known cure for bipolar disorder but it is a manageable illness. I still struggle with medications and suicidal thoughts but those consist of me isolating myself. I thrive for loneliness because it’s what I’ve become used to and it’s surely something I live with. Bipolar disorder isn’t a pretty or fascinating trend, it’s something I have to live with every single day. I feel it when I wake up every morning, drugged and ready to pass out, or when I have to shower, or even when I don’t shower for weeks. Bipolar disorder is there when I’m meeting new people and writings tests or exams. It doesn’t turn off when I need to put my sadness away and go for a life changing opportunity, it stays with me even during the happiest of times. It’s there when I stare at a wall for an hour and it’s there when the voices won’t stop. I can only rely on it to be kinder to me especially when I stand in my kitchen wanting to self-harm. Bipolar disorder isn’t just an illness, it’s me."

1536,"Hey guys and girls, so , indulge me if you will, but i have some questions as to whether  i may have bi polar, or if something else is tagging along with my depression and anxiety. 
You see, my mother had manic depression / bi polar, but i dont face the extremes she has, still, my depression often has spells where things seem better, or im even over excitable to the point of impulsive and silly, only to return to being depressed and over stressed again. I often feel restless , get insomnia and feel *creative* and want to do impulsive things, only to later feel drained, tired and down. I have *sides* that are confident, or really energetic , and the other really withdrawn and anti social. I have major problems letting the past go, or people not seeing my point of view / side of things. Im also obsessed with certain points in my life that seemed blissful to where ive been since, and i yearn to return to that point, despite knowing things wouldnt be the same. I cant see the point in most things in life because they seem futile, or because they seem insignificant in the grand scheme of things, so i end up not caring about much. I cant stand being the same person and tend to be very dysmorphic, constantly wanting to change who i am or how i look
Honestly, while already diagnosed with anxiety/social anxiety and chronic depression, i often feel theres more to it, and ive been told i have traits of bpd, but i never really fully disclose with the docs, because i dont want even more labels and medication after seeing what its done to people related to me.:low:
Any advice or opinions?"
1537,"Hello, I am a new member here. I was diagnosed in 2010 and have had 3 or 4 hospitalisations since. I tend to get very high but short mild lows. My highs tend to happen August to September. There has been a new addition, I’m self harming . This is as a tension release with no suicide intentions though it is worrying. I don’t feel as though my doctors are listening. I’m worried about this new development, I want to go back to my happy high, any advice?"
1538,"Hi all.

Quick history, diagnosed with ocd few years back known have had it for years since I was a kid. Have had severe depression and early this year was put on lactimal/lamotrigine (low dose increasing steadily) with suspected bipolar which isn’t a surprise with the last few years (also grandmother on mother’s side had severe bipolar).

Since on lactimal I’ve had much less severe depressive episodes and less swings than I’ve had in the last few years. I’ve been in a (gay) relationship for 2 years now and I know they are my soulmate, we click so well and love a lot of the same thing. We live together and plan to move out of my parents together eventually.

I have a very different sex drive to him. He is top only, doesn’t really like to experiment and very much into the same thing over and over. I’m kind of... into a lot. We have amazing sex but after two years it’s getting boring, not bad, just lacking. I suggest things to spice it up and honestly I can never see him going past very light stuff. I’ve considered asking him to open up our relationship cause I see sex and intimacy as separate things but I know he won’t want that, despite us wanting to be together forever.

So, what I wanted to ask really was sometimes my sex drive goes crazy, and I’m sure it’s partly to do with my mental health mood fluctuations. However I know that I’m honestly extremely sexual and wild, and having these episodes can really exacerbate this. I want to have fun and experiment, heck I’m not even sure I’m 100% gay anymore! Am I just having a really horny moment or is my mental health affecting this? Obviously there are no doctors here so I just wanted general advice.

Additionally to this, how do i bring things like this up with my partner, knowing he’s going to be upset about it but not wanting to ever hurt him.

P.S. I would never in my life cheat on anyone, and open relationships have rules and guidelines, I’m not jumping into these thoughts blindly."

1541,"My story is long so I'll aim to keep it brief to give an outline. I know I have Bipolar and have known this for 13 years.

10 years ago I was diagnosed with BPD by a mental health nurse after sharing something with her, seconds later she declared I had BPD and I was sent to this therapy group once a week, where I remained for 9 months. The diagnosis of BPD was confirmed by a locum psychiatrist 4 months later who I had never met previously.

I have always argued with professionals about my diagnosis and questioned it. For a while I accepted it, if only because it was getting me down and during that time I was under the CMHT, had a consultant psychiatrist and was in long term therapy MBT especially for those with BPD. Even in therapy for 18 months I struggled to relate to others who were accepting of their BPD diagnosis.

I still don't fit the criteria for BPD and I've never been someone who is a typical person with BPD. I don't self harm but I have had a binge eating disorder since my teens which is more prominent when I am depressed. 

I was discharged from my psychiatrist in 2014 and my CPN in 2015 and have never felt abandoned when services have ended. For a while things were stable but then a familiar trigger for me (noise) sent me slightly off sync. This triggered depression in 2016, but despite seeking help all anyone could see was the BPD label and I gave up and eventually got better myself. The depression lasted about 10 weeks. 

2017, the same trigger caused another bout of depression which soon switched into a mixed episode and this was the worst I had ever found myself. I was both depressed, suicidal but agitated, irritable, high functioning and also experienced paranoid thoughts, became obsessed with 1 person and heard voices and saw people who where dead. I eventually planned my death. I was at this time on no medication. I also barely slept for several weeks. 

Despite seeking help the BPD label again meant help was not forthcoming and even my GP tried to get help, with one member of staff telling her, I wouldn't act on what I was saying. 24 hours later I did try to end my life and woke up in ICU. 

I engaged for 5 weeks with the HBTT but again it was all about the BPD label and I continually asked for someone to tell me how I met the criteria for BPD, no one was willing to tell me. I did write an article about how BPD and Bipolar were similar and pointed out how I felt I fitted into the relevant criteria. The psychiatrist within the HBTT agreed I was encroaching a Bipolar diagnosis but because they had not witnessed any hypomania they could not change my diagnosis... Over the years I have been involved with services when I have been hypomanic and mixed but there is so much missing from my notes even the psychiatrist said 'they didn't flow properly'. '

I always pointed out last year to them that my biggest fear was going through what I did last year again. It was scary and part of me knew it was likely to happen again. I find the older I get the more frequent and prominent are my mood cycles.

Fast forward to today, this year I spent about 6 weeks depressed so decided to put myself on Prozac knowing it would possibly make my mood elevated (first experienced this in 2000) Within 48 hours I was hypomanic and this lasted 9 weeks - it was amazing, then I crashed into depression again for three weeks before another mild bout of hypomania which lasted about 12 days (ceased Prozac by this point)

Now the last few weeks my mood has been mixed again and suicidal thoughts back. I thought about going back on Prozac again but didn't think it was a good idea, however my GP decided I should - at this point I had not shared with her the 9 weeks of hypomania but we did talk on the phone when a friend raised concerns and she thought I was manic and wanted to see me. She decided I was not manic, but I know I was hypomanic... Obviously there is a difference.

6 days ago I recommenced Prozac and within hours my mood was elevated. I have barely slept and my obsessional thoughts are back as are some other worrying things. My GP is due to phone on Friday to see how I am getting on with the Prozac! 

My experiences of seeking help last year have left me almost terrified of seeking help again. I did complain to the trust and they apologised and two members of staff were put on supervision for the errors they made.

My sleep is the most bothersome, I've taken to going for drives in the middle of the night just so I don't clean the house again. In terms of risky behaviour I would love nothing more than to go on a joyride and be chased by the police! 

Whilst I'm hypomanic now again, I also feel life no longer has a purpose and there is no reason for me to live, not even for the person I care for. I am preoccupied with death and feel at the age I am (41) my life for the last 15 years has been wasted by what I feel is the wrong diagnosis. 

I did once see a private psychiatrist 8 years ago, she was fabulous and never diagnosed me BPD, she said I had a mood disorder, PTSD and a Binge Eating Disorder. I've considered returning to her in recent weeks but prices have shot up and I can't afford it. 

How to I get the mental health team to see what is going on and join the dots? 

I am certain with the right medication and therapy I can get life back on track and maybe return back to paid work. Now I can't even engage in volunteering work which I use to love because I'm either in the depths of depression or too hyper to function. 

I can also pinpoint my first mixed episode it was back in 2009 when I was in therapy and for the life of me I cannot understand why no one could see what was happening. 

Sorry a very long post."

1543,"Hi everyone,

This is my first post on this site. Also, please forgive me for being naive. I know very little about Bipolar Disorders.

Short Version (Because I know some people don't have time to read everything):
If you are on a mood stabilizer, is it common to still have manic or depressive episodes? Isn't a mood stabilizer supposed to prevent that?

Longer Version (Because I really want to share information behind the question):
I suffer from depression, anxiety, and hallucinations/delusions that come and go independently and randomly. I started seeing a new psychiatrist 3 months ago who believes that this is probably some type of mood disorder similar to bipolar disorders (But the psychosis symptoms take the place of manic episodes). All of my previous psychiatrists thought it was a form of schizophrenia. 
She put me on lamotrigine. It worked wonders up until very recently. It lifted my mood and virtually stopped my hallucinations and delusions. In the past couple of days, my hallucinations and delusions have returned. I am worried because these symptoms have always come in ""phases"" where they start and stop for no reason. 
So I am asking if it is common to still experience manic and depressive cycles on a mood stabilizer because I am afraid that it is possible that the phase coincidentally stopped around the time i started taking the medication, and is now starting again. I am afraid that maybe this medicine didn't work at all and it was just my imagination/high hopes. I am going to try to make an appointment with my psychiatrist if these symptoms don't go away in a few days.

Thank you in advance for your support

1544,"I was diagnosed with bipolar one into thousand four. I've had a lot of different treatments some work to someone for a time and  then some I never should've touched at all. To keep this simple I was prescribed a drug lithium I started having delusions and I've been in another hospital a lot in the past six months when I lost my motor skills and I couldn't walk from my living room to the kitchen I knew something was wrong. My dr said I was having side effects to the lithium so it takes 3 months to come off of it. I am also on zyprexa and tegritol.

I can't sit still, I'm afraid to leave my home,i am so angry and hateful. I want to start a fight but realize it would probably not be good. 
 Does anyone have any advice about how I get through the next few months stepping down the lithium and being able to take the bipolar medicine that is good for me"

1551,"Hello everyone how are you doing,

I just wanted to talk with you all about the situation I am currently in as I'm not sure who to talk with about this.

About 4 years ago I've moved countries, the initial experience was good but later on as the school year started I'd find myself isolated having no friends outside the school (I'd talk with everyone in school but after the school I wouldn't go out and just stay in home). This continued on for about 3 of those 4 years as in the last year I've managed to get a grip and bring myself together to go out and have fun with my new-found friends. 

About 2-3 years in living in my new home country I'd start watching TV shows and videos on the internet which would include moments of deep sadness, happiness and many worthwile lessons about life. I remember it was February or March because there were a few months left until the summer vacation during which I'd come back to my home country for 2-3 months and spend time with my best friend who was waiting for my return. Until I'd come back I was very very VERY sad, I think I'd even dare to exclaim that I was depressed at that time( and I don't like saying I have depression since I've never went to psychologist who could examine me) but that's what I felt at that time. I thought after I saw all those shows involving those sad moments of despair I just became used to it and that's why my heart wouldn't waver, but I didn't even shed a tear when I would see them for the first time.

During those 4 years I cried around 2-3 times in total. I find myself numb, empty of emotion, unable to cry, and crying only when being pushed to the very limit of my emotion (I suppose that's what it is). And I do feel emotion as I care about my friends and family members well-being, I love nature and animals.

As I kept living in my new country I'd start to act differently than I did in my home country, as I was never a sad person and was always full of happiness and joy. As you can tell that changed where I became very pessimistic ( or realistic as I kept insisting whenever someone would call me a pessimist).People also called me differently as my foreign name was too hard to pronounce and I'd make up a nickname for everyone to call me by. That's when I started seeing myself as two different people as well, and regardless of whether I truly act like 2 different people I kept insisting on it in my mind.

There was also a case where my crush, whom I loved for around 6-7 years got herself a boyfriend and I found myself short of words. My bestfriend tried to console and help me as he was the one who delivered me the news but I said I'll be fine, even though I was sad and definitely not happy about it, but I never felt like I was suffering too much from it at the start although I think it took it's toll on me over time.

So, I just wanted to ask all of you, is this nothing severe? is this something normal for everyone to go through in their lives or should I get concerned about it? I was feeling suicidal few years ago but I'm not anymore, I'm just sad most of the time and feel empty, being unable to cry and put myself at ease.

Thank you everyone who will read this and try to help, thank you again."

1553,"Need advice on helping my manic bipolar friend, strange things are happening

Hi, brand new to the forum. Posting today because i have a manic bipolar friend who is struggling but yesterday things got strange...some background. Ive known this person for a year. I met her at a festival last summer. She was very bad off as she had been a serious alcoholic for about 5 years, she was nearly dead, doctors had given her 6 months to live 6 months before. She was drinking roughly 1 liter of rum a day...and she weighs just over 100 lbs...that bad. I gave her a place to stay and helped her get off the alcohol. She almost died twice during detox, once on her own waiting for a spot to open up in rehab and another time on the floor of the rehab. Shes been mostly sober for the past 6 months (shes an alcoholic, every month or two she may have a moment of weakness and drink one drink, but thats it.)

It wasnt til she sobered up that i started to notice her mental health issues. After a while of paying close attention to her behavior i sat her down and pointed out that she had, what i thought might be some schitzophrenic tendancies. this is when she opened up and told me she had been diagnosed manic bipolar many years ago. She hasn't been on any medication. Obviously when you are too drunk to walk for 5 years you dont exatctly make and keep doctors appointments.

The past few months things have kind of been going off the rails. It would seem that the alcohol had been masking many of the manic symptoms. She has a few days where shes full of energy and never stops cleaning and running around. she talks incessantly. Literally one day she told the same story over and over for almost 13 hours. Then she gets...its not depressed, thats not really it, her energy is dampened but not her mood, she just gets more short tempered...its more tired and moody. She will get inconsolably upset over the littlest thing and cannot calm herself down.
 
She does have some delusions and feels like everyone is against her. Just one example i bought her a cheap car that needed tons of work and started fixing it up for her...the guy i bought it from sent out for the title and it should be here in a few weeks...she got into one of her ""moods"" and accused me of buying the car for myself. She said i got the car to ""pretend"" to give it to her just so i could keep it for myself. (If you knew me you would understand how ridiculous this is, i build and race cars, i already have 3 mazda miata's and i dont need or want this one as a 4th) In all actuality im doing everthing i can to help her have the best chance at a good, stable life. She really does believe these things in the moment but by the time she settles down and is lucid again she always realizes how off base she was and appologizes profusely. I never hold it against her because i know that that simply isnt her, so its never really an issue. I just ride the wave til it crashes on the beach and then we move on. So that was a quick segway to give you an idea of whats going on here.
 
So she will sleep for days and doesnt want to eat. scattered throughout these ups and downs she will have minor seizures pereodically. Not that often. Im convinced its tied to the alcohol abuse in her past and the lack of nutrition. We have been getting her to doctors appointments and the have started testing her for all her physical health ailments, which there are alot, as well as getting her to behavioral health professionals. She has to see her counselor one more time this week then she can get a psychiatrist appointment, almost there! :)

So heres where things get really interesting and scary. In the past few days she has had 3 major seizures. Her usual seizures just involve her being shaky for a few minutes. She is fully lucid during these and can talk to you through the whole thing. These last 3 seizures she has blacked out and gone into full convulsions for about 30 seconds and afterwards doesnt remember anything and has trouble speaking for 5 or 10 minutes. We called her doctor immediatly and got her an appointment first thing monday morning. She hadnt been eating and had been sleeping for days. After the 3rd one she was able to take all her vitamins the doctor told her she needed and eat a full meal with lots of vegetables and nutrition. The seizures went away and she seemed to be doing much better almost instantly.

One thing ive noticed in the few days since is that she is still having trouble ""finding her words"". This is very alarming to me because its similar to how she was after the seizures, just not nearly as pronounced. If i didnt know her so well i wouldnt even notice. I can hear the frustration in her voice as she tries to find the words to make her sentences. Its not that bad really, not like after the seizures, but it does happen. It really freaks me out becuase a friend of ours had a stroke this year and he still struggles ""finding"" his words even months after his recovery. She doesnt have nearly the amount of trouble he still has trying to talk but its the same kind of ordeal.

So finally...to the reason i posted today... Im sorry for the saga of a book here but this is as condensed as i could tell this story. For anyone who has hung in here this long thank you, thank you, thank you! I desperatly need some advice on how to help my friend. Im sure the doctor can help us monday and the counselor wed. but i just cant wait that long for some advice.

So yesterday she went out with our mutual friend to run some errands around town. By the time she got home she was very upset and heres what she told me happened...She said she went to Wal-Mart and saw a bunch of her teachers from highschool, shed had a dream about all of them the night before, and she tried to talk to them but they all acted like they didnt know her and it hurt her feelings. After that they went to HEB to pick up some of her meds for a tooth infection shes been suffering from. She said she saw more of her teachers there as well...same thing, she approached them wanting to talk and they all acted like they didnt know her. She was very upset at this point so our friend took her to play bingo, one of their frequent hang out spots. Again, she said her teachers were there as well, same thing happened, they all acted like they didnt know her. So fast foreward to today she went to a friends appartment to give her a gift and she wasnt home, she knocked on a neigbors door to give her the gift to give to her when she got home and low and behold, again, the apartment had a few of her teachers from highschool inside, same story all over again.

This obviously doesnt sound good. The mathematical probability of these people showing up at every place she went is astronomically unlikely, bordering on impossible, and the fact that the all said they didnt know her...im starting to worry her delusions are turning into hallucinations. Like i said we've got an appointment monday and ill be able to pull her doctor aside and tell her whats been going on. Hopefully i can get a chance to talk to her counselor as well. 

On the upside she isnt a danger to herself or anyone else and her symptoms and behavior are always managable. We are able to talk openly and honestly about what goes on with alot of love and im always able to talk her back down from her stress and anxiety so we have much more good times than bad. She just doesnt handle stress very well and is just freaked out by life here and there. Fortunately i have a nack for keeping her calm and happy so im not worried about us getting through the next two days but i would love if anyone could chime in that has been through something like this or supported someone through a similar situation. Ive devoted the past year of my life to helping her pick up the pieces of her own. Her family is more than useless, they are just horrible selfish people who dont care about her at all. It has fallen on me and our mutual friend to take the reigns and make this happen. I refuse to watch such a beautiful person get beat down by life. I love my friend and she deserves the best chance for happiness and a spectacular existence, and that is why im reaching out today, any information would be very helpful. Im here trying to get a better understanding of her and her struggles so i can be better informed and more capable of helping her through this troubled period of her life. We have plenty of hope and determination and i know we will prevail!!! :clap: 
Thank you so much for reading all this!"
1554,"Hi. Posting on here to hopefully get some guidance. I have a 21 year old stepdaughter who we think has bipolar.  Let me explain.

As a child/teenager she was always a challenge. Charming and smiling one minute or rude, moody and quiet the next without any explanation.  However we put it down to her being a teenager trying to adapt to new family set up.

She has always been either extremely loud, talking fast or the total opposite in her own world not speaking to anyone. She goes through phases where she will take up a hobby and for a while it’s the best thing in the world only to give up and move on to something else. She cannot keep friends and moves from group to group. It’s either black or white never grey if you understand what i mean.

She lives with her mother who is ill and they argue a lot but she chose to live there as closer to work and people she knows. Like many young people she enjoys a drink but i fear she enjoys it too much. A few months ago she got in her car drunk and purposely drove it into a wall. She was taken unhurt to hospital and the mental health team phoned us quite concerned about her mental state. However the following morning they discharged her after a quick assessment and there has been no follow up.

She doesn’t know but one of her friends contacts us to tell us if she has any concerns about her. She recently said she threatened to take some paracetamol while drunk. It is awkward as we cannot tell her we know as we would not have a spy in her friend anymore. 

We have tried to tell her to go for help but she insists there is nothing wrong. Thing is my husband, her dad, has bipolar and he recognises the signs. Thankfully he is on medication that real help him.

We are very worried about her. But she is 21 so we can’t force her to get help.

What can we do?"
1555,"Every antidepressant I have tried causes extreme mania but without them I get very depressed

I am diagnosed as Bipolar, PTSD, OCD and anxiety disorders. Less than a year ago I learned the hard way what serotonin syndrome is. By this I have had it to many times to count looking back and each time it happened it got worse to the point of me being close to being in a coma. It was bad the last time after it was over it was a very scary thing and that is when I found out what serotonin syndrome was.

I put way to much trust in my dr.s and I didnt really question them, Now I do. 
Why it took so long to say something isn't right. I wish I knew why but I don't and that is frustrating and I am kicking myself for it still.
 
I am really doubting my bipolar diagnosis because I never had mania before the antidepressants. 

Even with mood stabilizers I get sever mania from taking antidepressants some are worse that others but all are pure hell!!!

With the antidepressants I would be in some form of mania most of the time with mixed episodes and very little depression.  My anxiety and ocd where off the charts for so many years.


But without these meds I am in a deep depression. And the antidepressants  withdrawals are terrible. On the positive side the mania is gone and  the OCD is much better but still there and anxiety is just a little better.
 

What depression treatment options are there for people like me that can't tolerate antidepressants."
1556,"I’m very self aware and know I’m a bit strange, but hearing someone else tell me this fact, ain’t easy. Especially when it’s said out of spite. 
I’ve been told some of the following: 
“You’re not normal” (this was said to me following my brother in laws stag do, sitting around a table, the morning after a heavy night drinking. Came from my brother’s friend. He said it staring at me, a look of disdain on his face).

“You’re insane” (said to me on a drunken night out from a work colleague at the time. I had confessed to him some of my mad thinking at the time, perhaps not the best idea with hindsight)

“Calm down. What are you going to be like when you’re older, when you’re an old man” (said after I was acting a bit happy manic following a few drugs I’d taken)

There’s more, but you get the picture. Hardest thing is, I kind of agree. I kind of am a bit nuts, and definitely ain’t normal. Don’t think I ever have been. Just wish it wasn’t such a negative to be a bit different."
1557,"Hi, in a slightly better place now. I kind of had a mini breakdown (number 99 and counting). I would like to thank the people who replied for being kind and supportive including the moderators who pm’d me."
1558,"I'm a 20 year old male and I already have a diagnosis of psychosis 
anyway I think I've got bipolar 
because I go for a period ranging from a few days to a couple of months where I'm really low I can't be bothered with life and I feel suicidal 
other times again ranging from a few days to a about a month I go through a period where I spend loads of money make loads of plans and promises and I feel fantastic 
I'm on an antidepressant which doesn't work I've been on others that made my mood go really high 
I'm also on anti psychotics for my psychosis but do nothing for my mood"
1559,"i've reached this site after first googling ""why does everybody fucking hate me"", then after much brooding finally seeking out a forum with people that could maybe help. i've realized it's only a specific group of people that hate me, and what makes it worse is that i know exactly why, but i have no idea how to fix it.

i was first diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder when i was about 14. the following 4 years have been tumultuous, to say the least. it is a miracle that i passed this summer, as i was hospitalized and out of school with a tutor for part of second and all of third quarter. in my most recent hospital visit i was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, like my mother. my first suicide attempt was in april of 2017. then again this january, except i did not come anywhere near close to dying that time.

i was in a really strange sort of haze. i felt i had finally found a solid group of friends, and it was doing wonders for my social anxiety and self-esteem. partially, it had to do with an excess of substances in my system from the whole new-years thing. another part of it had to do with a friend i was particularly close with leaving with someone else. it felt like how they describe heartbreak, but i was almost immune to it, and walking home i felt a terrible and intricate plan form in my mind. i felt i was really going to die that day, no matter how. but i wanted to make it important.

this whole episode will haunt me for the rest of my life. it's the type of thing that creeps up the back of my skull and makes me close my eyes tight and hold my ears as if not to see or hear any of the memory. how fucking stupid was i? what the fuck did i expect?

i had about ten friends in that group. they were all very interesting in their own ways, and all very dear to me. in what i presumed to be my final hours i wrote a poem for each of them. then, i drafted out an INCREDIBLY, PAINFULLY long message to send out to the group of them, basically saying: ""hey, i understand i'm annoying and insufferable, i'm going to berid of myself now. here's all my innermost fears and exaggerations of my most obvious flaws. but no, don't try to stop this. this is not your fault. sorry for being such a waste!""

and not an hour later, i heard a knock on my door and there was a policeman there, asking if i was okay, and looking at me with these weird concerned eyes. the rest of it is kind of a blur, and feels so incredibly grey and hopeless.

i often feel as if i'm stuck in a timeline chock-full of worst-case scenarios. if i hadn't beaten myself up so much, i wouldn't have so thoroughly convinced myself i needed to die that night. and had i died, i wouldn't have to face this terrible aftermath.

now i'm so full of medicine i can barely feel a thing. moments of joy are short-lived, and moments of sadness turn into regret turn into panic turn into running off somewhere in the night, walking down the side of the highway looking for something, i don't know what.

i still do the things i used to do. i still smoke about 5 cigarettes a day, but it doesn't give me the same kind of release of tension. i still get on social media, and what hurts is i'm still following some of those friends i sent that message to.

their response to it has been to cut me off completely.

some of them i am okay with not talking to, but two of them in particular i miss the most. one of them was kicked out by her mother and lived out of state. she's finally back here, and i see all her new posts with my old friends. i messaged her back in april, then again about two months ago out of the blue, a very very long message again. she actually responded to this, and said that she was ""not ready for a relationship again"", and that her mother kicking her out has caused her ""all sorts of new ptsd"".

about a week ago, i messaged her again, asking if she wanted to get coffee sometime, like she had mentioned before when i spoke to her in april. no response.

the other girl i used to be close with was supportive while i was in the hospital, but cut me off after i got out and spilled my guts to her about the hospital and the meds not doing anything for me. i was very scary then.

i don't know if most people's bipolar is like this, but i don't really get 'manic' -- i get incredibly nervous and start talking fast and pacing, and usually this is the only time i cry. the rest of the time i am stoic but i feel very dull.

i am still in touch with a good friend of mine from middle school who has mysteriously gotten very close with this girl all of a sudden. she says she's sweet, and that she didn't want her to tell me, but i should not try to reconnect or make amends because she ""never ever wants to see me again, and that's the brutal truth.""

i don't know how to go on like this when some of the people i enjoy most treat me like i am a monster. i cannot see myself any other way. there is not enough money to move, or travel, and word has spread about my episode. i have a reputation, and everyone i could possibly be friends with already knows this about me. in school i feel people avoid me like the plague.

how the fuck do i fix it?"
1560,Has anyone ever experienced abilyfy after the libido disappeared completely but returned after the end of the period? So that with abilyfyn had sexual abilities?
1561,"Suddenly a sense of deceleration.. And I'm thrown forward.. And I can actually feel the straps catch me as they dig into my chest.


So this is reality ? it feels cold... Time to put some clothes on... Well I suppose its only 1am.. The 'good' news is I've just had a Pot Noodle.. The Bad news is I'm almost outta meds... I haven't got enough to get me through to the next resupply ... Which means I'm going to have to go a couple of days unmedicated.. ouch :panic:

Good job i've got nothing on this week... 

aww.............fuck"
1562,"I don't know what to do. I'm on Lamictal and I started Geodon a few months ago, and was just now prescribed Topamax. 

The Topamax is because I've been really anxious lately, but anxiety is a symptom of Geodon.

And I can't tell if it's anxiety or some heart problem that ALSO could be caused by Geodon. And the Geodon was to help me get out of a really bad place mentally but that could also have been because of withdrawals from coming off Lexapro. 

I almost want to go off everything but I could get really bad again and there would be withdrawals and how can I tell withdrawals from the way I am without medication?? 

I can't afford to put my life on hold for this and I'm scared and confused and sick of relying on medication that may or may not work and may or may not hurt me.

I don't know who to trust but I can't make these decisions on my own and I'm so so so scared that this is my life and I could be ruining everything with whichever decision I make I can't stand feeling like this

Edit: I don't know if I should've used the red exclamation point marker. Sorry if that's not appropriate for this post"
1563,"Today I met the nurse practitioner who has been assigned to take over from my psychiatrist, whom I did NOT wish to leave but the clinic has given him other work. 

So I have to listen to stupid questions like do you hear things, do you see things, do you sleep, do you eat. And stupid advice like the buspar is good for your anxiety (the psychiatrist and I were about to delete the buspar very gradually). 

So this nurse then says we can cut to 15mg from the 20 and I have to explain to him that is NOT gradual enough. 

And then he tells me I should see somebody about my sciatica. I've seen DOZENS of specialists in 15 years and this nurse is telling me to see somebody because I can't sit in his office. 

It's so stupid that this person is now in charge of my medications. He doesn't know me and he isn't going to know me and he has such a strong Spanish accent I can't even converse with him. I have no idea what he is saying half the time. 

This is not acceptable but I am forced to accept it.

I am angry that I cannot continue seeing the only psychiatrist I've ever liked in thirty years. And now I have to change that into compassion for the poor nurse who has been saddled with me."
1564,"I have bipolar disorder and suffer from PTSD. Which isn't exactly a delightful cocktail. I was diagnosed 2 years ago and it gradually worsens (father had same condition, doc says it is genetic) It started out as a simple anxiety diagnosis and has manifested into what it is now. Now I have full
Blown scene hallucinations and it's hard to tell the difference between my hallucinations and reality. 
      I always see ""shadow things"" in the corner of my eye. At night, dark shadowy figures. I try to tell myself it's a hallucination but my mind remains terrified that I'll be touched or poked. I'm afraid to be alone really anywhere because I always have the sense there is someone there. The worst place is at home. I'm terrified to be home alone. Nothing seems to ease that feeling of uneasiness. But it gets worse. Now I actually have scene hallucinations. All of them are persecutory in nature. It's pretty bad when it happens. It happens in a normal setting. The first time, I was in a garage with my boyfriends father working on hard wood flooring:
        His father looked at me and began questioning me and making statements. This went on for what seemed like 5 minutes. I was extremely uncomfortable due to the nature of the conversation, as it was persecutory. The next thing I knew, I saw his father stop talking and wave his hand across my face. He claimed I had ""spaced out"" and asked if I was ok. I told him I didn't space out that I had just been standing there listening to him talk. He claimed to have not said anything since we came back into the garage. When I told my bf about the conversation, he confronted his father who claimed that never happened. Up until a few days ago I believed the conversation really happened and thought the father was lying. 
       I was at work the other day, new job, and I could hear the doctors I work for talking to each other. They were saying negative things about me. That they knew I had PTSD and was probably bipolar. Etc.... Then one of them walked out of their office looked at me and apologized for what was said.....as they knew I was within an ear shot of the conversation. I thought it really happened until my coworker waved her hand across my face, said I spaced out, and asked if I was ok. So I immediately knew I had a full blown scene hallucination.....like in the garage. 
      It's scary because these things give no warning when they happen. How am I supposed to know what's real and what's not? Apparently I black out in reality.... And my world changes. I hallucinate the actual people around me that do exist, just in altered behaviors. I am terrified of this condition. My mind takes real people and real scenes and distorts them. I don't know what's real and what's not. Does anyone else have persecutory hallucinations?"
1565,"I'm considering lithium as a treatment option for the first time. One of the things making me doubt that it's the right medication for me is that I've never had a severe manic episode, only hypomania. And lithium is primarily effective for mania, right? I'm trying to decide whether my symptoms are serious enough for this medication. On the other hand, I'm on an atypical antipsychotic right now which is also pretty serious so who knows?? Any insight on experience with lithium would be appreciated <3"
1566,"I don’t know what to do. I’m super paranoid all the time, including tonight amongst friends, I just shut down and struggle with words. I don’t want to self obsess any more. I seriously thinking of taking myself off to the local suicide spot. I’m not right and haven’t been for years. People hate me at work. I have so many problems that I can’t resolve, I’m not going to bore you with the details, but I seriously think I’m the most fucked up person out there."
1567,"can't ask my family as they don't know how bad it is...

I need help with my monies.  I'm trying to work how and what to pay off.....  

I can't even count up my debts right now as I'm too scared to log into my bank..  

I think I am OK this week, and my rent got paid today.

Sorry I've been keeping you all hangin'... I've been a busy fool..That is busy doing nothing.. The last few days are all a dizzy blur... I haven't been eating.. So there has been no reason to go shopping.. So there has been no reason to get up in the morning.. I've been all over the place really... I haven't been shaving either.. So I got up this morning to several days of beard growth.. Which has always been a pet peeve of mine.. I say woke up.. it was more a case of coming down.. The last few days have been a blur... But what a rush !.. I've spent the last two..Three.. However many days its been... Just sitting here in my underwear burning up... The speed of my thoughts has been off scale high.. And I have just been tripping out...

Now the hard part.. gotta force feed myself and clean myself up.. Already had a shave.. I'm exhausted and my calves have seized up.. They're as hard as rocks.. Which is making walking painful.. Everything hurts.............................

Sorry guys... gotta close this one up there... I promised myself I'd be in bed by eight... gotta go to the bank tomorrow.. gotta normalize myself for that five minute performance

1570,I'm manic and I really need to go to bed.. Got to be up early in the morning.. And I just spent the last hour having imaginary conversations with people in my head... :prop:
1571,"Hello
I met my ex. gf in my birthday 2 yrs ago.
It was love at first sight. Everything was heaven. She broke up with me almost two yrs later (10 days before my birthday).
It’s been 3 months now, and I was destroyed.
It started after 3 month when she told me that she still loved the guy she couldn’t have before me. I went home and after a few days she said that she is sure that she loves me. Everything was heaven again.
She loved my two kids and my kids loved her. My ex. wife (my good friend now) also liked her and vice versa.
I lost my job... at that time and everything went south. She started acting like mother Theresa and wanted to save me. I said thanks but I need a girlfriend not a mother. She got upset.
Then suddenly she got all jealous and accusing me having other women. She wanted to check my phone which I agreed, but I said that she isn’t going to find anything on it... and that I don’t like to have a girlfriend who is behaving like this and that mistrusted me.
Her phone on the other hand always pointed down so I couldn’t see who was texting.
I trusted her 100%. I loved her 100%.
over the almost two years... she was suggesting me to rather find another woman... even random girls on the street, or friends or wven her sister whom I talked to once and had a good talk.
She could get really angry when I said somethin “wrong”... or even when I said that I can’t go by her place because I was dead tired.
“You never sacrifice yourself” she always said.
Anyways... she broke up with me 5 times.
I was never good enough. She said that I loved her more than she loved me... and always asked whay I loved her. I replied... it’s magic baby... you are my life... my love... my woman.
NOT GOOD ENOUGH.
The last night we were together, after making love I told her I needed two days to think about us... and how we can continue. She flipped out... gave me the finger and went out the door.
She came back after 10 min. and then I was all dead inside. I couldn’t handle her mistrust.
I was never good enough.
After two weeks of silent treat I contacted her. She said she was stressed... and I wanted to help.
I said... no sex or kissing (not to stress her)... just me helping her until she was ready again.
I helped to clean her house while she wasn’t home, filled her kitchen with stuff... talked a lot to her in a good way... I even started training (even though I am fit). She was blaming me for her putting a few kg.
Soooo.... three moths of this helping went on.
Then she traveled to Iceland.... “work” she said. While she was there... she wrote me how much she missed me and that she really loved me.
She came back... wanted some money... that I gave her. After a few days... radio silent for a week.
I contacted her... she only texted... I love another man now. She didn’t pick up the phone... only sms. wow! 
............
Later I found out that she had been seeing this new guy a week after she gave me the finger and went out of the door. She kept me going on a leash for three month... aaaand that she was on Iceland with the “new” guy.
Of course... on Instagram there were her hashtags like: a new me.... a new era.... him now ❤️, our first trip and so on.
....
For a looooooong time I thought that I was a bad man... that I was not doing enough... she almost destroyed my mind... until I recently read about bipolar type 2 here.
I’m 99% sure that she is bipolar now... and she doesn’t even know it.
She has known him for 4 month and wants to move in with him... and she has economic problems, and the new guy xan provide “stability” as she told me.
And A year ago I got clamydia... and I was always faithful. She never admitted it... and threw it back at my face.
She had a rough childhood and her mother is diagnosed with bipolar.
My ex. gf. also has two children with two different men. She left the kids when they were small and doesn’t have the best relationship with them.
...
There is a loooot more... but you get the picture.
Unfortunately I still love her... and miss her... but I said to her never to contact me ever again.
I had enough of her lies, mistrust, panic attacks, paranoia and pointing fingers at me for her missery.
I’m recovering and working on my self esteem.
....
So.... does she sound like a bipolar type 2.... or is she just a self centric asshole.
Or was she just ashamed of me that I ain’t rich or something. The new guy has a job, car and a house."
1572,"Next semester I'm planning on writing a research paper, and I'm gonna spitball a few ideas here to help my thought process. 

I feel an obligation to do something good with my life. I want my experience and ideas to make a positive impact on the world and I'm far away from reaching that goal, but I'm sure as heck going to try. 

I should preface that it isn't my intention to compare the severity of any mental illnesses. Each illness has its own difficulties and related stigma, and they all need to be more understood and accepted in the public eye. 

From my experience, I believe that anxiety and depression have seen the most positive change in terms of public acceptance. There's a long way to go, but we've made progress. I think that part of this progress is due to the fact that these disorders are the most ""relatable"" from a neurotypical standpoint. Non-clinical anxiety and depression are experienced by most people, albeit not nearly to the severity of those with the actual illness. This allows a person to more easily sympathize with anxiety and depression than with other mental illnesses. 

It's a different story, however, with the ""scary"" mental illnesses. Bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and others deserve understanding as well. I have witnessed a severe lack of empathy towards these illnesses compared to anxiety and depression. The current public view of these mental illnesses is so, so damaging to those who suffer from them. 

I don't have the energy to really make my point right now. Basically, I believe that the way mental illness is portrayed in society is internalized and causes turmoil within the mentally ill. We are not bad people. We are sick and we need treatment. We do NOT need to be told that we are crazy, evil, or something to laugh at. 

If you agree, disagree, or have something else to say, I would love to hear from you! Ideas and opinions are never set in stone and I realize that I still have a lot to learn. If you read this far, thanks for listening <3"
1573,I was diagnosed with Bipolar 2 earlier this year and was put on Quetiapine. Although I liked how it made me better I had to come off it because the ECG came back abnormal. A month or so later I was put on Olanzipine but again after just two weeks the ECG came back abnormal and I have to stop taking them. I know from last time that it'll take a month or so for it to get right enough to try something else. Is this a common story? I am very frustrated with it because I thought everything was going well for once.
1574,"This is something I think about when my brain is telling me that I'm a bad person to be around. Sometimes it helps.

Last school year was a rollercoaster of mood swings, most of them depressive. At one point, I felt guilty every time I went to see friends because I was convinced that my depression would infect others. One night, without me bringing it up, a room full of my friends agreed that I light up a room. I was so, so amazed that they thought I was a positive addition to their lives.

This is a reminder that being bipolar doesn't stop you from being able to bring good into the world."
1575,"Hi everyone, 

I want to share my story with you. And I would really appreciate your comments, tips or guidance.

I moved to Germany together with my husband 4,5 years ago. 4 years ago we had our little miracle come into this world, our daughter. It was the best thing that had ever happened to us, after all we've been through in our lives...it was a very long awaited child, a true gift. Everything finally started making sense, all the tough times seemed to be behind, and we were so happy despite being sleepless  And here it started. 

Bit by bit I was “drowning"". Postpartum depression they told me. I was so demotivated, so disconnected from this world, from my family. I felt ashamed for not being able to do simple things like calling a doctor’s office, taking care of the bills and so on. I felt worthless. I felt ashamed for not feeling happy, for not wanting my husband, for not enjoying life despite all the things happening around me. I was getting deeper and deeper under my shell. The world was blurry and at some point things started feeling unreal. 

We were sleepless for 1,5 years in a row. My husband said that it couldn’t go on like that anymore, and began to rescue me and us from the zombie land. I stopped breastfeeding, he took care of the daughter’s night sleep. Bit by bit, it took us about 6 months to recover more or less, but depression was still there. With a great push and help of my family I started working again, they feared that otherwise things would’ve got critical for my mental health. I started a completely new role - from previously customer supporting role to the proactive one, working in sales. Things felt quite stressful and new. A few months after the job's start, I began to feel changes within me. I felt kind of superior to other people, super self assure, my self esteem and belief in myself were as high as never before. I had lots of energy like never before. I started sleeping less (could be 4 hours vs “a post must have 8-9, and no issues)"", dressing more sexy, began to attract attention from people, and enjoyed this state quite a lot. Life seemed to be blossoming. All of a sudden I learned how to laugh - I never really laughed in my life, just smiled, as if I wasn’t physically able to. All of a sudden there I was laughing. I didn’t find it strange, I found it awesome. Then I met someone. It was a formal meeting in the first place (we’re in the same industry). Then he started telling me about polygamy and other bullsh…For some reason my brain accepted this information. It felt like I was on a constant high, not criticising things, taking everything easy, not taking into consideration serious and important things that we were discussing with my husband at that time. All in all it felt as if I was 15 or so. Then we started chatting. The world of polygamy, sex chats, cheating, porn, phantasies, ideas etc. - felt as if there was a second me that was living in that world. 

Before I was the kind of person who preferred not to lie, it was simply too stressful and felt so wrong, that I would worry about a little lie like crazy. However this time it was different. I lied like a professional poker player. I was lying to my family's face all the time. Making things up so fast and naturally. The complexity of my lies was pretty high. During 1 year after I met this person I did terrible things… Lying, cheating, self admiration, photos&videos of myself, masturbation in different places, living in a phantasy world, not paying attention to my family, again lies lies lies…and oh cheating with more than just that guy. It felt as if there was a hungry beast was sitting inside of me. I was remorseless, cold, hunting, playing…All in all during the past year I had 5 men, 3 of which I slept with (2 times unprotected!), 2 kissed. The beast was unstoppable and was growing and getting more and more hungry. I was scared to death and excited at the same time. I told myself more and more often that I have to stop all this, but I couldn’t. The more I told myself that I have to stop, the worse it got.. to the point of being unbearable - all my mind would get filled 100% with the idea of chats, phantasies etc.

Then my husband found out. I felt pretty crazy - it was a conference in our home town, and lasted 2 days. Day1 I slept with one guy, day 2 with another guy and in the evening flirting with the third one. In the meantime our daughter was sick. I didn’t think about anyone, didn’t think about any risks, just some crazy ideas of having sex with these people swirling in my head. He was devastated. We spoke several days non stop. He was trying to find out the truth, and I just wouldn’t let it all out. It was about 20 stories in total that I told him, releasing more important details as I went. I still felt hyper sexual at that point in time, still checking out men on the streets, still feeling like texting that guy. It took my husband some time to get me out of there. It was him to suspect me being ill. After going to a psychiatrist I was diagnosed with Bipolar II and started taking meds. After a few weeks on medication I started feeling a bit better, closer to normal. 

We’ve been together with my husband for 18 years, and we’re the only family we’ve got (no relatives, no real friends). I broke his heart and betrayed my family... Now we’re divorcing and I question myself all the time - Why did I do it all? Why didn’t I stop/confess? Now I’m in the phase where I’m so deep under water, that I can’t see any bits of light. Sometimes, once every two weeks or so, I get out of there, it feels like jumping out of the water: again having lots of energy, loads of optimism and great mood all of a sudden, start believing in myself, have an increased productivity at work, increased libido and desire to dress up etc. It usually lasts 1-2 days, and then I drown again quite suddenly and rapidly. Apart from that I also have a strange paranoia that all men out there want to either sleep with me or have no good intentions. I get very overwhelmed by sounds and people very fast, communication is difficult. I’m also like a walking juke box, the loads of tracks playing and rotating in my head are wearing me off. It started a year ago and it just got much worse. And oh, I feel as if I have no personality, that I’m a walking blank disc. Most of the days I feel completely disconnected from the world, and feel no emotions at all. I’m sure this all isn’t normal, but have no clue what exactly is the reason. What scares me is that this strange condition is getting worse, and I have no answers so far...  

I know I’ve said a lot. Sorry there’s been so much on my mind. I desperately need to understand: 

1) if it was just hypomania, why didn’t I stop? ( I had no hallucinations or super rapid speech, they think it’s bipolar II)
2) how come my family didn’t notice any weird behaviour at home, I was a “perfect” liar
3) how could my husband stop mania just with conversations (it was very tough but still, I thought that normally one in mania doesn’t stop without meds, and goes all the way to the abyss until he ends up in a hospital)
4) why in the world didn’t I direct my hyper sexuality onto my husband, why did I need to cheat?
5)what can be happening with me apart from bipolar if bipolar at all? 

Really appreciate your comments."
1576,"been a struggle again this week, plus i'm in pain and can't settle :(

so how you doing?"
1577,How do I find quality of life amidst a life that’s continually ravaged by treatment-resistant bipolar disorder?
1578,"I woke up this morning about 6am to an extreme attack of anxiety... I was freaking out so bad I was seriously considering going to see my Gp... But when 8 o'clock came I decided to go to the shop first... All I got was four bottles of Coke.. I didn't need to buy anything else, the freezer still full.. I haven't been eating.. But when I got back I felt extremely fatigued.. I could hardly keep my eyes open.. But this time I decided to give in to it.. So I turned everything off and went back to bed.. 
I woke up at about 2:30pm and the anxiety was gone.. Plus I'd eaten the last of the teacakes and have no memory of doing so.. The washing up fairy had been and I don't remember that either.. But the one that made me laugh out loud was my top browser bookmark was to a page about memory loss... Apparently I've been googling memory loss but I can't remember doing it ! :p"
1579,"I came to at about 11:30pm.. I was lying on top of the bed with my legs hanging' over the end.. Couldn't tell ya how long I'd been there.. I just don't remember.. And I was stiff all over.. Like everything had seized while I'd been asleep... it took ten minutes of rolling around in agony before I made it to my feet... In the living room everything was left on again.. Never mind burning out the Tv.. I'm starting to worry about my eletric bill...

I don't know what i'm going to do"
1580,"hi im new here , im suffering with bad memory loss which now is affecting my wife and i think shes using the fact . i dont get much support from any mental health teams for my bipolar ."
1581,"been a rough couple of days.

I can't cope with whats going on, I'm expected to do more and I can't do it.


not sure which way to turn.

can't switch my head off..........

dark thoughts , not stupid enough to act on them just don't enjoy my own head.:scratch:"
1582,"I met this girl at a summer job last year and we clicked. We started going out with mutual friends and got close.One day she told me ""I think I've a crush on you. Is it weird?"" She had a boyfriend at the time (we're both girls) so I laughed it off. Another time she said ""I'm falling for you.""She used to invite me over to her house while her parents slept. We would smoke and cuddle in her bed, then she'd sneak me out by morning. One day before I was about to leave, she kissed my forehead and said she loves me. Then she leaned in and kissed the tip of my nose and giggled. I found it a bit off because we usually have intense eye contact and I've caught her several times staring at my lips. 
Then one day her mom walked in on her leaning on me on her bed. Her mother called her disgusting and slapped her infront of me. (No not exaggerating)

She travelled back for college and would call me everyday and we speak for hours at night. She always tells me she misses me and my cuddles, and how much she adores and loves me. Sometimes she sends me ""sexy"" photos/videos revealing her body. And once when we video called she was only wearing a bra and sweats. 
Then we argued because her boyfriend (who she has a rocky relationship with) thinks I'm a bad influence on her, to which I said that I'll be away from her. She kept calling and left me a message* ""If you leave me my life will be screwed up. You're so special to me, you're my entire world. We cannot be apart I can't live without you""

She told me she feels her bf is cheating on her and she doesn't feel the same way she used to. And then she broke up with him. 
A few days later she told me she had a dream where we were fighting and then I kissed her lips. She said it felt good. I avoided that subject but she brings it up sometimes to joke about it. 
She said she wants to travel with me abroad to a new college and move in together. And so we did. 
Initially I supported her financially (her ticket, our dorm, pocket money)because her parents weren't helping and I shared mostly everything with her. 

We would fight from the beginning. I had an alcohol addiction, and I was recovering from some childhood  trauma. Sometimes she’d slap me or bite me really hard which drew flashbacks on me. She would claim that I tried to kiss her when I was drunk (though I didn't remember) and asked me if I had feelings for her to which I replied No. So we decided she should move out. Anyway it got worse. She had told to kill my self  (knowing I was suicidal), I grabbed her by the neck and we fought physically and cops got involved. 

We sat down to speak once after the police incident. She said ""we tried and it won't work out. I don't want you. I feel nothing for you anymore."" When I asked her what I've done to deserve this, she replied ""I cared about you. And I was in love with you"" after a pause she continued fast ""as a friend."" 

For the next 2 months it was a push and pull game. I'd chase her and try to fix it, she'd push me away and say she needs space if we were to fix it. But as soon as she sees me moving on, she stops me. For example; when I accepted it was over I gave her a teddy to say goodbye. She ended up going out with me and another friend that night. She got sick at the end, and i ended up cuddling her and sleeping next to her in her new room. We had another major fight after that and I found out that She's also been going around and talking badly behind my back to boys especially, saying I was gay or obsessed with her, and also spilling my secrets. I also found out that before she got close to me, she went and told people that I liked her. 
After all the problems she caused me, I left uni for the semester. She told me she was going back to her ex to get engaged but again I found out that was a lie, and she's desperate to have him back so he ""could take her out""

From my side I did love her and care for her as a friend and I miss how close we used to be. We knew everything about each other and I kept her secrets and just wanted to help her. No bad intentions. 

I want to move on and I'd like to get some clarity from her POV. 
Was she using me? Was she afraid that I liked her romantically? Is she mentally ill? What could be the possible reason"
1583,I have used Olanzapine and Risperidone for 7 years and currently none of them is able to put me to sleep. I'm loosing my mind due to lack of sleep. Any one has experienced this please advice.
1584,"I have sciatica or piriformis syndrome, not sure which or both. And I get very depressed about it hurting. And I'm afraid to go places where I have to sit and stand. And it isn't bipolar to feel sick and tired of dealing with this for over 15 years. I cannot emotionally handle the pain anymore because I had prozac induced lupus years ago. After that I had fibromyalgia from depakote. And now THIS because of the sedentary lifestyle the drugs induced. And I get brave every so often and go out and try to do normal things but I get hurt. How stupid is it to call my efforts and reactions bipolar ??

And how stupid is it to call my insomnia, induced by drug dependency, manic ?? The doctor actually believes it's the bipolar. There's no way to change his point of view. He believes the bipolar is coming back when it is the changes to the drugs that create this effect.

So now everything I do is seen through this filter called bipolar. If I am assertive with people who operate out of Critical Parental patterns, I am accused of being manic. 

And I think going into hiding mode isn't depression at all for me. I'm like a wounded animal hiding in it's cave, waiting to heal it's wounds. And everyone wants me to exercise and fix myself when every fiber in my being wants to stay home and heal.

Furthermore, and in conclusion, I am fine in my limited world until I have to go to some medical appointment like a mammogram. And then I get hurt terribly. It is so ironic that for medical tests I have to get hurt. I went to a clinic on Monday to arrange for more mammograms, ultra sound, 3D picture and a bone density. They are helping me to death."
1585,"I've been eating allot of teacakes... Seems a waste to just leave them go stale or to bin them.. Can't be bothered toasting them.. Just eating them raw ?..

1586,"The bums drop dead and the dogs go mad
In packs on the West Side

For the last couple of weeks I've been trying and failing to get my sleep patterns under control... I've been trying to get to bed early so that I can get up early so I can do my shopping when theres no one around.. But instead of going to bed earlier I've been staying up later and later.. To the point where I've been staying up all night and doing my shopping at 8am and then going to sleep when I get back and so end up sleeping in the day time.

I haven't been making it to bed... And my bedroom is next to the livingroom.. I've been sleeping on the couch and even been falling asleep sitting up in this chair (which amazes me) and my memory of all this has been getting less and less to the point I'm now having blackouts !

Take last night/this morning for example... I have no idea what time I went to sleep.. What time I woke up.. Even if I went to sleep at all... Its all just a black hole... I remember it being late last night.. Very late.. The wee small hours... And then it was this morning about 11 o'clock and I was sat here in front of this infernal machine... 
So no biggy right ?.. I've slept sitting up in this chair again (still amazed).. So no real harm done.. I just started my day as normal... The Tv had timed out.. (but it does that in the day to.. Its set for three hours of no activity, and I don't know how to change it) 
So I goes to make a cup of tea.. And when I opened the cupboard.. To my surprise I saw four packets of tea cakes which I have no memory of buying... I must of brought them this morning.. But I have no memory of this... Or of going out side for that matter... And that scared the shit out of me... If it wasn't me... Then who was driving the bus ?
This is one of the major reasons I don't drink anymore... When I get drunk I have a tendency to 'wonder' and end up getting arrested... Its funny enough when I'm bouceing around the flat making a mess... Or tidying up for that matter (yesterday I did the washing up and have no memory of it) But me going out.. er...er... 'unrestrained' ??? Thats a whole different matter.. I could of done anything and not known.. I could wake up with a dead whore on my livingroom floor and not remember... 
What can I do ? How do I defend against this ? I think its the lack of meds (run out (taken them all)) and being sleep deprived that's coursing the blackouts.. And that's allowing my alter ego to leak out... I'm not sure who he is.... But I do know one thing.. He's partial to tea cakes !!!

1587,"I really want to talk to my mom about these things but she's tired and stressed out and has to deal with the kids all day and she doesn't need this. I keep seeing everywhere, and someone told me directly today, that bipolar=insane, and it scares me so much. I don't want to be crazy and I don't want to hurt people but I feel like it's something I can't avoid. It's hard enough coming to terms with my illness without other people repeating what's already going on in my head. Every time I hear about a bipolar person it's in the context of them being abusive or crazy or unstable. 

I feel like I need to die again even though my medication is supposed to be working against that.

Does anybody else internalize the stigma of bipolar disorder like this? Or have any advice to lessen these thoughts?"

1589,Hi my name is Kayla and I have been affected by someone with Bipolar Disorder because my mom has suffered with Bipolar Disorder. Because of this mental illness I grew without a mom for much of my life and I didn't really like it. Until very recently I didn't know what Bipolar Disorder was and I didn't know there were different types of Bipolar Disorder; knowing this helped me understand what my mom was going through all those times she disappeared on us.

1594,"Hi,

I’m new to the forum.

I was wondering what people’s experiences where with claiming PIP for BPD Type 2 whilst working?

I work as a professional carer and am able to look after other people as well as my 4 children but on regularly need prompting to take care of my own needs such as eating, washing, taking m meds and I’m no good at budgeting decisions. I know this sounds ridiculous that I’m able to look after others but not myself, I wish I could make sense of it 😔"
1595,"Hi everyone, 
I’ve been doing some research recently into some of the symptoms I’ve been experiencing over the last year, and everything points to Bipolar II. I often go through bouts of deep depression for anywhere from a week to a couple months, and I also experience what I would call (from looking at the symptoms) hypo-mania for around a week/ two weeks, when I’m like that I get huge rushes of energy as soon as I wake up until I go to sleep, I become more confident but more irritable at the same time and I can never seem to want to stop moving or talking in any way. I’m currently going through some sort of ‘up’ state and I’m having to type most of this with voice inputs because I’m just too shaky with energy to type. Should I see someone about this? If so what do I say? Anything is appreciated"
1596,"I feel disconnected and different from people and like I don't fit in with anyone most of the time. I feel an empty feeling that's very hard to explain. I feel strange and different from everyone, like I’ve been born into the wrong time. I struggle to socialise with people and make friends with people, especially new people. I feel like I can’t maintain a friendship because sometimes I can socialise well and other times i can’t socialise at all. Socialising with people usually scares me, I feel like most of the time it’s forced and doesn’t come naturally. I often hide away from people or avoid any contact with people. I get so anxious about having conversations sometimes that I feel like I can't breath and end up with pins and needles and heart racing. I end up talking too fast and make myself look and feel stupid because I feel like I’m panicking to make conversation and don’t make sense. I feel intimidated and inferior to people who are intelligent, pretty or have big personalities. I feel like im being judged by everyone, even my own family. 

My whole life is controlled by what other people think of me. I hate the thought of being disliked by anyone. When I get new friends in my life I’m worried that I will do something to ruin it and lose them. I end up pushing them away. I lack a sense of self and feel I live a vicarious life. I usually live through other people and take on their interests and likes as mine so my style, likes and dislikes etc change a lot. I can not build my own sense of meaning. My sense of reality and who I am as a person is fragile and easily broken. I shift from one mindset to another and find it hard to make decisions. I can become quite obsessive over things and anything I start is a novelty then I begin to lose interest and move on to something different. It’s like I can never be satisfied for long. I need constant reassurance that people like me. I need constant approval from other people. If I don’t get this I hate myself. Any choices or decisions I make in life are usually influenced by what others will think of me or for approval from other people. I usually do and say things to fit in. I feel like I don’t know who the real me is because my personality will change depending on who I’m with or trying to fit in with. I feel like my whole life has been led by trying to fit in with other people and trying to feel accepted by people. I’m afraid of rejection. My mood is seriously affected by other people’s. If I’m in a good mood and people are in a bad mood they make me very irritable and fustrated. When people are hurt or I feel sorry for them I’m deeply affected by it. Seeing people who are homeless or people who are in need affects me. Sometimes I feel like I have too much emotion and other times I feel like I don’t have as much compassion and everyone annoys me. I don’t know anything about myself. I feel like I'm not good enough and like I'm never going to get anywhere in life. I feel like I will never be happy. If I make a mistake or say something stupid I get angry at myself and want to hurt myself. I dwell and obsess on things for ages. I get very intense thoughts about hurting myself when I make mistakes or do things wrong it makes me feel worthless. I feel lost. I don’t know who I am as a person. I hate myself. I don’t understand why I think the way I do and I don’t understand my thought process. 

Sometimes i have so many different thoughts I don’t know what thoughts are mine or real or what thought to react with. When I have days where my mind is racing I feel like I have all different conflicting thoughts and I struggle to work out what thought to listen to. Then I start to over analyse and overthink all the thoughts. I analyse situations from every possible angle then end up with too many thoughts and I don’t know what thought is correct. My mind ends up racing with millions of conflicting and contradicting thoughts and I feel like I’m going crazy. I don’t understand how my thoughts can change so quickly. I struggle to keep up with my thinking. When my thinking is like this I can't make decisions because my thoughts are too fast and complicated. They make me irritated and frustrated. I get very confused with my thoughts and overwhelmed. I get so stressed when my thinking is like this, that I feel like inside my body is shaking. Sometimes I feel like I’m going crazy which makes me feel worse and even more scared. When my thoughts are racing I struggle to think about general things or concentrate on things. I get restless and agitated and frustrated. Sometimes my mind feels so crazy and racing with thoughts that I can't concentrate then feel very frustrated. I usually internalise my anger then I want to hurt myself or drink til I’m paralytic. I want to punish myself because I’m so fustrated and overwhelmed. The more I try and work out my racing thoughts the more angry and frustrated I get. When I try to work out why I'm so angry, the more frustrated I feel then I get thoughts of hurting or killing myself, which are very vivid. Then I start to battle with the idea of doing it or not. Sometimes I know I’m not brave enough to do it which makes me even worse. Everything in my life is ok I have everything I need, so there’s no reason to make me feel like this which makes me want to hurt myself even more for feeling like this. I end up feeling so much internal anger and frustration that I feel like I’m going insane and feel like I need to punish myself. 

When I’m like this I get no pleasure out of life, nothing interests me. I feel empty, disconnected and numb to life. I feel like I have no emotions sometimes except fear, anger and self hatred. I find it hard to feel compassion for people when I’m like this and I get annoyed and irritated with everyone. My own family irritate and annoy me even though they’re doing nothing wrong. I over react to them and become irritable and frustrated in their company sometimes and everything they do annoys me. I feel like I don’t love them the way I should love them sometimes. When I feel like this I end up feeling guilty and wishing they would give up on me. I feel like I don’t deserve their love sometimes. I want to hide away from people when I’m like this and be alone. I spend most of my time worrying about things. I feel like I'm always trying to prove my worth to people so that people will like me. I can’t keep up with my thoughts and how much they change all the time from wanting to do well in life to not caring about anything or anyone. I can’t keep up with how quickly my mood changes sometimes. It's very unpredictable. I'm terrified of what the future holds for me. I feel trapped. My mind feels like it's going to explode and it makes me want to kill myself because I don't want to keep feeling like this. I don’t have much motivation and feels like life is just passing me by.

 It’s a Very hard feeling to explain but I feel like I don't belong here sometimes and that I have nothing to offer to anyone. I feel like I am just an existence at times. A lot of the time nothing interests me I get nothing out of life. I get no pleasure or satisfaction out of life and never really feel real happiness. I feel like I need something to make me feel something. Like drink and drugs. When I drink I feel complete. I feel at ease like the way I think I should feel when I’m sober. It makes me feel complete and fills the empty feeling I feel when I’m sober. It makes me feel relaxed, confident and careless and eases the racing thoughts. I struggle a lot to express my feelings to anyone. Im scared to tell anyone about the feelings and thoughts I have. I can sometimes do things to get people’s attention so that someone will notice that I’m struggling which makes me hate myself even more. Everything feels overwhelming and scarey when I’m like this. I Feel like I'm not whole as a person if I'm not drinking. I feel sober and uncomfortable. I feel scared and like something is missing. I have no sense of my own self or what I want from life. The only time I can feel totally myself and feel relieved is when I'm drinking. Sometimes I feel normal, happy and connected to life. When I feel like this, I want to sort my life out and other times I just want to give up and not give a fuck and drink myself to death. Sometimes I feel like I'd have a happier life drinking for the rest of it than these crazy thoughts and feelings when Im sober. I despise myself and I don’t want to feel like this anymore. I want to be a good person. I feel good about myself if I’m helping people. I hate the person I’ve become and I don’t understand why I do the things I do. I want to feel normal and happy but I feel very confused, hopeless and lost a lot of the time. I want to be able to like myself and not have to seek the constant approval of other people. I feel terrified of the future. I’m scared that I’ll feel like this for the rest of my life. I’m so confused and feel like I’ve lost control of my life and my thinking. 

I feel so frustrated trying to work out and understand who I am and why I do the things I do. I feel like I’m going insane. I do sometimes have periods where everything feels good and I feel connected. I can socialise with people and feel like people like and care about me. I even like myself and I have lots to talk about and feel like a real normal person. I am more positive about my future and worry much less. I want to be around friends and arrange to do things with them. I feel very light and like my worries have left me and I can’t understand why I felt so bad when I did. I start to believe that I’ll Feel this happy for the rest of my life. I start to think I don’t need any help from anyone and that my life has been fixed. I’ll feel like my body is lighter and that I can move about quicker and easier. It feels like the weight of the world has been lifted from shoulders and I have a feeling of anticipation and excitement and joy like something good is going to happen. I can sometimes feel my mood getting gradually better as the days go on. I have a peak day or 2 where everything feels amazing and I feel excited and have felt so buzzing that I don’t want to go to sleep. Overall my good mood It never usually lasts long only about a week or 2 at the most. I can also feel my mood getting gradually worse. I wake up in the morning feeling different. I feel heavier and like everything is different. I feel dread and lots of self loathing and irritation. Most of the time nothing has made me feel that way, sometimes my mood will change lots within the day depending on my circumstances. Sometimes I feel like my racing thoughts are working on me through the night and I’ll wake up through the night feeling terrified and a feeling of dread and doom. Sometimes my mood is erratic throughout the day and all over the place I struggle to keep up with my emotions. Sometimes I get this overwhelming feeling that makes me feel like I’m going to burst out crying. But it’s not a feeling of sadness it’s like overwhelming frustration and irritation. I find it very very hard to concentrate on things even watching TV. I’m very agitated and restless and can’t sit at peace to do things a lot of the time. I struggle to listen to people without my mind wandering and I come accross as rude. I forget things all the time and lose things and feel like I’m always doing things too fast and without any thought.

 I also have people based obsessions. I get fixated on certain people, usually women, I want to be like them, to emulate them, and I can't stop thinking about them. They are usually someone superior to me who show they care about me in any way or show me the slightest bit of attention. Often it would be people like police, teachers, workers usually females older than me. I crave their attention and want to be noticed by them.  I want to be able to get close to them like friendship wise and it’s usually someone who I’ll never see again or won’t see very often. I’ll try and find information about them and try and find out places they frequent so I can see them. I sometimes get so obsessed with particular people that I can't think about anything else. I identify as being gay most of the time. so thats probably why it’s women. I keep this obsession private because I am worried that it could be misinterpreted, but I don’t necessarily stalk anyone. I can control my behaviour to an extent. The obsessions are more mentally based, and I look at the person I’m obsessing about Facebook and fantasise about them."

1600,"My daughter 11 has been making up stories and lies since she was around 4/5 they’ve become more elaborate over the years but always dark and negative

I accidentally killed my other baby... (I don’t have another baby)
She’s convinced people that she runs a successful online business! Not true.
She’s told school that she wants to kill herself by overdose.
When asked “why do you want to overdose”
I thought she would say “because she’s sad and lonely” but her reply was “ because it seems easier than the other ways to do it!!! Almost like she’s researched it.

1601,"I recently switched over to Abilify when the Risperidone was causing drastic weight gain. Abilify causes my arms and legs to shake uncontrollably and I'm only on 5mg, taking Zopiclone to help with the severe insomnia side effect. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing or even worse? These drugs are incredibly powerful and are causing horrid side effects. It's even causing RLS (restless leg syndrome) where my legs start paining if I don't move them like a maniac, but the effect is less on 5mg rather than on 10mg. 

- any experiences with Abilify will be kindly appreciated

I have no idea how I'm going to fill the hours..

I just don't see how I made such a mistake... My skin is already beginning to crawl.. Its going to be a tough few days.

I'm either going to go up or down... I guess it'll be interesting to find out which one.. It'll all add to my knowledge base i guess :shrug:"
1606,"I had my wisdom teeth removed Friday the 7th.
I was told by my dr to start taking chantix that same day.
I currently take 200mg of lamictal daily.
I also quit smoking that same day.
So when I was irrationally sad, mad, and depressed for the first five days I brushed it off as quitting smoking.
It’s been eight days now, and I seem to be getting worse. I am bouncing at hyper speed through mania and depression and everywhere in between. I am overly pissed and upset by things and I start to yell and be a jerk, then I am extremely sensitive and cry for no reason, and at the same time I will be able to laugh and smile. Tonight, just now, I thought for the first time in over five months that I seriously want to *trigger* die *trigger*. No plan etc and I have two kids so it won’t be happening but I won’t lie and say I don’t feel the urge.
I really don’t know if it has to do with the chantix and lamictal drug interactions and my dr is closed until Monday, so I’m hoping to hear experiences from others or maybe just some support. My husband is very unsupportive at this point (through much fault of my own) and I just need some help"
1607,"Is Olanzapine(Zyprexa) prescribed only for Schizophrenia or Bipolar Disorder?

I am 22 and I was given Olanzapine 15mg. from my psychiatrist yesterday and i asked him do i have Bipolar and he said it sounds like it. So is that an official diagnosis then? Will i get a report telling me my diagnosis through the post or something? I live in Glasgow."
1608,"Hi guys, I made a post a few months back regarding my situation with my wife. Basically she was diagnosed late last year with cyclothymia (possibly bipolar 2) after pushing for answers for years. She had noticed herself that she was manic. After some digging I found out that she’s bought a horse, wasn’t paying the rent on our property or tax etc. She’d even considered admitting herself to the hospital, but everything that occurred was kept from me. 

She changed suddenly and decided she wanted to ‘do it on her own’ and I was basically shut off from her. She’d met a group of younger people around 17/18 year old and they became her new social group. We just turned 30. There’s one lad particularly she’s spent a lot of time with every single day and still does to this day. She even openly admits being with him at the moment but doesn’t express it to our children or others that I know of. We obviously live separately now and the last few months have been hell with a lot of back and forth between us. There’s even been confusion as to her feelings for me. We both brought up personality disorder in a conversation where she was approachable and she agreed that she fit the description but wasn’t interested in another diagnosis as it would just be another title. 

There’s a whole load more to the story of events but generally I am just eager to see if anyone has had similar experiences or knows of any ‘answers’ that would be useful. I’m the only one who’s foolish enough to engage in serious conversations about things with her and time to time it works but we’re still in the same scenario. I thought maybe hypersexuality was playing a part but she can recognise her symptoms? So BDP seemed a more likely avenue to pursue, however from what I’ve read about it, it doesn’t fare well for the likes of me who have spent my whole life with her and have such huge feelings for her only to be dropped in a flash. 

I look forward to any thoughts or opinions whatever they are....

Many thanks in advance"
1609,"I just saw this fragment of a bbc interview in which he talked about his addiction and his bipolar I diagnosis, very interesting."
1610,"My name is Brett. I've never done this before,  but I am constantly misguided by the advice of myself and my family. My father never dealt with mental illness and lost his marriage because he didn't understand it(Pray and tough it out.) My mother's depression seemingly subsided when she stopped drinking alcohol, but I've never done illegal drugs or had an alcohol addiction. They took me to a psychiatrist when I was 16 and I was diagnosed rapid cycling bipolar. I honestly don't even know if they got the diagnoses right.  All I know is that I've been unwell as long as I can remember. I gain pleasure from nothing except caffeine and video games.  I even gave both of them up for a few months to find that the pain only adds up when I don't actively escape it. 

For my Post's namesake, I have taken hundreds of supplements. I always read on their benefits or self diagnose a gene mutation or something crazy and supplement as if I had it.  Right now I'm taking a small box full of different supplements. Like amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins D, rhodalia, methylation supps, and so on. The reason I first turned to supplements is because I was put on a myriad of different medications between 16 and 18 years old and none of them helped. The one I remember most is seroquel which not only didn't work,  but all I did was sleep and when I was awake I developed severe postural hypertension which I still have to this day.  I have mini blackouts and shake aggressively for a few moments which has almost hurt me a bunch of times because I can't always catch myself.  After that one,  I never took medication again because I'm terrified of ruining what I have. 

On that note,  I'm legally blind.  I can't drive and people are unreliable. I feel trapped all the time and if I'm going to be trapped, I'd rather be trapped with current me than whatever version medication might create. 

On to religion. I have no quarrels with the religious and I'm not even sure I can talk about this but it's very important if I'm ever going to escape my head.  I grew up Christian and I really believed.  I prayed every day and I was happy,  as I grew into my teens, my symptoms developed and I prayed for strength to make it through.  I thought it was a trial, some test of my faith and also that it might just be puberty. It didn't get better after I became an adult and my faith diminished completely. I still believed in God, so I studied other religions and fell into spirituality. The damage that group and website did to me is so immense  that I won't describe it.  Not because its vulgar or violent, but because I don't want to expose anyone else to it.  I stopped following them,  but some things I read stuck with me and make me wish I could just end it all and forget. 

All anything seems to teach me is that if it's supposed to help,  it'll hurt me. 

I'm at the end of that road now,  I'm still carrying baggage from it,  but it lead me here, crying with a box of supplements. I have no clue what to do."
1611,"I had to come off Quetiapine because it was affecting my heart. Its taken 8 weeks to get back to as it should be.

1612,"A couple of months ago my nurse was trying to get me to go down to the clinic for my depot injection instead of them coming to see me.. My father was going to find out which bus I needed to catch and how much it would cost... The whole thing was in the advanced planning stage and then................. They just dropped it.. Without a word of explanation... Nobody has mentioned it... Not a word.. I know my father has my nurses phone number and they have been talking about me behind my back... But I can't understand why they have dropped the idea.. When they all were so enthusiastic about it... I hate the way they haven't said anything about it.. it creeps me out and makes me paranoid.. I would ask them... But I don't want things to change and I don't want to jinx it... This happens allot around me... People treat me like a child and make decisions that effect my life without consulting me... it makes more sense me going to see them.. So what was said for them to drop it.. I know they have redone my care plan.. I haven't seen it yet.. Still waiting on my copy... Maybe there's something in there... 
I hate being watched.. Talked about.. And having my world moved around me.. Without consulting me.. Even if it is to my advantage this time... Its not that they dropped it.. Its the conspiracy of silence around it. I should have been told something.

You think I should ask ?"

1614,"After probably ten years of doctors scratching their heads and misdiagnosis I finally had a definitive answer to what I am. Hey I'm bipolar and suffer from borderline disorder. It is great they have said words and that's my being, knowing is comforting. But I can't escape this void of confusion that my diagnosis created. All the research I've done all the work my doctors have put in so I can understand this, it just doesn't register. I signed up to this forum because even with all the knowledge I have about what I'm told I am, I can't understand it."
1615,"I feel as if theres these bugs in my head, just buzzing into my brain. I feel like theres bugs crawling up my insides as I struggle to force food down my throat. My absolute loss of appetite is causing weight loss and weakness. I can't seem to sleep at night even with the aid of Zopiclone, the restlessness and bugs keep me up at night and cause me to do impulsive things like chop off my hair at 3:00am.

I don't know how much longer this is going to go on. I'm tired of being tired, tired of feeling as if I'm sick in the head, and tired of being so pessimistic about everything. I struggle to keep relationships and sometimes I wonder, ""why me?"" 

Why did this have to happen to me, 
Why do i have bipolar disorder, will it only get worse or will I ever get better?

Im tired of constantly taking medications that only work to a certain extent and then taper off of them due to unbearable side effects.

For instance, when I am in classes and a insignificant thing happens I just start to laugh and can't stop. Inside myself I don't find that thing funny and I want it to stop, but I can't. It's like something thickling from inside the chest. Even when I argue with someone I just start to smile and laugh and I just try to get serious, but seems impossible. I am not in control of my self. This whole thing makes me want to die, cause i can't behave how i want. So suicidal thought are normal for me now.

1619,"Hi 

New to this group - looking for some advice.  Very basically I have felt for a number of years that my moods are not right and it's affecting my work and relationships.  I have very high periods where I'm on full throttle - out all the time, dis-regarding others feelings - just want to have fun at whatever cost.  My work suffers but in my mind I'm having the best time - these periods usually last for about 2 weeks.  Then I suddenly wake up, like I've been in a dream and start to feel shame, guilt and embarrassment for my behaviour.  I do remember what I've done but the details feel vague. This is happening I would say at least every 6 weeks and I can almost feel it coming on.  I always start speaking faster and faster at the beginning.  My husband made me call the Dr and had a phone appointment and he said it sounds like  Cyclothymia and I need to go and see him (this was about 8months ago but I'm too embarrassed to go to see the Dr).  Does this sound like Cyclothymia?  I look at other ppl and just with I could feel 'normal'"

1621,"It is hard being patient with an insomnia spell. I felt very tired yesterday and needed a nap, but I didn't want to go to bed. I wanted to stay up. It was happening at a time I never nap, at one PM. Because I resisted the nap, I felt very sick, which is unusual for me. Now I've been up all night long. I've tried lying down several times to no avail. So because I ignored sleepiness in the daytime, hoping to sleep at night instead, I created an insomnia spell. This is all that's left of my bipolar. It is just a sleep disorder now. It's not a mood disorder at all. I cried for literally one minute because I'm so disappointed that this is my life."
1622,"I've slipped back into thinking that I deserve to die and I know it's not logical but it feels true at my core right now and I think part of it is that I haven't been sleeping, but basically what triggered the thoughts this time was making a mistake with the upkeep of my fish tank and having to empty it really quickly and it shocked my fish and now that he's back in the tank he's jerky and disoriented and I'm really scared that he's gonna die and it's gonna be my fault. I haven't had him for very long and I really thought I could give him a good life and even though he hasn't died yet the guilt is overwhelming.

My mom saw me when I was crying and basically said that she was too stressed out to deal with it (which is absolutely true she had a really bad day) and now I feel even worse for contributing to her stress. The foundation of my moral values is to not hurt others and if I can't stop myself from doing that I don't know what the point is. The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself is that the hurt caused by my death would outweigh the hurt I cause alive and I just feel so stuck and it feels like the whole world is ending and that this fish deserves life more than I ever could"

1624,"I feel like i have two personalities fighting w eachother to be “normal”.

I have been going through a lot lately. I hate that i’m bipolar. Can anyone else relate to my sotuation? I just broke up w my boyfriend of two years. Mind you our relationship was hell. I woke up one day & its like my feelings for him turned off like a light switch. I left him. He tried to kill himself over it which has lead to serious stress & depression for me. I want so badly to go back to being in love w him but i cant, my feelings are literally gone & i don’t know why. When he tried to kill himself i didnt feel any sort of emotion at all. I was emotionless. I felt like a horrible person...

The same thing happened when i left my sons dad 4 years ago. I didnt understand why. I am
So scared to wake up sometimes because i don’t know who i will be that day. I will be the happy crazy me or i will be the hostile depressed me. I have so much going on in my head right now i feel like i’m just a person watching two versions of myself trying to be “normal” but i can’t. I love going hiking & working out. One day i will be so motivated to do those things then the next day all i want to do is sleep & i hate doing the things i love. Sometimes i love being alone & i enjoy my own company then the next i will cry myself to sleep because i hate being alone & i just want someone to be there for me. I also have a problem w sex. I feel like i need it all the time. I used to just literally use guys for sex then never talk to them again like a dude. I just recently started sleeping w this guy & i ended up catching feelings for him. He didnt feel the same way so that kind of broke me a little. But i ended it before it got too far. I don’t want to be that person anymore. I am on medication & it helps a lot but i still deal w these issues & i don’t want to feel this way anymore.."

He still talk normally except about these particles. Almost like he is lost in the la la land. Then if I disagree about the particles he will get very angry very fast. As long as I agree with him, he will be ok. Last night he barely sleep. He spent the whole night putting the cooking flour in the floor and he said he can kill these particles. It is sad to see him being this way. It could be side effect from substance abuse. He admit to me that he took cocaine. And the white powder can stop these particles.

How to take him to the treatment in this case?"
1628,"Do you ever get mixed states, like when you experience both depressive and manic symptoms at the same time?

I get this way often. I'll be restless and hyperactive, with a very short attention span, but in the same day I'll have really low moods and feel hopeless. It's frustrating because I feel both manic and depressed at the same time, and I don't know how to cope with it. 

What do you find helpful in these moods?"
1629,I'm on 200mg Lamictal for bipolar ii and I'm adding Geodon/Ziprasidone (20mg then 40). Does anyone want to share their experience with Geodon? Other antipsychotics haven't worked great for me but I'm hopeful about this one. Also: the cheapest I could get it was $40 and that kinda sucks :(
1630,"Hi,

New member looking to see if anyone can offer some hope for my current situation.

I've had GAD and bouts of depression and agoraphobia since 16. I started cracking up in January last year and started trialling different medications. I had a complete breakdown in July last year. Turns out I am anti-depressant resistant. Anxiety went through the roof and no meds help with that. Sometimes Valium will help but it's unreliable (can knock me out completely or make me feel nauseous with no anxiety relief). I was put on 60mg Mirtazapine.
Diagnosed with Bipolar type 2 last August and put on Lithium 1000mg. I was feeling better. Beat the depression but my anxiety has still not improved. I am in therapy weekly (since July 2017). I had to come off the Mirtazapine because I put on a tonne of weight. I have developed a reaction to the Lithium - severe Pruritus, which is causing insomnia, as well as trouble with my body temperature and thyroid issues. The Pruritus is at a point where I can't stop myself from hurting myself so I've told my psych to take me off the Lithium. I am in the process of cutting down and I feel like shit. My itchiness is starting to ease off but my insomnia is killing me. I feel like I just want to peel my skin off my body and I cry for hours until I pass out. Last night this took 6 hours after having taken 2 x Phenergan 10mg (for the Pruritus) which has a sedative effect and 5mg Valium. (I didn't take any more because I didn't want to make myself sick mixing pills). I'm trying not to develop a Benzo problem so I only use Valiums as a last resort. 
I have also developed my 3rd psychosomatic illness in 12 months (having never had them before). My brain is f**ing with my body so I don't even know what's real or imagined but I feel sick 24/7. Going on for months now. I just don't know what to do, it seems therapy isn't as strong as my minds stubborn resistance to therapy. I'm wondering if the increased insomnia could be from Lithium withdrawal? My psych said there wouldn't be any side effects because I haven't even been on it for 12 months. 

(My life is a mess so there are constant stressors - I'm 27, childhood trauma, abusive partners, married the worst of all [unknowingly], in process of separation from that monster and sexual harassment from uncle. Life has not been kind. No drugs, no alcohol. Actually, I'm a high achiever at uni, worked at the uni teaching [had to quit because of mental health]. I'm just a magnet for shit)

I'm just so exhausted. Hoping someone can relate and provide some reassurance that I can survive this? I'm not suicidal, just tired. I just want someone to tell me they know someone who has been through some shit like this and made it out the other side. I'm in a DV support group but they can't understand the bipolar/medication side of it all. I'd really appreciate some feedback please.

Thank you."
1631,"I am 3 medications for bipolar.

Zyprexa 2.5mg just for sleep.

Lithium 450

I have been trying to get off Zyprexa unsuccessful over the last couple years do Zyprexa's sedation.

Unfortunately I no longer sleep with out Zyprexa very well but I'm not sure if that would eventually change through withdrawal.

Is there a place I go to withdrawal from Zyprexa for insomnia issues?"

1633,"Hi Im new to the forum.. I was finally diagnosed about a year ago as bipolar 1.. I've battled with depression, psychosis, panic etc etc but was finally diagnosed. I've been on so many meds.. I'm just tired at this point... My behavior has been so erratic over the years. Job to job, city to city.. Constantly moving and never able to finish anything or accomplish anything in full.. I have managed to mess my life up to a point where I am having a hard time finding a way to continue.. How do some of you cope with these feelings? Lately its gotten bad.. Medication isnt really working.. ohh and I forgot to mention Im addicted to benzos... So theres that... :cry::cry:"
1634,"Most of you guys have seen me write to people about their Foundation Programming and I always advocate challenging it. But honest to God, I don't think I will ever get past the horrible feeling of being invalidated/dismissed by someone in their Critical Parental Mode. I just go head long into an endless rebuttal in my mind. It's the lousy feeling I had as a teenager which was only relieved with marijuana.

I know this instance of being dismissed rudely is an opportunity to whittle away at the program but it doesn't feel like I'm getting anywhere.

I know I should focus on the good son who called me for Mothers Day and talked for over an hour about lots of fun stuff. But instead I am focused on the other son who responded the next day to my query as to why he didn't call on Mothers Day. He said I was immature and looking for attention and Mother's Day is stupid and I am childish and disappointing to him. Which is a radical new view for him. 

I try to take the high road and worry if he is over worked and pressured and stressed. Maybe he has an illness ?? But the mental obsessing takes over and the high road of compassion for him goes out the window. 

I know I have the bipolar with an element of obsessive compulsive. Why can't I be the kind of person who stays centered and doesn't care when people are rude ?? Why do I need my sons approval ??  He NEVER talks to me on the phone. He rarely responds to emails. I was kinda hoping he'd talk to me on Mothers Day like he use to years past. 

He did give us a three thousand dollar loan six months ago and I was very grateful to him because it helped us get the product manufactured for a large job. So I'm not allowed to say anything because he gave us money ?? I have to take verbal abuse from my own son  ????

It's like the high road just vanished."
1635,"So basically I’ve been experiencing somewhat worse than ‘normal’ mood swings. I’m currently going through crippling depression, I’ve had very little interest in sex with my partner, I’ve struggled to pull myself out of bed, I have no motivation to do any of my studying for college, I’m experiencing suicidal thoughts and I feel as though I’m causing everyone else’s pain around me. However before this depression came on, I experienced a couple of phases of what may be called mania. My sex drive sky-rocketed, I felt like like I could perform better than everybody else in all of my classes, I felt as though I was more physically capable than everybody else around me, however I was very irritable and frustrated by everything else around me. I’m surrounded by people who experience a lot of depressed feelings and I was annoyed that they were being such ‘downers’ on my fun, and for about 6-7 days I slept round about 2-4 hours a night without feeling a tad of tiredness throughout the day. My research has shown this may be hypomania as it was rather mild and very short lived,  however it’s happened twice I think. This depressed phase has been going on for about 2 weeks and at the end of last year I experienced a period just like this for about 2-3 months. The main reason I started researching about bipolar disorder is because my father and his father both suffer from bipolar disorder so i thought I’d check it out.

Is there anyone on here who could tell me if it’s worth seeing a doctor/psychiatrist about?"
1636,"I've been medicated since the age of 15--first for depression and now for bipolar. I'm afraid that it's not working. For all I know, it could be making me worse. I have no idea what I'm like without medication and I'm seriously considering just stopping. I'm so tired and sad and angry so what's the point if the medication isn't getting me to a safe place? I've been trying different combinations of meds and it's been really hard on me.

What has made you the most stable?  Maybe medication or lifestyle wise?

Are you generally doing well and healthy?

There are many studies that those with bipolar die younger although they aren't 100% why.  Might simple be lifestyle choices or something else altogether.  I developed a sleep disorder and likely will be stuck on Zyprexa(or Seroquel) for life."
1640,"Hello all.

1641,"Even since coming down from the stress of school, I've been struggling a lot. This past couple days I've been lashing out at people, which I hate but it's so hard to control when I've been irritated by even the smallest things. My meds aren't working the way they should be and I don't have a psychiatrist appointment till the end of the month and I think my mom wants me to go off my meds altogether but I'm afraid that would make me even worse.

I'm scared. I'm having to come to terms with the severity of my mental illness and it's so so hard to act like a normal human being and I'm afraid of hurting people. I know this is part of a negative stigma towards bipolar disorder but since my diagnosis I've had it in my mind that I'm toxic to the people I love and that's one of my biggest fears."
1642,"Evening everyone. My partner was diagnosed with bipolar II a few months back. Not sure how it manifested itself, her father is bipolar and so was her late mother who passed away when she was young. She has been getting worse recently, was prescribed lamictal but sadly, was too scared to take it and now the lows are getting close to the point where it is affecting every aspect of our lives. I have had more time off work because I can't leave her, and now she's starting to talk about not being strong enough to be here anymore. Even if I try reminding her of the kids that I know she adores and would never to anything stupid to cause them loss, she says she is past this point now and says the only way to get help to her would be to lock her up in hospital. She was referred to the primary care liason team, but has since been discharged for failing to attend the appointment, ironically the mental health department is 5mins walk from the house. Now I have to somehow get her back to the doctors, fight again to get referred  and wait for another appointment. But I fear time is running out, I'm in danger of losing my job and I'm scared that the wheels are gonna come off one way or another further compounding the issue. Don't know what the fudge to do for the best I really don't. All this and she wants me to keep it to myself. 
Please advise, I'm in a mess right now :("
1643,"I’m planning on seeing my GP to ask for a referral for a psychiatrist as I’m afraid I may have BPD. I don’t want my GP to know why I’m wanting to see a psychiatrist as I want as few people to know as possible, is it possible to just ask for a referral to a psychiatrist without a reason? Or do I need to explain its because I suspect I have BPD?"

I get deep deep bouts of depression that lead me to self harm and suicidal thoughts, and I’ve experienced what I would describe as hypomanic episodes where I’ve got almost a week with about 6 hours sleep, I’m not going to delve into the specifics but I’m worried to tell anyone about it as it’s nowhere near what other people experience when t comes to bipolar disorder, i feel as though I’ll be shrugged off and told to stop exaggerating or something along those lines. What do I do?"
1645,"Not sure if I'm in the right area but here goes anyway and if a mod can move to a more suitable area then that would be greatly appreciated.

 So, I'm a guy in my late 30s, I've been suffering from extreme anxiety for years but only recently went to doctors as it started to manifest in to physical symptoms such as pains in stomach but tests show nothing and the pains moved around a lot, loss of appetite and little to no sleep there were a lot of events and things happening that caused this on top of ongoing stress. I've been given citalopram (sp?) I'm taking 20mg and have been for about 4 weeks, my wife has said she has seen a difference and I guess it has taken the edge off. However, I have a lot of thoughts of worthlessness and failure, to the point of thoughts of suicide. I have always been a lonely person, despite easily making friends I've always preferred my own company but I have in the past gone through episodes of undiagnosed depression (possibly) and have thought of suicide but have never done or attempted to harm myself in anyway. I don't know if this is a genetic thing also as both my Grandfather and my uncle on my mothers side killed themselves.

 I really don't know what to do and I noticed my anxiety is also starting to creep back up with regards to my childrens health which is my main anxiety, they are relatively healthy children but my youngest was in hospital recently and it almost sent me over the edge, she is ok now (touch wood) but I'm just feeling in a real dark place like I have failed my wife and children and may be I can make things better if I wasn't hear. 

I don't want to tell anyone of these thoughts though as I don't want it on my GP file and I certainly don't want to be sectioned or anything, I also don't want my wife to find out about it, she is great and all but to me it would make me look weak and even more of a failure. My family are no good, my mum and dad are divorced and the most narcissistic baby boomers known to man and my brother is not interested unless there is 50 quid in it. I'm not actively looking to take my own life, but just the other day I typed out (and saved) my suicide note and that's something I've never done before and it should've scared me but it didn't it was kind of like a matter of fact, but I know it should've scared me if that makes sense. I'm just I'm not in a good place and I need help but I really don't know what to do, any advice will be greatly appreciated I can assure you.

Thank you."

She was prescribed lamictal but has so far refused to take them and each time she has a low its getting worse, particularly when she is on her monthly cycle. Had a great Bank Holiday weekend with her and friends and last night all of a sudden... Bang! In Come the low. She is now completely withdrawn, doesn't want to talk about it and is just full of self hate, which is scaring me now as she never used to get this bad. I'm just worried she ends up hurting herself or worse.

1648,"In January this year, I had a review at work. My boss mentioned that she had noticed over a couple of months how I had been up one minute and down the next. I considered this and told her it was just that we were very busy and I had just been working hard and occationally had time to chat and enter in to workplace banter. She seemed satisfied with this.

Early March I had a very bad run in with the second boss. She told me that my work was really poor, I never finished a job, she was constantly having to clear up behind me and that she had been scared to approach me about it because she didn't know how I would react. She got personal and it really upset me. 

I spent the weekend crying  (I havent cryed for years except when my Mum died two years ago).  I felt like she was unjust and that she wasn't being honest. Why would this be the first time I was hearing this? I was really confused and scared. I had a meeting with my boss about it and she told me it was in my best interests to go to the doctor.

My doctor signed me off work for 3 weeks and refered me to the psyciatrist and he concluded I have Hypomania. I was given Quetiapine but had to come off it after six weeks because of the ECG result.  I am now waiting for the next ECG to show everything back to normal before we try another med. 

I just don't understand how this all happened so quickly. I didn't even know anything was wrong. I've been off work two months now and its still not sorted out. I can accept that I have been depressed and maybe even for years but I just dontget how its gone so bad so quickly.

Having no spares was freaking me out.. So I got dressed again and with some trepidation ventured out.. I brought a shit load of batteries.. Which is something I do.. Why buy one when you can get two for twice the price.
Then I figured.. While I was out there I mite as well have a walk about.. So that's what I did... Ended up getting a couple of second hand PS3 games.. I didn't stay out long... But it was me..

Oh sun so mighty, 
A blood orange Pharos,
Basking in all its glory,
Take my hand,
And guide me through the darkness.

The blush of the day fades, 
Into a lifeless mist and soon
The Siberian chill, that burns my skin,
Turns me numb.
My body, my heart.
My heavy, heavy heart,
Cannot fathom the weight.
The weight. The pain. The pain, pain
Of the weight,
Dragging me under, under,
Into the night,
Lives for my surrender.

And so, all light is banished,
And the darkness calls,
To wake the shadows,
And paint my world black.

Oh sun, guide me through,
Through the darkness,
And into the light"

I've been feeling so so tired and even little things are really hard right now and it's also final exam week so even if I was completely stable I'd be stressing out. I'm so sad right now because I worked really hard on a portrait and it would've been something I could really be proud of but I didn't even finish because I just can't force myself to work late nights. then I forgot to take a photo of it before I took it apart and threw it away

I'm also so so afraid of having a negative effect on those around me, which is normally a big stressor for me but I know that I'm really hard to be around. I'm trying not to make my roommates deal with it but I can't control the mood swings and I'm afraid they'll feel obligated to take care of me"

I had nothing but problems on this drug, It knocked me out at night I would be getting up in the morning banging into walls feeling drunk and dizzy, But kept getting told to take it or cut down on the dose my physiatrist had left and I've been waiting on a new one. I finally got to see someone last week who was so helpful and was told I should never have been on it that long due to the way I was feeling, it also never made any difference to the the way I was feeeling too, the physiatrist also told me looking at my notes it was more bipolar 2 I had and has started me on lamotrigine, is anyone else on this? she has started me off on 25mg and to work up to 200mg,  but I'm finding it extremly hard to sleep since coming off the seroquel.

Wow! I um duno but yeh I have been a nurse now for almost 6 years now, Its for me one of the most things that I loved. It was my life! I  used to work as a nurse aide in a resthome that, believe  me is pretty stressful in itself.
For me in a way nursing was my nature. I was so proud of myself when I finally graduated and for me nursing seemed like my nature. It wasnt hard to be a nurse until the pressure of being a 'senior nurse' and trying to struggle with my own periods of un wellness and the fact we have a lot of new nurses on the ward and have a number of new nurses, just out of polytech/training. 
I  have an amazing husband who loves me so much, I keep a lot of my symptoms to myself. Now he knows most of my stuff. I have an amazing psychdoc, she has now really understood where I am at. I would love to go back to where I was I cant and my support worker David rang me this morning to say my work had rung him to say when we can meet. My lovely psych doc has made a time to meet. 
Yet I believe in ringing my psych support is rather an unethical thing in itself. Who needs to know that I am mentally unwell. I could be pregnant, have another type of illness. What makes this there interest.
I mean I have, yes have had at least 7 weeks off now, and yet on maternaty leave it seems to not matter.
I arent angry but in reality I am concerned bout others in my situation.
Is being bipolar that bad? If I had a bad car crash or something similiar and had to have several months off then that would be ok?
I know that 3 nurses at least atm are pregnant so they will be off work on maternty leave. Why does my period of unwellness have to be any different. I honestly  am going further with this.
If they want me  to resign or what have you I am going to not allow myself (even though I want to atm) to be a push over that some people think I am.
Interesty I have always been interested in mental health issues and well the world is out there for me  to hopefully make a change. I dont care money does matter. I think if we can pay the bills have a roof over our heads,be warm, have the odd treat, and enough to eat that is great. Friends whether one or a few thenh if they are people that are there for us then thats great. For me atm I feel lost, bewildered, scared, and well real time lost. But well the whol;e mental health thing I will find something and work out how in some way to make that difference.

1662,"In October of 2017 I was diagnosed with bipolar but my doctors didn't tell me what type and I was too depressed to express myself. And by the time I was well enough I forgot to ask. So am I type 1 or 2. I only ask because I internalized many of my symptoms. I only know the dates through looking at my prescription receipts and medical notes  All of October was just one massive day if you ask manic me. Here are some details 

[LIST]
put on  25 and then 75mg of Efforxor late Sept. 2017 (doc skipped the 37.5mg)
went into a antidepressant induced mania on Oct 9th spent 1 or 2 days in the hospital and was all fine and not manic. prescribed Seroquel 
Oct 12 I had an appointment, told the doctor I was taking two showers that day and writing books worth of notes and was told to come back the next day
oct 13: (I thought) everyone at the bus stop was talking about me and told the doc, he put me on a 72hr hold 
Oct 13-18 EVERYONE is an actor testing me. theres a sciology prof studying me. Securirty guards are dressed like patients. they are poisoning the water. the lady sharing the room with me is recording me. 
[LIST]
Oct 14 (I think); Discharged from hosptial 
 Oct 15-21: Everyone is talking about me. A cockroach is taking nude pictures of me while in the shower. (I am not explaining my reasoning its too much, I'll spare y'all the details). My phone gets tapped into, I thought the hospital did it. my student loans came in and I thought the hospital was paying me hush money, I literally went to the bank and asked for a statement. The accornym they used confirmed that the hospital is in fact paying me hush money, they were not. 
Oct 22: I go to the ER talking about the hospital tapping into my phone and bank account. I get put on a another 72hr hold. But get discharged later that night, after acting as normal as possible 

Oct 24: another appointment, I am now depressed. get prescribed 15mg of olanzapine and 25mg of lamatical, I am now on 100mg of lamatical and that is all. 

So type 1 or 2?

Thank you so much,

1663,"About a month ago my wife said she wanted to end our ten year marriage. I was shocked and it seemed out of the blue. Less than a week later she started having delusions. It included being able to give people visions, thinking someone was poisoning her, my brother trying to poison me and putting cameras in our house to watch us have sex, among some other delusions. Fast forward a few weeks to yesterday she accused me of raping her repeatedly and molesting our kids over the last 16 years of our relationship. She told her family about it and everything. They don't think she needs help and is just ""stressed out"" I need help. What do I do? Is there hope?"

And it occurred to me that I take medications and then turn around and say they are bad for people. I am stable and centered and content on medications. But then I say they are bad for us. This is hypocritical. 

I realized this when a woman started screaming at me and shouting at the highest intensity yesterday. And I remember distinctly that I use to have that level of anger. And my first thought was that she had a bad childhood. And my second thought was that she needed a medication adjustment. 

And I realized that I might not be so calm and understanding if the meds were taken away. I think I'd only have the insomnia from decreasing meds but regardless, I've been on them for decades and my very cells are soaked in them. It would be torture to stop them.

And why should I be ashamed of taking them ?? Who do I need to prove something to by quitting the meds ??  I'm too old to be stressing my body out. I have enough stress coping with the chronic leg pain.

Without meds I am a very big character, rough around the edges. On meds I am still like that but more subdued. I actually think it's an improvement. And it's necessary to keep me from over doing it with my bad leg. 

I just think it hypocritical for me to keep saying drugs are bad."
1665,I am diagnosed with schizoaffective bipolar type 1. I've been very depressed for about the last month or two but I'm manic also. It's like I'm crushed on the inside and talkative happy looking on the outside. I've felt like this many times but this is the worst. I also have been feeling like I'm on the outside looking in and like I'm in a haze and watching myself. I've been suicidal also. I can't sleep or i sleep too much. Not sure if i need my meds changed or deal with it till it goes away.
1666,"Okay. 
I know this is going to seem like a lot, but I'd really like some guidance:

I'm a 29 year old female therapist. I started depression meds in college, then my symptoms of mood shifts got worse, highs and lows (hypomanic and depressive symptoms but not consecutive enough to  constitute a hypomanic or depressive episode), then when my menstrual cycle comes, my depressive symptoms amplify so much so that I feel like a completely different person that dissociates, lacks all sense of responsibility and motivation and is tearful and overreactive. 

Long story short, one year ago I decided to share my thoughts about my unspecified bipolar-ish symptoms. We decided it was likely a mood disorder. Started lamictal, felt wonderful (literally so fucking happy ) and for months I thought it was all a dream because it was nothing I had felt before. 
After some increases in my lamictal and antidepressant, things kind of plateaued and I felt like I couldn't get out of bed in the morning and work was a nightmare. 
I'm sitting with people dealing with real life situations, sharing very private things with me, and I can't seem to remained engaged (even though I actually care a lot about what they say and I want to help). 
Being disengaged and daydreaming have always been a thing, but as an adult I haven't been employed as someone who spends a lengthy amount of one-on-one time multiple times a day listening to people. 

After speaking with my doctor, we kind of brought up ADHD as a possibility.
I had never considered this because I have always been extremely mellow as a kid. I could just never comprehend anything that was taught to me and I slid by. College was the hardest thing in the entire world, forcing me for once in my life to rely on myself to get good grades.

I started thinking about the kids I see with ADHD and some of them aren't bouncing off the walls.

What I'm getting at is, my family has a history of drug abuse with amphetamines. After filling out a questionnaire, it said I had all the symptoms. I got an Adderall prescription. I tried it with caution. I have been very productive, focused, motivated, but calm. My anxiety symptoms have decreased, my mood has been consistent.

Perhaps this is an anxious thought, but I feel like I'm doing something wrong by taking the medication because it makes me into this version of myself I've never seen. It's a better version, sure, but is it me? Does that mean I'm ""high"" when I'm focused? I'm not sure how it EXACTLY is supposed to feel. 
Does ADHD make sense in this situation considering my mood disorder?
What is the likelihood that I do not actually have a mood disorder, but have ADHD?
I don't know why I have guilt about it at all. Perhaps because of my negative associations with the drug. Regardless, it's been a wonderful change in my life and in my job, I'm just concerned about being artificial or taking something not meant for me because I overanalyze everything.
Idk what I want, just insight I guess. 


Thanks for reading."
1667,"Living with bipolar isn't a list of symptoms from the DSM; it's the realities of chaos in daily life that defines one's environment for me. Living in chaos is tiring, stressful and very much chaotic to the point of untidiness in the home, self-care and the complete confusion that overwhelms the consciousness.

The side effects of medication, when psychiatrists and mental health nurses attempt to persuade their patients into stating there are none is overwhelming, to say the least. But I still see lists of symptoms ever-present on the internet that attempt to explain what living with bipolar is really like, without really explaining anything to anyone in reality. And I still see lists of drugs that take away the willingness to live our daily lives to the full, for they numb the very realities of existence.

Sleep is not given but taken from me in an ever ending uneven circle that evades my life, it is not from morning to evening, but chaotic cycles of an hour or two of sleep at random times of the day or night. Thoughts are uneven with symptoms not explained in a DSM but those that run around my head quickly that need to be slowed to a pace acceptable to the general public and our health care providers, but really I do not wish my thoughts blocked to a crawl so that I cannot think.

Eating regularly isn't something that comes naturally, it is something taken away from those living with bipolar. Cooking is difficult and certainly, it isn't to the point that three regular meals at set times of the day for nutrition are taken for living healthily. But in my life I take nutrition at points when we are free to the extent that hungriness comes easy and overstuffing myself at times is also something of a requirement at times.

From the dryness in my mouth, the dribbles on my clothes, my teeth grind together until they break and fallout. My throat feels like it's going to break apart from every invading pill and saliva that drips haphazardly from my chin. My mouth quavers from the side effects of drugs that evades my body, and to all this is called management of the condition known as bipolar.

At my manic extremes, my consciousness is invaded with thoughts from others, we natter to an endless point of restlessness and annoy those around us requiring apologies at a later stage to maintain relationships, keep our friends and our glue to the very realities of a happy life. At the other extremes I cry, quietly slow our thoughts to the point we do not get out of bed for hours and even possibly days.

My physical health suffers, for it's not only the medication that destroys our health but the condition itself; leading to diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, headaches, parkinsonism's and something’s that couldn't possibly be written on the page in a civilised society in an acceptable way without disgust."
1668,"Interesting but maybe not surprising. It has to be quite something to be a performing artist on the big stage with bipolar though...

1669,"A few days ago I became aware of a disorder that I never thought I had, bipolar disorder ...

Well the hypotheses are there and I'll explain how the doctor arrived at this alleged diagnosis ...
I did a cycle of Zoloft from September to January 50mg day for an anxiety depression, from the first days the mood has risen a lot, I always felt load, I did things that were years that I did not like to go out with more girls, expenses and great intra-occupational at work, socialization as never had, etc .. nothing pathological, however, I thought, well, the antidepressant works all right! Unfortunately, however, the sexual problems have made me stop after 4 months and from there I return anxiety obsessions and strong depression ...

When I decide to try it again because I could not live things just did not go the same way, I started a month ago and already the first assumption makes me feel accelerated, I was at work and I was at the ball and I say before assumption already so well, wow the cure works again, unfortunately, however, things do not go as expected and for a month things are alternating without having a sense or precise condition, ie one day I'm accelerated, 2 days total apathy, and from here my doctor has hypothesized that the zoloft is slatentizing a latent bipolar disorder, so it makes me stop a week and then see me again to decide what to do ...

What do you think about it? It should not give euphoria a cure with ssri it? I do not understand if there is something strange or if it is a normal side effect that they all have, but according to my psi no ... I'm a little frightened and angry sincerely because I gave the zoloft a lot of confidence and hoped I could get out of the ordeal, instead I risk to resume from the beginning :sorry:"
1670,"Hi there, 
I met my wife in school, we got together at the age of 13/14 and have been together since. She always struggled with anxiety and depression. Whenever she visited her doctor she they did the same over and over. Prescribe the meds for exactly that, anti depressants etc and sent her on her way. It wasn't until recently she finally got a proper diagnosis of cyclothymia, which she was so pleased to finally have. We are now 30. However, she has now started her meds and almost instantly shut me out. She's says she has no feelings or wish to be with me anymore. She's caused us a lot of problems over the years, especially with money and debts. Her first major episode was around the age of 19, just as we were expecting  our first child. She started hanging out with  groups of younger kids and after a bit of digging I finally found that she had been messaging and seeing one of the lads. It was hard at the time but we worked through it (we didn't know she had cyclothymia then). As the years have gone by she said changed herself time after time and become involved in so many different things it was hard to keep up with. Shes never been able to hold a job down either, but I didn't begrudge her for this. . Shes always know something was wrong but nobody listened to her properly and now she hates the doctors she's once thought were great. I guess the hardest part of being pushed away now is that I got an understanding of her 'condition' as quick as I could to be there for her and she hasn't allowed me to do so, she wants to 'fix herself'. She's also recently admitted that she can't  accept that she's grown up and is now 30. Her words that she's stuck at the age of her first major episode, so she said always been 18/19 and that's how she wants to live. She's now hanging around with people of that age and spends a lot of time with them. She says they're just friends and I can accept she needs friends but it's not normal and my two girls are in the house while shes 'pretending' to be that age again. It's also a lot similar to that time years ago.  Ofcourse I feel hurt, cheated and very confused. The whole scenario has blown me out of the water and I'm trying to move along and focus on myself. But it's not easy to disconnect yourself from someone you've spent every minute with for 16 years and made a life with. I don't want to be pushed away to  easily, but I don't want to be hurt either. I just don't know what's real or isn't at the moment. I guess by sharing some info I feel that some people from both sides of these experiences could shed some light on what the hell im supposed to do lol"
1671,"New to this , I have a problem with over doing , example eating , smoking, just felt the need to put out there, I've been doing this for a while, I'm bipolar just tired now , glad I found this forum , hope to hear from people ,"
1672,"Well I always had dealt with anxiety since I can remember but it was all under control until last week. Since then I had nothing but bad anxiety and panic attacks with sleepless nights and waking up during the night anxious and scared. I been changing the way I eat which had help a bit I eat blueberries with Greek yogurt in the morning and also some 78% dark chocolate for snacks I eat about 1.5 oz which is half a bar. I read it helps for anxiety and it does and for night I drink a cup of chamomile tea  with a tea spoon of raw honey all of these things had help with my anxiety but the main thing which change my whole view and felt a HUGE impact is my relationship with God. I'm no preacher yet I felt this was the way God called me to have a relationship with him. I haven't felt so calm and relax in a while yet so at peace.  I invite all of yall suffering from anxiety and all your problems to give God a chance to help you trust me you won't regret it yet you don't have much to loose. Jesus was right there with you even on times you felt anxiety was winning he was there by your side waiting for you to call for him to help. You don't have to do this alone; God would love to help you. Give him a chance to change your life and let him take all your worries and fears away since that's the cause of your anxiety. In the Bible it states with God there shouldn't be no fear ; maybe this the way God is asking you to come and start a relationship with him. It has change my life for ever and my anxiety has not been the same. I got God to help me and he hasn't let me down I always remember i have a good friend who never gonna let me down and will ALWAYS be there for me. Give him a chance and see what God can do for you not just thru anxiety but to all your problems. Find a church and start going to it as soon as I stepped inside I shed tears of hope and felt this undescridable feeling that made me smile something i havent done in days .i hope y'all have a wonderful day don't let anxiety take over your life. You have a life to live without worry , you deserve happiness.Your bigger than it and no matter what keep your faith up. Blessing to all yall"

Why do I perpetually feel sorry for myself?

How did I develop into such a selfish, self-centered person?

How can I be someone else? Someone better

How can I derail the cycle that is me?

How can I take control?

How can I be someone else?

I don’t want to get me.

But I don’t think I have a choice. Are there any other roads?

Is my existence to be a lesson to others?

Is Jared’s life a lesson? Or a punishment?

How dare I make him about me?

I want to be someone else.



All my life I have been screaming silently for someone to notice. For someone to have the strength and ability to reach outside of themselves and save me. HELP ME. 

I secretly demand this of others, knowing that I cannot return the sacrifice. 

But I think a thousand earthly angels could lay themselves bare for me and I would consume them and keep on burning.

I think there is something truly evil inside of me.

I think the promise of redemption is the route of EVIL.

I feel like the devil has designed this path for me to taint the good. I feel like a poison.

I feel like terrible oil that seeps into every crevice and crushes every light. 

I want to be someone else.



I feel alone. I feel like a succubus. I feel like a leach. I feel disgusting. I want to punish myself, but I can’t. I want to feel the physical pain that is inside me so that maybe it can get out. I want to try electroshock. Maybe a lobotomy can make me someone else.



I can’t be me. I hate me. I don’t think these are redeeming qualities. I think I am a nightmare. I think I am the perfect storm. I feel like a siren, leading everyone I come in contact with to demise. I feel like a cancer. I feel like a plague of everything that is wrong with the world. I feel like a human trap. I feel like I am stealing the energy of everyone around me, without returning it. I take without giving. I have nothing to give. I am false hope. I am worse than death. I am suffering. I am the worst. 

I want to be someone else. I want to be a tree. I want to be part of this world. To die and be recycled. I feel like rot. I feel like suffering. Something that death would relieve, but something that prolongs death even in the face of pleading mercy. I feel merciless. I feel like a wrath. I feel incurable. 

Maybe there is nothing wrong with me; maybe this is who I am. 

My life is all about me escaping myself, but at what cost? How many will drown to try to save me?

3pm 4/3

This is my being. This is every fiber of my existence. This is my reality. And no matter how many days I dress up in the functional costume, I don’t see any other me. It’s not even a curse. A curse implies an altered state; an infliction. I am the infliction. This is my purpose. And this is why I despair. I will always return to myself, no matter how much I practice. I was made to be an impassable test; the epitome of a lost cause; the definition of insanity: repeating the same thing and expecting a different result. This is not regression. This is truth. 

The energy consumed with this myriad that is my life is being stolen from the world.

I am the cancer that causes the body to attack itself and die from within. There is no cure. Only prolonged suffering. Death is too simple. I am here to waste everything into nothing. I am terrible. 

*side note: I am not overly religious. this is how I felt so I wrote.*"
1674,"Hi,

I have a friend who has just come out of psychiatric hospital having spent 9 months in it due to being treated for Bipolar-I.

I am trying to encourage him to remain positive and that he will be able to find work even though he has been in hospital for so long.

I feel that he may now get another depressive episode because he feels there is little chance of him getting into mainstream work and will always be dependent on family and friends for support.

Does anybody know of some person in the public eye or maybe not so much in the public eye that has been a long time in hospital and then got back into mainstream work? I can then use this person as an example to my friend to show him that it is possible to get back into mainstream work.

I much appreciate an answer.

1678,"Really struggling lately with my diagonasis of bi-polar i was diagnosed when I was 17 now 25 so had it a few years but I’m really struggling. I moved away from home because I thought that was 25 year olds do but I honestly can’t do it I need my mum nearby however stupid that sounds! 
I’m a teacher and want to go abroad and teach but I feel like this is a huge barrier because I don’t know how I’m going to wake up in the morning or end up like in the evening. My family are my support network but they just can’t undrtstand that change of mood and I feel so alone with it. Can’t hold down a bf and get frustrated with working with others. But everyone thinks I’m the life and soul of the party no worries in the world - only if they knew aye 
Just come out of a depressive so on a bit of a high so if none of this makes sense I’m sorry"
1679,"For those of you that have bi polar do you have this?
I have been jumping around in my moods again lately. Not everyday but quite a bit lately. I probably need to see my doctor before the time scheduled next month.
Right now writing this I’m weepy, crying. Then I go into anger because I am crying. Been very irritated and quick to anger. Started out slow and not that often. Last two days though it has been next to constant.
The question I want to ask is do you have these kind of flashes. Quick mood changes, flashes of different events of sorrow, grief, angry of the past?
I had a very stressful night at work last night. It was difficult to keep it together. I managed it, not sure how, but I have spent my entire life covering up this illness from others. I didn’t know I had it for years. Just knew I was different then others, having more intense reactions and wondering why I was like this. Always wishing I was like them. Wanting to be stable. 
I drive an hour home from work. Almost the whole time, I had quick rapid flashes of crazy distress stuff. It just wouldn’t stop. 
Feeling flipped out from the fast changes of mood and different emotions I knew no one could hear me so I started screaming in my car. Trying to make it stop. Then in anger I was yelling fix it fix it make it stop! I have never did this before.
It was so distressing that I felt I heard someone’s else voice talking to me. Usually in it’s my own voice I hear, but this time it felt like someone else.
I just need to talk to someone else who understands me."
1680,"I’m not exactly sure where to start! I just want to gather some thoughts on my situation I geuss .. I was diagnosed and put on medication 10 years ago for anxiety and depression but quickly took myself off them and never seeked any other help ..I’ve always had issues with my mood swings but my mood swings are kind of week to week .. one week or two I’ll feel overly confident and like I can’t sit still but then crash and burn and wake up crying .. before school I would cry for na hour because I messed up my eye liner, I’d also change my clothes 5 times before I even  left the house .. anyway things have been getting a lot more severe tho .. I got into an extremely violent and mentally abusive relationship that I managed to escape from 6 months ago after 5 years .. we have a young daughter together and I was 19 when we got together and he was 29 ..anyway after we split my mood swings became more intense which I think it normal because of the situation but on one of my high moods I went to the bar chatted up some guy and made the wrong decision to get into the car .. we got into an accident and I shattered my jaw and they had to removed all 8 front teeth .. I still have highs where I can’t stop talking and I think I’m on top of the world or overly confident even without my teeth.. but then I’ll wake up after a while and I’ll cry for 3 days off and on straight and I won’t get out of bed .. but now some the accident I’ve started eperiencing loud screaming thoughts in my head .. mainly at night which will cause me to not sleep .. for a whole month I got nothing but 1 hour a sleep a night .. but it stopped for a few weeks and now is starting up again .. I want to pull my hair out on these night and find myself getting really irritated and angry .. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything other then the anxiety and depression as a teen but kind of curious as to what people might think between these mood swings I also have days where I can’t really feel anything at all .. I was referred to mental health but never called back .. I feel like to actually go through it I’d need someone to force me to go like when I was younger .. I don’t know I feel confused and would just like someone’s opinion on everything"
1681,"I am afraid of myself, simply because I don't know who I am, and I fear I never will be ""me"" again. I show symptoms of bipolar disorder, psychosis, mania, and have been diagnosed with chronic depression and anxiety. Despite all this, I maintain a 4.0 gpa in software engineering and have every person in my life convinced I am perfectly normal. I was institutionalized for 2 days for attempted suicide when I was 17, I was supposed to be there for months, but I convinced the psychiatrist, psychologist, and a couple (dumb) social workers that they had made a mistake and this was all a misunderstanding, they hesitantly believed me. I felt powerful and now get a high out of manipulating people in any way I can.

I feel as if I have broken the boundaries of depression, and now feel nothing. Faces are blurry, my sense of time/space is awful (walking extremely slow, bumping into things), I am beginning to self harm because it makes me feel alive, something that has become foreign to me. 

I feel my personality changing into something that is, by societies standards, evil. I want to cause harm to others, in hope they will cause harm to me, in return. I get angry easily. I'm getting lazy. I have been doing weird things like getting up at 3am to go for a walk in -12C weather in shorts for no reason, and I almost don't feel in control of myself. My crazy brain is taking over and I feel myself quickly submitting to it. I get into phases where I feel like I am dreaming, and have the slight urge to do things that could potentially get me in a lot of trouble, in attempt to get myself closer to reality. I have developed an addiction to marijuana to feel at ease. 

I feel like I am sliding down a slippery slope into insanity. I don't know what to do. I have 0 friends, by choice. I have a girlfriend, who I have no feelings for. I show her compassion, because I am a good actor. 

I need a diagnosis. I am scared of what I am becoming. I don't know what course of action I should take."

Now I have to be transported lying down in the passenger seat, with my bf driving, as I usually do this, and it's going to hurt. I'll be in a panic by the time I get to my appointment today; to see a psychologist for Voc Rehab !!!  Bloody psychologist will see I'm depressed.  :eek2:"

1686,"Hey,
So like the title says I told my mom about my diagnosis and after the conversation I felt like crap. couple days ago she called me and I tought this would be a good time to tell her well first she wanted to know where it comes from I told her that It can be genetic she said that she doesn't think it comes from her side of the family because her parents were so strong I got offended because even if you have a mental disorder doesn't make you any less strong. 

She also wanted to know what are the symptoms and I read for her the basic symptoms from online and se said doesn't everyone suffer from those? I felt like she didn't take it seriously and thought that I'm just having a phase or something.

What are your experiences of telling your loved ones about your diagnosis?"
1687,"Hey everyone! I'm new to this forum, but I've been reading a lot of the topics and comments here and everyone seems so welcoming and helpful. So thank you for this forum! Additionally, if I interpret bipolar incorrectly in any way in this post, please please point it out to me! I want to learn and be the best for my partner.

My boyfriend of more than a year (we're both 20 and go to college together) has bipolar disorder, which has led to a lot of misunderstandings between us until I finally learned more about BP and we were able to navigate his episodes of anger more appropriately. Before I knew, though, he said a lot of very damaging things to me to the point where he made me believe I was a bad person and was doing terrible things to him (I know now he didn't mean any of this personally, that often his accusations were thoughts affected by his disorder). But there are still a lot of things I'm confused about and holes in my memory, and he still tells me things I did when I really feel like I didn't do them, but I can't remember the events at all. 

I know he has been gaslighting me. Typically the person gaslighting KNOWS they are not telling the truth. Here, my partner truly believes the events he recalls have happened (he believes I have never shown him affection or shown him that I want to be with him, but I really think I have-- I just can't remember, because he has been angrily telling me this for so long and I'm very confused. And I still do my best to show him affection now.) I think at this point, both of our realities are a little distorted-- mine from some of the things he has accused me of and his from BP.

Is it fair for me to think any of this? Whenever I try to bring issues up with him he shuts me down and doesn't respond. I feel like I'm in a very precarious position regarding our separate perceptions. I'm a little bit lost on how to approach this, and any insight would be so appreciated. Thank you!!"
1688,"Over the last 3 years iv been suffering from depression but over the last few months iv noticed big changes to my life and not for the better. Now I’m having trouble sleeping but at the same time I’m feeling tired, I don’t feel like doing anything and lost all interest in hobbies that I loved to do. I’m even getting to the point where I don’t even want to know my children. I’m getting a huge amount of pressure in the front of my head and I’m always talking to myself like there 2 of me in the same body.....my moods can change like in seconds and can take days for me to snap out of it. I continue to struggle to get through day to day life but this is no joke I just feel like falling asleep and never waking up."
1689,"I need help.

Background, a DX of BPD some 9 years ago, one I have been reluctant to accept but grudgingly did. No traits of BPD for 4 years after therapy - never been a serial self-harmer.

Plenty of other traits that are also linked to Bipolar, binge eating being one.

I have a reached a point of no return. I have had enough and set plans in motion to end things next week.

I am tired of feeling numb inside but looking ok on the outside.

I seem to keep going through these cycles of depression, but mixed so I'm bouncing off the walls but also want to die and feel hopeless, unloved and so alone.

What I am experiencing now happened last year and I sought help only to be fobbed off by them and discharged after one appointment with a locum psychiatrist.

Now, I am back in the same cycle again. Started with feeling depressed, tired, hopeless, anger and sleeping a lot. Then it switches so I feel depressed and empty, but find myself happy, smiling, singing, talking and not sleeping.

I have barely had much sleep in the past few weeks and I've been writing non-stop, keeping a diary or just being generally creative on the bedroom wall (a first!)

I walked away from my best friend almost three weeks ago because I knew it was my intention to finally kill myself and I didn't want to hurt her, I also didn't want her to stop me. She's now just phoned me and I broke down in tears and have agreed to go and see her this evening. My friend has a lot going on at the moment, her husband is terminally ill and I wanted to protect her from what I was going through.

I've also been driving rather risky in the past few weeks, slamming the accelerator down and taking of like a bat out of hell, not caring about anything, tie this in with loud music!

I've managed to spend £500 in the last week on nothing, mostly creative things and lots of Sharpie pens!

I ended up in A&E almost two weeks ago, only to be fobbed off with a referral back to the CMHT which could take 14 days. That is up on Monday 18th. I have been desperate to speak to / contact my old CPN who I have not seen after I was discharged 2 years ago.

I just want to die. There is a rainbow I need to follow and at the end of it my mum and my dogs will all be waiting for me. There has to be a better place that the one I am currently living in."
1690,"Okay so hello again! 
I am currently trying to sleep I have only slept 1.5 out of the last 30 hours because I had to help my aunt drive to her house in Texas (I live in North Carolina. I drove 13 out of 18 hrs). My boss (cousin) still expects me to be accepting calls for work. People are calling and yelling at me. I am about to flip out and have an anxiety attack. 
The upside is my aunt is helping me curb reckless spending by letting me shop from her closet. 😀 the bad part is that I have to get some sleep before I leave at 3:30am tomorrow morning to go all the way back home 🤦🏾*♀️ 

What do I do??? I haven’t started any kind of medication yet I’ve only just been diagnosed."
1691,"I am worried about his health he buys dvd box sets and records them onto blank Dvds constantly all day everyday. He sleeps on the sofa.
He also flushed rubbish down the toilet instead of putting it in the bin.
He also pauses the washing machine.
He sleeps on the sofa.(and he steals money from anyone to buy his dvds)"
1692,"Hello I am new here but I need to rant a bit for my first post so I will.

I have Bipolar 1 / Schizo-affecitve (had both diagnosis) and recently I am living back at home for a week or so now after suffering a bad manic episode, which peaked in unwillingly consuming spice and having a fit due to it (Spice is synthetic weed and can be 100 times more potent)... So long story short I was doing ok for 2 year and I screwed up a bit so I'm back home.

Thing is though, my Mum is doing her usual 'lets make you feel guilty for being ill whilst also piling on as much artificial non-existent pressure as possible to make you feel ever worse' routine. Might sound harsh but let me give you a few examples to give context -  

I had a bill to pay for drog a cig near a tube stop in London for which my parents were going to pay, I was on the phone for a while and started getting a bit frustrated and swore a bit, so she kicks me and starts having a go at me for swearing. This one wasn't so bad but was a bit grating..

She keeps on barging into my room and complaining about the most inane shit ever -and she blows it all out of proportion, so me leaving a kitchen light on for 5 mins when I left the room becomes an angry lecture on why I am such a failure and how it costs dad money blabla, and her face might as well be red like a demon when she goes on about this, this is after I have apologised multiple times.

Oh she also wakes me up at 8am in the morning and forces me up regardless of how tired I am, despite the fact I am on 10 mg of abilify, which can make mornings difficult, to say the least. 

I recently worked on a logic / maths problem in computer science and produced a paper on it (not a joke, a serious mathematical / logic problem ) I told her this and her first response was I was being delusional and had I taken my pills i.e she doesn't value anything I value or take it seriously and like with a lot of my family they see me as some sort of delusional loon, despite the fact a lot of what I produce is just outside of their comfort zone or not their areas of knowledge i.e art / computer science, therefore in their eyes it is useless I imagine...

I could produce more examples, but basically she is the classic overbearing OCD mother with serious control issues, if I put one tiny thing out of place she becomes this demon women and despite the multiple times I have tried to create dialogue over my illness she is like a closed book and seems to have some deluded protestant notion that if I just work hard and wake up early at 8am everyday that I will be ""normal"". It is enormously frustrating and having had a job interview today for work in the city and if I get it I'm out of here straight away because she is a nightmare to live with.  I mean she is my Mum so she has her good days but when she is like she is now, she actually makes my depression about 10 times worse and more ingrained, and actually bloody re-affirms it sometimes with how she acts. 

Anyone have any experience with this or advice on how to move forward, tried talking about it (blank or no response/ denial) sending documentaries / info (no response or denial again) so I'm honesty at the point of giving up with her, we couldn't be more different, I'm quite left of center in my politics, and she is a proper uptight Tory, often with borderline racist or uninformed / ignorant views that come from The Daily Express or the Mail (I'm British)

If she wasn't my Mother we would probably never even communicate because we have more or less nothing in common. It's a bad thing, we were getting on better when we not forced to live under the same roof, so hopefully this sheff job comes up and I can get out asap (just had an interview for a web dev job and my mate has a room going for 200 a month)"
1693,I'm looking for someone that understand what bipolar is. That we can share our feeling together. Please make me your friend. I need motivation to go on with my life
1694,"So basically I'm on here because I've come to realise there maybe something up with me.. short story I won't go in to detail.. basically o go through periods of happiness ok with life etc then I'll go through a period of being pissed off constantly not happy in life no motovation, I'll then go through a period of bein really down which comes with paranoid behaviour and in my lows I tend to drink to feel ok.. Each of these periods can last weeks or months and Its almost like I know it's coming but nothing I can do to stop it. Does this make any sense at all? I've taken numerous of online tests every one of them say high chance of bipolar I don't know though.. before you ask yes friends and family see it. Thanks"
1695,"Hello! 👋🏽 I’m new here and I kinda just want someone to talk to. It’s kinda long but here goes. 
I was diagnosed Bipolar as a kid, but I had two doctors change my diagnosis to PTSD. Now I have a doctor that I adore and trust and she has told me that I am a classic picture of it, and I’ve begun to see exactly what she is talking about. I feel like I’m losing control of myself and my life, and I spend all day trying to remind myself that my life and I am exactly the same as I was before the diagnosis.
 I am just not handling this as well as everyone thinks. I always want to cry and I am terrified that I will never be able to achieve my goals (I want to become a doctor) because of the stigma behind mental health. I feel like less of a person and like I have no control over myself. Like I have never really had control over myself. I feel like this is probably the primary reason I am getting a divorce, although I could never put my finger on it. I feel like everything is my fault... 
This is all overwhelming and I feel like I have no one to talk to about it who understands where I’m coming from. I haven’t even told most of my family, and the ones that I have told act like they never heard me or downplay it. I am terrified and also mildly relieved that some of my more serious mistakes aren’t entirely my fault..."
1696,"Hi to everyone,

I am new to all of this. Recently I have been diagnosed with cyclothymia and I am kinda struggling how to tell other people.

 I live in a country, where mental health is really stigmatized. You have depression? Suck it up, you are a man! You have BPD? You are lunatic who belongs to the asylum. So in this environment, I live in. And my family is the same... 

I have had a female friend (i am 26yo male), she knew something is off with me, so I told her. She was ok with it until she experienced firsthand how my mood swings work. We were going to be a ..how to put it, more than friends. but after this, she told me she wants to be only friends. So you can tell, I am not sure if or how to tell people whats going on. My family doesn't know. At work, they know something, but I am leaving soon, I have got perfect job in the similiar field (IT consulting), for a big corporation and I am a little afraid how they will react when (if) they discover my condition. 

I am highly functional most of the days, during work hours, but after that...at home, where I am alone, the hell begins. 

Sorry for a little chaotic message, my head hurts as **** and I have a hard time to concentrate, and English is not my first language, so please forgive me.

What would I like to know from more experienced you...how to tell people? Almost no one knows what cyclothymia is, so should I go with ""milder BPD""? I feel its little insensitive to people with real BPD...but analytically speaking, cyclothymia belongs to bipolar disorders family, so I don't know... 

and...what do you do when you have a day when your moods swing like a pendulum, every hour different mood? it's really exhausting.

Thank you very much! I wish the productive day to all!"
1697,I have recently come out being hospitalized long story short I think I was wrongly diagnosed my doctor thinks I’m post traumatic stress but my psychiatrist is awful I’m sure she hates me she said I had bpd and doesn’t listen to me. Anyway she put me on quetiapine and I get chest pains and it makes me feel physically ill I tried to stop it but withdrawal was awful I couldn’t stop being sick and I couldn’t get out of bed I was sweating and my stomach killed do these symptoms ever go because Im on my second day of not taking it and I’ve had no sleep I will not go back on it though to my opinion its a dangerous drug I have taken anti depressants for years but quetiapine has been awful for me!
1698,"In November I moved from Colorado to California. Hubs had moved 2 months prior to get an apartment, etc. I hate it here.  I don't have any friends. I can't find a job. I don't really get along with my stepdaughters (they grew up here while hubs and I were in Colorado). I don't drive much because I have panic attacks.  I don't do highways at all, not even in Colorado, so my travel is limited.  We have no money because my hubs also can't find a job (he's physically limited), so we are incredibly broke. We've had to file bankruptcy.  We live with my 29 year old stepdaughter and her 2 year old. The baby is the only bright point to this move. My stepdaughter is dirty. It looks like a tornado hit her room every day, and her bathroom is disgusting. Hubs gets on her all the time, and she's slowly getting better. A nephew by marriage lives here, and he is the most annoying, lazy person I've ever lived with. He decided he didn't want to work anymore, so he just stopped until hubs said he had to leave, then suddenly he started working again.  All he does is smoke weed. He pays a little rent, but contributes nothing to the house.  

It's been an overall bad experience here.  I feel incredibly lonely and isolated.  Since the middle of December I have been depressed. A week ago or so it got really bad and I thought about checking into a hospital, but didn't.  What goes down must go up, and now I'm getting manic.  My pdoc appt wasn't until April 13, so I called my insurance to see what my options are for immediate care.  I called two days in a row, and got transferred, calls dropped, got about 6 different phone numbers, all wrong, and one message saying the behavioral health department closed at 5.  It was 4:30. Finally got to a department that I thought, now I'll get some help with that.  The woman I talked to was horrible. She wasn't helpful at all, and had an attitude.  She said if I wanted a sooner appointment then my primary doc would have to request another referral, then I would have to wait to see if there was a appointment available that was less than 6 weeks.  I was livid and told her that she obviously didn't know about the availability of psychiatrists because they all have a huge wait.  She gave me more attitude, and I gave some back, I have to admit.  Very frustrated.  As I was hanging up I called her a stupid b*tch.  I guess I didn't hit the button fast enough because she called back and asked what I said to her.  I really wanted to say, I didn't stutter, you heard it right.  But I didn't.  Hubs said, you'd better be careful or we're going to have the police at the door hauling you away.  Uh huh, I
 didn't threaten anyone. On top of that I got an SSDI review request in the mail, so I have to worry about that while trying to get care.  So more stress I don't need. 

Omg I can't stop talking.  Yup, definitely getting manic.  Anyway, what do you consider to be an acceptable wait time for services?  I was thinking about checking myself in before it gets too bad and I something I'll regret because the new appt I was able to schedule is still 12 days away.  I'm frustrated. I'm thinking about going to the hospital anyway."
1699,How do you find it as a mood stabilizer? I have been on it around one year and it is not going good. I am on a low amount out of choice and considering upping the amount. It'd take months to see the psychiatrist so I am relying on my regular doc.
1700,"I feel left behind entirely. The Bipolar and physical health issues have robbed me of feeling connected with the world I live in. I feel like so much of my life has been dominated by mental sickness. Leading to an unproductive and mostly pointless life. I sometimes wonder if I am just lazy? I don’t know how to accept this or even be okay? I don’t know what it is to be normal because I have never had it. The bipolar is so cruel. It is like building a house only to smash it down over and over again, like sisyphus’ boulder. Unsurprisingly I feel like I am in hell."
1701,Hi everyone this is my first post here and I'd really appreciate any feedback. Ever since I was 20 (I'm 28 now) I've been different. Without going in too much detail let's just say I had a relationship breakdown and I had my first manic episode. After my first manic episode I basically became mute for a while I wonder if this was catatonia. I wasn't suicidal but I literally would shut myself in my room not talking to anyone for a very long time. I eventually became communicative again and a bit more functional but I don't think my personality fully returned. Nowadays I always tell myself I'm a loser but I always try and think desperately what to do to change. I have zero confidence these days. I don't really get episodes I just feel all the time that I'm a loser. Even when I'm not thinking about it if someone asked me if I was a loser I'd say yes. I have no life also I literally listen to music all day and don't work. I'm sensitive and lack social skills such as being assertive. I have some other symptoms such as lack of concentration and whenever I try and do something new I give up. I always cancel plans with people especially if I don't know them well/at all. It feels like im slowly isolating myself because im down to one. I haven't made a new friend since all this happened. I've known this guy since school and I'm really worried with my mum having cancer and my friend count going down I'll be left a lone in the world. I have very little motivation to do much. I want to work but whenever I get a job if something goes wrong or someone's not happy with me I just leave. Oh yeah and I'm REALLY negative I'm always putting myself down all the time. I make constant threads online about myself and my problems. I wish I was as good at talking about this as I am some other things. I give such detail about this topic but a conversation about anything else is short lived usually. I have bad low self esteem but just wondering if it sounds like I have depression also? Like I said i don't really have episodes of feeling down. I just constantly have an underlying feeling of being a loser and I spend more time thinking than doing anything. I've had some major manic episodes but never really discussed depression with a professional. They're not even prescribing me antidepressants I have explained to them how I feel and they seem to think I have anxiety though and they diagnosed me with bipolar
1702,"i am struggling beyond belief. To the outside world no one understands the torment. The skin irritation when any material or human touches me i feel this rage burning in me. i can't stand being victimised being told frequently by one parent that had i spoken up at a younger age about his abuse to me they would have protected me. its all out in the open now and they still take his side.  they still maintain contact with him and expect me to be fine. i was used to "" normal"" which was keeping quiet and never revealing what he did to me. Now I have and all to do with him is over, the rest of the family downplay what he did. He walks free now an ""innocent man"" . The medication helps me to be a happy and successful go getter to the outside world. This inner self, the small girl who kept quiet for years is remerging. pushing herself away from everyone. i physically cannot stand family speaking to me, even the slightest random question makes me hate them. My friends are my everything and so is my partner. I don't want them to know how bad it is again. How bad my mental turmoil is, that sounds other than silence infuriate me, that i hate being around people yet my self-taught mask remains high  in public. They can't discover how much i truly do not care anymore, that everything is trivial to me. That the small inner girl who protected me for years is not safe in such a grown up world. That my mask will be up and worn forever because i cannot possibly admit to those closest to me that i am really struggling to cope for too many reasons i cannot comprehend. i know for certain it's not what he did to me that hurts. It's that he is still a tolerant human to so many around me, they remind me of this daily. It's like i am to forget it all and tolerate him again. There is only so much therapy one can take. if only i could trust anyone, someone to let my guard down too. my inner self used to be with me comfortably. Now she is coming out with a vengeance and i am fighting her back down. She can't be exposed. If she is I'll be weak all over again."
1703,"A couple of people who read Gledwood Vol 4 (new main blog) have remarked that my manic-type phases seem to coincide with full moons but I never took them seriously. 
Then I realized I DO get uncannily restless around the full moon, only when this does happen, the full moon has just passed. So the moon is technically waning. (You'd think a waxing moon was more associated with hypo/mania... wouldn't you? At least, I would...) 
Then I realized that, just as highest high summer usually comes AFTER the solstice, it actually MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE that my restless highs should occur AFTER the moon's fullest point. (Something inside me has been waxing with the moon ~ and even though the moon begins to wane, I carry on waxing...) 
Sometimes I do just feel restless and a bit hyper at this time of the month... Other times I have gone into week-or-so-long hypomanic episodes. (And worse...)

HAVING SAID ALL THIS, the most extreme psychotic mania of my life kicked in on Monday 17 January 2011 (as hypomania). The previous day, Sunday 16 January, I had been depressed and very listless. And hearing voices. (IE: Psychotic BEFORE the mania...) On the Tuesday 18 I was paranoid and extremely irritable. And hearing voices again...

On the Wednesday I was uncontrollably excited, hallucinating auditorily and visually. And got ""dragged into a mental hospital"" (by the leader of a dual diagnosis group I used to go to). To her great horror they LET ME GO (I didn't want to stay anyway. But I did want an assessment of my extreme moods, because at this point there was no official diagnosis except ""depression""...)

Over the next few days, I became so manic I was completely incoherent. Didn't know what was going on. And would definitely have got sectioned if any doctor had seen me in that state (as my own psychiatrist was to tell me shortly afterwards...)
Anyway I've just found out WEDS 17th JAN 2011 WAS A FULL MOON.
wow

anyway, YOUR STORIES, PLEASE!:rofl:

+ WHAT IS IT about the moon that's doing the influencing? Today's researchers seem hung-up on the idea of increased light levels (as if we manic-depressives can't afford decent curtains)... I think it's magnetic and nothing to do with light. Otherwise I'd be manic 365 days of the year as I nearly always sleep with the lights on!

Also: does anybody, unipolar or bipolar, get DEPRESSED in time with the moon?... if so, which times (full, new, whatever...)"
1704,"I do this and I do that... it often feels so very self indulgent

I know I am indisdinct...

1705,"Depression, psychosis and lack of memory. Have you ever experienced this?

Hello.
I've been recently diagnosed as bipolar. I decided to go to a psychiatrist due to a severe depression accompanied by hallucinations (it was then when he gave me the diagnosis). 
I was having a rough depressive season and then, I started watching things. For example, I was walking around my house and suddenly I would watch a little and fast animal flying/walking beside me. Then I started watching these things more often and more clearly; a few weeks later I wouldn't see a little animal but another person's face in the mirror. It was getting worse day by day. 
It stopped about one month after the first ""vision"", but now I'm having real struggles with my memory and my concentration; I'm not able of keeping information, I can't concentrate and I feel really disoriented. I'm completely failing at college right now and it drives me crazy. 
My psychiatrist says that these are the consequences of a nasty depression season, and he says once my depression is gone, I'll get my ""memory"" back. 
I just wonder if any of you have ever experienced anything like this!! I would appreciate to read your experiences and it would help me to understand this whole (new and unknown for me) disorder. Thanks :inlove:
PD: Sorry if my spelling or redaction is not ok, since English is not my mother language and now with these issues, it's really hard to me to write in English."
1706,"We are both 49. He has bipolar, I have general anxiety disorder. We are both committed to taking our medication. We've been together for 9 months. He's been a challenge, but he's aware of his faults related to his bipolar...which unfortunately is a huge trigger for my anxiety...but so far he is worth the struggle. I recently subjected him to a drunken melt down. This is not something I frequently do...I've been very very stressed at work resulting in severe anxiety. Obviously my meltdown triggered his bipolar...jeeze what a pair! He said some very mean things to me, but admitted he was ""over the top"" with his use if words. I was gentle with him despite my hurt, guilt and feelings of extreme anxiousness. Initially I thought we were done, but over the past few days he has been mellowing out slowly. Having anxiety Im obsessing that we are over. I know I need to give him space, but sadly when I am in my distraught anxious state he's what I need.  Are we a lethal mix? Help me understand bipolar...and what I should and should not tolerate..and what I can do to make him feel at ease?"
1707,"Sleeping and taking medication. Trying to eat a balanced diet and look after myself. Washing and ironing. Buying food, eating it and taking the rubbish to the bins."
1708,"Please no over the top responses, as this will start messing with me and causing panic at the slightest symptom. Just objective, sound, scientific, fact-based answers only please. Thank you in advance!!

I am fairly skinny- I weigh about 115 lbs and am around 5’9” to a maximum 5’10”. I also do not eat much because I have a gastrointestinal disorder. 

Currently, I am taking 900 mg of Lithium. My doctor told me I need to know the warning signs if it isn’t sitting well because there is a very fine line between a dose being therapeutic or toxic for an individual. I fear toxicity because I fear fatal sickness and death as I feel I will go somewhere worse when I die.

Anyway, lately, I have begun exercising. Because I don’t weigh or eat much, I started losing weight. I have issues with self-hatred and it eats at me; it absolutely ravages my heart. It is an unspeakable pain. One day while I was out in public, I looked in a mirror- I looked thinner, older, a bit worn out, but I liked myself!! I liked what I saw and I felt a sense of control over my life. I’ve been continuing to eat very little only to burn off more than I’ve taken in in a day. My goal is to go down to 105 and stop! I would then work to maintain that weight. I know this seems unhealthy, but if it will help my self-esteem, it is worth it.

My only concern is I am going to accidentally kill myself with these behaviors because the dose of Lithium that is normally therapeutic will now become dangerous due to the body changes.

Am I making a fatal error or is it just a not so healthy one? Can I continue to take my Lithum even if I weighed 105 or even 100? Thank you!"
1709,"Hello...
 Maybe you read my other thread about feeling like a failure.. I want to discuss something that is also a big part of my chaos mentally. That is my overwhelming confusion about God... Now, I read the forum rules and I do not intend to bash religion or convert anyone one way or another, I just need help getting as close as human being can speculate answers...
 The thing is, part of my bipolar, a big part of it really is  being so damn back and forth with my religion.. I haven taken to blaming God for everything for many years of my life... So much so that the blame induced hatred I had for him started as Satanism from when I was about 14 and lasted until I was about 23 but I still feel the overehelming darkness about me now at 27.. I have always floated in and out of the idea that God gave me this mental illness as a means of his amusement, and he keeps me from going anywhere and walls me off from any form of success and he just downright can't stand me for whatever reason.. In my heart though, its screams that none of this is true...
 Honestly when I let go of the hatred and the belief that God is just an evil, sociopathic being, I cannot deny the calmness I feel... Like he is trying to say ""dude, its okay. Quit freaking out and hating me and everything else. I only wanna help."" And I know that is probably true, but next up here is where the distrust comes from and where I need help understanding things if anyone here reads this and thinks they may be able to explain it...
 In this world, we have priests that molest children... We have these random religious cults that molest little girls and they use God to try and justify it... We've got war over people not believing in him the same exact way as one another... And there are people that will go on random killing sprees and say that God's voice was in there head telling them to do it... So my question is how can God be good? 
 I am not trying to stray anyone or shake their faith... I want to believe that God is good and that he wants to help.. I need to... But all this crap in the world has so many arrows pointing to the sky that it is making me struggle to find this closure... My new therapist is a decon at a church and was saddened to hear that I thought God was evil, but he pretty much offered his sevices up as a spiritual councelor as well as mental if I wanted so I know he can help a great deal too, but I guess ultimately everyone has just had their own experiences with this mysterious diety and I really need to try and look at this from as many positive angles as I can to try and see clearly and relieve God from all of this hatred so I can start letting him help me and stop feeling like he is only hindering.... Thanks.."

1711,"Hello, I just joined...
With this site keeping things completely confidential, this just seems appropriate right now... I am seeing a new therapist as of last Friday, and it seems like this one may actually be of help, but right now its Sunday and I don't have an appointment until Tuesday and I feel like shit... Hope you guys don't mind swearing...
 Here is the thing... I am 27 years old and I am back again at my mom and stepdad's homestead for like the third time... Its going on like 3 years now this time.. My mom has always had to put up with my drama because its like I just don't even know how in the hell to face the world... I have never been able to hold a job... I have always had to either mooch off of friends or my mother... I have been on and off all kinds of different medication and currently I am taking none at all... 
 My mind is chaos... I live day to day not knowing if I am going to wake up and be normal or if I am just going to fall apart for the thousandth odd time and wish death upon myself becuase Idk how the hell to live my life... I have always taken to staying in and playing video games and watching movies over actually trying to get out and accomplish something becuase I simply feel like I just don't know how... I am afraid to trust people becuase every time I do, my fair nature gets taken advantage of and I am used...
 So here I am living in a quarters on my stepdad's property, who I don't even like yet he has had to pull my weight over his back off and on for the past 8 years and especially the past 3 becuase when it comes to the real world it seems that I can't tell my own ass from a hole in the ground... I have a problem with authoritive figures pounding their chests at me, so when I get a job, I lose it as soon as the power-tripping asshat of the facility reveals himself... 
 For the longest time, I smoked marijuana to try and balance myself out. I thought it was helping, but it probably never was... I have recently as of about a week ago had to forfeit smoking it becuase I could no longer bare the harsh allergy to the stuff I have... I smoke and then it comes out my pours and makes me itch.. Then it finally got to a point I smoke and I just physically feel like shit.. Honeslty I just need a vent... Amd maybe someone to tell me its okay and they have been there too.. Idk.. Thanks"

1717,"Hi all,

I have recently been diagnosed with bipolar with mania. I have had two episodes of psychotic breaks, one in 2013 and one on 12/24/2017. I have been trying to better understand bipolar with mania by researching through credible resources (mostly the DSM), and I truly feel that Brief Psychotic Disorder better describes my experiences. So my question for everyone with bipolar and mania is: How long do your manic episodes last and can you please describe what your episode is like? The first time I had mine, I was mostly just scared because I had racing thoughts and was highly confused. I have never gone through emotional highs and lows throughout this and my episodes have both lasted for a few days. Can anyone shed light on this? Also, how do talk to your doctors if you think you have been misdiagnosed?"
1718,"Hi my names holly I'm 21 and a mum of one, I've always had issues with my head I've always been very emotional but I had a rough upbringing, I've recently come upon a issue that started when I was young and now I can't bare it, when I was 12/13 I started seeing people who couldn't possibly be there walking down the street or stood smiling at me, people from films, old memories of people I don't know or have met once or twice, then slowly it stopped, as I got older every now and then t would start to happen but they got closer to me and clearer to see, then it stoped again and now as it's progressed over the years I'm seeing people from movies delivering things to my door, and someone has delivered a person I'm just seeing there face wrong! And now I walked my dog tonight and the terrorist from my girl walked past me and smiled right in my face, also I'm having panic attacks all the time for no reason and I have to talk myself down from the panic attack like I'm in someone else's body on auto pilot I don't feel like myself I'm always dizzy and confused and it's effecting my whole life now and it's not stopping!

1720,"hi 
i started to notice that sometimes i get very excited all of a sudden then my excitement drop very low with despair .

when i feel excited and energetic i plan to read a huge amount of books/articles ,plan stuff at home but this doesn't last and then i feel desperate and emotionally blocked from everything 
this happens quite often and it follows with several days of feeling down .

so i wonder if i am having bipolar disorder or what?  

ps: i used to have OCD and i recovered several years ago ,is this relevant?  
ps2: i am having anxiety these days too."
1721,"Hello world.

Well, I just felt a strange compulsion to share with anybody who's interested what tends to take the sting out of suffering from cyclothymia.

As well as the usual tips of eating a reasonably healthy diet, getting regular exercise, taking care of your sleep patterns, reducing sugar intake (proven links to depression) and avoiding drugs and alcohol, I've found a few more things that tend to help.  These things seemed to work for me but I can't say they will work for everybody.

A big thing that helped me was taking ayurvedic herbs.  These are herbs used in traditional Indian medicine as I'm sure some of you are aware.

I take Bacopa Monnieri extract and Ashwagandha both twice a day.  It takes around 4-6 weeks for any effect to be felt and I think 10-12 weeks for the full effect.  It is subtle but it seems to have created a 'buffer' zone whereby I don't go as 'low', and as often as I used to before regularly taking it.  I still get down and depressed but nowhere near as bad as I have been.

I also sometimes take CBD oil which is legal (in my country at least) and derived from cannabis.  It has just about zero THC content (which is responsible for getting people high and 'trippy' but some say also has healing properties).  The CBD part is the theraputic compound which alot of people say helps them with all kinds of problems including pain, anxiety, skin conditions and a whole host of other things.  I take it when I feel a bit too low or stuck in a low patch for too long.  It most times seems to help but again can be quite subtle.

And lastly, learning to love myself and treat myself with the same compassion, tolerance and understanding that I can show others (sometimes complete strangers).  I used to hear people say 'you need to learn to love yourself' on TV programmes and other places and to be honest I used to roll my eyes and think 'what a load of nonsense'.  Until fairly recently. When it really dawned on me and made quite a difference.  It kind of took the edge of some of the horrible feelings and gave me a bit of room to breath, relax and recoup slightly, I dunno.  Again, can be quite subtle but also quite powerful at the same time.

I've basically had problems of this nature since I was 17 and now lets just say I'm way beyond that age.  I must have tried absolutely everything out there over the years except regular meds (except for a short stint on SSRI's)(I also have a prescription in my drawer from 3 years ago for lamotrigine that I never followed up).  Hypnotherapy, chinese herbal medicine, talking therapies, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, acupuncture, reiki, pretty much you name it and I've tried it.  The three things I've listed are the most effective, at least for me.

Oh and meditation, or even just sitting in a chair for half an hour each day with no distractions of any kind really helps me.  Sometimes I drift off, sometimes I'm able to concentrate and focus and train my mind, often times its a mix of the two.  I see it as a daily 'reset' of the stress levels in the body which can accumulate often without us realising.  A big help for me.

Anyway, sorry, I seem to have rattled on somewhat.  I just wanted to let people know of my experiences and maybe give some pointers if people are searching for advice.  Have a look, do some of your own research and follow your instincts.  It may work for you.

Thanks."
1722,"Hello all.
Well, where to start?

My partner (currently ex-partner) got sectioned about 4 weeks ago. I was with her for about 7 months and she told me she was bipolar and had been sectioned twice. (About a year between episodes). She was taking meds and although she went through periods of being down, seemed quite stable. Her family live at the opposite end of the country and have been through this twice with her before. (She can be very abusive and difficult and her family were exhausted at the thought of going through this again as they also see the situation as having been avoidable if she took greater care of herself). So theres only really been me to try to be there for her.

Since it happened I have tried my best to advise her to take better care of herself (sleep, no cannabis, avoid excessive caffeine and sugar especially nearing night time). She just doesnt get it fully. Last time I was with her she was telling me she wasnt eating and was survivng on coca cola and caffeine through the day. She said that she feels better this way. I think she wants to be as close to the manic state as possible. She's on different meds now (lithium) from previously but they haven't reached the desired dosage yet.

I've tried my best to be supportive but it seems so pointless if she isn't going to help herself. We have argued a good few times because its so frustrating that she doesnt help herself. Recently, after another argument she breaks up with me. So, I still don't want to let her down - I want to offer her support as a friend. A few nights ago she invited me to her house (she had been granted home leave for the weekend). I go. She seems okay, if not slightly down but alot better than I've seen in a little while. We are sat playing backgammon while she has food in the oven. Anyway, at some point she states the oven has been turned down. I don't even comment. Then after a few minutes she asks if I can leave after the game has ended. All calmly. I say calmly that of course I can leave. Im just thinking she wants time on her own. I then say, ""is it because of the oven thing"" meaning has it spooked her out. She then explodes and accuses me of deliberately turning down the oven (when I popped into the kitchen) and pretending not to have in order to play mind games or screw with her mind or something. She demanded I leave and was so convinced of it that it was impossible to reason with her. I had to shout to be heard as she was very angry and I literally could hardly find a gap to speak. So I argue and shout back and the argument continued as I was gathering my belongings to leave and protesting my innocence but she simply would not accept it.

I was so angry at being accused of this and of being accused of being controlling and manipulative that I was glad to never go back to see her again. Now I've had a couple of days to think I still feel like I can't just walk away and let her down (just as a friend). Right through all of this I have tried to see past it and not take it personal but its hard sometimes when things like this happen. In the heat of the moment I shouted at her to ""never speak to me or even look at me again"". I was just so frustrated and had had enough and let the whole bizarre situation get the better of me. I should have been calm. I'm certainly no angel and have my own issues.

So now I don't know whether to just leave it all alone or to try to contact her again (if she'll speak to me) to see how she is. I still care about her and feel I a certain loyalty to be there for her. I feel a bit guilty even though I was the one accused of this bizarre situation.

Please offer any advice. I'm struggling a bit with my own mental health right now. (I'm cyclothymic and prone to depression.)

This and other forums have been a real help in understanding things and even just getting this all out has probably helped a little.

Thanks, I'd really appreciate a different perspective on things.

She's a really smiley, caring and compassionate person whens she is stable. Full of love. Its just when she's been sectioned after an 'episode' and the fallout after that she can be difficult and sometimes abusive. Especially when trying to confront some of her behaviours that are not helping. I have also seen very 'sensitive' traits in her even when she's stable though. i.e. things effecting her that wouldn't neccessarily effect other people.

And blaming. I have had a few occassions when I've thought I was going mad and had to question my own reality. Arguments that seemed obviously to originate from her but rather than admiting responsibilty it would get turned around onto me. Again, I'm no saint but I don't have a problem taking responsibilty for something that is my fault and then moving on. Reading posts on forums like this one really helped me put that into perspective because it was starting to confuse me slightly.

I'm also wondering will she forever believe that I 'messed' with the oven or when she's feeling better will she likely understand that it was just her paranoid state of mind?

I've posted this on another forum but was really looking to gleen further advice from people with experience of both sides of this.

Thanks for your help."
1723,"I have recently been diagnosed with cyclothymia and have been taking antidepressents for it for a couple months now. At first it helped, I was taking gabapentin and wlbutrin xl 150 but after a month my depression came back like it was before the meds. Because of this they doubled my dose to 300 mg which made me feel completey out of control crazy. They also took away my gabapentin which actually really helped me. I got my dose back down and now have added a mood stablizer. I am having a hard time not being in tune with my body anymore. I always feel kind of weird and I don't know what's side effects and what's not anymore. My episodes seem to be getting less intense but I still feel like I don't know who I am anymore. I've been feeling incapable of doing a lot of day to day activities. I have been in a slightly manic state for about a week now so people are more pleased with me. Sometimes it seems like my bf likes me the most in this state because of my elevated mood. How long does it take to adjust to new meds? My mood does seem to be stabilizing but I also feel disconnected to reality a little bit and somewhat feel like I am having an identity crisis. I just want to understand what is going on in my body and my head."
1724,"I take enough antipsychotics to make a big scary thing forget all about itself...

cos?... it's like to me a monster with some diabolical intellect is just waiting and hiding in amongst my daytime and night-time stuff.

it's got thoughts ideas impressions and understandings that hurt to recognise...
but amongst the unmedicated or half medicated or just not enough medicated..

me!

am I me?

what is happening to what I told myself?

those comfortable conditions I gave myself to survive in?

suddenly it's all happening way to slow!

and a brand new addiction becomes the solution... to take to the maximum of whats indescribably possible.

and once achieved?..

is everything just way too loud? and the good and bad sounds are a permanent echo in my head.

and it's not even quarter way over yet not finished!

there are desperate memories of brilliance to over-ride the suicide...

reaching reaching I reach something whatever it is and decide to adopt it ...

could be every conspiracy on the planet to give me rest..

cos I don't trust the reality I am apparently here to experience..

and the INSTANT recovery is not essentially good for me...

like I discarded anything and everything that might just assist me.

to think otherwise than I do?

but manic depression is the worst thing to happen to a person who has anything less than flesh injuries or gunshots to the head!

for a bipolar person?
mania is real life
and medicated bipolar is something else

some kind of disaster

with the meds I hurt

without the meds I don't feel the pain

I am on the autism spectrum"
1725,"Hi everyone!
So I have bipolar disorder, social and generalized anxiety and mild OCD. 
I’m a junior college student studying clinical psychology and I’ve just been having a hard time believing I can get anywhere in life with my disorder holding me back. I’ve had trouble going to my classes, I keep feeling like I’m never going to make it in the real world and my depression has caused me to be extremely unmotivated to even do my work. I’m scared to start a new job this summer in the fear I’ll have an episode and get fired. I have to go to graduate school but I really feel like I won’t be able to keep up with the work and balance my mental health, working and school all at the same time since graduate degrees are such hard work. I’m just terrified of life in general. I was wondering if anyone else had ever felt this way and what you may have done to accomplish your goals, work, transition into adult life, etc?
Thank you for your time :)"

I’ve tried medications for acne that didn’t work, and two very strong ones that I could no longer take due to side effects.

Next week I lose interest in that and then get obsessed with experimenting on overdosing on certain drugs to see what the affects are like (delirious affects) while researching up a dozen threads of people doing them. Bought a punch and took em.

Week after that I lose interest in drugs and now get it into my head that I really am going to die this time. I start packing up my belongings in my room in black sacs, tell the therapist (who I no longer see) that I don't want anything to do with her, nor any of the services she was going to pass me along to. I write a note in my room and head to my destination but for other reasons I ""cancelled"" half way there. went home and acted normal. Said to myself I'll try tomorrow - unfortunately with this phase I've 'lost' the interest and am waiting for it to come back.

Or other times I'll probably just be obsessed with other things.

But yeah is this a normal thing that everyone goes through with depression with the jumping through phases? like they feel so real at the time yet I seem to jump through them and leave and hop to the next with no hassle.

1733,"Hi everyone. 

I’m not really sure which forum I should be posting this in as I don’t yet know what the issue is. However, I’m hoping you guys might be able to help.

I’ve suffered from low mood and negative thought patterns my whole life, and was diagnosed with anxiety about 6 years ago, which I still live with today. However, I’m now starting to think that there is more to it, and that I might have some form of personality disorder or bipolar even something else entirely.

I go through phases of getting obsessed with things and thinking about them (and nothing else) for days on end. I’m not even talked my about bad stuff though - at the moment, it’s holidays and travel. It’s not a normal way of thinking, though - a few weeks ago, on a Saturday, I was alone all day and spent sixteen hours straight comparing hotels for my next trip, even when there couldn’t possibly have been any more for me to find out about them. Throughout this, I wanted to stop but quite simply couldn’t - it just carried on, and on, and on. I’ve continued to obsess about this for the past month, and it’s getting to the point where it’s taking over from the second I wake up to the second I go to sleep.

Separately from this, I have never found a passion or even a hobby in life, really, and lose interest in things very quickly. For example, I’ve always enjoyed my current job, yet after a year and a half, I’ve suddenly and completely lost all interest and enthusiasm. I can’t pay attention to anything, inside or outside of work, and certainly can’t focus. Life often feels meaningless yet I’m at a loss as to how I can change this as no matter what I think I want, it never fulfills me in the way I’d hoped.

I’m not sure what you guys think, but I’d appreciate hearing from anyone who has experienced anything similar and found an answer.

Thanks in advance!"
1734,"I always have this Love/Hate relationship going on with pain.

Either I can love it 
It can be anywhere from very mild to quite moderate or even on the high side (it's hard for me to gauge pain as I would rather smile and hide it; even if I'm miserable than to tell anybody about it)

Or I can hate it and sometimes I feel like even though I don't mean to I might make a face that lets people know something is wrong (I've had people say I look really upset about something sometimes).

Or sometimes it starts as love and become hate when it lasts too long.

It's not like it's ever extreme enough to make me think something is actually wrong (outside of that 4 day stomach Ache)

And then I have times where I feel like I am in pain because I deserve it or did something wrong, and I've even had images of being in a relationship and telling my GF or w/e to hit me harder and how I deserve it; not in a kinky way, more like a straightforward meaning what I said way (i know the ""common""/typical abuse in relationships is usually Male to Female, not that it can't or doesn't happen other ways).

For the most part I have worked through my issues and I don't feel too depressed or manic, but in my life there always seems to be a time when life has to give me a wake up call and ruin my expectations to the worst possible outcome.

Really curious! Wondering what happens with your consciousness and where you go when you are in a comatose state. 

Then i go deeper and wonder what would happen if a psychedelic drug was added to the mix. They supposedly heighten the consciousness. Could a coma and psychedelics release your full subconscious potential? Where would it lead? 
Deeper again and i question alternate realities etc. 

Its not the first time my mind has wandered to these places. It wanders there quite often as it is all stuff i am genuinely interested in. Only sometimes i get so absorbed (like i feel now) and it leads to almost being my main thoughts and hours and hours of research. 

For the record i do not take drugs, or even drink. I have never tried a psychedelic drug.

I was just going bed and put my head on the pillow to go sleep and I had all these negative feelings then the tears started. I closed my eyes and I imagined i was a million miles away. But it felt so lonely and if was dark but I couldn't get myself out of this place. No matter how hard I tried.

I have been under so my pressure with work I'm scared it's bringing back memories I thought had dissapeared. I am a relationship counsellor and I'm scared I'm going to get ill again. I want to run but I have nowhere to hide. 

I have protected myself these last few years by pretending my past didn't happen that I have recovered but soon as something stresses me out I feel I slip back. I can feel it happening now. 

Sorry for long post."
1751,"Its weird. I haven't been having mood swings really in some time. I mean yeah there's the occasional polar shift, but by and large I've really only been having schizophrenia symptoms. I guess that's proof enough that I'm schizoaffective bipolar and not just schizophrenic. I take 50mg of lamotrigine daily and it seems to help but here lately whether its stress or something else I'll have huge mood swings and be all over the place. Suicidal one minute then laughing hysterically the next. Fuck."
1752,"I have been doing pretty good. But sometimes I think I would do better if I didn't have any faith at all. It seems to keep failing me. And I am so confused by my failing faith.

I know a few things are hurting my chances of feeling good.... the fact that is it bitterly cold, Christmas is over, my best friend is away (yay she comes back Sunday), homeschooing has been tough (my kids are inside so much because it is so cold), i can't seem to get enough sleep so I am tired...

Its like a perfect storm. 

I am so not motivated. I wish I had a fireplace to sit in front of and just stare at the flames covered in a warm blanket. Though would I be motivated enough to light a fire....maybe not 

Just feeling a bit low and alienate right now..."
1753,"I moved from Colorado to California 2 months ago. Things have been very hard for us here. My husband hurt his back and can barely function.  He can't really work much. He is hostile at times which makes him very hard to live with. He is extremely passive aggressive so most of the time I just want to lock myself in the bedroom.  I can't find a job. I've applied to dozens of places and I haven't gotten a single interview. I have to be careful where I work because it can't be too stressful or I'll start cycling. I don't have any fiends or family here. I feel incredibly trapped as I don't have anywhere to go.  There's no one I can stay with. I don't know how to find support here. I don't drive, and I don't know where anything is.  I just want to go back to Colorado but like I said, there's no on I can stay with. 

I guess I'm just venting, but I sure could use some words of encouragement of you have any."
1754,"I have had these throughout my life.
I had a serious car crash december last year.
3 weeks before the accident I had a voice telling me I would be involved in a serious car crash soon
I have had them before. Knowing somethings going to happen before it does doesnt freak me out but the knowing can be overwhelming. Its so strong It has made me take action that if i hadnt things could have ended in tragedy.
I know that someone could have passed away before i have found out. its really interesting it can be little things I will tell my husband then when it happens I will say to him..Well ...He will respond by saying..""I know, you told me"""
1755,I don’t know I’m this stupid to stick to this guy who I never love and is plain disgusting to me.

1757,"Hello,
 Never have spoken to anyone much about this sort of thing but when i hit a low it seems to always hit me when i find myself thinking.  I think back to all my old friends/relationships i have had in the past (i am 27 now) and why i have pushed them away either directly or indirectly.  My oldest friend of 12 years i removed and blocked, i just faded away on purpose and felt relief.  Or just not having enough will power to even try to maintain the relationship, it saddens me that i have let these once cherished things go. But as soon as i reestablish a relationship i still feel empty and just auto repeat.  I now don't even try to reestablish them at this point as its become such a cycle that its exhausting to try and combat. I once was a social outgoing person and now i'm a comfortable hermit.  It all started happening around 21 when my type 2 bi polar manifested.  Anyone else notice this pattern and any tips on helping combat it?

Thanks for reading my word dripple, take care :)"
1758,feel so low and can't really express my feelings to anyone.  I just keep saying I'm ok.  I see my shrink on Thursday so going to explain that I'm faking it right now and my thoughts of suicide are back.  I'm not making plans or anything just a lot of thoughsta nd visions of me doing it.
1759,"Hi you you all, thank you for having this place where anybody can look for help and advice

I have a situation with my wife I don’t know how to handle anymore. 

I love my wife, more than anything. She’s sweet and incredibly noble, been friends for almost two decades, five as a couple, two married. 

However lately she’s been having fits of mania, specially characterized by gaming addiction. This has been affecting her life: barely sleeping, bad mood if not playing, no motivation in her work. Every time I’ve tried to talk with her about it she gets extremely defensive yet she recognizes it’s a problem. She changes a couple of days just to come back with vengeance.

All her life she’s been taking meds to help her cope with anxiety and depression. She used to have schizoid episodes as teenager and young adult, later she was diagnosed with BD. Her first years she took a lot of meds but for the last 7 she’s been only on alprazolam for anxiety and Prozac for depression. 

I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know how to help her. Please, any advise will be welcomed."

1761,"Continuos muscle twitches after olanzapine and mirtazapine. Can it be tardive dyskinesia?

Hello everyone,
my name is Nicholas and I'm a 21 years old guy from Italy.
I suffered from chronic insomnia from the age of 15 and in mid-February 2017 was prescribed before bedtime the antidepressant mirtazapine at 15 mg and the antipsychotic olanzapine at 2,5 mg. I took them for 2 weeks without improvement. Therefore the psychiatrist increased mirtazapine at 30 mg and olanzapine at 10 mg. Now I believe that he thought I had bipolar disorder type 1 but I hadn’t any mental illnes.
I took olanzapine at 10 mg because I think was only a tranquilizer and because I trusted the doctor.
Olanzapine made me sleep for 13 hours but I was no longer myself. After 5 days I tried to split the tablet but it gave me a strange effect. So I continued for others 15 days at 10 mg because I really needed to sleep. Then in April 2017 I tapered olanzapine in 1 week because I could not live anymore like that. I took it for a total of 48 days.
After this I reduced mirtazapine to 15 mg and 1 week later I stop cold turkey. At that time I took the benzodiazepine brotizolam at 0,25 mg for 2 weeks to help me sleep.
The withdrawal symptoms were terrible for 4 months and I have not been the same anymore.
When I was on mirtazapine and olanzapine I had eyelids fasciculation 2 or 3 times per day. When I quitted olanzapine the eyelids fasciculation ceased.
2 weeks after withdrawal from olanzapine and 1 week from mirtazapine I started to have frequently intermittent muscle twitching in the left thigh and occasionaly pulsating muscles in other parts of the body. After less than a couple of months they have decreased in frequency and intensity but didn’t stop completely. During this period I was forced to take the antidepressant sertraline and the benzodiazepine diazepam because for the new psychiatrist I had obsessive compulsive disorder with an obsession for the damage of antipsychotics. I did not have anything like that and could taper and withdraw after 3 months in July 2017.
Now I think maybe that the muscles twitching have diminished because diazepam is also a muscle relaxant.
In August 2017 I started to have continuous fasciculations in the legs when I lie down and less frequently when I sit while I never had them when I move. Few times a day I had pulsating muscles also in the arms and the trunc but never in the face. I never had muscle twitches in multiple parts of the body at the same time.
In September the muscles twitching moved for 1 week in the lower abdominals.
In October 2017 for 2 weeks the muscles twitches suddenly stopped in the legs and continued in the rest of the body about 10 times per day.
When the muscles twitching returned they were milder. Sometimes the fasciculations are so mild that when I looked at my calf I saw them without feel them. In the legs they have become more single rapid muscular contractions than pulsating muscles.
Soon after I started to have continuos pulsating muscle in my upper lip. The muscle twitch was very mild and lasted 2 weeks but after it I have sometimes pulsating muscle also in my face.
Do you think it is a tardive dyskinesia caused by olanzapine despite I haven’t involuntary body movements?
Do you think it could be some other side effect caused by olanzapine or maybe mirtazapine? It’s 8 months that I’ve it.
I have been visited by several psychiatrists and neurologists and everyone said it was just stress.
Even if I do not have the symptoms of tardive dyskinesia I do not know what else it could be: I’m not stressed and I do not suffer from anxiety, I do not take stimulants, I can sleep, I have had blood tests and I haven’t electrolyte imbalances or hypoglycemia, I did electromyography and had normal results.
The thing that worries me most is that there is a very large amount of medical literature that associates tardive dyskinesia with cognitive impairments.
If it were to be tardive dyskinesia do you think that the fact that for almost 2 weeks the muscles twitches had almost disappeared means that I am healing?
Thank you and greetings from Italy."
1762,"Hi guys and girls.
Just popping in to say hello, I have been diagnosed with BPD now for 12 years but to be honest with what happened all through  my childhood I have lived with it all of my life well most of from the age of 10, it was 12years ago I nearly had a breakdown as a lot of trauma happened to me in such a short period of time and all what I went through in my younger years came back to bite me on the ass big time,So  I have the condition quite severe and have tried all avenues, the doctors now say I cannot be treated anymore and I just have to stay on meds for the rest of my life, but I cannot function when I am on the meds it’s almost like I am comotose and drugged up, which messes up my whole life, now I have stopped taking the meds for the past 6 months and turned into a recluse that had no purpose or any outlook for the future, it’s getting to the point now I can feel myself becoming weaker which resulted in me attempting to take my life 5years ago, I just feel that I don’t want to be like this for much longer, I don’t want sympathy I just need to find some kind of help that I cannot seem to find. To be honest it’s only my 2old dogs that keep me going as they depend on me to feed them. I really don’t want to start the meds again and going through the 36hr sleeping patterns then 48 hr awake I cannot do that again.

I hope I haven’t bored you and thanks for your time. 

Regards and a Happy new year, Gary."
1763,but dose anything change?  I'm still ill. I'm still skint.  I still don't want to be me.
1764,"Hi everyone, how are you all? I have bipolar type 2 and am really struggling"
1765,"so its Friday and the psychiatrist comes round and has a review with everyone. It came to my turn and the first things out my mouth were "" I'm fine"". but he then came up about the fact that I am leaving to go home just after Christmas, and he is worried about me self harming and how I will cope with it. for example when its like midnight and theres no one I can call etc etc. now I have always spoken to someone before ( 9 times out of 10 this do not stop me) or after. I have been aked to write a list of things that have not stopped me but made the urges less strong in the past. and to tell him next week. I have a little list. things like music, drawing, masturbating (sorry). but other than that I'm a bit stuck. 
not only that I'm feeling the fear if living on my own and having to well LIVE as close to normal as I can get to :) . 

ANY TIPS WELCOME

I'm hoping he has a plan of action or some ideas , I do wish he told me right there and then. 
he said he likes it when people come to the answer themselves , 
which is kool of him really. 

if anyone has experience of coming out of hospital . please reply 

PEACE"
1766,"hello gang, I'm away for a couple of days from today... so just wanted to wish you all a safe new year.     please stay safe and take care."
1767,"struggling guys,  got into a situation yesterday which was stupid of me and its set me off......  very low today and  amini panic attack while out...  flat is a tip and no energy to do anything.  I'm supposed to be going away tomorrow but i'm close to cancelling.


how are you doing?"
1768,"Hello my name is Josh and I've occasionally have had these times where at night I snap and all of a sudden become really angry then right after I start crying and then it is like a mix of both, during this period when I am talking to people it brings out the worse in me and I find myself being very mean even towards someone I really like, when I try to stop feeling like this forcefully I suddenly cry and start breathing really quickly. One of my most significant mood swings is when I become really depressed this can last for a long time or a short time but I think that I might as well just end it here because hey whats the point. I am a calm and generally smiley person at day time but I have mood swings through out the day all the time and I cant help it, whenever i'm out with my friend who is a girl, which I like, I always think of the bad things that can happen and that she doesn't like me and that i'm too weird even though she has told me before she does likes me, I bottle my feelings up all the time I can say that and before you tell me I shouldn't ill just tell you that I cant simple as that, I don't know maybe its nothing or maybe view worded it wrong hopefully there's something."
1769,"Is there a word or term for when you go back and forth between hopeful (I'll even go as far to say ""euphoric""-ish) optimism/good mood and doubting upset ""suicide-y pessimism""..?  (I apologize I can't think of a more eloquent way to put it)

I know that it says Bipolar goes through mood swings and it'll be days or weeks, but what about when you go to those extremes in a day or it even happens multiple times a day? 
Is that even bipolar? 
Is there a word for this?"
1770,have good one :)
1771,"I texted my manager this morning  informing her of my absence. She like ""ok thanks"" asked her if she's in tomorrow, but no response. I think she's pissed off.

1772,"Hi my name is Dave and I was diagnosed with bipolar about 16 years ago. I was married for 13 years and it ended 5 years ago and I lost my health insurance. I haven't had any since so I haven't been taking any meds. Well I started having episodes and I'd never experienced one and I never heard of them before. Well the last 6 months  have been extremely stressful I mean one thing after another and it just hasn't stopped. I lost my job, I've had 3 family deaths in the last year and a half, my dad has Alzheimer's that is progressing very quickly, my partner has PTSD. I've been having a lot of episodes lately and my mood swings are uncontrollable and I don't know how to control them or cope with them. I'm lashing out at my partner and he's had his fill. Can someone help me by suggestion or pointing me in a direction to find answers or help please."
1773,"I've taken lamictal before, but when I tried taking it a couple of months ago, I was extremely restless and just felt like I couldn't sit still. I felt a lot better emotionally, but my body felt pretty uncomfortable. I've had horrible reactions on just antidepressants, in the past, also. 

I'm just wondering has anyone became manic or hypomanic on lamictal, and does it even count as a genuine episode? Or is it more substance related, and not a genuine episode?

The reason why I'm asking is because like a decade ago, I was only on anxiety medication and lamictal and had a really amazing time, for about a year and a half. I was extremely productive and felt better than I had ever felt before, in my life. I've never been able to feel that way again... Is that considered an episode, or maybe it was the medication?"
1774,"I always feel like someone is watching me, more like a group, usually around 3 people, they're not following me. They're just always watching me, almost like in the Hunger games where the judged see and control everything or the truman show, but with a few people.  they're onmipotent (they can do anything, and control my sorroundings) and omnipresent (they're everywhere). But, they're not omniscient, meaning they don't know it all, and sometimes I feel like I can trick them. 
I don't really have my identity sorted out, I feel like I'm always acting, but i can't really tell. 

I'm not sure what this means, i just want to know your opinion on what this might be. I went to therapy, for  3 months, but i never mentioned this, therapist told me I have depression. I don't take any sort of prescribed drug. In case it's relevant i'm 18, f."
1775,"Asking because I've withdrawn socially over the past year and a half. This was after a smear campaign that someone i had a falling out with started after i cut them off. I eventually got tired of having to counter the smearing so i just faded out. This didn't help my reputation since friends were hurt/angry that i just up and left.

Next is family, we've always been dysfunctional. I went no contact with my father over 10 years ago after i had to file a domestic violence complaint against him. Relatives had to help me with that as i was just 18 at the time.

My mother, who has lived and worked in another country since i was 11, only comes home once every 2 years. She is aware of the domestic violence complaint but has not confronted my father about it to my knowledge. Did not ask him to leave home and so i was the one who left. 

Our relationship has gotten strained over the last few years as i realized that my mother's seeming lack of involvement and her demands that i join the family (including my father) during family events post-abuse has given me the impression that she has been complicit this whole time. Or at least non-reactive - she let her brothers do the heavy lifting 
during and after the domestic violence complaint.

My siblings live away from me. They are close to my father and though i tried to rebuild my relationship with them a few years ago, that failed too. I left home again after my father visited one day - he was regarding me casually like the abuse never happened and that set me off. One of my siblings got furious because he thinks why couldn't I just get over it?

I have been at my job for almost 2 years now, but my colleagues and I work from home most days of the week, and so have not been able to establish a friendship outside of work.

I'm raising this because the therapist emphasized the need for a support system for treatment. She wants me to bring someone whom she can interview to make sure that i am taking meds, observe my moods, etc.

She also thinks that my perception of events might be skewed - that i might just think that my friends and family don't want me, when in fact they do. In other words she thinks my perception of events can't be trusted.

She interpreted my psych assessment results (I took a battery of tests including the MMPI) and confirmed that I had a mood disorder, but with psychotic features. She says I performed poorly in reality testing. I initially suspected ADD and/or a personality disorder but my understanding is that these have not been detected with screening. 

The report was also distressing. She read out a part (at my request) that said that I was selfish and self-centered, which was why I can handle being isolated. Thinking of the last 2 years I'd say this is not untrue, as I've only been concerned with ducking out of sight and keeping my job.

I see where the therapist is coming from re: support system but I don't think I can rebuild my relationships with friends and family overnight, and I do need to manage my life and my condition on top of that. It might take years and I do admit that being isolated has become comfortable for me.

I see the value of online communities like this one, but since I have reservations about outing myself as BP, how do I start offline?"
1776,"I work in a home preschool and today I heard mildly disappointing news from my bf so of course I over react and make things 100x worse. I had to take extra anxiety meds and go in the kitchen so the kids wouldn't see me crying. I don't drive and I have so many health appts it's stressing me out. I feel like all I do is work, go to appts, and errands. I have calmed down now that the meds have kicked in but I still feel sick deep down in the pit of my stomach. I have an appt to get my meds adjusted tomorrow so hopefully that will help but I am just so tired of being thrown into a whirlwind anytime anything happens, no matter how small it is and the never ending guilt that accompanys my irrational behaviors. I recently have found myself mostly friendless and isolated other than seeing my bf which we haven't been on the best terms lately so sometimes it just makes me feel sadder and more alone."
1777,"Mixed states I think, I'm so sorry this is so long, maybe I just needed to vent

I lived in Colorado for my entire life, most recently in Denver in a little mobile home with a yard. On a whim we put it up for sale and it sold 2 days later. Two weeks later our stuff was packed and on its way to California, where my husband is from. I had to stay in Colorado to finish up the paperwork. Hubs ended up getting an apartment in the same complex as his ex-wife. I'm still super pissed about that. 3 weeks later hubs injures his back so severely that he couldn't get out of bed for 5 days. He lost his job. 

I finally made it to California a month ago. He is working 20 hours per week, but it's killing him. I can't find a job because there's not much I can do that won't aggravate the anxiety and bipolar. Target wouldn't even hire me.

Since I got here i have been wracked with depression to the point where I sleep 12 hours a day, plus have all the body pains and i don't take care of myself. Some days i don't leave the house.  And then the anxiety which has been so bad that I doubled my dose of ativan (which wasn't much to start with), and I did try to do the DBT which did help. Now I'm sliding into periods of mania,  where i can't sleep and go on rages which embarrass everyone, including myself. Then I'm like, wtf is going on. Now I'm mixed states. I'm so tired I want to sleep, but can't.  

I'm homesick and I don't like it here. People are rude. There are no decent parks to walk the dog. I'm scared as hell to drive my car, so I've been stuck at home unless hubs drives. I have panic attacks driving. I went from living with just hubs to living with 3 other people, including a 2 year old. I need a garden, but there's no room. Half of my stuff is still in boxes. People keep telling me to give it a chance, but why? Things are so crappy and stressful that my first instinct is to just pack up and run.

Does anyone have any different views about it? To maybe point my brain in a different direction?"
1778,"I’ve been dignoise with bi polor, anexiety, depression. I’m in a emotional and mentally abusive relationship. It to the point where I don’t feel anything. I’ve never wanted to hurt someone, but it the only way out I feel. I can’t end my life cuz I have a wonderful daughter. I’ve not ever thought this way before, it scary, but I really going to snap. I have no where to go or family who will take us in. It only gets worst by the day"
1779,I feel like a burden to the people I'm closest too. I do not drive so I am very dependent on my dad and my boyfriend. It really puts a strain on my relationship with my bf. The past couple weeks I've had a lot of appts on account of getting my meds straightened out and I'm about to get my wisdom teeth out as well which I have to do 1 hour away because of my insurance. I know I'm trying to take care of myself but I feel like with all the help I need on a day to day basis that I don't really get to ask for favors to do things that are fun. I feel completey stuck and stagnant with my life and I end up taking it out on others. I'm doing my best to control my emotions and reactions but usually end up just suffering by myself. So it's like  I either let it out and damage relationships or keep it in and continue to damage myself and self worth. It feels like a never ending cycle.
1780,"I am so unhappy, I don't know where to begin? I first started to feel mentally unwell around 16 years ago and since then I just feel that I have gradually declined to the point I am now, where I have simply had enough!  I am morbidly obese and have carried this around with me my whole life, I hate myself! It stops me doing everything I enjoy and has dwindled my confidence away, so that all I am left with is someone that pretends to be “jolly"", when inside I just yearn to be normal! I am missing out on life and have dragged my family down with me!  Feeling like this has contributed to my gambling, so that just for an hour or 2 I can escape, who and what I am!  This has culminated however, in us accruing a mass of debt, which now stops my family being able to do things as well.  I have gone from ruining my life to my whole families life and this makes me feel devastated inside.  I am short with my wife and kids and think I am deliberately trying to push them away, so that they can all start a fresh life without me.  If it wasn't for the fact it would upset everyone, I wouldn't hesitate ending my life and have found myself planning it in my head. My job keeps me ticking over and helps to pay the bills and more importantly keeps me out of the way on nights, where nobody is judging me or looking at me in ill fitting office wear!  I don't enjoy the job and feel that I am just going through the motions until I am unfit for work or die through the immense strain I am putting my heart through.  I can't believe you only get one shot at this life and mine is as good as over, I take very little enjoyment from anything any more and often feel that I am utterly worthless, a joke and a terrible role model.  16/12/17"

1782,"Gosh i dont know where to start. Anyway i had a serious car crash in december last year. Broke my neck and multiple injuries.
Lucky to be here
 Anyway here i am feeling back to m so y old self. Pretty much physically. Mentally i did so well coped really well with everything.
Anyway i have 2 brothers who have nothing to do with me. 
Thats fine.
My mother despite the emotional and physical abuse i was subject too as a child i kept in touch visiting most weeks. Shes on a benefit and well anyway..hasnt got much money so i try  help her out
I used to always take her out for morning tea or lunch etc always paid, isnt that what  daughters do? drop of some groceries. Some free products in return. Maybe i am selfish but she never returned any favours at all 
And by the way she abused me not my brothers.
So anyway my husband didnt tell her about the accident. Seven weeks in hospital never heard from her which is ok. Even though I was normally in touch most weeks.
Anyway three months later she arrived at my door. Here i am with a feeding tube full neck and body brace, only just starting to walk due to  pelvic injuries (not because of spinal damage  my spinal cord remained intact)
Anyway here i was in that  state. She came in told me how well i look???!!! never asked what happened or what i had damaged. It was 100% about her.
She was like 'why didnt you tell me, I  am your mother its hurt me so much'....she went on' and on about her?
Today 11 months later i havnt heard from her since. But was thinking that if she was a so called decent mother wouldnt she just forgive me for not telling her? Like wouldnt she think 'um i wonder why i havnt  heard from Ann? Or even though it was christmas she wasnt even in touch then and that was xmas despite everything else.
Her daughter almost died but anyway i dont know is this because i am a bad person? I feel so messed up at the moment"
1783,"Anyway I have in the last 6 months or so been at work or later on the day start shaking/jittery feeling/sweating..
Anyway saw my gp got loads of blood tests done physically everything is fine.
Then it was like a light bulb being turned on?something mental health wise was going on. 
Anyway things have settled down yet once again in last few nights wake up in a major sweat where my bedclothes arent just damp they are wet. The nightmares are back again dont know what to do. its weird i wish i could put my finger on a cause yet i cant. The subconscious is an interesting thing really. In real life everything can be fine. Then once i close my eyes the battles start the abuse as a child the abandonment stuff it just goes on and on.
But anyway see my therapist next week hope that helps."

I feel very shaky and restless almost constantly.

All of my life I have depended on guys to take care of me. I dropped out of school at 16 and got married and have 4 kids only for it to end after 10 yrs. Ever since I have been out of one bad relationship right into another. I have suffered mental and physical abuse and have been run over all my life. I do not know how to stand up for myself. I am so codependent that I go out of my way to please my partner even at the expenses of my own happiness. Right now I'm with a man who says he don't know how to love and does not know how he feels about me. He can't even be intimate with me without watching porn. It makes me feel so unworthy and unattractive but I just go along with it like everything is OK. All I do is sit at home all day sabotaging myself. I can't even function out in public by myself. I don't know what to do anymore or where to start. I've been to therapy and been on every med imaginable and I still don't feel any better about myself. Please help!!!"
1787,"7 Ways To Improve Cognition In Bipolar Disorder | bpHope


Cognitive impairment is one of the bipolar symptoms I struggle with the most. It is definitely bipolar related, not med related. I just came across this article with some approaches to improving this symptom; medication,  therapy,  lifestyle and just plain sticky-noting your way through life.  

Does anyone else deal with cognitive impairment,  and if so, how do you manage it?"
1788,"I was diagnosed with cyclothymia in my late teens early adulthood, which I was medicated for a couple of years. I completely stopped doing anything about my mental health but it's becoming more of an issue again.

1791,"Hi all
I've worked as an accountant for years, actually i found it is a boring job,and i just spend money on novel, especially in Harukimurakami's books.

i got job and quit,usually.
now i'm getting old, stuck with debt and unemployed.
i got divorced years ago,my kid lives with me now.
i find hard to focus in everything,except reading books( only books i love), also easy to get mad,sometime.


am i having BPD? and people with BPD- are we... dump and can not be fixed?
this is the first time i'm unemployed for a long period ( eight months), i think i have to be more serious about myself,and i found this forum.Please help.
what can i do now?"
1792,"With the new year around the corner i have hopes that i will be able to do better next year than i have been doing this year.

I mean i tend to be manic more often than depressed and its a well controlled manic for the most part; but every now and then i crash and sometimes its a really hard crash

Especially if i end up broke and too stressed out; which happened probably 3 or 4 times this year because my job barely pays above minimum wage even after ive been with the same company for going on 4.5-5 years now; and i feel its a very thankless job

The higher ups sometimes say we are doing a good job and they appreciate us; but it doesn't translate to extra money so its kinda worthless in the end.

Anyways; about a month ago i got my braces removed after over 2 years of having them on; check flex card balance and it was about $350 more than i thought; so thats great; but i sort of messed up my retainers; so that almost costed me $400 (ortho office is making replacements for free this time)

And i need to get 2 dental implants, and they (implant dentist) requested for me to get a different type of X-ray done which would of costs $350, but my Orthodontists office had it on file; so thats another score.

So im a lot more ahead than i thought and this makes me so hopeful i will find a way to pay for the full implant costs without too much difficulty  (a little hard work and money as well as some planning).

It feels good to have achieved a real victory for once; and hopefully things keep going good in the new year."

1794,"I've been with my girlfriend for over a year. Just recently we found out she is bipolar. I have read a bunch of articles online about how to help and care for someone who has the disorder. I love her a lot. We need some help.

The hardest for us is getting through manic episodes. These often happen when we're apart. (we don't live together) On her end she's experiencing something very painful. She feels the world is against her, there's no hope for her, I'm going to cheat and I enjoy her suffering. The articles I've read have said not to take it personally, it's the disease. They also say to not be confrontational and to make sure they feel heard and not challenged. The problem is is that these episodes can last for a long time. I often stay up until 3 or 4 in the morning, and any attempt to sleep is met with ""You're just going to abandon me?!"" and creates future problems. She also feels it's me valuing my need of sleep over her need of comfort, and if I did a better job at helping her I wouldn't need to stay up so late. And yeah, after 2 hours of doing what I think is best I try defending myself and it gets worse. It just feels hopeless sometimes.

I want to do a better job at helping her, there's just to many times where it feels like anything I say is going to make it worse. A lot of times when I'm being accused of things I'm not sure what to say. If I defend myself she feels challenged and it makes it worse but sometimes she's looking for me to defend myself because she doesn't want to believe that her fears are real. If I stay I feel useless and stuck, often making things worse. If I wait for it to end, it makes things worse for her and leads to bigger future problems. It just feels hopeless.

We need some help. Any advice or insight for us would be much appreciated."
1795,"I am at my wit's end! I struggled with bipolar disorder for several years while I worked in education over 10 years ago.  I finally quit the profession thinking that it was surely my job that made me so miserable.  For 10 years I worked in my family's businesses in bookkeeping and, although not symptom free, I felt like life was good since I could be flexible in my schedule.  That seems to be the key for me.  To be able to work a lot when I feel good and rest when I don't.  I felt good more than I felt bad, but to have the option was extremely comforting to me.  It worked! Then my family feel apart along with the businesses.  I am now back in education and have the same terrible cycling moods that I experienced when I was in this profession before.  Mostly terribly low moods, but sometimes when I feel like I am ok, and I can do this.  There really isn't any other profession that I want to be in.  I don't have dreams to do anything else.  I did when I was young, but now that I am older, and have been through all of the mental illness pain, I just want to feel evenly good most of the time.  Also, to not feel like my life is over because I can't have a flexible work schedule.  I am on medication and have been stable for several years.  Until now.  I want to quit my job because I know that without the stress I will be fine, but I need the money to survive.  I feel like I don't have an option because without money, I can't survive; but without my health I can't survive either.  I am going to my psych on Thursday to discuss the situation, but my question for all of you good people is, any suggestions/opinions about what I am going through and how to handle? Thanks so much in advance.  I know we are all struggling from time to time.  I appreciate you!"

   Yeah, I'm feeling sorry for myself. Sad, lonely,etc.  I've been having a rough time for a month or so and sometimes it just really peaks and I feel like if I don't talk to someone I will go crazy. I even texted my older sister and went to her house for the first time in years. Her house was so beautifully decorated. Every surface had lovely tasteful decorations. She has a huge Snow Village and it is so cool. A large loving family that is in and out with lots of grandkids in and out. To put it bluntly I am jealous. 
   It makes me feel bad to admit that. I feel like such a loser. My life feels meaningless and to be truthful, parts of it are absolute hell. I know the people here can understand that people saying ""Just put up the decorations for yourself and no one else."" just makes you feel worse.  
  I feel like people ignore my texts and calls because I am such a downer. I don't know why but I want people to see and understand how much mental pain I am in. ARRRRGGGGHHHHH."
1802,"Hello all,

I have been diagnosed with mood disorder, manic-depressive. My dad was diagnosed with cancer, and my parents need help. Which I am more reluctant to give but they just don’t understand how hard it is. That may sound selfish but they honestly don’t. They think it’s something that I can just snap out of and be fine any given day of the week. There’s some days where it’s so hard to get out of bed and it’s not because I’m being lazy it’s just because of the sadness that over takes me. Some days are better then others, and I feel fine and I’m happy the whole day but the next could be randomized. People who suffer the same know what I’m talking about. My dad needs a lot of help and I’m trying to help him. I just had my cousin come talk to me about it, because my parents generally think I’m just being lazy. My mom knows I’m taking medication to help me but she still has no what it’s like. I see a counselor regularly and I have told her lately I have been feeling worse.
How can I possibly help her understand that I’m not just trying to be lazy or dodge work but I actually have a mental condition that inhibits me from certain functions sometimes."
1803,"...they are annoying me so much today. I love them and for the most part the noise is them playing and laughing. Some of it is LOUD complaining about getting school work done (we homeschool) BUT it seems SO much louder than normal. 

I am wondering if I am just tired and lonely (my hubby is working out of town this week), or if they just haven't gotten out enough the last couple of weeks OR if I am starting to swing into more of a hypomanic period of time. And everything is loud. 

I have been aware of the fridge running and the furnace running (we are in full blast winter here) stuff like that, when usually the background noise doesn't bother me. And falling asleep has been harder (again hubby is gone so maybe that is why) but I have slept and had crazy dreams....

I hate always being in a guessing game of is this just normal? or not?  I am a stay at home mom with 4 kids of course they get loud and annoying or is it over sensitive and I need to prepare myself and my loved ones for me to be a bit out of control, dramatic and well just all round hypomanic.

Does anyone else get tried of the constant self reflection it takes to stay healthy? 

hopefully after history class my kids can play outside in the snow before horse riding and guitar lessons.  


deep breath.

I am thankful for my meds that allow me to function so well. I just hate when the illness pushes through the meds for a visit now and then.  

HUGS to all."

1805,"I've been told cyclothymia by one psychiatrist and bipolar II by another - but neither diagnosis is 'official' yet. 

I experience 2 week to 6 month long periods of depression. They vary in severity from crippling pessimism, inability to leave my house due to fatigue, thoughts (no plans) of suicide, overdosing and self-harm to what I would describe as moderate depression, with intense fatigue, loss of pleasure in hobbies, no desire to socialise, anxiety and sleeping 12-15 hours every night. 

I also experience short periods (3-7 days of intense optimism, high productivity, lack of impulse control, expensive talkativeness and an abnormally great amount of energy. These periods almost exactly fit the criteria for hypomania in my opinion. Usually they increase my functioning and are quite pleasant and allow me to do a lot, but occasionally they become scary as I lose control of my thoughts and my body - I have tried to pack a bag and leave for France, thought of committing suicide for 'fun' (I had no idea of the reality of this) and my energy level is so high I was only just able to stop my legs from moving before I walked into the road by accident. In this state I care about very little, but it soon turns sour and I become depressed, leading to self harm and feelings of shame at my earlier behaviour while in an 'up' mood. 

In between these periods I can be stable for anywhere from 2 weeks to 6 months - the winter tends to trigger my depression and when I'm experiencing a lot of stress my normal periods tend to be much shorter - only a week or so. 

One psychiatrist told me my experiences werent 'out of control' enough to warrant a bipolar diagnosis, and I appreciate they're not like some peoples symptoms such as walking around naked or spending a fortune, but they concern me greatly and I really do worry I'll lose control completely and do something terrible to myself. 

Does this sound like anybody else's experience of cyclothymia or bipolar ii? What do I do about my psychiatrists differing opinions?"
1806,"Hello, I'm not sure if I have a mental illness as ive never been stuck with one diagnosis.

I was doing well so felt so much better 

But the past few days I feel so manic, I just dance constantly, I want to just go insane, my energy levels are x10000000 I don't care, I just feel so wild and free and amazing and I love it but I don't feel normal at the same time.

I'm not sure whether I'm bipolar or what because I would never be diagnosed but I have been stable and I just feel so x1000000 energy and happy but Idk why. I just fweel really good, like I just wanna do something crazy, idk whether my meds have worn off and I don't feel as numb."

Its always been a curiosity of mine since being diagnosed with bipolar. My most recent manic 'up' phases lasted 2-3 months as I was unmedicated and I'm now in the 2nd month of my depressive phase. My social worker keeps saying most manic phases last a week or more, but I'm guessing that's just general guidelines.

1813,"Hey everyone,
   I woke up today feeling overwhelmed. The smallest things put me into a tailspin and rev up my obsessive thoughts. I get so tired of it my knee jerk reaction is to just give up. But I know that is the illness talking. I just feel so alone and scared sometimes. I have pretty severe health anxiety and it is really kicked up today. I won't explain because it is totally TMI. Chances are it is gallbladder or liver or less likely pancreas. Everyone in my family( even extended family has had gallstones and had to have them removed. i made an appointment with my doctor to ask about an ultrasound of the gallbladder. I'm really afraid that I will have a bad attack in the night and no one to take me to the hospital. My feelings get all messed up in the nobody loves me, no one cares cycle when I think of this. I don't talk to my family about it because they just don't get how the bipolar mind works. 
    I have had to spend about $1000 dollars on car repairs within the last month which is very  stressful
   I have a VA person coming to the house on Wednesday to check on my father's wellbeing and go over my fiduciary accounts for my dads VA pension. I have been so paranoid about this that I have cleaned every nook and cranny of the house to a spotless shine. Today I need to do my regular household stuff and I feel like I just can't. I feel frozen with anxiety for some reason. I'm am so tired of feeling this way and just want to be normal.
   I have Thanksgiving and Christmas to think about. Usually it is a small affair with my sister, dad and brother. I used to enjoy it so much. Cooking the turkey and preparing all the sides made me feel part of the countries celebration. Last year, I got up early and did all the hours of work cooking by myself. I had to wake up my sister and dad at 4 in the afternoon to eat. My sister took her plate to a living room chair and ate a little and went directly back to bed. Dad ate and went back to bed (he is very old so this is normal. My brother left right after eating because he had to keep his woodstove going. So all that work for less than an hour of time spent together. My sister never said three words. In that short of time I was left alone to clean up. I don't want a repeat of that, but if I don't make the dinner, I will feel more distant from the ""norm"" than ever. Ugh. Christmas was the same.
     Can you believe the presents I bought my sister for Christmas last year are still in the corner by her chair. The wrap is  off, but most  still have the plastic on from the store. We are talking hundreds of dollars unappreciated. I had to decorate by myself including putting up the tree. Life with a drug addict is HARD. Especially when you used to do everything together. 
I just feel like I don't want to do any of it anymore. Life doesn't seem worth it, still I sit here and struggle on. 
Sorry for the long post, I just needed to get things off my chest."

I've posted this here because I'm not sure what forum to put it in.
I saw my Gp last week and she said she feels I need psychiatric assessment but as I'm having counselling atm she said to ask what the counseller thinks and let her know.

Thing is I just really don't know how I am anymore - I've hit yet another massive depressive point again. I go from feeling like life is great to full crash to rock bottom. 

I need to know if I have some sort of mental health problem other than just depression and anxiety (which I've had since I was a kid) - and if I have I want to do whatever I can about it. 
I want to live life and enjoy it - but I can't because I don't even know what makes me happy other than my kids - but even with that comes a feeling of just being a complete failure as a mother. 

I don't know what to say to the counseller - I've only seen her once so far and she said at the end of our session that I seem to have no sense of identity- and that's exactly how it feels. 

Has anyone else felt like this and if you don't mind me asking what was the outcome of the assessment and what help did you get? X"
1817,"I’ll try to keep this as short as possible but I’m not sure how that will work out.

I was dating a girl who I think has Bipolar II. Although she is diagnosed and has been dealing with the disorder for a while (around 6yrs she says), I don’t think she has a very good support system. In the past she has abused prescription drugs and for two years now she has been abusing alcohol, which her parents know nothing about (she’s 16 so she lives at home). She also gets extremely hypersexual and would engage in risky behaviors online (often lying about her age in order to talk to older people) and even meeting up to have sex with one of these people on one occasion.

We dated for 5 months, long distance. We live in the same state and I would see her whenever I was in her area, even met her family. Everything was perfect for the first month until some mild symptoms started to show. She would flirt with anyone who showed her the slightest bit of attention, I would catch her in small lies, and she would put off any time that we had planned to spend together while away (skyping, calling, watching movies together online) for no reason at all. I wasn’t aware that some of these things stemmed from her bipolar and neither was she so it would lead to me suggesting a break or break-up. These usually only lasted a couple of hours or a day because she would always come back saying she loved me and she couldn’t stand to lose me and wanted to get better. Until about a month and a half ago she expressed that she didn’t think she was able to feel romantic feelings anymore, as if the particular emotion had just been completely taken away from her out of the blue. She thought she had “become” aromantic, yet she would get these random, profound bursts of appreciation and love for her friends (which she confused for crushes); just not for me, her girlfriend. Basically, she became very passive about me and our relationship for no reason at all. After researching, I found some sources stating that this was an effect of the bipolar. So, I wanted to work through it and kept trying to offer solutions to do so, but she started becoming cold and never wanted to talk about anything regarding our relationship. She began fully pushing me away, keeping herself more and more busy with friends and school, and our contact became less and less.

I later found out that while she was ignoring me she had made a Twitter under a fake name, posting explicit pics and audios of herself, vulgar tweets, and begging people to sext her. I confronted her and she admitted to sexting multiple people on the account, i.e. she cheated on me. She had explained that she doesn’t think she was manic at the time this happened as she sees hypersexuality and impulsivity as just “a part of her personality”. We broke up and during this she was so insistent on keeping the account up as if it mattered more to her than I did. She kept asking to remain friends, but I felt as though I could not do so while she was still using the account because this just felt like a huge slap in the face. Unfortunately, I know there are people and predators trying to take advantage of her through that account even though she’s only 16. From her tweets, I see she has experienced some slight bouts of depression since this all happened yet everyday she’s back on it doing the same things. I am just very worried because all of her closest friends seem to be enablers? They show no concern for her actions (cheating on me, abusing alcohol, risky behaviors online).

I know that she last changed her meds around June after a bad depressive episode, her cheating on me and our breakup all happened within the past two weeks. The problem is that she hides and doesn’t communicate some of her symptoms to her parents or doctors (her drinking and substance abuse as well as her hypersexuality). She just continuously settles for the fact that she is simply an asshole and a shitty person, which I do not believe. This was both of our first ever serious relationship and I do still love her but I recognize we are both extremely young. I am worried that if someone in her life doesn’t take this seriously it will turn into very strong habits and addictions by the time she’s an adult. I am wondering if there is anything I could have done or should do while we are no longer together or in contact. I was the only one who actively tried helping her and she would even say she knew I loved her the most and treated her the best out of anyone she knew, and now that I’m too hurt to even be friends I feel like I’ve completely abandoned her. I would feel intrusive and like it is not my place to contact her family. I’ve reported the account to Twitter multiple times for child sex exploitation but they don’t seem to take anything seriously. Any suggestions, feedback, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated."

I'm kind of having one right now, feeling euphoria but helpless at the same time. I'm aware of what's going on by doing some research and the medication also helps. But I do know I'm going to feel like shit after the ""kick"" is done. How do you deal with it?"
1820,"I'm waiting to meet my new CPN.. They're coming to give me my injection soon.. And i have no idea who or what is coming.. And its freaking me out
i also don't know when they are coming... Which totally sucks.. I'm having a hell of a time just lately... Too much stress... i hate being alive... it just never ends... :cry:"
1821,"I've taken a hell of allot of pills in the last couple of days.. Hasn't really helped at all.. If you don't count all the sleeping I've been doing.. Trouble is it made the weekend fly by.. Now I'm back to alarms and early mornings.. Which i hate..
I'm soo depressed i don't know what to do... My 'family' has just about given me up...
The count down to Christmas continues.. i am soo not looking forward to it this year.. 

I'm lost guys.. i can't find my way out of this depression :cry:"
1822,"Besides the typical medication and counseling/therapy; what else do you find helpful for extra stresses and symptoms?

I find that i can normally become manic without any sort of trigger; but its usually not to the extent that it becomes a major problem.

I really only get too manic or too depressed if im too stressed out; which seems to happen at least 2 or 3 times a year because i usually have money problems; so anything above that just seems to push me over the edge.

Sometimes i deal well, but most of the time i find that i dont and it usually leads to binge drinking beyond the point of blacking out.

I dont need to drink all the time; like i skip most weekends; but its like when i get too stressed i want to shut off my brain so i dont have to think about everything that bothers me because the more i think about it, the worse i feel.

By now i know things to not do and going forward i plan to stop drinking completely.

But what do you do thats a good way to deal with your problems?

Pretty much all i got for ideas is 

Exercise (if my energy level/motivation allows it)
Extra sleep (when i feel too drained of energy)"
1823,"Tonight people were talking about relationships. It just made everything worse. I feel so alone. Like no-one will ever like me. Am just sat in my room crying and I don't know what to do. Most sensible people are asleep right now.

I am 28 and am single. No-one has ever shown an interest in me, whatsoever, since I was about 12 and even then, I'm not sure that he wasn't laughing at me the whole time. No-one, that is, except my married youth leader who was 15 years older than me. I was (am) friends with his wife. I was 18 and depressed and vulnerable and I didn't really know how to react, so I just buried it til a few years later. SO yeah, if that's all who are interested in me, what hope is there?

I just feel like I'm too messed up for anyone to love. Not to mention fat and ugly! But mostly messed up. I mean, who is really gonna take on someone like me? There is a guy I am very good friends with, and I would certainly not complain if he wanted to take things further. But realistically, how likely is that to happen? He has lost someone close to him, he is vulnerable too I guess, so I don't know why I would even think that he'd look at me twice.

I know I have to like myself before I can expect other people to. But even when I'm at my most confident, no-one ever sees me that way.

SOrry for rambling on again, am just struggling with this so much tonight. Well, in general, but it's come to a head tonight. Am I being totally dumb?"
1824,"Gosh I have done so well for a long time now. Been ages since i have visited the forum.
Anyway I had a major car crash end of last year without any mental health crisis, which is awesome.
About 8 weeks ago I started getting hypomania symptoms back after being stable for at least 18 months. A few minor hiccups certainly nothing major.
So went to my gp thinking there must be something physically wrong with me.
Loads of bllood tests later all came back fine.
So anyway am getting hypomanic. Things have been making me feel so anxious anxious over nothing. Feeling jittery, on edge, things appearing brighter and agitated easily. Also over spending. So anyway admitted to the psych ward and the doctor cut down one of my anti-depressants. Finally am now at home feeling good. Then went to work yesterday came home upset and anxious. 
Since i was discharged last thursday I decided to halve my quetiapine dose, from 900mgs down to 450 sleeping fine I have no withdrawel symptoms. While i was on the ward i kind of didnt take all my quetiapine i pretended i had taken it then i got rid of half the dose. I may tell my support worker on Friday but then i may not because if i do then they may assume i have been playing around with my other meds which i havnt done.
I also have already lost some weight so feeling really happy about this"
1825,"Hello, 
   Lately I feel like my moods are all over the place. I am angry one minute and crying the next. 
   I feel like I should give you a little back story. As I posted in my other post, there was a time in my life where everything came crashing down and I left my job, house, and everything to move from my home town. It was terrible. My younger sister came and helped take care of me. We were even homeless for a few months and bounced from couch to couch. Finally we bought an older mobile home on a land contract. We agreed that we would make our own little family (since we ha been shunned by our own). We would make homemade holiday decorations and celebrate everything. She was my support and I was hers and we said to hell with the rest. Well, 6 years ago she broke her leg and was prescribed Oxycontin and I bet you can guess the rest. She is a full blown drug addict. Her average daily intake is around 30 of the 10mg hydrocodone, 10 of the 1mg Klonopins 10 of the .5 ativan, 6 Lyrica, 6-12 of 25mg benadryl and lots of Robitussin. She has overdosed twice. When she goes into withdrawals she says the meanest things to me, you can't imagine. The last od was so bad I had to break down her bedroom door. Our friendship is gone. I rarely see her as she sleeps all the time. I am so sad about the holidays and hearing everyone's plans and I sit here alone. I hate it.
Thanks for reading this, I know it was long."
1826,"Hello everyone,
I have been wanting to post for a few days but was not sure how to explain so people could understand.  I grew up up in a very toxic, abusive environment. I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder at age 5 and given Phenobarbital. I fought severe depression all through my school years. Even though I was an honor student, valedictorian and offered a full college scholarship, when it came to actually going, I got to the door of my dorm room where a bunch of girls were standing around talking, and I panicked. I knew how weird I was and that I shouldn't be there. Even though my mother hated me, I couldn't leave her. At 22, I had my first major breakdown and suicide attempt. I have had years and years of therapy from different Psychiatrists, and have tried hundreds of med combinations. I feel I have grown gradually worse over the years. I am now 50 and feel I am worse than ever. I struggle every day with anxiety, depression, anger, lonesomeness ,deep sadness and so on. I even had the Gene Sight testing to see what meds should work best for me. I am on a list of meds now but they aren't working any better than any other combo I have been on. I feel I have done everything right to improve this mental illness. I have done every kind of therapy recommended by my different Psychs and took the meds even when they made me sick. I changed my diet to only whole foods, I do a walking regime and I am still miserable. I have never been loved by anyone except one sister. (long story).  I have lost hope on improving and just live day by day. Are some people just so broken that they can't get be helped?
Thanks for Reading, I know this was long."
1827,"I feel like I don't know who I am at all, I'm always trying new things and get upset and frustrated when I can't do those things. I'm someone different with everyone I'm not my own person. I sometimes feel like I'm looking in at life like I'm standing in the background watching it all go on in front of me. I have views on life which people find 'werid, cry every time I have to go work as I feel work die and that's not the life I want for myself however I don't know what life I want for myself. I change my mind in a matter of hours, there is no choice I have made that I am 100% sure it was the correct choice. I feel empty when alone and resort to self harm but do it in ways where I can lie and say I hurt myself accidentally. I feel like I don't have a purpose in life when I'm alone I need people round me as a distraction but only very few people I like around me I tend to distance myself from others apart from a couple of family members and my partner. I find it difficult to trust and I make reckless decisions such as drinking, self harming, cutting my hair cut+colour, reckless spending etc. My mood is happy sometimes but it always changes so suddenly. When I'm alone I will write poems when I look back at them in a day or so I'm shocked that I felt those feelings and wrote stuff that dark it's like it was a different person. Something isn't right could anyone help me with a insight to what these feelings could indicate. I'm so embarrassed and ashamed of these feelings"
1828,"Hello everyone, 

I just wanted to take a moment to say hi and let you know a little about myself.
All this is new to me and I’m still trying to get my head around things. I will start back in October 2016 although things was bad on and off for years before. My wife took me to Iceland for my 40th birthday which was fantastic! When we returned from the holiday I felt really depressed but went back to work for half a shift which I was taking bad and just needed to go home. I was a career for people with learning disabilities and mental health and doing 24hr shifts. Since leaving after that shift I have not been back to work and handed my notice in. I was having really bad times lasting weeks and when on a high buying stuff on cards and not having the money to pay back. I even done lots of these payday loans and spending more. It got that bad I got hold of my mums card details and my dads PayPal details. Once I come down and released what I had done I would get very upset and depressed till the next high moments. 

I took out another big loan and booked a family holiday in Ibiza. I owe so much money but can’t repay it, think I may have to try and go bankrupt… going back to coming back from the Iceland holiday I went downhill fast with suicidal thoughts. On the 28th of November 2016 I woke up and went downstairs without knowing what I was doing, I had taken one of my high powered rifles for deer shooting out of the safe and was sat on the floor. I snapped out of it due to hearing a noise upstairs which was my daughter moving around in bed. I sat there devastated at the fact I had a gun in my hand and didn’t know if it was loaded. I opened the bolt action and a live round fell out and to top that the safety was off ready to fire. I put the gun back in the safe and locked it then sat on the floor and broke down. 

I was surely in a dark place but kept it from everyone for around 2 weeks. I took up cycling just to push myself to get out the house and in that week covered some miles just going around lanes so I didn’t have to see to many people, around 2 weeks after the gun incident I was starting to hear a strong males voice which was telling me to do things, this happened one afternoon while out on my bike, I ended up at a railway bridge crying waiting for the next train. Luckily for me there was a man walking his dog and stayed with me talking. A lady stopped in her car and was going to phone the police so I fled quickly and made it home as I wasn’t going to get sectioned. 

The next morning I phoned the doctors and he saw me that morning, he prescribed fluoxetine for me which I was on till Christmas Day when more voice started while I was helping my wife prep dinner. The voices was trying to get me to harm myself. I threw the knife down a broke down and my wife phoned the Nhs who told her to stop my meds right then and to contact my GP once they was back open in the new year. I went to see him when there were open and he handed me over to the mental health team who put me on quetiapine which made me feel like a zombie for about 2weeks.

I’ve been back since and now got a new mental health doctor and he has put my quetiapine to 50mg at night and 50mg by day as and when I need it by day, also he has now put me on Pregabalin 50mg 3 times a day and I’m on my 4th day with them. They are playing silly tricks with me as I forget what I’m doing mid flow of something and can’t seem to remember a lot of stuff. Everything keeps going really bright and the room spins and if people are talking to me it goes echoey. I know it’s early days but do you think I should be on something else as he diagnosed Bipolar ll back the 11th of August. The holiday in Ibiza was just amazing and since been home a month from it I was on a high and started looking for the next holiday. To take my mind of it my wife said we are going back to Ibiza next year and it’s working at the moment. 

Sorry for the long message but it gives you a little of my background. I still struggle with this maniac/mania & hypomanina but I’m sure I will get my head around things in time. I’ve got an appointment on the 3rd of November to meet my care coordinator so she can write up a care plan. What the heck has happened to me ? I’m not me…

1829,"I have been slightly dissociating, been taking clonazpam with quetiapine to knock myself out do the dissociation gets work.

1831,"General Guidelines - Factually explained - On the Basis of a Good Bad Example

Hello,

I wrote a lot about my schizoaffective disorder and what helped me.
I think It can help everyone.

Executive Summary:
- Psychic disorders can arise when one thinks and acts ""wrong""
-Conversely, it can help against mental disorders to think and act properly
-The right thinking and acting can also help everyone else to become happier
-I lived the last 7 years with schizoaffective disorder and thought and acted wrong. During the illness I looked very much into myself and my surroundings to find solutions which I now present. I feel so much better now.
-The laws are not always enough
-The ""psychotic experience"" has a lot to do with religion. Basically, my illness ultimately led me to believe. Faith helps to think positive and to give confidence in the future

[Moderation]

Some constructive criticism / feedback would be nice. I just want to give meaningful hints. I guarantee you that I have described everything truthfully and everything described corresponds to my feelings / my memories.

Of course, this is not a panacea, but it definitely helped me a lot."
1832,"I saw a general care doctor in hopes that she would refer me to a psych, write me a letter for an esa(she did for my sister), and get me started on medication.

I paid $50 dollars to see a doctor who couldn't hear me. She mostly insisted I should be hospitalized, reluctantly prescribed me medicine that costs over $100 a month, told me I should ""think about my safety plan"", and refused to help me with the esa. 

I explained that I had waited a month to see her and that the only thing getting me through was that I thought I could get an esa. My work had approved me bringing it daily. My apartment gave me paperwork. 

Well, the psych unit won't see me for a month. 
The medication she gave me and insists I need to take, I can't afford. 

I called another behavioral health place, they won't take her referral and want me to go in and get one from them(50 dollars up front) to wait for at least a month to see a psych. And the lady was really rude on the phone, obviously annoyed by my questions and wouldn't give me straight answers the first time. 

I do not want to be hospitalized. 
I will likely lose my job and won't be able to pay for my apartment just by missing that much work alone. 
My last stay in a hospital taught me to lie to doctors to get out sooner.


Yet somehow I am in a corner where it feels like my only option. To lose everything I have and feel accomplished for- the only things I am proud of. 
I love my job. I work so hard. 
And I live alone, I pay my bills. This is something that makes me feel good about myself. 

I need help. I need advice. 
I have no insurance. 

It is so hard to get help when I can't afford to live."
1833,"Hi. I’m not sure if anyone can help me but here it goes. I found some emails where my partner was talking to men on craigslist about meeting for sex. These went on for a short period of time then stopped as far as I know. When I confronted him he says that he was in a bad place and it was a symptom of self loathing. We were having problems at the time and he was duing drugs which caused him to be aroused I guess. He said that at the time he hated himself so he sought out things that disgusted him. He said he never actually spoke to or met any of them that it just gave him the scenarios. He claims that sometimes after fantasizing about these men he would immediatly vomit. Is this kind of thing even possible or has he just been caught and is tryimg to feed me a line? He claims that he did this once before when he was married only that time instead of men he fantasized about very old women. It all seems incredibly far fetched and insane to me, of course that is how most people feel about the fact that when my self hate gets too big I self mutilate. Any advice is appreciated."
1834,"So anyone reading this will know how it feels when your bipolar decides that it is time for rodeo lessons and all you can do is go along. My apologies in advance but I am trying this new thing where I treat the bipolar as an unwelcome house guest.

I am not even really sure why I am posting this but I need an outlet because it gets frustrating to go through these motions and deal with ADHD and an anxiety disorder at the same time.

There hasn't been a day in the last eight months where one or all three of them haven't ganged up on me. 

I know you're supposed to stay positive but I am nearing the edge of a very high cliff and their constant pushing isn't helping. I have tried reading, music, films, writing but nothing seems to be helping.

1836,"I was just doing some Google research into the effect of Bipolar on empathy. It yielded some wildly divergent results. 

Here is a blog post that mirrors my own experience. I'm intensely sensitive to the feelings of others, to the point that I will allow myself to be walked on. However I struggle to express my own thoughts and emotions, and that empathy sometimes stops short of action. I do think though that it's a positive trait that goes along with bipolar. 
Bipolar Disorder and Extreme Empathy - I'm Bipolar Too: A Bipolar Depression Blog | HealthyPlace

However the Internet seems to think otherwise. Nearly every site said that bipolar goes hand in hand with a lack of empathy. 

This forum thread honestly hit me like a punch in the gut. Is this really how we come across to the people we care about?
I want to say NO WAY. But then some of those awful posts could have been written by my ex-boyfriend. :low:
Bipolar and lack of caring for others…... - Discussion on Topix

Which is it then? Too much empathy? Too little? A distorted way of showing it?"
1837,"Sometimes i think i pretty much know it all; other times i feel clueless.

To elaborate; i feel like the reason many of us end up Bipolar is because of substance abuse while we are still developing.

So; we drank alcohol and energy drinks at different times and because of that our brains have gotten stuck in this pattern of high highs and low lows.

And the meaning of life (to me anyways) is to do the best with what you are given and if possible have a lasting positive effect on the world (hard to do for most of us struggling with money; but for those that are rich its much easier to help others).

Now thats not to say that i enjoy life and dont think of suicide a lot; in fact sometimes i think about just running into traffic.

But im scared i would have a horrible afterlife because of it and i dont want to leave my family behind in a horrible state because i dont have a lot of valuables/money to leave behind; not to mention possible effects on their mental health (if that would be an issue).

And at other times i feel like i really dont know why things are how they are; i just feel like everything is set up for me to fail; especially being in the United states (they want people to be slaves to the system; never able to better themselves); and even more especially in New York State."
1838,"Hi :) 
I have recently been to see my GP and she has referred me for Talk Therapy, I originally went to her because I self harm and have been since I was roughly 13 year old. My memory is not the best and I can't quite remember the Whys, Hows, or Whens from back then. I will be 26 next week. I must add that the self harming has not been an on going thing since that age. The longest I went without any harming was approx 6 years. But over the past year I have relapsed and have went back to my old ways. (I will add here that at present I am not currently on any medication, I chose to refuse these until I next see my GP which is next week)
Anyways, I made the first step to go to my Doctors and like I say she referred me, I have had my first initial phone call assessment and had my call back to say I will be seeing two Psychologists and having therapy for Impulsive behaviour. I have no idea what any one this means or what it will entail. I'm also not sure if Psychologists can diagnose? 

Anyways back to why I am posting in this part of the Forum. I know you's are not Doctors and can not diagnose me etc. But if I write what I seem to experience throughout my life if it sounds similar to Bipolar. I know there is a few more like Borderline Personality Disorder all run quite close to one another when it comes it 'typical' symptoms. 
I never realised these could be symptoms, I just thought this was part of who I was. Since I was referred to a Psychologist that is when I started to read up on a few things. 
So basically, I am very up and down with my 'Moods' I can be very down and depressed and self harming and not wanting to leave my bed or the house or even want to talk to any one. I can then be very hyper or on a high, where I can literally take on the world, I can be sat watching tele and feel this build up inside of extreme hyperness. I have so much motivation and confidence and believe I can do anything. I plan to open businesses, go to college and even plan holidays and pay deposits which never end with actually going or paying the full balance. In the past I have gotten my self in so much debt and arrears with my rent due to thinking other things are more important than having a roof over my head. Are they called phases? I went through a cake making a decorating phase where I literally spent all my money and things to do with that and making sure I had everything in. That is all now sat in my cupboard collecting dust, my next phase was Acrylic nails and making sure I had all that, I would sit for hours and hours watching You Tube videos to self teach myself. Etc etc. I can literally go days without sleeping and working a hundred hours a week. Which soon ends when I go into a low mood, when all I am doing is sleeping and not wanting to go to work. 
As I have got older my tempter has got shorter and shorter not sure if that is just part of life and the fact I work in a taxi office on the phones and as a dispatcher, members of the pubic really do know how it hit all the right buttons :)
There will also be times where I can be sat here laughing my head off then burst in to tears in the same breath. My partner at the time used to say 'You're Bipolar you like' and I would happily laugh it off thinking to myself maybe. Who knows.
I have read that it can take years to be correctly diagnosed with it etc.

Anyways everything I have read on Bipolar nothing mentions anything about self harm so this kind of swerves me to it being something else. I'm just not sure. 
I have my first appointment with my Psychologists on Monday 6th November so I suppose I will get more answers there regarding myself and when they hear my stories. There is a lot more to what I go through with these 'episodes' but I just thought I would keep it as brief as I could :)

Any advice or words of wisdom would be gratefully received :)"
1839,"Hello everyone,

My nane is dezza and i have come to this forum as I have no idea where else I could go for some advice, seeing my GP is the last thing I want to do.

I have previously been diagnosed with depression and anxiety some years ago but now I fear could it be bipolar? I just need some advice from people with the disorder, as for me seeking a diagnosis would mean losing the job I love.

Sorry in advance for the long post but I know not what else to do?

So a back story, when i was a child I was diagnosed with ADHD, 
When I was 19 I hit a very bad spell of depression with thoughts of suicide and self harm.
 I was diagnosed with depression and put on citalapram which i was unable to take due the potential side effects and the safety critical environment I work in. So to be able to keep working I never took my anti depressants.
 Although very depressed I carried on working and partying heavily, a week or two later and waking up at 4am with the feeling of purpose to kill myself ""never tried"" I ended up in A&E and was then given a prescription for Haloperidol and signed off work for 9 months.

The next few years carried on pretty steady with some mild lows, however I am now 28 and over the past 3 years I have hit 1-2 bad depression's lasting from a week to 10 days every year. 
While in between the depression I have some normal patches and what I would call extremely productive, during these patches I have spent a few hundred £ ""nothing drastic"" on equipment needed to start up ""a new business"" none of which ever take off because I move on the the next big idea.
My girlfriend always moans because I always want to run her through my new ideas and when she doesn't agree I tell her... ""she will never be millionaire because she has no vision""....... could this be hypomania? 

It's hard to track my sleeping because I'm a shift worker. As I get older and these episodes of depression and potential hypomania become more frequent they leave me worried and confused as when I look back on the ""hypomanic episodes"" I laugh and can't belive that I actually wanted to start a cricket farm?

I also have weeks of extreme anger which leave me very upset ashamed of myself :(

What would you people that have been diagnosed think of my story? Do I have need to worry, at present It doesn't effect my work just my home and social life, however the diagnosis could mean losing my job and I have a family with 2 perfect children to support. 

If you do think I could be bipolar could I ignored it or will it keep getting worse and worse? 

Thanks in advance."
1840,I am bipolar and for the past few years I have been having delusions that Christianity is the word of god and if I don't become christian I'll go to hell this was largely because I neglected my mental health and wasn't taking my medication now after getting genetic testing done my psychiatrist prescribed latuda 2 months ago its helped a lot but the deeper parts of my mind still haven't let go of the delusions I notice this when I meditate when I try to tell myself the delusions are wrong I start to feel scared and panicked sometimes I get flashes of what feels like intuition telling my delusions are true
1841,"I've known for some time (years) I've got some sort of mood disorder, after many goes on the NHS merry go round I've now been diagnosed with cyclothymia. Would greatly appreciate any input/opinions. 

Basically, I  experienced mild mood fluctuations most of my life but never to any great degree on the 'high' side, mostly felt like ""me plus"", and the lows felt numbing but not really affecting my functioning too much.  Since having a child (who is now 5) I've had really pronounced mood swings including two periods of very bad depression (most recent has had me off work for several weeks) and at least one period of extreme high which I thought was hypomania, but I came across some notes I made at the time two yrs ago and now wondering if it was actually a manic episode. I've also had fairly long periods of being/feeling normal. 

Anyhoo - this diagnosis of cyclothymia was given second hand, as I saw a pretty dismissive jr doctor who told me she had no idea what it was, relayed the info to a psychiatrist then came back to me with cyclothymia. She then told me that they've decided to prescribe me clotiapine. When I asked, she told me this was the only option aside from lithium, and they didn't want to give me that as it's toxic. She also told me i can't have bipolar as I've never had a manic episode. To be fair, I only came across the notes I wrote about the possibly manic episode after I'd seen her so she didn't have that info. 

My instinct is to go private and get a second opinion - surely there's more treatment options? I can't find anything useful about clotiapine anywhere, which makes me really wary of taking it. Also I'm so uncomfortable with the idea of being diagnosed by someone who has never met me, on the basis of information relayed by a third party."
1842,"Hi. I'm new to this forum but it looks great. I'm trying to find out more info on how Lithium affects people. My boyfriend and I have only been together for 3 months but it looks like it's the real thing. We both feel like we've found our soul mate. He's bi-polar and his doctor recently changed him onto Lithium. My brother is also bi-polar so I know quite a bit about it. My worry is that the Lithium will make him flat and emotionless and essentially make him fall out of love with me. Can this happen? Obviously I do want him to feel better so if the Lithium works for him that's great, but I'm hoping it doesn't make him care less. Can anyone give me some insight?"
1843,Well my mood is dipping into a despair and cannot see an end to it . Ive been to see the new physiatrist and he has added a pill sertraline. Ive been on it before but not with the combination I'm on at the moment. Anyway not sure if it will help but giving it a go. I'm just stick of keep feeling like this and the worse is that I know It will come back.

1847,"Depakote Bipolar Disorder Therapy - Is It The Best Bipolar Medication for YOU? | Bipolar Lives

Depakote is commonly regarded as a “mood stabilizer”.BUT NOTE: it is ONLY FDA approved for bipolar mania, NOT for bipolar depression.

According to Dr Jim Phelps, Depakote is a good choice of bipolar medication for people who:

1. Need medication that will kick in fast and have a strong effect.
2. Are male.
3. Are not worried about gaining weight.
4. Are rapid cycling.
5. Are experiencing significant manic symptoms.

1. Okay...
2. Not male.
3. I am a WHALE. Gained 30lb so far.
4. Is a two-year depressive episode considered rapid cycling?
5. Never been manic in my life.

I can think of a whole host of reasons why NOT to take Depakote. But why should I? Why would my doctor have prescribed this particular med?"
1848,"Having been depressed for most of my life up to this point, any break in the depression is a reprieve and a breath of fresh air.

Yet since my diagnosis of bipolar II these times when my head breaks above the surface have a frightening aspect of their own. 

How does one tell the difference between ""not depressed"" and ""hypomanic?"" Any positive emotion, any idea that bounces into my head, any streak of creativity and I start to worry. I'm afraid to get too attached to an idea because what if this is just some half-baked hypomanic scheme that makes no actual real-life sense to anyone but me? When is my Pitts Special going to be shot out of the clouds?

The natural result of this type of thinking is numbness and inertia. I'm looking for insight into how to recognize hypomania and take safeguards without completely blocking myself from feeling anything positive or considering any ideas or plans."
1849,"I've been struggling with addiction and mental health for several years now. For the past few months ive been struggling to get off meth. The longest i was clean was a month in july. I'm down to once every week or two but each time i relapse i just get worse and worse. I doubt its a good thing mixing meth with my meds and taking my meds off and on. I take latuda trazadone depakote strattera busprione and another for anxiety. Also I've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety bipolar 2 a personality disorder and a slight learning disability.

Anyways, everytime i relapse i start losing my mind more and more to the point i wanna be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. Suicidal thoughts become more of a problem (ive been fantasizing about suicide since i was 13 but ive never told a psychiatrist). I feel so helpless, hopeless, and worthless. Because you can't fix something that was broken in the first place. I want help but at the same time i don't, i don't know how to either. I feel incapable of helping myself supporting myself everything. I'm so lost, confused, frustrated, just hopeless. I'm confused about who i am and i don't know how i got here. Trapped and stuck. I see no way out. I wanna exaggerate the confusion because its severe, i have no idea what to do with myself. It's very disabling and i cant function really at all. I can't get a job I can't complete my GED, i just cant do anything. 

And its so hard to kick meth no one understands. I'll be good for a little while then get an episode of depression personality change i stop taking my meds and im back at it. Can anyone guide me half way there? This is really hell.
I've been seriously considering admitting myself to a psychiatric hospital for a longer in depth treatment. I feel like something else is seriously wrong and something is. I really want answers."
1850,"hello folks.,  not been about much trying to keep my head together and deal with my shit life.  hope your doing ok?"
1851,"Since I left school (I quit college after one semester) I have worked part-time jobs, first living with family and then boarding with a couple from my church. I really long for the independence of living alone, but though I have a sizeable amount saved up for a down payment, my income isn't sufficient to get a mortgage. 

Today my supervisor's job - meat manager at our grocery - was posted. She's retiring in January, and the store owner is giving first opportunity to those of us within the company. No one else in my department wants the job; I have seven years' experience and have stood in as manager whenever she is gone. My coworkers and friends are urging me to apply.

But I'm scared! If this was even two years ago I wouldn't have thought twice. But this roller-coaster journey of mental illness has rocked my confidence to the core. If I'm not depressed I'm a med-induced zombie - though hopefully the recent change from Elavil to Wellbutrin is beginning to change that. The job is stressful for my supervisor, and the store owner's expectations are high. I'm afraid that trying it could cause a bad episode, as work-related stress is already a trigger for me. 

Does anyone have suggestions or similar experiences? Finding a different job is not really an option for me since I live in a rural community, have no post-secondary education, and am a visible religious minority, which added to the requirements of my church severely limits the available jobs."

1853,"Hi there! I'm new to this forum. My name is Jayson Greene; I'm a music journalist, and I'm writing a piece about my experiences with psychomotor agitation and music.  I've got a lifelong relationship to both ;)

I am cyclothymic, and I've demonstrated psychomotor agitation since I was old enough to close my fists around objects. If you catch me walking by myself on the street, you will notice my fingers twitching, and my hands working a little, at my sides. I keep my keys off of a keychain most of the time, because if they are on a keychain, I will dig them up out of my pocket and jingle them relentlessly, without consciously noticing that I'm doing it. Once I accidentally dug them out of my pocket and flung them, accidentally, directly onto the subway train tracks, right in front of a very confused onlooker. 

When I was a little kid, I did something else with this energy: I took my socks off of my feet, balled them up in my little hands, and shook them, furiously. For hours. I also muttered and talked to myself. If you walked  up to me while I was doing this and spoke my name, I would hit the ceiling, as I'd have no idea that you were there at all. I did this without any self-consciousness in the front yard of my parents' house until I hit adolescence, and then it became a furtive, masturbatory habit, one that I finally managed to stop when I was about 19 years old. (the twitching, of course, has not stopped, but I contain it to episodes and bursts -- on walks to and from the subway, for instance). 

Why am I posting here? Well, this might seem opportunistic, but I really just want to collect examples of people's behaviors, if they see fit to share them -- I wouldn't even  mention people's usernames in the article.  Mine seems to be pretty unique, in that if I google ""sock shaking"" I don't get anything at all! 

Honestly, I am just curious, above all, about other people's experiences with this symptom."
1854,"Some days when i go in to work i just absolutely hate everybody; especially the ones causing me extra stress and i wish i could beat them all up.

Not that i actually would; i just have a lot of anger sometimes and i play it off by joking around and focusing on work (unless it hits a high point, in which case i just do things to make people mad (im a huge jerk when people upset me) and if i feel like it i yell at them loud and with emotion so they back off) but some people just absolutely suck and are hard to work with; even on good days.

1858,"Diagnosed with bipolar II recently(had the wrong diagnosis), will it ever get better? I feel lost

Dear kind people who went through hell because of mental illness,
I am a 19 year old, who has been treated from severe depression for 2 years unsuccessfuly,
one attemp of suicide, and two hospitalizations. Luckily last time I was
hospitalized there was a bipolar specialist who quickly realized that my diagnosis was
wrong(I have bipolar II) the entire time and I got proper meds for mine.
I take Seroquel, Eftil(I don't know what it's called in the US, but it's used usually for epileptic
episodes), Pregabalin(Lyrica), and I'm tapering off of Clonzaepam which I used to take for
anxiety.

I don't have manic episodes, I have slight hypomania, but very rarely. Most of the time my episodes
are depressive and I feel like I don't wanna live. I feel sadness and cry most of the time.
These meds so far got me a bit more balanced, and the psychological pains are not nearly
as bad.

I wanted to ask if anyone with bipolar II has got their life together?

My college is starting in roughly 10 days, and I hope that days with structure(having to
wake up and go to college, study and so on) will help me get out of my own thoughts.

I have distanced myself from almost all friends, or some have abandoned me because I'm not
doing good. (You're just spoiled, you have everything, you have no reason to be sad etc.)

I wanna hear if anyone is functioning normally, and how did you get to that stage?
Because the more I stay in my depressive episode, the more suicidal I get, and most
of the time I don't see an exit other than suicide.

Any tips to get better? Is it even possible?"

Has anyone else tried this drug? Does anyone feel so bloody tired all the time!? I'm considering asking my doctor to change, but as I have no other side effects I'm hoping the tiredness will pass and I should just stick with it to see. Will this pass? 

Much love x"
1860,I've now change teams and phyco doc. This new doc is going against everything the old one said and says I've never been depressed. The team I'm with now are useless. I feel low and am self harming everyday I feel so alone with lots of people around me
1861,"I would say my biggest challenge is self image; either im on another planet in deep space; feeling like a god.

Or something/somebody in life causes my mood to crash to ocean depth lows.

I try to be in a healthy middle; but sometimes after life runs me ragged mentally and at times physically as well i sometimes just get to the point of not caring about anything; especially myself.

I know many of my problems which may never go away are job and/or money related and the job just inst worth continuing to keep long term.

But im working on getting a better job; and if i cant get this job im trying to get by January; then i will go to anything full time as i wont lose much wages, plus i will have less responsibilities and wont feel as stressed out by problem coworkers  (given its a company where i have hundreds of coworkers in the building and its a revolving door, so i dont know who i will have to deal with next.)"
1862,"A little about me before I get into what is going on and why it is difficult. .

I have been through so much throughout my years of life and I have a lot of regrets and repressed memories. 
I was diagnosed with bipolar 15 years ago after my mom had me admitted into the psych ward for reasons that were not reality. My mom's husband would beat me up daily and she would just stand there watching. I started rebelling and running away and changing into someone I shouldn't be. I self-harmed to get out of another beating and was sent  to the hospital. 
I tried to tell them what was happening but my mom said I was just attention seeking and was a problem child. They believed her over me and I was put into the psych ward and pumped full of meds. Once I was released I had to go back to that house and be hurt for the next year until my dad gave in and took me.
My mom turned my everybody against me with her lies so no one trusted anything I said . They always thought  I was lying which wasn't the case at the time. I tried to see a counselor at my school but I needed a guardian to okay it which they refused saying I'm just seeking attention. They also took me off my meds so things went downhill. I didn't know how to cope or deal with anything and I had no one to talk to.
I was told about drugs and that Coke will make me feel better. She said I would feel good again so I gave it a try. And she was right; I did feel better so I kept doing it. 
With every bad thing that happened over the years I pushed down and tried to forget and the drugs helped me with that. 
After 6 years of daily drug use I found out  I was pregnant so I immediately dropped everything and sobered up. I left my sons father because apparently being pregnant doesn't stop him from beating me up. I finally had the courage to leave him because I could not and would not put my baby in that environment. 
I graduated high school then did a couple years of university  but about a year after I had my son I slipped up and my downhill spiral started again. I ended up dropping out of university too.
I was drunk and thought I was given crack but after my first hit I realized it was not and found out it was meth. I instantly loved it because it worked way better at making me not feel than anything I've ever tried. 
Eventually I hit rock bottom after a little over 4 years. I lost everything including my son and I was devastated. I did everything to get him back which I did.
My mom suggested we move in with her and she will help me get back on my feet. I thought maybe it was me being a problem child and things would work out since I was an adult. But apparently my mom is just a crazy b**** and she would get mad and threaten to slap me then call the cops and play victim. She kicked me out then went to cfs saying I'm homeless so they said I could have my son back once I find a place. 
I found an apt and told my mom I wanted him back and was set up then the next day I get a call saying he's apprehended because my mom made some false allegations that they believed based on my history. I went to the office and apparently the entire time she denied me my son saying cfs had him was a lie and she was just keeping him from me. 
I did 6 months worth of drug tests which all came back negative and got verification from my pdoc that I was stable. They still wouldn't give him back. Then my guy I was with gave me two black eyes then charged me so I went to jail since he made a statement and I said nothing happened and they believed him. That made cfs take me to court which makes getting him back even harder. 
I did everything to get back what I lost and be there for him but I still lost everything again.
I ended up giving in and using again. I haven't been able to leave this guy because he beats me up when I try to leave him. And he won't leave me alone. He has his nice moments and I remember why I fell in love with him. He makes me believe it won't happen again and we're good for a bit.
I made the decision that I can no longer live like this and I need to sober up and leave him. I made up an excuse to get away and I'm in a safe place to detox then Monday I find out if I get into this shelter in a different town. 
This is so incredibly hard on me because I love him regardless of everything for some reason and I can't stop thinking about what he's doing and if he's alright. 
Dropping everything and leaving is the hardest thing I have ever done because I'm all alone and don't have the intention of using. I have absolutely no one; not even people to surround me to keep my mind occupied. I have to do this completely alone and without the only way I know how to cope. 
I am so scared, emotional, worried and just a ton of feelings that I can't handle. I am so overwhelmed and hurting. And I can't stop overthinking and I'm so upset. I just hope I can get through this and finally have my life back and keep it this time."
1863,"Ever since 2014 i had a major mental breakdown. police vans at house etc. locked in bathroom smashing everything thinking i was multiple people.

1864,"I am not against medication...at all but sometimes I wonder if I could maybe do life without it. I mean I was without medication for 35 years and I was fine. I mean sure then I started to struggle  but maybe if I wasn't on meds I would go back to being the person before 2 yrs ago. 

I am too scared to try. I have a husband and 4 kids to stay healthy for but tonight I lie here wondering what if I tried it...just eased off a bit even. Would the voices and people come back. They weren't so bad most of them. The depression was bad but maybe I would stay afloat. I had 14 yrs from one long 10 year depressive episode as a teen/young adult until another started at age 35."
1865,"I have a diagnosis of Bipolar-NOS  (not otherwise significant) and i try to hold myself together and enjoy life.

But something always happens that makes me feel terrible mentally and then i usually resort to binge drinking (no joke, sometimes I don't remember half of it, but usually wake up feeling perfectly fine (im not bragging)) I used to self-harm but not doing that again as i hate my scars and dont want to make more)

I guess at those times i would rather be in a severly altered state of mind or just blackout so i dont have to think about my problems; not really caring whats gonna happen to me that night or in the morning.

I used to drink once a night every weekend  (although most of the time a lot less alcohol than stated above); ive scaled way back as i know its not good for my health and its costly on money too.

Are a lot of us this self destructive, or is it an uncommon/rare thing?

Most of it stems from too much stress at work, not getting paid enough (i have plans to get a better job hopefully next month (i have interviewed for a company and im waiting on them to hire more people; which is due to happen next month)); and getting yelled at by coworkers for some pretty stupid reasons (the company i work for has a lot of employees that are more about drama and starting problems than actually focusing on being a good worker and nice person)."

1867,"Hello all, this is my first post in a mental health forum...I am grateful for any support/advice on my situation with my partner.

We have been together for three years and in these three years there have been three ""episodes"" (I don't have a better word for them), in which his character changed drastically, and with severe consequences. One of them is going on right now...After it happened the first time I started paying close attention to his behavioural changes, and also to stories he tells me from the past that sound like similar episodes. I will try to summarize:

All three times this happened so far, a traumatic event in his life happened (last time, his father almost died in an accident), followed by a time when he can't sleep, or can't sleep deeply, or feels energized after 3h of sleep (and at the worst point, 20min of sleep). He usually doesn't drink alcohol (he is a Muslim), but then suddenly starts drinking compulsively, he is usually very careful with spending his money, but then starts spending all his (our) money, f.e. on buying 5 motorbikes in 1 month. I have a substantial debt from the first time this happened and I had to pay a lot of people back for his debts...The worst part though is that he gets extremely irritable and difficult to talk to. Everything I do upsets him, when I look at him too long, when I do something too slowly. He starts accusing me of very absurd things (like I am stealing his music and selling it to Universal behind his back), gets very insulting (again, very out of character for him).  He suddenly wants to realize all his career plans at once, thinks he will be a millionaire soon, gets into fights with everybody. Is suddenly all social (he usually likes to spend time by himself). Wants distance from me, questions our relationship. He talks nonstop, mostly starts with a small everyday thing, and ends somewhere in his childhood. It is extremely difficult to interrupt him or get him to listen, even if he does, most times he doesn't remember it afterwards. His thoughts seem to be racing...

The first time this lasted 2 months, the second time ca. 3 months.  It just recently started again after he broke his ankle and had surgery two weeks ago. I am really at loss of what to do...I cannot go through this again, especially with a baby to take care of. I try not to take anything he says personal, which helps a lot, but is difficult. I tried talking to him several times about getting help, but he gets upset that I am trying to convince him he has a problem. He had a very traumatic childhood with all kinds of abuse... I love him so much and I want to have this family with him, and I know he loves me too. But I cannot take the emotional abuse (I have no other word for it) that occurs in those episodes, and the financial strain they put on me.

Help?!"
1868,Hi... I'm new to this so not sure what to say.. I was diagnosed with bipolar 2 and server anxiety which leads to panic attacks daily only last Christmas and finding it hard to deal with... I'm finding it more and more difficult just to get an appointment to see my doctor and ended up with the crisis team twice in one week only to be sent back home even thoe I told them that I was suicidal and was planning to act on it and had no one at home to watch over me... so I have no clue what the crisis team are there for.. I got to see a doctor weeks after this and was told I didn't need a care coordinator and when I explained what happened with the crisis team and asked him to explain to me what are they there for if they are sending you home when being asked those questions and he just stared at me and didn't say a word... Does anyone know what I should do next and what a care coordinator is supposed to help you with as everything I ask help with they give me excuses and just say that that's not there job to do and tell me that my OT can help me and then my OT tells me that it's not her job todo it... I feel like they are just passing me to pillar to post wasting time and making me feel no one cares...
1869,"Today my doctor prescribed me chlorpromazine to take as needed for sleep since lately I have been having a lot of nights that I just cannot sleep at all, let alone stay asleep.  He prescribed 50mg and told me to try it out and if necessary break it into 25mg or take 100mg.  I figured since I have tomorrow off work I would try the 50 mg and see how I will feel in the morning.  Well like 20 minutes after taking it I remember I have an 8:30am phone interview tomorrow :unsure: .  

Anyone taken this just for sleep before?  How did you react?  Most meds for sleep just don't have any effect on me or if they do work I have to take such a high dosage I feel like I have a hangover in the morning.

I lost my insurance and trying to get a job. I have bits of meds left. Just traz for insomnia and propranolol so I can leave the house. I don't like either of them. Barely touch them. My only other is my weed-guy at this point, and working to get my med-marijuana card. That actually helps. I miss my therapist, too. Oh well.

I wish my husband would be so inclined to read some of these posts...not to invade your privacy, because he won't read it anyway. But he's convinced I'm some ""special crazy"", easily dismissed. I'm just an asshole when I talk too much. (he's the asshole.)

me an dmy girlfirned have been dating for 3 months now and to begin with everything was going brilliantly i knew she suffers from depression and anxiety but recently she left me out of the blue until a week later when she was having an anxiety attack in college when i decided to call her to make her feel better by having someone to talk to, and then we got back together and it was going well for a day or so until she got really upset last night and said she wanted to leave me and then she started crying her eyes out and said she didn't want to leave me and she is scared of her emotions as it's never been like this before.

she has been crying several times a day and self harming and feeling really depressed and suicidal and she said she has been really scared of her head and she doesn't know what's going on, i'm really scared too as i love her more than anything and i just want to help her and because i suffer from depression and anxiety i have been feeling depressed and like i can't help her and i'm a bad boyfriend. i'm worried she may be suffering from bipolar disorder or borderline personality disorder and i really want her to be happy.

1872,"I have Bipolar, not OCD but I get obsessions with mania, anyone else?

My obsessions can change, and I have more than one at a time usually. 
I might obsess about one thing for just a day and something else for months and another for a week. 

Lately I've been obsessed with death and suicide and not just because I feel like I want  to end my life (I get mixed moods so I have depression with mania) I just feel like I HAVE to KNOW everything about death and suicide, every little thing. I've been reading, researching and watching documentaries on both for 3 weeks now, almost non stop. 

I tend to get spiritual and math obsessions too."
1873,"Okay so a little while ago I posted to the BPD thread about my therapist being unsure about BPD symptoms but through more research and observation, I've come to feel as if I'm somewhere on the bipolar spectrum. Here's the mood timeline from 2016 up til now that I've analyzed:

Mood of 2016

Jan:(in school)  asypmtomatic; 
Optimistic, feeling more rested, happy, not affected by usual triggers 
Rest of Jan-April(?) Severe depressive symptoms 

Jun-Aug(Prozac started): happiness, optimism. Asymptomatic 

(Sleep cycle felt reversed, lot of night anxiety)

September (Prozac contin, back to school): 
Depressive symptoms return


Mood of 2017:

Jan-Mar: Depressed (Prozac less consistent then stopped) 

April(spring break; 1 week) increased mood

           Day 1: happiness, extreme energy, lack of need for sleep, doing many tasks

         Day 2-8: slight decreased energy from Day 1 but still high mood/confidence

           NOTE: vitamins started on day 1 but discontinued later that week

Remain. Of Apr-Jun: severe depression (vitamins started again during school week but less consistent then stopped)


July-Sept: depression for short periods, heightened mood for short periods, intense anger for short periods, anxiety at night 

      (Slept slightly less these months but slowly requiring more sleep) 


      I'm trying to notice a pattern here and I'm struggling. But ultimately I'm wondering if this does resemble Bipolar 2 somehow or anything on the BP spectrum. While I do feel like I might have BP, I'm afraid my Hypomania isn't long or severe enough. Such as for April of this year when I first had it but I also took vitamins that week so maybe it could be that? But I also noted that the vitamins didn't work again like in that week... Today especially I felt suicidal earlier but later on after a nap i woke up with a ton of energy and happiness that slowly winded down after 30 minutes.  I of course don't expect diagnosis as I plan to be re-assessed with my therapist very shortly but I'm extremely confused and in need of help. Any help will be much appreciated."
1874,"I didn't sleep enough last night. I had a headache all day and my legs and hips ached. I hurt. tylenol and advil helped a bit but my head still hurts.

I feel like I am losing my mind. My faith has been slipping away for months and it feels like it is doomed. That is so much of what defines me without it I don't think I will keep being me. I mean like I feel confused, unsettled. I want to scream but it hurts to even think. 

it is so cold here and rainy. I would even go for a walk though it is pitch black as I live in the country. but it is raining and I hate being cold and wet. 

I want to feel. I have never been into self harm...like I pinch myself and that is enough lol. I am a wimp. But I want to feel something bigger than all the feelings that are trapped in me. When I am tired like this they more easily seep out which is GOOD but they just don't end and then the chasm is closed again and the emotions are trapped again. 

i am home with my kids. My hubby is not home. I feel so agitated. and my head just keeps hurting. 

I want to throw up. I just feel ill. Physical and mental and emotional....all of me wants to throw up. I feel like I need someone to hold me down and cover me with thick heavy blankets until the weight of them forces even my insides to slow down. I don't mean to smother me, to kill me HA! no I am not there. just to feel the weight of the blankets in my soul so I can feel steady. 

My eyes hurt. I think I am having a panic attack. I haven't had one in months and months. Anxiety and hypomania go together for me but I feel so down and hopeless."
1875,"Sometimes I take that blasted stuff and within 20 mins I can hardly walk up the stairs to my bedroom. 

Tonight I took it almost 5 hours ago and here I sit. 

Like seriously. 

On the plus side being tired helps me feel emotional which helps to cry and get some of the ick out. 

But wow I am going to be tired when I have to function with 4 kids tomorrow.

1877,"Hello, I'm Sarah from the UK. I've been dealing with mental health issues for the last 10 years. For the last 2 I've been stable on meds but I am now in the midst of a major depressive episode. I know I CAN'T kill myself, I CAN'T self-harm or any other destructive behaviours, so I often just hide under the duvet and imagine it.

I have booked an urgent appointment with my psychiatrist for Monday. Just wanted to reach out and connect with those who understand.

1878,"Hello new to this and never really talked about it . 
Would like to speak to people who are nuttier than squirrel shite like me haha
Any help in dealing with it would be much appreciated 
Have tried medication and never been the same since , and counciling which was no use at all . 
I need to learn about mental illness from other people with the gift that keeps on giving haha
Would love to share mine and listen to others way of coping because at the minute I'm struggling tbh 
Any help would be appreciated thanks"
1879,"I was trying to describe to my husband how mania feels both good and bad. It's the best feeling in the world, yet you know what's coming next. The crash is coming and there's nothing you can do about it. I can't even feel good when I feel good for being scared of the crash.

I am really excited and scared about it. I share my mental health struggles. It's so scary but worth it if one more person can feel more human and less like someone suffering when no one else has to. Be gentle, I'm still learning."

I'm not sure I'll make it till Christmas.. And if i do I'm not sure I'll want to see them.
I just don't understand what's going on.. i can't get my head round it... Why just cut me off without explanation ? That's the bit which is bugging me.. no explanation.. no arguments.. no.. Nothing......

1883,"I had a birthday (48)... And it was a really good day... My parents took me out and brought me a new laptop.. My son came round later and he brought my daughter with him.. it was a really good day...
Oh and my ex got me a card and a pen... But the next day i tried texting my daughter.. And nothing.. She just didn't answer me... And still hasn't... i haven't herd from her now since the 17th of August... i haven't herd from my ex since April.. And i haven't herd from my son since the 30th.

So ive been trying a little experiment... See how long it is before somebody texts me... So far its been a week... i could be under arrest, i could be in hospital, i could be dead. How would they know.. Nobody has bothered checking... it would be different if they wanted money... They would find me fast enough then

All this has left me severely depressed... not to mention lonely and board... I'm not eating or sleeping... i just don't know what to do.. So i end up doing nothing... Just sitting here staring into space... I'm really disappointed they haven't bothered checking on me... I've been self harming in some minor ways... 
The good news is I'm saving lots of money.. Because im not eating the freezer is still fully stocked... So i haven't been shopping as much. Didn't go out Friday.. Till.. Tuesday.. 

i don't know what to do... I've lost all motivation... i just don't want to do anything.... i don't know what the answer is.. I'm not sure if i care enough to try and fix this..."
1884,"Cyclothymia is not always mild. I think I needed just to put that fact out there. 

A ""down"" can come like a gust of wind, cause a fight between my husband and I over the smallest issue. It can persuade me that a change of job is nigh, that I am SO stupid that I should just sit in a corner and cringe. It makes me want to smash a plate with rage. It makes me cry in front of my children and it forgets to make me care. It makes me kiss those same children goodnight later that evening with painful guilt coursing through my entire body. When the storm has passed I feel raw, sore and tired like a toddler after it has wept so much its body shakes. I can dread going out as I feel embarrassed. I often people won't recognize me from one hour or one day to the next because when I am on a ""high""...

I will be utterly charming. I will smile so much I am sure my smile is shining. If I meet people who have got to know me on a high they will say ""you are just as happy as ever"" and my husband can not understand why because he is there for the lows.
I want to BUY online just because I want something in my letter box. I feel taller and stronger. I feel I can talk with style about the subjects I know. I feel pretty, funny, engaging. I feel drunk in fact. I move fast, I don't sit still. I speak quickly and I go to bed but I can not sleep. At all. I lie there as if someone laid me down at 11am and I wait. I sometimes move my legs non stop, it is horribly painful and I get very frustrated.

Before or after this episode I will be so tired I get a head rush going upstairs. I have zero energy. I feel like I am moving through sludge. I want to sleep for days or just stare at a wall. I feel blank, apathetic but I am not depressed so I can not cry. I just exist for muted tones and blank walls. 

And this, again and again and again despite the Lithium. Ongoing cycles like some ride one can not get off. I can not think about it. I know I change every four days but sometimes it is every few hours. I just have to hold on and try and learn from each swing. Still, I am getting older and I don't think this will stay mostly unseen for long. I push it down like an ice cube in a glass but it bobs up and I feel with age I am not going to be able to hide it as well as I could at parties in my thirties when shiny and glittery and was more mainstream.

Cyclothymia is not mild. It can pose serious risks to relationships and to sufferers themselves. It can improve though. Of that I am persuaded. But it will take work.

Although I was diagnosed only in December, I have had Cyclothymia since I was a child. When I was 17, a doctor gave me Prozac for depression. I became so irritated and needed to move constantly so much that it hurt to stay still that I had to stop taking it.  I developed OCD probably as young as 12 to deal with mood changes.

If anyone wants to talk about Cyclothymia I would love to share and listen. I don't know anybody in my boat. It is a shame that it is rare and that more people don't speak out about how difficult it can be. Reading that it is ""mild"" can make it difficult to feel valid which everyone has a right to feel no matter what."
1885,"Hi guys

Around a year ago I became severely suicidally depressed which came with agitation, anxiety, thoughts that I and the world weren't real, and thoughts that people could know what I was thinking and that I had 'demons' inside me. I was able to recognise though that that was not a normal thought to have. I felt an overwhelming blackness which I could at times almost see and had insomnia but felt physically drained/tired. 

I also had a sensation where I could feel thoughts with no content/couldn't understand them flying around my head so fast it felt like there was a month in there. 

Taking on board all of this what does it sound like? And does the moth thing sound like racing thoughts? Can they occur with depression? 

Thanks"
1886,"I have lived all my teenage years knowing that there was something wrong going on in my head. I knew my way of thinking wasn't correct, and that I should seek help with my extreme depression that I've always experienced. I suffered from an eating disorder, attempted suicide one time, consistently self-harmed, and pushed away everyone in my life. Yet I never told my doctor what was going on, I never told my parents, my friends, anyone. I was scared to death. I've been terrified of medication for as long as I can remember, I never took Advil for my headaches, I didn't take my pain killers after surgeries, and being medicated for my mental illness was my worst nightmare. I finally reached a point where I felt like I could get help, but only through therapy, not medication. We explored a lot of ideas about what was going on with me, depression, various personality disorders, and bipolar disorder. I am surrounded by people with bipolar disorder. My best friend's brother and my boyfriend at the time have the disorder, and I watched it eat away at them until they broke. They both were addicted to drugs, had been hospitalized, put into rehab, arrested, and so much more because they couldn't control their manic episodes. When my therapist said I should see a psychiatrist to get a proper diagnosis, and that I should be prepared to hear that it isn't simply depression, I was terrified. I put it off for months, believing that if a doctor told me that I had bipolar disorder, I was doomed to go down the same path that so many people I love had. Somehow, hearing that diagnosis was going to ruin my life. I knew they would suggest medication and therapy, and I didn't know if I could manage to swallow pills every day for, potentially, the rest of my life. Finally, last month, I went to my doctor about what had been going on with me for years. She put me on an antidepressant and scheduled me with a psychiatrist to get a definite diagnosis, but she too suspected bipolar disorder. I was terrified. But two days ago, I saw the psychiatrist, and surprise surprise, I have bipolar 2 disorder. This is exactly what I've been afraid of for years, but I'm on an antidepressant and a mood stabilizer. I've managed to take them every day I'm supposed to, and I'm optimistic. Surprisingly, I feel relieved that I finally am getting the help I need, and soon I'll be seeing a new therapist closer to home. I thought that this diagnosis would be the end of the world for me, but in reality, I finally feel safe. Although I don't have many people in my life, the ones that are here finally understand what's going on with me, and are supporting me through this terrifying time in my life. I know a lot of people are scared to seek help, but please, if you're reading this and were in a similar situation to my own, know that there will be people to support you. No amount of fear should stop you from getting treatment. Be safe."
1887,"I haven't been doing very well lately... So i needed this like a bag on my hip...

I'll try and fill you in when i have more energy :low:"
1888,"hello. can i just complain to you for a moment? i need to vent. my mom is a liar and  it is potentially dangerous for me. she lied about my biological father until i was 18, lied about her family, who i don't know, lied about her education, etc. etc. that's all fine, she's a liar, no one's perfect. it's my mom. but, her ego needs to support these lies in such a way that is destructive to other people. for example, my grandma (her mom), and i both have been diagnosed with bipolar. and she has used those diagnoses to leverage her own credibility to get us unnecessary treatment, including involuntary hospitalization, and disability benefits that she gets.

although, with her, nothing is certain, anything could be true. here is the most recent text conversation we had where she is lying about one of my life events: the college i chose to be undergrad. i wanted to go to community college to transfer gen eds to a university. she refused and theratened to kick me out if i did that. and now she is doing the same thing.

however, her story about that now has changed. and i called her out on that. and she didn't like what i said, so she threatened to take me to the mental hospital, even though there is no emergency with me. 

she is so crazy she even tells people she is studying grad level courses at a community college and honestly expects them to believe her. the only reason to go to community college is to get take general classes at a lower price and then transfer to a larger university. in the US, community college only offers a 2-year associates degree, not a bachelors, and definitely not any post grad degrees like a masters or phd. lol. 


also, if you think i am in the wrong here, please tell me. i am diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder NOS, and slowly recovering from a depressive phase."

1890,"Bipolar girlfriend broke up with me randomly and had sex with someone the night after

Me and my girlfriend had been having problems lately. We had been together for 2 years and something. I also wanna day we are long distance and we are both bisexual girls. She never cheated on me technically but 6 months ahora we had our first break up. We weren’t together For a weekends she was unmedicated around that time. 

She broke up with me said she didn’t love me and completely opposite stuff she had been telling me days previous to that. Immediately after she broke up with me she blocked me on everything and jumped on tinder. 3 days later she had sex with a random guy. She told me all this was her being manic and after hat she came down, she started being suicidal and would scare all her friends. This is when I contacted her. We eventually talked and we got back together. She tried for 6 months to constantly reassure me that’s she loved me cause my trust was REALLY bad. 

My trust issues led to other issues and out relationship was more complicated. She constantly tried to make me understand that it was because of her bipolar and it never was about us or me. Even though we were having problems we still were crazy about each other, we still loved each other so much but would fight. 

3 days ago she broke up with me again. She told me she didn’t feel comfortable in the relationship anymore. She immediately blocked me from everything, and I tried to contact her for the next 3 days. Cause it was so damn random, I was destroyed, I just wanted her back. I talked to her on the phone last night to ask her again cause I thought we could work it out. She told me she wished we could but we couldn’t, after so much drama she ended up telling me she hooked up the night after we broke up with a random idiot from tinder. I was furious and destroyed. She did it once again. She claimed she did it and had nothing to do wth me or us but she just wanted to feel worthless and she was depressed and didn’t care about anything. She told me she just did it. I just couldn’t grasp the fact tha she was doing this again. 

Now i’ve been talking to her and she regrets it and says she doesn’t wanna lose me forever and what not. I know things are so messed up right now and we agreed to part ways but now we were talking about the chance of trying again and she told me she doesn’t get how I don’t hate her after all that happened. And that it’d be selfish of her to get back with me. I love her with all my souls and I might not be thinking rationally right now but I miss her so much. I love this girl and i’ve never wanted to take care of anyone so much i’ve never felt so safe with anyone. She’s my whole world but god i don’t know what i’m supposed to do. Everyone tells me to let her go. That she’s a bitch and what not. And I honestly HATE what she’s did. I just can’t hate her. I don’t know I don’t want to everything to go to hell right now. 

Any advice and opinions would be appreciated."
1891,"First I am diagnose Bipolar NOS b/c I have had crazy severe depression with lots of hallucinations and just a drip here and there of hypomania. 

Second I am on 300mg of Wellburtin and 400mg of Seroquel.

Third this cocktail has been working great for about 9 months.

I am mostly doing good. Sure there are bumps but I really do feel normal sometimes. 

Here is my question....sometimes I just have a time when I stop (like I did laundry and cleaned my kitchen so I decided to sit down and have a little break while my kids watched a video) and then my thoughts just start to fold inward and they get all negative. For example ""I hate myself, I am a failure, look at how messy my house still is, people don't like me, I am failing my kids/hubby, etc (normal depressed thinking) It lasts for a bit...like 5 minutes or sometimes a few hours. And then I start to feel normal again. If my hubby comes home, or a I get an email from a friend or just have something I HAVE to do (like pick up a kid from a friend's house, etc) then it snaps me out of it usually.

it is like instead of a panic attack I get a depression attack

????  

it doesn't last super long. it isn't followed by mania. it doesn't affect my overall ability to function (though when it lasts longer than a few minutes I do fail to get much cleaning, cooking, and just general ""momming"" done). 

I don't know how often it happens but when it stops I really do just pick up where I left off and continue on. 

Does this happen to anyone else?"

Does anyone know method to calm the symptoms other than meds???"
1893,"Hi, 

I've just come out of hospital having spent 9 months recovering from Bipolar-I. I've been taking Lithium during that time. My discharge report does not mention whether I should carry on taking Lithium. However, as I've been reading about the illness it seems that one has to carry on taking Lithium for the rest of one's life.

I'm not sure whether I should carry on taking Lithium or any other medication.

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

1894,"First of all I would like to say hi to all of you wonderful people who offer help to random strangers for the sake of well being.


About 3 years ago I was admitted to a psychiatric institution. Stayed there for about a month. The symptoms I was showing prior to admission were the following:

Bipolar behavior, extreme paranoia about the government killing my family, believing I was sort of a God which is as far as I know, severe delusion.
Believing I can see subliminal messages in almost everything surrounding me, believing I was watched by the government. I was not aggressive though, I knew this was uncommon behavior, but I was not sad or very concerned about it. 
Only after I entered the government building naked, I realized this is not supposed to be happening. After that I went into my University and spooked a lot of people there with my abnormal behavior.
I did not eat for 3-4 days and I barely had any sleep, the days before I was institutionalized. I experienced severe depression after the manic episode calmed down.

These were the symptoms, now I am going to present some information of my lifestyle 4 years before this.

I was a potsmoker. I smoked everyday all day for around 3,5 years. Sort of an addiction, though not physical. I just functioned normally while on weed.
That said, I was barely sober for almost 4 years. Also I had a situation when I consumed 2 extasy pills and my body couldnt handle them. I threw up, and my jaw constantly shook for a few hours afterwards.
I was wondering if my smoking habit has a big impact on what happened to me. I am asking you only because my psychiatrist barely gave me any information on why this had happened to me. 
Nobody really answered my questions as of why this had happened to me.

A week before my breakdown, I met a girl online. I fell in love with her and then she suddenly disappeared. I was on my computer 24/7 waiting for her to come back. I thought I was hacked and watched through my laptop and broke it. My phone also.
Did not happen and I lost my mind. I feel that this also had a big impact on the situation. Literally i stopped eating, sleeping and functioning. Just waited for her to come back online. Silly and naive I know, but also ill.

I don't really know if this is enough information for you to give me any opinion about my situation, but I really hope you read this and answer me.
I had b12 on my diagnosis too, and was obviously told never to smoke weed and consume drugs.

My question is, what do you think was the biggest factor of this happening, did weed play a major role, did my overdose on ecstasy pills contribute and did love mess me up? 
Do any of you know a similar case? 

Thanks if anyone reads."
1895,"Hey there!

So a few days ago I was seen by a psychologist for a mental health evaluation after a referral from my PCP. After the session was complete I was booked with an appointment to see a psychiatrist within this behavioral health complex next week. Before leaving I asked if he knew what I had going on, and he said I fit into the box for Bipolar I and sent me on my way telling me to make sure to return for my next appointment with the psychiatrist. So I spent some time researching this diagnosis just to learn more. Now today I signed in to check my insurance and the claim has been submitted. I noticed that under Diagnoses for Service, it had F31.9. So being interested I looked up this billing code and it shows bipolar disorder, unspecified. Now I'm very confused, as I'm unsure what I really have. Has this ever happened to anyone? Can there be a difference in billing diagnosis versus personal diagnosis? Or is this just a general code to use until I see the psychiatrist? It just bothers me when things don't match up :( Thank you for any guidance in this situation :peace:"
1896,"So I know that I shouldn't do this but one the weekends lately I haven't been taking my meds so that I can stay up for a few days. I've been enjoying these manic periods, I feel like I am somewhat in control because all I have to do to come back down to planet earth is take my heavily sedating meds. I have been having company on the weekends and didn't want to take my meds because I knew I would sleep all day when my friend was here."
1897,"Hi there,

This is my first time on one of these forums so excuse me if i ramble on for a bit. i'm 27, was diagnosed with cyclothymic disorder a few months ago, but have been coping with it most of my life.
When I was a kid i was told i had add and sent to anger managment to control my outbursts and make me easier for teachers to handle. I guess to everyone else it seemed to help but all it really taugh me was to internalise things so I wasn't so disruptive. Fast forward through the usual teen years of drink/drugs to try and keep me consistent if not stable, I somehow wound up married to a wonderful woman who is almost unendingly patient with me on my bad days. But being a young couple with few qualifications doesn't make life easy and ignoring my issues has led to them ecoming more visible t people at work and in real life so i finally went to my doctor.
So i've now been doing ccbt for a couple of months, and growing increasingly frustrated at it's lack of relevance to how i feel. Now the techniques are very helpful for a specific issue like if something happens at work and sets me off, but are't very helpful for the lingering, overwhelming sense of doom and pointlesness that comes and goes without the need for external influence.
Im not sure what to think, am I expecting too much too fast? is there another avenue that will help more?
I know i should just go back to my doctor, but that was one of the scariest things i've ever done, and it took me several years of talking about it before i actually did it.

Sorry if this isn't the right board for this, but not totally up on how it all works here yet."
1898,"Hi there! This is my first ever post .
So basically I met my husband whilst travelling we fell in love it was intense but felt so  right. 

Things progressed quickly we moved in together and then got married .thinks we're still going well...,

We would have argumenta and I did feel like he lied a lot he was addicted to weed I did feel he was different but still loved him so much he then had an Injury he started to Distance himself.

He go depressed and told me he didn't love me and he wanted to to go .so I proceeded to do so.

Since then he said he missed me then would ignore me and now it's back to being my fault ""I could of stayed""
""He held the relationship together ""
""I never trusted him""
He has had one session with a therapist his mum also has bipolar he won't discuss the session with me.

I wasn't perfect in the relationship I didn't trust him as he would lie about trivial things.

Is it my fault? Will he want me back? I'm so heartbroken."

1900,I've been transferred to a new psychiatric doc and seen him twice in the last 3 months my mood goes up and down rapid but not had a high in some time now on lithium. Been to see him and said I have had some down moment he said I'm not depressed and never have been. Wtf when I've tried to kill myself before he said it was anxiety and wouldn't prescribe me anti depressents let alone lithium he doesn't have a clue now I'm left mad and feeling like there will be no help.
1901,"Well, hi. This is my first post in the forum. I joined up because Ive been having a lot of difficulties separating fantasy from reality. 

It started about foyr months ago, really mild actually. I was watching an independent art movie with my friends about the repercussions of society's politicaly correct crap. The main plotline was a girl that did not want to say hello to her parent´s friends and got punished for it. By the end of the movie (MASSIVE SPOILER ALERT) and a few shrinks later, she killed herself. 

The problem here, is I got really absorbed in the movie, my phone rang fivefold and I did not even notice until movie was over. A few minutes after that (maybe ten, not more than fifteen) I told my friends about this sad story someone i know (did not remember who) told me about. A girl who was forced to greet strangers and killed herself. I was literally telling the movies plot, even though we had just watched it together. They of course called me up on it, and only after they told me that was the movie did i remember they were actually right, and it was just fiction. At that time I just assumed I was drunk or tired or something, but after that day it has continued to happen, more often and stronger every day. Las month I was sure I had killed someone, even knew the gory details, I was really close to going to the police, but then I remembered it was an episode from a show i saw the day before.

This ""episodes"" always seem to happen after I see a movie, watch a tv show, read a book, it even happens when I daydream about anything. The problem here is that I am a writer, I have to create fiction in order to eat, and now every time I finish writing something, I actually believe what I wrote is true. One time I was convinced reality was a dream or an allucination, and the ""real"" reality was a world where I was an archer. 

I dont know if this has something to do with anything, but about the time this episodes starting happening I also started having involuntary muscle contractions or twitches, not sure how to describe them. Specially in my torax. Im really freaked out and afraid I might be going insane. I cannot tell anyone, i cant have my wife thinking Im crazy, i dont want to see her eyes if she already suspected it, I want nothing to do with this, but im afraid. really afriad. By thw time this started I was 24, never had a psychiatric problem before that. I had a neurological one when I was a kid, I took risperidone for six straight years. I dont have my clinic history so I am not sure why I took it, just that i did. Sorry this took so long. Just wanted to tell someone without having to face repercussions. Thanks for reading."

So i ended up with two of the bloody things... In the end i got so sick of it i brought another one the cost a bit more but had arm rests and a fixed back.. And wollah ! No more back ache.. This has all been a while ago.. So i ended up with two of these chairs stuck in the corner of my bedroom and no way to get rid of them.. i don't have a car, so i couldn't take them to the tip.. As for the bin men you can fucking forget it.. Environmental services charge fourteen quid an item.. And i haven't got the money for that... So I've been stuck with them for months.

A couple of doors up from me is an empty flat... The council have been refitting it and they are almost done so there's a big pile of rubbish outside... Boxes, empty paint tins, bits of pipe.. Just general crap..

So I've been thinking about it for a couple of weeks.. on and off.. But i couldn't possibly do that, its just not me... Besides.. What if somebody saw me.. or i got found out, I'd get into trouble and that's just not me.. So it was like 3am and I'd been drinking on and off all day.. And i was sitting here minding myown business and something just flipped inside me.. i was halfway down a fag but that didn't matter.. i just got up.. Went in the bedroom grabbed one of the chairs, took it outside and dumped it.. Then i came back for the other.. it really happened that fast

And Now The Important Bit

I'm becoming impulsive... And i can't control it.. i just flip and do what i want to do without thinking... Do you think its the drink ? I'm not pissed.. Just buzzed not blistered.. i dunno.. i feel weird.. Like i can do anything.. Like there are no rules anymore.. Nothing to stop me.. Instead of thinking about something over an over without ever doing anything.. Now i think.. Then boom ! i just do it

i feel........................................................... weird :meanie:"
1906,"Hi there. I'm looking for feedback or advice on how to cope with the mental illness of the person I am in love with. We've known each other for around 15 years, and I've watched him deteriorate. We are not in a relationship currently because he disappears, cuts me off, make me the enemy, and then comes back apologetic a few months later. He says he can't handle seeing me. 

I don't know what to do. Every time he goes away and I start to heal, he pops back up and I become vulnerable and heartbroken again. What do I do? 

Is it better to disconnect and leave him behind? Do I love him only when he wants it? I've created several fake social media accounts for when he cuts me off so I can at least monitor if he's alive. 

Thanks :("
1907,I think it's the worst insult possible when someone accuses one of being manic when one is definitely NOT MANIC. When all one is doing is being Assertive and defending oneself against obnoxiousness and rudeness and condescension. They stoop to this low level of playing the bipolar card because they cannot admit when they are wrong in an argument. Does anyone else's family cry bipolar when they have exhausted all other insults ?? I can't wait for my mind to shut up about this. :eek2:
1908,"Hello lovely people.

I am a 30 year old guy who absolutely wants to have kids sometime in the future - The only thing stopping me is my fear of being a bad parent due to my mentalhealth.

I have a borderline diagnosis, but i am not as much affected as many other people whom i've meet who also have borderline. I have been in therapy for 4-5 years, having conversations with a therapist. I live in Denmark and we have an absolutely great system helping people with everything so i am getting alot of support when needed.

My question, now, is: What do you guys think about my situation?

Do you think its a bad idea, no matter what, if you have a tendency to having mental issues in your genepool?

Is it wrong because my potential wife/girlfriend has to accept that i might have unstable periods in my life? Eventho she does accept it, will i be able to live with myself with her being the main caretaker at times.

Should i not worry to much and see if my future wants me to have children? Hope for a more stable life in my 30's

What do you guys think in general about people with Borderline getting kids?

I know some evidence proves that parents or caretakers with Borderline has a higher risk, then other parents, making kids having borderline symptoms.

Im dying to hear your opinion :D
Kisses"
1909,"Not sure if this is the right post for this as it includes a few subjects but- 

When I was first diagnosed with mental health issues (in 2010 I think) I was diagnosed with Bipolar (NOS) Which I agreed with. I had the symptoms of hypomania which lasted a few weeks then that went onto depression, however, a normal mood wasn't really evident. 

Somewhere, between now and then, they changed my diagnosis to Cyclothymia, which I have tried to argue against, the psychiatrist argued, ""The depression was bad enough for clinical depression but the mania wasn't bad enough for bipolar,"" (This is now when I'm on medication which has helped calm the manic side and helped put some normal mood in my life) However, I have family and friends who will argue different that my mania is still bad when I go through the mood. They have also added Borderline Personality Disorder to the list, ok, I agree I have that after they sent me the book on BPD.

Now they are looking at taking away the diagnosis of Cyclothymia completely... I feel like I am going crazy just by going through this process. I have just come out of a 3 week manic state and a 3 week depressive state- which I nearly took an overdose in. I know BPD involves mood swings but do they last that long?


I'm thinking of getting a referral for a second opinion, but at the moment I don't know if I'm in the right or wrong for doing this. :cry:"
1910,"I just when outside in my underwear :eek2:

I just forgot... i don't wear clothes when I'm in my flat.. Jeans are rough to have on your legs all day.. Theres nobody to see me, so i sit here in my shorts.. 
Anyway.. i had a pizza in the oven, so i was slightly in a rush.. i looked out the window and saw they had Emptyed the recycling bin and i needed to get it in... So i just put on my slippers and when outside... Oops

So is that allot ? i feel dizzy and my head is swimming but i can't decide weather its the pills or the placebo effect.. What do you think ?

1912,"Hi, 29 male here. 

I have suffered severe anxiety, depression, memory lapses and such for many years, since I was a young teen. Seen countless doctors, counsellors, psychiatrists. All with the same diagnosis, severe anxiety and depression. 

I always felt it could be more, but whenever I bought that up I was always told two things; why label anything and if I did have bipolar I wouldn't be aware of it? How true is the latter?

I experience periods of time, could be days/weeks/months where I am not feeling severely anxious or depressed. Then I can wake up one day and it is like a switch has flicked in my brain and I feel anxious/depressed again. Isn't that systematic to bipolar? 

No matter how much I have bought this up in the past it just gets overlooked.

It could just be my anxiety playing tricks on me. I know in mental health rarely is anything black and white at the same time.

Thanks to anyone reading this.."
1913,"Its my injection later today.. And I've started to worry about it... i can't remember when or maybe more importantly where i was when they first started to inject me.. i really can't remember... When i go 'strange' i never can remember anything... The only thing i do remember is being on the ward and them giving it to me.. But because i don't remember anything else.. i can't remember any discussion about why they were swopping me to an injection.. Its not like i ever refused to take my meds.. I'll take anything in the hope that it will make me feel a bit different.. But i do remember it being a condition of my release that i continue to have it... And they seem pretty keen that i do... They send a CPN every two weeks to inject me with this crap.. How much does that cost ? Its been four years !.. Shouldn't they have switched me back to pills by now ?... Injections are murder.. Once its in you, you lose all control.. There's no way to say no.. With my other meds at least i can stop taking them if i want.. But with the injection..No.. I'm stuck with the bloody stuff.

I wonder what effect it has on me.. Have i been gelded somehow ? i don't really feel any different day to day.. Over the long term I've noticed i don't seem to get as high as i used to.. But at first i took that as a good thing.. Now I'm not so sure... You know what they say about you only noticing the leash you're on when you start tugging at it...
I've been thinking of not opening the door today.. Just to see what would happen.. What their next move would be.. i guess they'd try and phone me.. But what if i ignored that to ?... What i want to do is go buy a big bottle of Vodka and forget all about it... But i don't know how they would react.. Maybe they'd overreact and put me back in hospital.. the very last thing i want... i don't know.. But the more this goes on, the more I'm not loving it... I've just got this nagging feeling that its bad for me and i just want it to stop. They could be giving me anything.. i have no control over this"
1914,"*Quick resume*

I got depressed and diagnosed in 2009. At that time i was 23 y/o...
I was studying at that time and got my first girlfriend aswell.
Within 2 years time i've lost 2 girlfriends, my study and spent alot of time ""just"" being sick. I've had alot of good times aswell, going to concerts, partying and just hanging out with my friends.

I had a relationship in 2013'ish aswell that didnt work out. I had a long downtime with depression where i did nothing but playing computer games and socialising very little.

From 2014 up til 2016 i got in connection with an institution that was giving me something to do with my day and i met other people and new friends. It was pretty cool but i felt like i was getting nowhere i my life. 
Then i met my latest girlfriend and decided to move in with her. 1 year later i am now living in home for homeless people with drug-addiction - not because i am addicted, but because i dont have a home, since she kinda ""tossed"" me out. She couldnt give me the time needed to find my own appartment cus we both we're hurting, she more then me. My parents is not an option and i have little to no friends left because all of them have kids and their life.

I have been in therapy for 4 years and i am aware of my mistakes. When it comes to girlfriends i find the same type of person and i actually thought i had broken that cycle.
But i am much wiser now and thats a good thing.

So i am starting to ask myself... Will i find happiness in my future? Will i still find deep relationships? Does people get more bland and uninteresting when they get older?
Will i still have the same passions when im 40? or was that just a window of opportunity existing in my 20's ? Did i miss a good part of my life?

I am 30 years old, lost and looking for hope. 

Hugs."

1916,"I have struggled with obsession regarding my weight and appearance for some time. Even before I started taking antipsychotics, I engaged in behaviours like calorie counting and restricting. Now that I take meds that could cause weight gain, I constantly obsess over my body and what I'm eating. I have gained a bit of weight, but I don't know how much of that is in muscle from weight lifting, the meds, or simply the vacation diet. I have never been diagnosed with an ED, but I know I have an abnormally bad body image and knowing that I might gain weight because of Latuda makes it worse. 

From other people who take drugs that have weight gain as a side effect, how do you deal with the worry surrounding weight gain? Do you worry about it at all? Any tips or shared experiences would be great."
1917,"Hi, 
Erm, not sure how to begin.
I've had mental health problems for years, never been properly diagnosed tho, always just fobbed off with anti depressants by my doctors even tho I've asked to be referred for an assessment. My sisters and parents have always said there's summat wrong with me, they assumed aspergers or bi polar from my symptoms. I was sexually assaulted when I was 14 and self harmed and rebelled a lot. From a young age id drink and embarrass myself to deal with my issues and have drunken break downs. My moods are often all over the place and are often irratic. I've always been able to hold a job down but only by the skin of my teeth due to my moods. I can go months where I'm completely fine and I'm calm and my life is in check. But then I'll go completely off the rails for months and I drink and spend so much money and get out loans and cry and embarrass myself and my moods and anger are just uncontrollable and I hate and resent myself and argue with myself in my head and call myself all the names. My mum and dad died last year and that's just set me off again and I feel like I'm a burden to my family because they hate being seen out with me because as much as I want to and I try, I can't control my behaviour. Even happy behaviour im completely over the top. I have a 3 year old and I want to get right for her but I don't know how to as I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm self destructing and it's ruining my relationship with my partner. Ive been like this for years now and just when i think im doing ok I revert back.
Has anyone got any advice or Help?"

1920,"My 4 kids ages 6 to 10 have been begging/looking forward to a family water balloon fight. Today we made it happen. They had a blast. We all were laughing and had fun. We ended the fight wet and eating freezies happily in the backyard.

I came in to change clothes  and suddenly felt so sad. I cried for a bit and now I am in my room hiding from my family. 

I wish I was a normal mom and wife. I hate that with all the meds, which usually keep the moods stable, I still have moments when good times turn sour. My friend reminds me often that everyone has grumpy/sad days and moments. But mine never feel like the normal kind. 

I try to hide all this from my hubby. He means well but he doesn't know what to do when I cry. So I am thankful for this space."
1921,"Hi I decided to share my story on my ex who I met again recently . 
I don't know how to describe his behaviour because he isn't acting like a normal adult .
Let's go back to October of 2015 , so nearly two years ago when I met him initially ..
He was in his 30s , fun and active person . He lived hour and half away from me so i used to go down and see him every weekend and he used to come see me too .
But as the time went on he started to show some signs of that behaviour . He used to take forever to reply sometimes days , which is normal but , I remember one time he arranged to meet and I asked him the night before what time should I call up and I never heard back from him for like week , he said he was reallt stressed and a lot was on .
Another time I remember I went down to him and he was meant to meet me and I texted that I have arrived and he said just there in one min . He arrived two hours later and said he was busy with his friend because they had to go to police to do a statement . Someone's he also says he will call me right but forgets 
Every time he had stress with someone or something  he would cut me off , eventually I had enough and four months later I asked him does he wanna be together and he never responded to me , I asked him few times and he said I'll get back to you and he never done . So I blocked him everywhere . That was maybe early march 2016..
Later that fall he found my Snapchat and everyday he apologised for what he done he said he was depressed and a lot was going on . And literally every week he waned to meet up saying he missed me etc . He was asking me too meet up for few months so eventually few weeks ago , after 10
Months of him messaging me I agreeded . He came down to me and we hung out all day ( we did not have sex ) he went home in the evening and said he  misses me already and to see when I can come down next to see him .
And we messaged that night and monday I told him the weekend I'll be free , and then he dissapeared, like he done before. When I messaged him the second time he gave me a unfinished sentence like "" yeah that sounds .."" and I told him he didn't finish his sentence , I haven't heard from him since , I got angry few days later because he been putting things in his story on Snapchat and I told him not to contact me again. But I know deep down he will contacT me again .
Like what's wrong with this dude .
I genuinely know he doesn't have a second woman , like I truly believe that I just think there is something wrong in his head like mentally ..
What do you guys think ?"
1922,"I'm living with my parents, and due to a range of circumstances, we've had no money coming in apart from my ESA.  We have literally nothing between us at the moment until I get paid again on Friday.  I'm glad it's Wednesday, so we only have to get through tomorrow, but it's been really hard.

I've tried not to eat a lot for the sake of saving what we have.  So I've been under-eating.  We just have one big meal a day.  I'm tired, constipated, and miserable.  My mum and dad are going through the same thing, so we're trying to support each other.

I just feel like I need a hug.  You know that feeling when you're about to be done with some hard exercise, and you push and push up until the last few seconds with whatever energy you have left, and then you can collapse into a sweaty lump once it's done?  I feel like I'm in that moment, struggling to get to the finish line.  I just want to collapse into someone's arms.

Poverty is real shit, yo.  I'm only having to deal with mild poverty here, and I cannot cope.  I hate that so many people don't recognise the kind of poverty that people in the UK are having to live through every single day."
1923,"I have been diagnosed bipolar for 8 years now. I was medicated throughout my adolescence and now that I have been an adult for a while I have decided to try to manage my illness without meds. In the past 6 months that i have been completely off meds I have felt so much remorse towards my parents for keeping me on medication while I wasn't able to make the choice myself. Now that i am off my meds I feel like an entirely different woman. My morales are so much stronger and my judgement is so clear. I feel like I can feel every emotion so vividly. I had been doing really well too up until a month or so ago. Due to some situational aspects, I think, I have developed extreme anxiety and struggle with suicidal ideation almost daily. Of course the inital response would be to change my environment so those aspects don't come into play. However, at this point there is absolutely nothing I can do to escape my situation or change it at all. My situation doesn't allow me to be medicated and quite frankly I wouldn't ever want to be again. What do I do. I have no support.."
1924,"Hi.  I'm a thirty-one-year-old female who has recently received a diagnosis of cyclothymia after fifteen years of being diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

The psychiatrist who diagnosed me as having this version of bipolar disorder met with me when I was in the ICU after a suicide attempt.  I was not depressed or sad at all when I took many handfuls of pills, but rather furious.  I wanted revenge.  Of course the actions for which I sought revenge were the result of hallucinations due to a stomach bug making me unable to take my medication for a few days, in addition to complete lack of sleep for roughly three and a half days, but that was that.  Because of the motivation for the attempt, as well as a history of my long and sordid experience with anti-depressants, he gave me this new diagnosis.  To be honest, I worked as a technician in a psychiatric hospital for two years, and I didn't even know there was more than one kind of bipolar disorder!

I didn't mean to go on like this, but rather get to the crux of my dilemma.  I am having a lot of trouble with sleep.  I mean, I have had trouble with sleep my entire life, but this is getting on my nerves.  At bedtime, I take 200 mg of Seroquel, 25 mg of Lamictal, and 1600 mg of Gabapentin.  We have gone up as high as 300 on the Seroquel.  None of these medications have ever made me sleepy.  I've been on Risperdal, which never made me sleepy and gave me an elevated prolactin level, and since I'm on Medicaid, there are things my insurance just won't cover.  My NP tried to put me on Rozerem, for instance, which it wouldn't cover.  She is unwilling to put me back on Ambien, even before the suicide attempt, even though that worked for years.  I've tried Trazodone, to which I did not respond well, and obviously with the new diagnosis they tend to want to avoid antidepressants.

Benadryl is hit or miss, it will make me sleep like 1-2 nights in seven.  And since most over-the-counter sleep aids are simply Diphenhydramine under another name, also not helpful.  Unisom is also unhelpful.  Melatonin, again, has never made me sleepy.  I don't drink alcohol, which is to be avoided in concert with my medications, and I would never try recreational drugs.  So suggestions along those lines are decidedly unhelpful.

Hell, I don't know why I'm even positing this here.  I've never joined a forum before.  I'm just frustrated, and my currently weekly appointments with my NP are not bearing fruit.  I want sleep.  I like sleep.  Granted, my sleep hygiene sucks, but when you've spent three decades with insomnia, you know not to go to bed before you're drowsy.  I don't have a clock in my room and never look at the time on my computers/phone, so I just take the meds at 9-10 pm (when it actually does dawn on me to look) and next thing I know it's four in the morning.  I don't go to bed until I think there's a chance I might fall asleep because I hate tossing and turning.  It makes me think.  I don't like reflecting on my life, past, and current circumstances, so again I avoid going to bed until I'm drowsy.  Now, I have haunted websites trying to encourage good sleep hygiene for years, and I have tried most if not all of the suggestions to no avail.  I don't know what to do.

God, this was a long post.  Sorry.  I guess I needed to vent.

Cheers!

1928,"Around the age of 16 I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The next two years I had been in and out of behavioral hospitals. The people i had trusted wholeheartedly to help me often put me down and made me feel as if everything i was feeling was not valid. That i was ""too young"" to be feeling or acting the way i did. Fast forward to now - I am 21 and finding again I am struggling immensely to function. It has effected my relationships, studies, and work continuouosly over the years. I am at my wits end once again and I can no longer cover up these feelings/actions with substances or false hopes. I'm very afraid that when i seek out counseling again, I will feel as if my struggles are not valid -- or i worry that medication will make it worse.
Has anyone had these fears with seeking treatment, and have encouraging words? Input is much appreciated -- tee"

Been having horrible thouughts again is it my way of finding something that matters in life? I don't know but these thoughts are taking over may had to up my meds :*("
1930,"I've started drinking again.. And i didn't really notice.. Its been ??? 4-5-6 days... i don't remember.. And i don't really know what made me start again.. But i was thinking today.. i haven't had a drink since before i went into hospital the last time.. And that was at the beginning of 2013... That's like 4 years sober.. And now I'm pissed.. How did this happen ? Things have been slowly getting worse for me, but i never realized it had gotten this bad.

Now the big question... Should i continue drinking or should i stop.. The initial reaction is to say drinking is bad and i should stop.. But why ? What for this time.. I've already lost everything... 
Drinking is helping me pass the time... i get so board and lonely shut up in here all day every day.. I'm not hurting anybody.. it makes me feel better and I'm eating less... it helps me sleep to... 
Its weird... i feel.............. Different somehow.. i don't know what to do here... i do feel like shit, I'll give ya that..... But i also feel....... Relief.. I'm not worried about anything anymore.. Its helping me relax.. i don't know what to do...... Cheers

1931,"Me and my "" partner "" have been together for 2 years I love this man dearly , however 4 months ago is was like a light was switched out and he just totally changed , at first I thought it was depression as he works 2 jobs having little sleep and is exhausted 
Then totally out the blue in May he tells me he's not sure if he wants to be in a relationship with me or not apparently he needs to sort his head out ? When I asked what is going on In his head he can not tell me , apart from that he was allways feeling unhappy and that feeling would not go away . I noticed small things like he thought people where looking at him ect and he would start to clearly look uncomfortable and sweat , then as the weeks went on his behaviour became stranger , we had a hoilday booked which he refused to come on due to the feeling he did not deserve it .. I went with my friend and while I was away he was seen with another girl in his car apon my return I confronted him and he said they where just friends I contacted the girl and she confirmed this .. 
the next day he came to see me and seamed to be on an extreme high dancing around being silly and I "" thought at the time "" brilliant he's back to his old self .. how wrong was I any way that night we made love for the first time in a long time and he was really there where as the last few times it was not nice and felt very uncomfortable like I was sleeping with a stranger ..  immediately afterwards he became extremely low and has been that way now for a month , he's expressed feelings of hopelessness reckless driving  reckless driving he's told me he has  suicidal thoughts  and wants to no longer be here .. he then ended our relationship completely and when he did so there was no emotion there what so ever .. yet contacted me 3 days later like nothing had happened "" hey how are you"" I honestly thought are you serious? 
Any way I begged him to get a doctors app which he did and he went however they sent him away so I called the doctor my self and explained the seriousness of the situation and they called him back in they have  diagnosed moderate depression however I'm not convinced they say because he hasn't planned his own death is not high-risk they haven't even signed him off work .  He has all the symptoms of somebody with bipolar .. 
basically I'm at a loss he's contacting me via message however never or rarely ever comes to see me I do understand what I should do I no he's ended us because he's not making any rational decisions at the moment he thinks ending our relationship is the best thing to do for me I continually spends his time alone because apparently it's better for everybody and won't accept support from anybody anybody who is aware that he is ill is refusing to speak to apart from me  because he's not making any rational decisions at the moment he thinks ending our relationship is the best thing to do for me he continually spends his time alone because apparently it's better for everybody and won't accept support from anybody anybody who is aware that he is ill is refusing to speak to apart from me how do I go about supporting him and not getting hurt myself ?

1932,"I'm freaked out big style.. Suddenly I'm totally aware of the reality of my situation.. And its freaked me out.. And today didn't start off so bad.. i went to bed early last night.. Before midnight i think.. And got up real early this morning, before it got light.. So by the time eight o'clock came around i was fully awake instead of half asleep like i am when the alarm wakes me.. So i go to the shop and do my shopping... Then i had to make a second trip out to buy vinegar.. The supermarket i use doesn't sell vinegar... Which is weird, but they don't... And Iceland doesn't open till half eight.. So i had to wait and then go out again.. Anyway.. by nine i was all done, and thought I'd settle in for another day of sitting on my ass and doing nothing... Watched a bit of South Park.. Some Blakes7.. Then about midday i got board so i thought i go out !

People keep telling me i should get out more.. So i got dressed and went for a walk around the shops and i went to the bank... Took £20 out of the bank in fivers.. Brought a Chicken curry.. Two bottles of vinegar.. a liter of Strawberry Moo Milk and some painkillers.. Got back some time before one.. Ate two packets of pickled onion Space Raiders and then drank the whole liter of Moo Milk.. Which was a bloody stupid thing to do.. A, a liter of milk is allot in five minutes.. And B, it didn't sit to well on top of the Space Raiders... So i began to feel really sick.. i knew i didn't want to throw up.. So i thought I'd sleep it off... So i set an alarm for two o'clock and lay on the couch.. i can always sleep on the couch for some reason.. So i closed my eyes around one.. And as soon as i did the alarm went off.. it was two o'clock !... i Love the time travel aspect of sleep.. Sometimes i put myself to sleep to fast forward through the dull bits of my 'life'

Got up.. Sat in the chair.. Began doing the usual.. And then i just freaked.. I'm all alone now ! Ever since i got out of the hospital my wife? Had been coming to see me a couple of times a week.. But then 2-3 months ago she just broke off all contact.. She blocked my calls and stopped replying to my texts... Every time i tell anybody about this they say... New man !.. Which isn't helping.. My wife? Wasn't just my wife.. She was my only friend.. She was the only person i could talk to in real life..She was always there for me... And now shes not.. And there isn't anybody else... So I'm screwed... If i get evicted for any reason, I've got no where to go.. I'll end up on the streets.. My wife? Was like my safety net.. If i was stuck.. i could always sleep on her couch.. i don't know where she lives.. Or my daughter who lives with her... i don't know where my son lives.. i been completely marginalized and its really frightening....

But all the pills i took have kicked in and I'm starting to feel drowsy...i Think I'll eat.. Then go to bed"
1933,"there are good people on here, people who really try to help.   I don't post too much as I can go on and on, also I stay offline for days as the internet is not a good place for me.

just needed to say thank you."
1934,"not sure i can fight any longer.  I'm in so much debt there's no way out. i don't have any money for food right now, but all my bills are paid so tahts a plus.

my mood isn't getting any brighter even on doubled meds.  i've not had any ""flash"" points recently so I am stable just so dam low.


my head is dark, dark thoughts agaisn't myself and other's,  violence is raining in my mind.  i feel i am going to hrut myself or someone (not has i have attacked now in nearly 18 years)  i just fear it.

i have had enough.  life can't be this shit all the time."
1935,"hi guys, i need to vent some stuff here, sorry if i UPSET anyone.







i have really bad images in my head, and I guess you would call them horror fantays.  I play with these thoughts when they start, but I don't go looking for them.....  from causing harming to myself, others, mass murder.....  it can be anyone, from the old, t children to myself, a lot of this is aimed at myself.


they as you can imagine are very hard to deal with and upsetting, two hours of them is enough to make anyone sit and cry.

its been like this for over 20 years, i take a anti - pycotic drug which helps from time to time but recently they have been worse again.

i never really feel i should act on them, they are just there, in my line of vision like a bad movie."
1936,"had my meds doubled as I expressed  alot of my thoughts to my p doc.  he seemed concerned and made sure i had the crsis team number to hand.

my head is worse that it has every been, what goes on in there scares me.

not sure what I can say here so won't go into detail."
1937,"Hi everyone, I'm new to this and just needed somewhere to write this all out and find anyone who has even the remotest idea how I feel. My family and friends have been wonderful and are very supportive, but they find it difficult that I don't seem to be ""getting better"" and definitely don't understand my ""down days"" as they put it. 

I've suffered with depression for years, mostly low moods and lack of enthusiasm and motivation; they were easy enough to get over as I usually took a couple of weeks off work or studying to refocus and then I was fine. This time it's completely different. I was low after Christmas, something that happens every year once I've seen all my family together, I missed the talking, the laughs and the jokes, but considered it normal for me. Then midway through February it kicked in like normal, I couldn't get out of bed, would lay staring at the ceiling for hours on end and just wouldn't move. In short, it got worse; I became suicidal, self harmed and overdosed on tablets. I spent most of my time thinking of the easiest way to die.
I have horrendous mood swings, from being ridiculously elated to then feeling so low that I can't be on my own in case I take up on suicidal tendencies. 

I've seen my doctor countless times, who increased my medication and referred me to Italk. I talk couldn't help as they thought I needed help more involved than they could offer so they referred me to the CMHT, who saw me 3 times before arranging weekly counselling sessions. I've had my medication changed, which I've now been on for 9 weeks. It seems to be helping the mood swings by making them less dramatic, but they're still there. I'm still self harming and the suicidal thoughts are there, although the appeal to do something about them is much less apparent. My counsellor is teaching my techniques to distract myself when things get to bad, rather than looking for the triggers, which appear to be anything and everything. 

I don't know how I feel anymore, my mood changes from minute to minute which makes it difficult to settle to anything; I spend most of my day in my room, surrounded my half finished cross stitch projects, unopened books, puzzle books half filled in and DVD cases for films that I get bored with. 

I want to go back to my normal self; the girl who enjoyed being at work at the challenges it gave me, the girl who loved spending time with her nieces and nephews or going out to the cinema or for a meal with friends. Instead I'm sat at home, filled with anxiety about having to talk to anyone, having to leave the house and interact with people I do and don't know, just getting petrol for the car is enough to bring me out in a cold sweat and start me stammering. 

I feel like the girl I was is no longer there, that this is who I will be for the foreseeable future. My friends seem to be slowly slipping away from me as they get on with their lives and don't have time to spare for the nutcase that I have become. I have the most vivid dreams, that I fear are reality and result in me having to call around in the morning to ensure they aren't true. 

I lie to nearly everyone, I don't want them to see just how shattered and shredded I am on the inside. My counsellor thinks I'm making improvement, but I don't want to tell her the truth. My family know a little better, but they've never experienced me like this so have little understanding of how to be around me, my friends tire of my mood swings and have stepped back to let me 'focus on myself' rather than spend time with me.

I'll apologise for the ramblings, I write things down as they pop into my head. It has helped being able to put some of what I'm feeling into clear words on a screen. 
I'm not expecting a divulge of support or guidance, I'm not sure what I'm expecting from this to be honest. 
If you've managed to read this far, then I'll thank you for taking a few minutes out of your own day to listen to my internalised drama. 

Thanks, V"
1938,"I take my 400mg of seroquel faithfully. I am in fact terrified to not be on it (it hasn't even been a year of my meds actually helping me)

Last night i woke up to my 10 year old leaning over me holding the cat. It took me a sec to focus on her because I am rightfully groggy with meds when my kids wake me up. 

I asked her what was wrong and she didn't answer. I asked her again and reached my hand out and my hanf went through her. 

She wasn't actually there.  I started freaking out, blinking, rubbing my eyes. My hubby thought I was sleeping and was like its ok wake up honey i am here and all that. 

Could still see her. I even in a panic told my hubby what I was seeing and then she still didn't  disappear which freaked me out even more. Eventually she just sort of stepped back a bit and then vanished. 

I was so freaked out.

Just needed to share in a place where people get just how upset this made me. 

I was not dreaming. My hallucination (pre seroquel) always went away as I put words to them. And I always knew I was hallucinating (weird but true. This experience along got me extra appointments with my pdoc bc he was fascinated that I knee when I hallucinating)  

Hopefully tonight is better."
1939,"I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in November 2016 and didn't want to take ANY meds for ANY reason. After five back surgeries and all the medication I took, I told myself, once I no longer needed them, I would stop and never take another medication again. But here it is July and I found myself looking for the Lamactil that was prescribed all those months ago. I was just feeling horrible. Up one day and down the next. Needless to say, I called my Dr and made an appointment. He even called in the medicine so I could get started. As I research, bipolar disorder won't go away but can be controlled."
1940,"Because they accept thats the way it is.
Everything is bipolar just as all roads leads to Rome, apart from the M25 that just goes round in circles.

This is getting too deep

Sorry to have wasted your valuable time."
1941,Is it normal that when you are having a bipolar low can't do this shit anymore!! For your whole body to hurt..... or is it just all in my head. ??
1942,"Hi everyone, I'll try to keep this short but also try to get as much info in as I can. 
So let's begin. My wife has filed for divorce, moved out and got her own apartment and is totally pushing me away and running from me. Evan more odd is this has happened all in about 2 weeks. She sees a psychiatrist about once every 3 months to re-up here meds. She's on Effexor for depression and Adderall for ADHD. We've been married for about 3 years and she's been on different meds the whole time with us trying to figure out the best combo for us. I work out of state so I'm away from home for 4 months. This really all started towards the end of May 2017. She text me one day saying she was feeling down the past few days because she missed me so much, missed my physical touch, missed our bodies touching when we cuddle in bed,missed me holding her and missed me picking her up to give her big hugs. During this same down time she met a guy whom she later described to me as ""pulled on her heartstrings"" and ""had deep meaningful conversation with"". From researching out phone records I found out that they had started these conversations on June 7, 2017. On June 8, 2017 we had a normal day and since I work out of town we would FaceTime every night, that night she Facetime'd me in lingerie so of course I'm loving it and we had our normal chat. We ended that with our normal I love you's and later I sent her a text telling her I appreciated her doing that and appreciated how much effort she put into our marriage. She ended up texting back at 4am which I thought was odd but ok. I came to find out she went had gone out drinking which is highly odd behavior for her because she's normally is bed asleep by 8pm. The text at 4am read something like this,""I love you more than anything in this world. You are my everything"". So Friday rolls around and it's normal until Friday night when I find out that this guy she's has been secretly talking to comes in town from 2 hours away where he lives because she's invited him to a golf tournament on Saturday. I never hear anything from her Friday night because she is at a friend of ours birthday party where she invites this new guy also. She is so against anything extramarital that our friends don't even think twice about it because they know her personality. Saturday comes and goes with not much talk bc I'm getting that gut feeling. Sunday gets around and when she Facetime me this night she wants out of our marriage. ""We just aren't compatible, she hasn't been happy for a long time"" etc etc etc. Things I've never heard her mention not even once. In fact for the past few months before this she's been obsessed with getting pregnant. Like so obsessed that she flew out to where I work during April when she was ovulating. Even talked to my parents the week before about getting pregnant and throwing out baby names. I even found baby clothes she'd bought while I was away at work. I mean obsessed. So from June 7 she starts what she calls and emotional affair to June 11 and she wants a divorce. Something just isn't fitting. We've never had problems. Yes we've had our heated arguments but in fact the last one we had she said she kinda enjoyed our arguments because when we made up it made her feel closer to me and made our relationship feel stronger. I might could understand divorce IF one person could have said they saw it but NO not 1. I mean family, girlfriends, and myself were all shocked by what she was saying. I've tried looking at the internet at different disorders but I'm no doctor who can nail it down. Her Psychiatrist told her last year that she thought she has a slight case of bipolar but has never changed any meds to focus on that. She claims that she's had anxiety disorders since she was young. Also the same with depression. She does have bipolar in her family. Her Aunt died last year from a self inflicted gunshot wound to the stomach. 

So she's gone from our home right now and filed for divorce. I will avoid signing any papers because in my heart I know this is something else. She won't be able to financially make it with the salary from her job and normally she makes very well thought out financial plans. She's done nothing but run from me over the past few weeks. We did get a chance to talk one day at the park where she sat in my lap telling me all of the same ""I'm not happy and haven't been happy for awhile/I love you but I'm not in love with you"" type speech. Then after us talking for 3 hours and me being more confused we are taking the long way around the park to get back to our vehicles and she asked if I'd hold her hand while we walked. To say the least I'm confused and any insight would be greatly appreciated."
1943,"I deliberately took too many meds this afternoon.. not at overdose levels.. Just more than prescribed.. Just enough to numb me out.. I've been asleep now off and on for twenty four hours...
Now its 9:30pm and i just got up... I'm feeling pretty cruddy... Sometimes living on my own gets to me.. The rules are different.. Sitting here in my underwear again.. i don't get dressed anymore.. What's the point ? Haven't got dressed since Friday morning.. I'm just sitting around half naked like some sort of a bum... i think this is Gods way of telling me i need to drink more alcohol... :low:

1944,"I've been diagnosed with cyclothmia and have been taking lamotragine for two years. This week has been hectic and I forgot to take nearly all of my doses for over a week. 

I'm one of those prats that always thought that I was fine, so now I don't need medication - I was wrong. 

My mood has been so irrational and erratic. I couldn't deal with my daughter having a tantrum and was really awful to her. My other half has got the brunt of my mood, especially when we had a falling out last night. 

I keep fantasising about running away, then attempting suicide. This morning I self harmed. I want to go out drinking but I lost my card. I've been out of the house all day and I can't face going back to the walls. 

I feel like I have nobody to turn to. My best friend has a new guy and my other half is just as angry as I am. My therapist cut me off because I couldn't make the appointments with her, even though I kept ringing to change the dates.

I feel like there's no answer to this, I just need someone to stop this feeling in my head. Who ever said that cyclothmia was a mild disorder clearly doesn't live with it.

I want to die, but my daughter needs me."
1945,"Hi all thanks in advance. This is my very first post. 

My whole life I feel I've been singled out. I don't even know where to begin with that. Anyway recently especially I've been having some really bad mood swings. I've experienced every single emotion to the most extreme, good and bad. I feel like everywhere I go EVERYONE is judging me. I think this is a result of being rejected and betrayed a lot throughout my life by friends, people at work, classmates at school and even family at times. I can give many examples of people singling me out, making fun of me and judging me, just ask. I have tried to let go of the grudges but they've burrowed emotional scars deep into my subconscious. The more it happens the more it builds up. 

Lately I've been especially concerned because I have manic episodes. Part of the reason why I think is because I've recently stopped self medicating (yes substance abuse and or addiction). I've also just stopped cold turkey a smoking habit, one week ago today. I've been very agitated and on edge and getting furious at the most trivial of things. It has definitely exaggerated my symptoms. Two years ago I harmed myself badly enough I had to go to the hospital. It was probably one of the most embarrassing days of my life honestly. I've even had suicidal thoughts and thats the main reason why I'm worried. I want to make sure I can reduce those tendencies as much as possible because when I'm in my right state of mind I go 'man what the hell was I thinking!?"" 

I've been to multiple therapists and on multiple medications. Right now exercise and vitamins are my medicine. I'm thinking of starting st john's wort or a safe herbal remedy. Like I've said I've had a lot of self harm thoughts but never to harm anyone else. Sorry its a bit long and thanks if you've read this far."
1946,"I ask because i have only recently been diagnosed so this is all new to me. I have been hypomanic for the last two weeks, been quite irritable, been VERY industrious around the house except with the odd spot of dancing in the garden in the early hours with my headphones on lol but my cpn is monitoring me, i thought it was a mixed state but i was told it sounded like i was hypomanic. However, this morning my mood has dropped extremely low and i am crying at everything and keep thinking ""why am i even here?"" and the thoughts of ending it are back. Its all come so suddenly, nothing has happened to trigger it really except an argument with my teenage daughter but we argue all the time (teenage stuff) and now i think im going mad. I don't want to tell my other half as prior to my hypo i had a full blown manic episode which led to my diagnosis and prior to that a severe depression where i was self harming. They gave me anti depressants which led to the full blown manic episode but i told them a long list of stuff i have done over the years which they have now said were manic episodes, including affairs, drinking, fighting,getting into debt etc
Is it possible to go from being so high one day to so low the next? am i going mad?
I'm only on Apriprazole atm.
Thanks in advance"
1947,"hey I';m sorry if this goes on.  I'm so alone, my relationship on teneeyars is on its last legs I've not seen the woman in a month.  I have no real friends as such, well none that help me in the real world. I also don't get a lot of support if any from my daughter.

1949,"My children are grown men now. All three of them contacted me within the last couple of days. So then I had a dream where I had just had a baby but the hospital wouldn't give the baby to me. The baby represents my 3 sons, who were given to my ex by my mother when I was incarcerated in the psyche ward when I had lupus. 

So I woke up devastated from crying in my dream. 

I promptly checked my email and found a post in a facebook page that's about mental health. I wrote a response and to make a long story short, I got kicked out of the page. 

I have little contact with the Compassion that I am. 

I'm also upset because my mother is very sick and 86 and can barely walk and she calls me to tell me she doesn't feel well.  She is very upset and breathing strangely on the phone. She said she wishes she were dead.

I don't know why I am in touch NOW with the feelings of losing my children at ages 13, 14 and 15."
1950,"I've been on priadel for 2 maybe 3 years which has helped the manic episode and was helping the depressive to an extent.
I also have a dissociative disorder which gets out of hand when depressed. Voices and some hallucinations.

I have been on all mood stabilisers and lithium is pretty much all I can tolerate
Lamotrigine stopped me sleeping and killed my sex drive, valproate made me put on 3 stone, carbamazepine made me angry.
Antipsychotics:
Quetiapine I was on for about 10 years, got fed up of being 3 stone heavier and having a high cholesterol despite being a vegetarian and a little eater. And I've tried again recently, and in 4 weeks I've put on 6lbs and I've watched the calories what what I eat.
Risperidone made me lactate 
Aripiprazole made me restless and agitated
Olanzapine made me fat
Trifluoperazine or stelazine...tardive dyskinesia
Levomepromazine...I couldn't function..

What else is there?! 
I'm seeing psych today and I'm desperate as I e finally landed a job I love and can progress career wise..they've got be training before the probation has finished.

1951,"Hi everyone,

I'm new to the forum so please forgive me if I'm posting in the wrong place.  This'll be a long one...

I have some serious worries about my wife and wanted help, if possible. 

Bit of background first.  She is 35, I'm 29.  We're both female.  We were together for 8 years and 5 months, and got married in April.  

She has a history of anxiety and depression.  She hasn't been able to work for around 6 years and also has fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome.  She had always been in employment, but the combination of anxiety & depression, then the fibromyalgia and IBS have made it so difficult for her.  

So we got married in April and it was truly the best day of our lives.  I'll never, for as long as I live, forget the look on her face as she turned round and saw me walking down the aisle towards her.  She could not have faked that look, I'm 100% sure of it.  I have read and reread the card she wrote for me to read that morning, and you cannot write things like that if it's not true.

We had an unlucky first month of marriage - I caught gastroenteritis twice, she ended up in hospital for a week with a bowel impaction...it was just a rubbish time.  We were never going on honeymoon until August because I'm in my final year at university and had no time off.  So come August we had said it would like a combined honeymoon/graduation celebration.  In the fortnight before she left, she had been distant.  I'd asked if she was okay, if we were okay and she said yes every single time.  I'd have pushed harder for answers but she's always been the type that will clam up if you try to do that. 

So less than 5 weeks after the wedding, she told me she wasn't in love, and left.  She went to her the home of a friend ""for a couple of hours"" but then texted to say she wasn't coming home.  She came back the following morning to pack a bag, and left properly then.  I worked nightshift at my job the night before this happened and she drove me to work, told me she loved me and we texted back and forth until she went to sleep - just like normal.  I've read back on all of the messages looking for clues but there are none.  She picked me up the next morning and was laughing and joking, sending me voice notes asking if we could go get breakfast somewhere.  I went to sleep, and when I woke she was ready to make dinner, but still seemed down and distant, then I asked one final time what was wrong, and she admitted it.

Obviously I was (and am) devastated.  Additionally, I'm confused, hurt and downright heartbroken.  We have a cat, so she comes to visit her often and we've spoken a little.  From these conversations, I seriously suspect at this stage that she's bipolar, type 2.  

She kept things from me, which I've now found out about.  About a fortnight before our wedding, she went to her doctor and had her antidepressants increased (Fluoxetine.  She went from 20mg - 40 mg), and didn't tell me.  She often sees her GP so I had no reason to question it.  In the weeks following the split, she told me that she showed up in tears at the surgery and has been further increased to 60mg of the drug.  She's also been given a referral to the community mental health team. 

So, why do I suspect bipolar?

She cheated on me in 2010.  We moved in together that summer, with so much ahead of us.  Then she suffered a bereavement and around a month later, found someone online (via a forum at her workplace that connected the offices around the country) and casually told me that she didn't know who she wanted.  She flew 500 miles to meet this person, and when she landed from her flight she told me she desperately wanted to come back.  I breathed a huge sigh of relief, but she slept with the other person that night.  When she flew back the next day, she was nonchalant about the whole thing.  I was the one who fought to keep us together, and took her to her GP, which is when she originally got the antidepressants. 

We had some strange weather - essentially thunder and lightening without the thunder - and she was genuinely convinced that MI5 were coming for her.  She was terrified and truly believed it was the government.

She had always had anger issues.  She's punched walls, self-harmed (only superficial cuts, and lots of tattoos) and physically assaulted a manager where she worked.  She's never done anything to me, but is always ""ready"" for a fight with anyone else.  

In a bid to stop the unemployed rot, she was accepted onto an Open University course.  She was SO excited about it and couldn't wait to begin.  She quit after a month because deadlines were causing her strsss and she felt too dumb to continue.  I tried to help, but it made no difference. 

She got a part time job, which was amazing news.  She quit after a week because roadworks forced her to get lost on her way home.  She cried for hours and said she couldn't do it.  Anxiety had kicked in and ruined it. 

She comes up with huge plans.  Her thoughts are that she'll never work for someone; she hates authority, so she'd like her own business.  In the past she's wanted to buy a pub, a cafe, a shop, a kids' activity place and other things.  When I remind her of the costs involved and her lack of experience in running a businsss, she says ""don't worry about that"" and ""I'll sort it"".  

She sometimes speaks at 100mph.  Particularly when I come home from work.  She wants to tell me everything within two minutes.  She said that if she doesn't get the words out, she'll forget. 

Her memory is appalling - she tells the same story three times and asks the same questions. 

Since leaving, when visiting our cat, she has washed dishes/clothes and taken naps while I'm out.  Not really normal behaviour I'd expect.  We were discussing her lack of money one day, and she suddenly told me she'd like to learn to play the saxophone.  When I questioned it, she asked me what was wrong with wanting to learn to play?

Those are my observations, and I've tried to talk to her since she walked out.  She's opened up a bit and said:

She hasn't felt normal since she was around 14 years old.  At the time she told her mum, but nothing was done. 

Her childhood memories are limited.  She mainly remembers bad things, very little birthday/Christmas memories.

She identified with her ex-brother in law who is confirmed bipolar (not sure which type).  He was unmedicated and became paranoid, violent and eventually threw away his wife and kids.  

She said she can go to sleep one night worrying about being ""blown up by a suicide bomber"" and wake up the next morning excited ""like I'm going on holiday"".

When she looks in the mirror, she said she expects that her reflection might talk to her.  She believes it's more of a window than a mirror.

She also said that there's two of her.  She feels like there's one person - the real her - who's got anxiety and is socially awkward, and a second person who's confident, the life and soul of the party and is carefree.  She also mentioned that she feels like she doesn't control her life.  Like she's in a video game where someone else is controlling her.

She picked up our wedding photos yesterday and emotionally told me that she couldn't look at them.  Then, today, she came to see our cat and sat, sobbing on my bed.  She was crying so much that she was physically sick a few minutes later.  When I asked her what was wrong, she didn't know.  I saw her again this afternoon, and she acted like nothing had happened and went for a nap on my couch.  

As I said, she's been referred to the community mental health team, but this was weeks ago and she's still waiting.  I've offered to buy her private treatment but she declined the offer. 

I'm going out of my mind with worry.  She's sleeping in different places, living out of her car and has almost no income.

I fully appreciate that she isn't diagnosed yet, but does any of what I've wrote resonate with you?  I'm worried her antidepressant dose is doing her more harm than good now.

I know bipolar husbands and wives walk out on their partners without warning all the time.  I've read lots of stories and they're all heartbreaking.  I cannot accept that our marriage is over, but I feel like I'm setting myself up for a lifetime of misery by holding on.

She wants help, knows there's a huge problem with her mental health and is desperate to see a professional who can diagnose whatever it is, and treat it.  But her anger is worrying; if she feels cornered, she'll walk out.  

I don't even know what I want from this post - advice, info, stories.  Anything at all, I guess."
1952,"Is He Manic or just a jerk? (Edited prev thread).

Hello: Sorry for the repeat but I left out some details that may be important and I don't know how to edit previous.

Okay. I dated a man for a little over a year. I knew going in he was Bipolar, and some other conditions mixed in. He was very gentle, kind, and honest. We dated casually for about 2 months before we made it official. He made Sure I knew all the deep dark secrets from his past and all the terrible things he had been through. Sure he wasn't perfect but who is? One of the issues we had a long the way was his toxic mother. She was jealous of the relationship we had and how close he was to my daughter. We actually lived with her for About 4 months. She started verbally attacking my daughter and I and he got upset and decided to move out. He cut off all contact with her for About 6 months until he found out she was in the mental hospital. During the time he wasn't talking to her she tried twice to use his little sister and his ex to break us up. About 5 days prior to is breaking up he missed his shot and was speaking frequently to his mother via Facebook. The day we broke up he was unmedicated and woke up with a major attitude which started a nasty fight. He begged me to not to make him leave but there was so much going on at the time I had to.. I just couldn't handle him like that anymore. So, when we broke up he went to live with his mother who now hates me. In 24 hours she agreed to sell him a carand pay the insurance So long as he stays away from me. 10 days after the initial break up he has a new girlfriend ""A"". That lasts about 10 days and he's telling me he just said that to upset me and they were only roomate's sharing a tent in his mothers yard. So this is ex gf #1. A few days later he pops up with ex # 2 We shall call her ""T"". T is married and has begun hanging around him again at the urging of his mother and sister. About 2 weeks after that, he tells me he wants to be with me and get to know each other again but his mother cannot know. Like I care lol. So, things are going super good. He was coming to see me almost every single day. We were having a blast . he even kissed me in front of our friends. Then the end....his mom needed a ride to a community yard sale that he had invited me to. He mentioned to her I might come along and that's when stuff got bad. He was cold to me and starting fights with me to the point I just said forget it. The same week I broke off what ever it was we had going he went out of town. While he was away we talked on the phone almost every night for hours. He even called my daughter I'm her birthday and told me he wanted me to go with him next time. He went up there on a Friday and was going to stay a whole week. He ended up coming home on Tues because he had stuff to do. He came and saw me Weds and told me he had missed me and had liked the way things were going. I told him that kind of situation wasn't working for me. I noticed that he seemed different to me....even his bright blue eyes seemed black and his skin was shiny....so Thursday ivsaw him and he picks a fight with me out of nowhere screaming its not going to work. Friday he meets a girl he supposedly has been best friends with for 6 years but no one has ever heard of. Saturday he's in love with her and they are a couple and going to make a life together. They have been shacked up at his mothers for 2 weeks. She hasn't even seen her daughter because of this. So, after gf # 3.....T and I start talking and realize he was seeing us both at the same time and was even on Meet Me hooking up with other girls. This is so totally not who he is....is he manic or just a jerk?"
1953,"Okay. I dated a man for a little over a year. I knew going in he was Bipolar, and some other conditions mixed in. He was very gentle, kind, and honest. Sure he wasn't perfect but who is? One of the issues we had a long the way was his toxic mother. She was jealous of the relationship we had and how close he was to my daughter. About 5 days prior to is breaking up he missed his ahot. The day we broke up he was unmedicated and begged me to not do it. I just couldn't handle him like that anymore. So, when we broke up he went to live with his mother who now hates me. In 24 hours she agreed to sell him a car with the condition he stays away from me. Within 6 weeks of the break up we had decided to start over and see what happened. Now things were going really great for a couple weeks until he told his Mom we were hanging out. He got really weird after that. He went out of town for a few days and called me every day and even wanted me to go up there with him. He came home on Tues. Saw him Weds and Thurs, Friday he had a new girlfriend entirely. So come to find out he was seeing me and his other ex back and forth. He was on hook up sites.....all this is not him. Now he's cruel and saying I made it all up ......thoughts?"

Hi can someone pls help ? I've been trying to talk myself out of the fact I'm convinced I'm being watched by dwp , I don't go out much anyway -due to anxiety and this feeling of being watched I walked to the local shop a very rare thing for me and they was a man parked up and he was watching me I try to talk myself out of this feeling when I was walking back home I passed the car I turned round and he had his phone pointing straight at me !! Clear as day , my immediate rezctionw as to take a pic of his number plate and I made it obvious at which point he drove off fast I rang the police and reported it giving them his reg number rang for an update to be told it was a company car and not suspicious - does this mean it wasn't a private individual being a weirdo taking pics ?

Should I tell my pdoc or is it nothing to be concerned with?"
1956,"Bipolar-No diagnosis, GP thinks i have it, several years ago psychiatrist very unhelpful.

For at least 10 years i have been battling mental health, i went to the doctors about 8/9 years ago and doctor referred me to a psychiatrist as he suspected i had bipolar.
 At the appointment the psychiatrist basically said i don't have bipolar as people with bipolar sell there houses and get in £1000's and £1000's debt. So i was basically fobbed off.
 My metal heath has deteriorated since then and it is causing major problems with my marriage till the point that me and my wife don't even know if we can stay together.
 I went to the doctors yesterday(it was a different doctor too 9 years ago) and he mentioned bipolar again and is referring me to a psychiatrist again. I am now worried that the psychiatrist will just not believe me and i won't receive the help i know i need!
 My symptoms are basically hard for me to explain because i have lost my identity i don't know what is me anymore and what is mental health issues. Some days i am just hyper and i will sign up to collage courses and apply for jobs and do loads of house work and gardening and have so much energy, this can last for 1 day or a week then for a few hours or a day i will be on top of the world and plan for the future and think i can achieve anything and i will be hyper telling jokes and laughing and feel on top of the world, that what i drop off and hit rock bottom with depression. I don't want to talk to friends or family i get irritable, I don't want to do house work and just basically don't have the energy to do anything. this can last for a week or 2 then i will be ""normal"" for a while or what i think is normal i don't feel overly down but i do feel down and i don't feel overly happy but i do feel happy, life sort of feels Grey! after that i can rather drop down into bad depression again or i can go hyper and the cycle starts again. I also have conversations in my head and answer myself sometimes it is with my wife sometimes friends sometimes if i have a appointment it will be with the person i am going to see, it's almost as if the left side of my brain is talking to my right side. I spend money as if it is going out of fashion it has got to the point were my wife cant trust me to even have the bank card as i would go out for a pint of milk and spend £30 on scratch cards and drinks and anything really i just had to spend the money, i would go behind my wifes back and order things online just because i had an impulse to buy them. My wifes say i have become very self centred and only want to talk about me and my things and not bother with the family. I also have major obsessions and if i get something in my head i can't stop thinking about it until i get it if i don't have the money for it i will try to find the money, i have ran up £1000's of debt by getting mobile contracts for the phone sand not paying them and they were too much for our budget and catalogue debts i have got the point were my credit is so bad i can't get credit for anything and have recently had a CCJ. I am a perfectionist i do alot of art and creative things but i never think they are good enough and always want them to be better and think they should be even though everyone else says how fantastic they are. Now i am waiting for the appointment with the psychiatrist it has sent me in a really big depression and i am petrified he will say i am fine and i won't get the help i desperately need, if i don't get the help soon i am going to lose everything including my wife and kids."

1958,"Bit of a random question - if you work for a council and pay into a pension fund, would you get a payout if you committed suicide?  On paper, you get a Death In Service benefit of three times your salary but I believe that part of it is provided by an insurer rather than the pension provider.  I've always been under the impression that most normal life insurance policies will not pay out in the event of suicide, so if that's the general rule then I would assume that the Death In Service benefit would be the same if it's paid by an insurer? I know it's a bizarre question but I've been wondering about it for years, and there's no polite or surreptitious way of finding out without your management or pension provider thinking you're a weirdo, section-able and sackable lunatic!

Waiting so long for psychiatrist help and they're all against me anyway so will tell me I'm normal and will get no help again... 

In a bad way, death keeps showing me what it feels like and everytime I read the news or talk about death, he reminds me what it's like and what happens and I'm scared. It makes me cry.

1961,"I am definately not addicted to codeine and I am probably fortunate in that in larger amounts it makes me itch like mad. However, I have found over the last couple of days that I have chosen codeine/paracetamol as a painkiller rather than paracetamol alone. There is no obvious change to my mood but I think I definately became more relaxed. Maybe psychological, maybe just because my tension headache was gone....or maybe it adjusted my mood. I don't know.
I found myself trying to work out how I could take more.....basically up to the annoying itch part or thinking, if I itched during the day it would not be so bad....but of course it would.
As I say, I am not addicted but I do have a problem in as much as I have (and still do) psychologically depend on some drugs. At the moment I am mentally missing diazepam but I have no physical addiction.

Anyone?

1962,"Hiya
Tomorrow I have my last hearing to decide whether my employer will sack me or not. I've been off suck for ten months, firstly treated for depression then diagnosed with bipolar 1 and remedicated! I'm pretty stable just now but knowing I have this meeting tomorrow is causing the panic to bubble away inside me and I'm really scared of losing it in the meeting. I lost control in the last one and sobbed through it hence being on a very last chance. My employer has not been supportive at all, particularly my line manager and her manager. This time I'm seeing much higher management and I'm terrified. One of the problems is I'm a nurse and I can't return to clinical practice until cleared to by psychiatry and that's likely to happen they say but they want a bit more stability first. In the meantime I want them to give me something to do as I really can't afford to not be paid anymore! I have a great union rep, now the last one was about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike, but even so I'm so afraid of being unemployed by lunchtime tomorrow. Don't know what I hoped to achieve from this post but thought it might be good to write it down, so far that's not working for me!

1963,"Hi, I was given a provisional diagnosis on Friday after a second appt with a Psychiatrist after a Manic episode the preceding week. He has now put me on Apriprazole. I am a little bit worried as do not know an awful lot about Bipolar as i have always thought my  ""crazy ways"" were just that and i had a long standing battle (25 years) with severe depression. Since Friday after coming down from a manic episode i have slipped into another low mood, with the exception of i have a very high energy level and its making me very irratable. I get very frustrated if i cant be doing something and almost to the point of getting angry, i cant sleep, cant eat yet my mood i would say is still low. i have this bubbling feeling inside like i want to run for miles and miles which is the opposite to how i normally feel when im so low in mood. Can anyone explain this if its anything connected to Bipolar at all? It started before i started my medication.
many thanks."
1964,"Not so hot to tell you the truth.. I think I've figured out what med combination it is that makes me sleep.. So I've been doing that since Friday morning.. I take pills... Wake up... Take more pills, and go back to sleep. So now its like eight o'clock Saturday evening... And I don't really remember the last 36 hours. But now I'm awake and out of pills.. Don't get a resupply until Wednesday.. So the next few days are going to be interesting... My injection is Tuesday.. Not looking forward to that.. I don't smoke in the livingroom till after shes been.. I'm guessing shes a none-smoker.. So its not really fair to ask her to put up with three feet of smog while shes here.

Its not for two days and I can already feel myself stressing.. Got to take my prescription in Monday.. That can be a nightmare.. Sometimes they just don't do it.. How hard can it be... 

I just sat through one of the worst films I've ever seen.. I've got to stop downloading dramas.. They suck !.. But I really don't have anything better to do...

I got to figure out a way to get stoned.. My ex would know somebody but she just stopped talking to me about three months ago, without explanation.. Putting the peaces together I think it was a money thing..

So I really feel like crap today.. What's left of it... Maybe its a reaction to all the pills and I'll feel better tomorrow... I should really go eat something, but I'm too depressed.."

I don't want to be but if I come off I become very unwell. But even on all this medication I still struggle a lot with my mood, in a good day I am literally the most happy person going, I want so much for myself....but it doesn't last. Ive also had anorexia but that was more of a issue from ocd and controlling what I eat. atm I'm 5ft7 and a low weight.

1966,"I have bipolar but not on medication. I was,for several years, but had to come off of them when i became pregnant unexpectedly last year.I also didn't like the fact that they made my speech sound slurred and people would think i was drunk when i wasn't which was very embarrassing.

I manage my condition by keeping a very stable routine, going to bed the same time every night and waking up at the same time, even on weekends. Eating well, exercising,limiting stress as much as possible, keeping a journal and meditating. I also takes notes when i feel my mood changes and take steps to keep myself relatively under control.But in saying that i still do have times when i am on a high where i become loud and over-the-top and low times where i sit in my room crying.

Iam 2 years off any meds and the main problem is my anxiety!I get anxious many times without reason at all!
i experience alternating bouts of anxiety and depression and sometimes both anxiety and depression at the same time!One day i have more depression and the other day less depression and more anxiety,it's very strange!Every day is different!
What i see is that i have wave of mild/modarate depression that comes for some hours/2-3 days the max and then goes away!I can call it ""depression attack"".They can last anywhere from hours to 2-3 days, and then they suddenly vanish and return to normal!Is this normal to happening?Iam afraid that maybe is cyclothymia??I don't have other symptoms of cyclothymia!
Can you please help me?
Thanks in advance!!"
1972,"I'm bored. Death sounds appealing but I'm not suicidal. I don't even know If I'm depressed, I'm just not happy in life and I'm full of rage.

Hi there, Not sure if this should even be posted here, But I'm going to go ahead and post it anywho. Apologies if it's in the wrong section. 

Never really discussed this before, And I certainly haven't told anybody about these thoughts in case I get pictured as crazy, I'm not crazy. I'm normal and capable of thinking for myself. For all I know, these could be normal thoughts and I'm exaggerating a bunch, But I want to discuss it now because I've had a rough week and I've been thinking about this more than normal and to further extents than usual. 

Actually, It's been a great week for me. The greatest week I've had this year, But I'm still unhappy, Actually, I'm feeling the worst I've felt all year, Just yesterday I had urges to self harm, Which later that night turnt into urges to take a bunch of pills and alcohol... For absolutely no reason, It's rare that I get to that extent, Its just so random. I feel stupid and embarrassed for even writing this paragraph.

I've also recently been plagued with nightmares. I've always had nightmares and gotten used to them, I usually just wake up, shrug it off and go back to sleep but recently It's gotten progressively worse. In 2 weeks I woke up twice jumping across the bed waking up my girlfriend thinking I had killed my daughter by accident, No idea why.

Overall though, I'm bored. Bored with life. Bored of living, I'm full of rage and anger, I'm seriously afraid that I'm going to lose control someday and hurt somebody, Although I control myself fairly well. I lack any sort of motivation and I'm never really happy.. I'm Content, But not happy. I live for my girlfriend and my daughter, They're the only things I have and love and thats the only time I'm content and happy in life. Death sounds appealing to me, I just don't care enough to live other than than for them. I've become a master in the arts of appearing to be a confident, polite, cheerful, Happy and uplifting human to others, But realistically, I'm not remotely interested. I've never been interested. I don't want friends, I don't want company, I don't want to socialize if I don't have to. It's not me. I'm just bored, angry empty and negative about everything. I just feel.. dead. 

I've never really seriously self harmed (moderated), But I did that rarely (Last time 3m ago?) So I don't think it really counts. I feel I've done well to suppress any urges or feelings I have and when I'm feeling terrible, I usually just listen to relaxing music, Sit in my chair or lay in bed and have long thinks to decompress, I guess in a way, I meditate. Lol. 

I've never tried,Nor would I ever actually kill myself, I know this for a fact, But that doesn't stop me from finding it appealing.

So yeah, That's me.
This is the first time I've actually expressed how I feel on a day to day basis. I've dropped hints to my girlfriend before, But nothing ever came of it. Just small talk. Just no have no idea what's wrong with me, All I know is this can't be normal. As I said before, This week has been the worst week I've endured all year and wanted to vent a little.

1976,"Hi all, 

I'm relatively new to the forums, but I've been diagnosed with OCD, but I am not sure it is my only problem. I have had a long history of mental illness. A lot of it being cycled. 

For my whole life, I've suffered with moodswings. Periods of depression where I have been suicidal and also very high moods. These have been going on for as long as I can remember. I remember being a teenager and seeing things at night, depending my mood I'd be wanting it to kill me or I'd talk to it like it was my friend. If I was in a neutral mood, I wouldn't see it. I began to acknowledge they'd always be there. Fast forward some years, and I became so unbelievably depressed and tried to kill myself. Then fast forward some more and I was manic pretty much for a whole year, with a few off days. I became this monster where I became arrogant which is not like me. Combined with an eating disorder, I thought I was the best thing since sliced bread. I became extremely sexually charged and I slept with a lot of people without really thinking about it. After that year, I became extremely depressed again. I took to alcohol and codeine and I ended up becoming ill and ended up in hospital. The hospital psychologist told me I drank too much water and was diluting my tablets which was probably why I was crazy (or words to that effect). 

After that, I met my partner, and for the year, I was fine. I then got my diagnosis of OCD because of intrusive thoughts and paranoia and put me on sertraline which sent me INSANE. I was manic for 3 days with hallucinations and I was arrogant again. Today I've upped my dose and I am not sure if I want to get up and run about or feel suicidal out of frustration. So now I'm all mixed again.

I have seen a psychiatrist, but this was 3 years ago now, and he cleared me of borderline personality disorder and I did mention maybe bipolar. But he discharged me anyway as he said he didn't want to diagnose me as it could affect my work and didn't want to label me (which is fine). But I need a diagnosis as I need the help. I've lived like this for far too long. I do not fit the bill for bipolar 2 as although I meet 2/3 of the criteria, I fail on the last 1/3 as these did not cause me major problems i.e. with debt (ok I spent a lot but I didn't go into debt) or family as I am very good at hiding my illnesses. I am guessing the sertraline has sent me back into overdrive but I'm scared. I need help, and I do not know how to go around asking for it as everybody seems to go against me. I don't think it's bipolar 2, but I know it's something. Every time I seem to try and explain what is going on, I get a GP saying ""you can't have BPD because you don't set things on fire!"" (that is an exact quote)

I can't work out if this is just an obsession with my OCD and I'm stressing about nothing... but I know those moodswings are there and always have been. I can't actually explain why I have mental illness as I had a pretty good childhood, minus things such as bullying but I'm a grown woman at 24 now. I've been through therapy and that was something that definitely didn't attribute.

Oh my gosh, sorry I've been rambling. I've upped my dose of meds so that's probably why! Sorry if this is a long post and makes no sense :drunk:

Thanks for any advice."

1978,"Hey everyone,

I've not been on here in a while. 
I actually recovered and got my life back on track. I was on lithium and Abilify. 
But I roughly took it in April and come May, I had stopped taking it. 
And I was fine, no immediate relapse. 

But now I feel odd. 
I feel very flat and emotionless, I'm feeling very tired and I have lost interest in creativity. I have started to neglect my personal care too. 
I've been socially isolating myself too and I don't want to go out, I keep worrying that there are people that know me, but I don't know them and that they'll come up to me in the street and I'm scared as to what they might do. 

My mother is concerned that I'm relapsing. 
But I don't feel depressed. I don't have thoughts of self harming or suicidal thoughts. 
I know that I'm not depressed nor am I manic. It's very confusing. 

Has a anyone else had an experience like this? 

I've also become irritable, I don't really talk and I just sit on the sofa and watch TV. I know I'm not feeling myself. 

It's very odd behaviour for me."
1979,"I've been taking Lithium since I was diagnosed Bipolar 1 about 6 years ago. Lately though my moods have been fluctuating wildly and my bouts of uncontrollable anger that only subsides through physical activity (using a punching bag etc.) have came back. 
Now aside from the usual stressors in my life nothing has changed all that much lately so I'm wondering: could the lithium be becoming less effective over time? Is it about time to start looking at being placed on a new stabilizer or to just increase my Lithium? (I take 900-1200 mg a day.)"
1980,Have been down A&E the past few hours after contacting the Northampton crisis support line as I  have gone further down hill. Spoke to a Dr before being referred to the on site mental health team. I explained openly and honestly that I have been getting very strong urges to overdose or self harm. Saturday I felt that I could just walk out of the flat and do who knows what. The mental health team have prescribed me 5mg of diazepam to get me through the night when tomorrow I will hopefully hear from my local community mental health team and a possible emergency appointment with my psychiatrist.

So I'm apprehensive about it. I've been on different anti depressants, and though every few years they seem to lose efficacy, while they last they seem to greatly help. But now 'venturing' into an entirely new field of psychiatric drugs? I don't know. They're so unsure of this whole issue, they haven't been willing to diagnose me as Bipolar II, Borderline, or anything - so I'm still just diagnosed as 'Depression'. Yet they want to give me medical treatment for mood-instability...

So - could anyone share their experiences on mood-stabilizers (specifically Valproic Acid)?
What does feeling 'stabilized' even mean? I've read many people reporting feeling numbed out or zombified on these drugs...
For someone for whom the Hypomania has never really been an issue in of itslef - how much of this is 'cut-off'? 
Any insight, that goes beyond, 'it helped me', or generic side effects, would be greatly appreciated!!!

BTW, you can read more about me and more in depth about my apprehension towards this whole issue, in my Presentation thread:

Thanks so much for any feedback! 

Have a great week y'all!

1985,"Hello everyone. I do not know from where to start, all my childhood was filled with my mother's ups and downs and her drama. When I was a kid I thought that was normal but as I grew older I understood that my mother has some issues with depression and maybe bipolar disorder too. She is sometimes extremely happy to try new things and go out and at other times she wants to sleep all day and stay in bed. She get very angry with the smallest things, and yess a lot- every day she yells to be clear. She wants to have the control and she can judge people so easily including us(me and my two younger siblings and my father). She says things that i know she dont really believe but they hurt a lot. For example many times she yelled that i am paranoid that i am the one who has lost her mind, that I dont deaerve anything, that she spends a lot of money on us and she doesn't spend a penny on herself. She is everyday mad that the house is not clean and tidy... but our home is the tidiest and cleanest house u have ever seen. And even when the house is clean she yells that the house needs to be cleaned asap and that we dont help her with housework which is not correct. When I was younger she used to slap me but this year she stopped(i am in university thats why i think) but she slaps my younger siblings when she gets mad. She always thinks she is right even when clearly she is not and she never says sorry. I am in a point that whenever i hear the sound of her voice i get mad and defensive. There are times she gets drunk and votims all night and calls people at midnight just to see what they are doing(people she has talked before years, she acts like this because she gets drunk). Also, we do not do any activities as a mother and a daughter. She does not do any activitities with my siblings neither.She spreads so easily the negativity and i try to be positive but she ruins it every single day. She calls me the morning and she always says ""what are u doing today.? She says ironically will u study and do nothing interesting?"" When in fact she is the one who is not doing anything. She is moody and does not spend her time on hobbies or activities. She is only going to work and coming home. We encouraged her to try new things and she always says she will and at other times she says i dont have time but she does have time. Also, when my friends come she sometimes says very bad things about me. She made me feel like a very bad daughter but i always try to do my best. I dont smoke, i never go out clubbing and I am studying medicine so I can affort a good future for me and my family. She always puts me dows and there are times I cant concentrate on my studies even though medicine is very demanding study.
She always refuses that she has a mental illness, but she takes clopidrol(a depression pill) that she takes daily because my aunt (her sister) has suicided two years ago. She was always a bit bipolar but after the suicide of my aunt it gotten worse. And she refuses to get help!
Does she has bipolar syndrome? What should I do? 
I am always nervous when she is around me and I am ALWAYS scared if I say something that will change her mood-and even if I dont day something she gets upset and overreactive.
Please help me"
1986,"I'm in a mess, massive debts, that I can't egt out of...  depression that won't go away.  shocking housing, no real friends.  family that don't understand.  day after day of isoloation.  i'm reaching out but no one is there.  its like i'm being dragged closer and closer to my black hole.:low:"
1987,"am in a bad place today,  mood is low and thoughts of hurting myself an dothes are ripe.  not going to act on these just need to vent them out.

i am in hell and no one can see it."
1988,"Hi all. 

Have not been on for a while as I have been battling with some demons. Started off fairly well but over the past six weeks my mood started going up to the point where the moment I received any income I would blow it with out even thinking of the consequences then having major anxiety attacks about what I had done, it got to the point where I would be spending five hundred pounds in just under two days. I even started to believe I am invincible and would have these surreal dreams where I could see myself floating across a room instead of walking or even being able to fly. I even started to get ideas about running naked through the local town centre. And now, as they say, what goes up has to come down and I am very quickly. I am sleeping fourteen to sixteen hours a day and waking up feeling like I have not slept along with a loss of appetite. To be honest at the moment I am struggling to see the point in life as I am not getting any enjoyment out of anything as well as getting intrusive thoughts giving me ideas to do something drastic."
1989,"doses anyone here use the Mind's elefriends website,  I have tried to get on but can't anyone else having trouble?"
1990,"Im lonely, how does this work i often ask. The girl who finally fought against everything to be at home and settled, i finally found love, a man who wants me with all my flaws and insecurities my anxieties and mood swings. He tells me he loves me. Something i'm still learning to accept as iv never known this before. But on Monday his granddad passed away and right now he needs me and i know this but i need him . Usually he knows it all but right now i cant share, i cant share that i feel low and unloved . I'm feeling like he doesn't want me or to be with me , i feel unimportant as i know its his family he wants and not me. Hes faultless he is and i know the issues lie with me as i revert to disappearing to the bathroom to make myself sick after eating because i feel worthless and fat.  I'm insecure i'm horribly insecure and i wish i could change this, i hang onto him and needing him like a child their mother. I cannot cope without him but apparently i cant cope when hes here but hes different because of his loss , this hurts me and it shouldn't because this makes me selfish not him. I should be able to give but right now all i want to do is take because i want . I'm down right now and i feel rather low i felt like this prior to his granddad passing and just as i was going to share this he passed away so now i cannot share this as i feel this will make him mad because i'm making it about me. So i don't know what to do but i am scared i'm loosing him right now and i don't feel strong , i don't know whats going on. But i need my boyfriend who needs me and seems to be pushing me away."
1991,"I know I need to talk to my doctor about this but is there something comparable to Seroquel (I take 400mg at night) that doesn't cause you to lose all emotions/feelings.

My lack of emotion is wearing on my marriage"
1992,"This may be a lengthy post... just a warning. But I feel like the entire history is important here...

I have been dating an incredible girl for almost 8 years now. Early on in our relationship I noticed some things that were potential red flags. Often times I'd go to her place and find her just sitting in the hallway crying, or she'd get upset into tears over what seemed like the smallest of things. Her upbringing seemed sketchy at best. She basically raised herself. So I chalked it up mostly to that. 

We got closer and our relationship grew, we moved in together and blended our families (we both had a child from a previous bad  relationship). Her mood swings grew worse. She would be perfectly content making plans for our summer trips and then in the blink of an eye be in tears and having doubts about our relationship. I would bring up if she wanted me to leave or if she wanted to break up and she never did, she always apologized and said she didnt know what made her think that way because thats not how she felt. 

So skip ahead a bit more.. she finally gets help and is diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder and as manic depressive. The doctor gave her medication and things, in regards to her moods,  began to improve. He started her on a very low dose and said if she didnt feel anything differently within 8-10 weeks to call the office and come back for adjustment. After the 10 weeks she told me she could feel the difference but it wasnt significant and felt like she needed something more or something different. That appointment/convo never happened. She would go for her check ups and tell the doc all was well and thats where it would end. 

This was around 6 years ago now that this happened. About once a year she, for whatever reason, would go off her meds unbeknownst to me. When asking her why she would go off her meds her response would be dependent upon if she was on then or off them. When she was on them, she was very honest about and aware of illness. She would say she would accidentally miss a dose here and there and before she knew it she was weeks behind and by then she was so far ""off the rails"" that shed have herself convinced she didnt need them and it would just escalate from there. 

About two months after shed go off of them she would pack her things and leave, saying she didnt feel like she was in love anymore and wasnt happy. She would go to her sisters for a couple of days or a couple of weeks, and her sister would find out she wasnt on her meds and get her back on track while i talked to her.. and shed come back home after a few days. This has happened once every year... twice on an occasion. I stood by her every single time because, even though I couldnt personally relate to what she was feeling or experiencing, I did understand. 

She had one of her ""episodes"" back in september and left for four days. This time it was much worse because she slept with someone else. I hesitantly let her come home anyway... and for whatever reason our relationship was stronger than it had ever been. Not that it had been weak before. Even with the incidents we always had a pretty good relationship. When she slept with the other guy and i essentially was finished... it was as if she saw what she was losing and how far over the line shed let it go. she got back on her meds and things were amazing for us. 

Fast forward a bit more to two weeks ago. I found out she hadnt been taking her meds again since February. Which would put it at around 8 weeks, give or take... which is about how long it takes her to lose touch entirely and flake out. 

Friday she began acting really weird toward me, so I knew something was up and it was coming. So I took her out to some shops and then for a drive... riding around backroads listening to music is one of her favorite things so i was trying to lift her spirits and get her mind off the down side of where she was going. And it worked. She perked up, we talked, she went on and on about how glad she was that we worked our issues out and that she was thankful that i was here for her while she was in her worst times so on and so on. It was a great night. 

The next day was our sons birthday party.. that went incredible as well. We had a blast. Then this morning she woke up and was being very stand off-ish. I let her do her morning thing assuming she just woke up in a grump.. but it felt like much more than that after a while. So I asked her what was up and she said nothing really. So I said well obviously something is and she said she didnt want to say because itd start a fight.. which led me to say that obviously there is something we need to get out and on the table.

Which is when she said she wanted to move out and gave the speech (which is almost the same every single time) about how she didnt want to be here anymore and was leaving. I didnt argue or put up a fight this time. I just told her she needed to do what she felt she needed to do and that i supported her as long as she knew for sure thats what she wanted... even though i wanted to flip out and argue. 

She had me call her sister (which she always does, she can never do it herself) to have her come pick her up and she left. Again.

Im so torn. I love her. I want to be here for her. I want to weather this storm yet again and be there for her on the other side of it.. but i feel like im running out of steam..so the other side of me wants to just cut my losses, endure the heartache and try my best to move on. 

When is it enough?  I feel so terrible for thinking this way when I know she isnt entirely in control of her decisions and reactions right now... but I feel like thats not fair to everyone else in the family because she -IS- in control of taking her medication and shes very aware of how vital it is to her illness.  We have our children from previous relationships and our son together.. three total.. who ride this roller coaster with me every time she leaves.

She says I shouldnt try and that shes just done with it all and thats what she says every time.. but a few days later shes coming back home with her meds. I dont know what to do...

I feel terrible for being tired of going through this again and again... but im only human.. and I have the kids to think of as well...

Any insight is VERY welcome...

EDIT: After reading some other threads here I thought I would clarify that there is no drug use or alcoholism involved with me or her. We are both 100% clean. I havent drank more than a beer or two with dinner in over 10 years and shes only ever drank once and hated it."
1993,"Hello everyone. I'm posting here because I am really confused by stuff that my psychiatrists and other doctors/nurses have been saying about my various problems. I basically have some fairly serious problems with mood instability for the past year or so. I've had bad depressive episodes in the past and ended up being referred to a psychiatrist after a (admittedly pretty shoddy) suicide attempt in february. I also have had a couple of episodes in the past where I've gotten really elated, anxious and energetic to the point where I feel totally out of control. The first psychiatrist I saw said I probably had EUPD, and told me to research this. I looked at the symptoms and I felt they really didn't fit what I'd been experiencing. In particular, my moods tend to last for weeks or months rather than rapidly changing, and I don't really have any self-image issues or feelings of emptiness described in the ICD 10. It also doesn't really capture how awful and out of control the 'up' moods are. I looked at some of the stuff EUPD is commonly misdiagnosed as and started researching BPD. Reading first-hand accounts of this it felt like someone had crawled into brain or read my diary or something. Thinking of my mood swings in terms of depression or hypomania really helped me come to terms with the stuff that's been happening to me. It especially helped me to recognise the seriousness of some of my symptoms (in particular hearing voices and getting visual hallucinations and having grandious plans/ideas). I told my psychiatrist this but he insisted that bipolar was very unlikely since I wasn't psychotic. I was then referred to a psychologist for DBT but the psychologist agreed that EUPD didn't seem to be the issue, so I was discharged. I saw another psychiatrist recently after getting bad suicidal ideations again following a brief bout of depression (a few weeks long). She seemed to think I had eupd as well, and kept saying stuff like 'it doesn't mean you have a bad personality' but I never really worried about that in the first place. After a discussion with the home treatment team I had been hoping that the up episodes I'd had might just be down to the SSRIs I was on (fluoxetine). The nurses said this was likely. The psychiatrist said that this definitively was not the case and didn't want me to change antidepressants.

I feel incredibly lost and confused. I don't want to just wait for the weird elated symptoms to come back before I can get treatment. They're horrid and they make it impossible to live and function normally. I want to understand what's wrong with me but when I asked about this both psychiatrists just sort of gestured at a ""gut feeling"" that it's eupd. I feel as though I've just been type-cast into this idea of a young woman who's emotionally unstable and hates herself. I've had some mild self-harm problems in the past and extracted myself from an abusive relationship last year, which I think feeds into this image. I just don't understand. I want to trust the psychiatrists, and it would be relieving to think of my problems as falling under a neat umbrella like eupd. But I just can't believe them. The label seems utterly wrong.

Can anyone here advise me what to do? Anyone here have similar experiences? Am I just being stupid for not believing them??

(Also it's worth noting that I'm not in a depressed mood atm so I won't be a risk or anything if people want say anything that might offend)."
1994,"Two hours after the doctor ordered me sleeping pills, after three days not sleeping due to pain, I fell asleep for a nap naturally. So I didn't need the sleeping pills. Now the pain is much less and I can't sleep because I took the sleeping pills two nights anyways.. It always takes three days to stop an insomnia spell  It always takes a couple days to sleep after a couple sleeping pills. I should be fine around Tuesday. I listened to this doctor because he is good looking. LOL"
1995,"I feel as if I am being possessed by a demon at times. I will start to feel myself get a little light-headed, and start to have 2 people fighting over control for me, then the evil takes control. So far, it has been mostly text through which this has happened, but it is starting to have some IRL effects. The demon wants me dead at all costs, but wants to - if possible - preserve my body for use as a host for itself. I am going insane, and I need to stop it. I am not going to the authorities, because I know for a fact that they will lock me up. A person with similar problems as me tried to go to the authorities very recently, and they tried to lock them up. Example: I am talking to some people, I start to lose control and split into 2 people. We fight for control until the demon has control, and I say extremely offensive things to them. For about a week afterwards, I have suicidal thoughts A LOT. For the first 5-10 minutes, I CANT stop thinking about suicide. I tried to post this on a different forum, but it was not taken seriously. So what do I want?

Listed in most important to least important:

*To know WHAT is happening
*To know WHY it is happening
*Ways to help myself without the authorities


Some more notes: I did not have anything that traumatizing happen to me, accept being abandoned by a pretty close friend. I put on a mask, to say, and only have recently been taking it off. I take zoloft. I do not think it is actually a demon, but I used that as a tag because it is very similar. I put this on the bipolar forum because it is the closest disorder to what I think I have."
1996,in a really bad place right now
1997,"if its only mood swings then whats so bad about it?i have bipolar and can function pretty well.i mostly have mania so am always happy but i fo\do my job ect?,whats so bad about bipolar i can see reality clearly and i dont have any delusions or psychosis,or get out of touch with reality?"
1998,"Hi,
I have recently been diagnosed with cyclothymia/bipolar type 2 and my psychiatrist has prescribed me fluoxetine (20mg) which I've had previously and also the mood stabiliser/anti-psychotic quantepine (seroquil) at a low dose.
I was wondering whether anyone had any experience of this medication (quantepine)?I am aware that it can cause weight gain which makes me extremely apprehensive as I've suffered with eating disorders for the past 10 years (bulimia/anorexia) so I fear that weight gain could act as a trigger for unhealthy eating habits again..
Thank you x"
1999,"Hello!!I'm new on here and thought I'd come on here to get more info about my diagnosis.so ima get straight to it...is it possible to have bipolar 2 and borderline personality disorder at the same time?or could I have been misdiagnosed.also,is Prozac and ability good for bipolar 2??thanks!!"
2000,"Apologies for some of the short form. This was originally a post to myself for clarity...

We have spoken for nearly 3 years on and off, and I think the history and friendship makes it hard to move on.
I knew she had a past involving drugs, alcohol, ty ways, and had lost custody of her kid before and many wrongdoings, but I accepted that.
She has Bipolar Personality Disorder, which again is troublesome, but I accepted it.

The above is the early days when we spoke but never hangout.

Nearly 2 years ago we met and started dating, and I realised there was so much more to this girl, claiming to many that she’d be perfect at the age of 30. She’s now 22, turning 23, and has made tremendous progress.

I'm not in way too deep with her and in love with her, and her little girl, who ive become like a Dad figure too. The kids amazing and Ive always wanted to be a Dad.

Although we dated a few times, I backed off as I didnt feel she was relationship material. EG we went to watch West Ham United her football team, and in the evening she was on Skype wearing the shirt like a dress, being GF material. I went to sleep, woke to meet her to find out she’d been on a cocaine binge and barely mate it. We had a good day, but her coke comedown soon started and did impact it. I didn’t see her for a while.

Soon after I insulted her saying something jokey, and she deleted me. We wouldn’t speak for a few months.

Then I’d gone back to another ex, and had left her and began dating a little more..I met a girl called Kayleigh, and although she was lovely, she just wasnt for me…During this I realised I didnt have feelings for her and decided to meet Rachael. Again I realised I liked Rachael but she was a risk..Stupidly I went for Kayleigh..

Soon after that we begun. And here are the problems in our 8-9 months of on and off being an “us”.

I cheated on Kayleigh a few weeks after making it official. Rachael came over, got me drunk, and I’d always had a thing for her. I came clean of course, but at that moment I thought damn I’ve got to 25without cheating, what the  gives. I cheated.
I processed my thoughts and wanted to see what I want. It was Rachael.
We began dating instantly and it was great, somewhat justifying my decision to ‘cheat’. We made it official, but with the hot weather and lust we started drinking an awful lot. I still maintained control of my life, but hers fluctuated.
We made it official in mid August 2016. Soon after rumours began to surface that she had cheated. She hadn’t but I accused her etc..anyway soon after, one day I left and she got on cocaine whilst looking after her daughter and had her Mother over. She was also back in college..you’d think I’m safe right? She cheated on me that night in order to get cocaine.
The next day she dumped me..blaming me..however, few days later we patched things up and she admitted she cheated and we worked through it. Id never seen her show guilt or remorse for anything, so gave her another chance. MY worries grew.
Although we were great problems started to occur. EG October 8th was my Mums death date, we had planned to see one another. She seen me on 7th and 9th, and made other plans with her mum and friend on the 8th. I was fuming, especially with her holiday to Ibiza coming up..she went away to Ibiza, and had been clean for a while, however, one night she was on cam and her mate was in bed. Both makeup less and drunk..her mate was slagging her off for not doing drugs etc..they went to bed as did I. I woke up at 6am for work, only to see pictures of the two of them coked up, and they told me they’d done cocaine abroad and been drinking and skinny dipping for 6 hours. about 2 months later  than the first split we split, and it got pretty nasty.
Around this time she had recently started driving, she drunk drive to mine with her 4-year-old daughter in the car.
I started hanging out with one of her close friends behind her back, again not something Id ever do. There was rumours of her doing stuff with a guy during this break that I later found out to not be true, but her inaccurate stories of this didnt help.
Soon after we got back together and this was probably our best period. However, in early December we both lost our jobs a day apart and began spending so much time together. With little money, plenty of drink and junk food, no jobs, and Christmas looming  kicked off. 
Around this time we were ok in a sense, she had given up drugs. However, her Mum came to time who’s a bad influence..,me her and mates went bowling with her two young brothers on a Saturday. We all had a bit of drink, but I thought fine great…all of a sudden I look round and there’s me and her brothers. 6 adults are gone. Where are they? doing cocaine on a Saturday lunchtime in bowling alley toilets around kids..Classy..I only found out later through other means.
She began to ignore me and kicked me out her house..I was down, jobless, skint and had lost any friend or partner support. Her previously mentioned friend offered to come over and drink..We got wrecked, and after a silly Facebook post about booze, Rachael dumped me for a third time.. I then spent the night in bed with her friend, but didnt touch her or do anything.
During our break I went back to my previous ex, she went back to hers and we were apart, but both failed with them and came back to one another.
Rachael found out and flipped, I came clean about things with her mate, e.g. seeing her behind her back…however, after some back and forth we patched things up when she was lonely on Valentines, soon after we got back together, however, before confirming this I was sleeping with/seeing my other ex at the same time, weighing up my options you may call it. I picked Rachael, fourth time lucky ay?
We were again great, but she grew distant.
Recently she lost her new job, got smashed with mates for two days straight and got coked up beyond belief, putting me at the bottom of her priorities.

I could add much more, but in the 8-9 months together we got together through me cheating, we have split 3 times, she’s cheated once that I know of, we both ran back to exes, I shared a bed and met up a few times in private with her close mate, she has damaged her car beyond belief crashing etc, got drunk several times a week, done cocaine on the regular, although it calmed down some. She’s lost 2 jobs and a college course, shown inconsistent behaviours as both a girlfriend and a Mother.

I love her, and she is improving day by day in the grand scheme of things. EG she used to do drugs daily when I met her, now she doesn’t. and I know she loves me, but its takenits toll on me, making me anxious and obsessive..this is probably 50-60% of what’s happened in our less than one year together..

She has been drinking a lot lately, some times with me, but This weekend, early days in our fourth time together, I told a mate theres always something with her. Later that day. She lost her job, got drunk and did drugs again.. just showing that these bad, dark times are always near..or possible.

What do I do? I want to end it, but a part of me is convinced one day she’s going to be a better person. As in 2-3 years she’s made amazing progress..she’s done plenty of good too, but this is the basics of the bad that we have both done together..

Trust me when I say this is 20m off top of my head. There’s a lot more like this, or little incidents, lies and problems.

Do I give up, or do I perserve. I do love her, but I think I deserve better, and I’ve already done some bad things, and it makes me wonder if she’ll influence me to do more."
2001,"I am been off work and not able to do much due to injuries i sustained when i had a serious car accident in December. I had in the last few weeks past started drinking again after several months without. Anyway I am lucky to be alive post crash i spent several weeks in hospital as had loads of issues and complications,I broke my neck and lucky to not be paralysed amongst many other health issues.  But anyway. 2 weeks ago i started drinking and ended up overdosing on my normal meds plus painkillers. 
I  rang the alcohol and drug helpline people  who rang the ambulance for me. When i arrived in the ED department i went from being 100% fine to un:conscious/unresponsive and unable to breathe on my own. This all happened within 10 minutes. If the ambulance had been a bit slower in responding, the ED staff  been extra busy i could be dead. Like i feel like being a cat with nine lives to a person who  has used double that. I am so ashamed and angry with myself gosh i had done so well and one drunken moment i almost threw it away. I spent several days in the ICU some of those i was intubated. Scary really thrown me i can so clearly see how alcohol fucks with my brain!! 
But anyway i hopefully have learnt my lesson. Sober I would  not have behaved in this manner at all.
I have been really physically sore today and yesterday and because of my overdose whos going to prescribe me painkillers umm...probably no-one"
2002,"Does anyone know of any retreats for people with mental health problems?

I would really appreciate any information relating to the above.  I know I will have to pay but cant afford too much.  Just trying to avoid hospital admission.

Any replies much appreciated.   xx Mm"
2003,"Ive been treat with risperdal for a 6 months cant remmber the dosage. Just remmber the side effects its did to me iam talking about low sperm when i was finsh.. sorry for the information.. also i was eating so much like a Pig. 
So my therpasit changed me to ablify. 5 mg 
With a lil bit of the resperdal and then only the abilfy. I felt and feel really good with my life exept when iam down and its usally cause by alcohol or weed . The last time was from alcohol .

Thank u .
Sorry for bad english."
2004,"How long do you last inbetween psychotic episodes and how many have you experienced since diagnosis please?

Okay so i'm new here, i stumbled here by searching for the above question. I know everyone is different but psychosis is scary for all. 
  The thing is, i take my medication as i should, i never deliberately skip it, i sometimes forget but not enough to make a huge difference. I am on Abilify and Depakote.

 There are alot of statistics out there, especially on Google Scholar based on studies ect but me not being able to fluently understand the way they write the studies means i may not be understanding the results like i should. 

So question one, does anyone know of any reliable statistics which states the average time inbetween episodes for people who stay medicated. ( i already know its highly likely without medication i would be poly ) 

Question two is for those of you with a diagnosis of bipolar who have had psychosis, how long have you had bipolar and in that time how many times have you become psychotic? Also if it was because you stopped your medication please say so, if it was whilst you were medicated please also say so. 

I know i sound really nosy but we all share something in common .... Bipolar and psychosis so i guess i'm just trying to figure out what bipolar with psychosis is like for normal people.

In answer to my own question two, i am diagnosed with bipolar, i first experienced fully blown psychosis in 2006, it was very severe, i believed i had super powers and also believed select people were out to harm me, or worse innocent children. I take my medication as best i can, and plan to continue. I became ill again at the end of 2012 and since then haven't had psychosis, i have been ""well"" coming up to 5 years now. The second time i became psychotic under doctors supervision i had stopped taking medication, as i wasn't sure if the first psychosis was just a ""one off"" it took 6 months of being un-medicated before a very stressful life event and i again, became sectioned with severe psychosis. 

Thanks in advance."
2005,"I just read Mark Vonnegut' Just Like Someone Without Mental Illness Only More So. 

It was a tad confusing to read because he jumps all over the place in terms of years but  I always find it interesting to read other people's experiences, thoughts and confusions about being bipolar. 

And it was cheap. Only 1.99 USD on google books. 

He had 3 breaks and then became a doctor (!!!!) and then had another break years later.

As I read it at times I felt like he was swinging on the pendulum. 

Just thought I would share in case anyone likes reading such as I do."

2007,"Mom has Bipolar Depression and she won't do anything about it... what now?

Hi everyone, I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on how to go forward...
About two and a half years ago my mom attempted suicide by taking a bunch of pills. She got admitted to a mental hospital for a few weeks and got diagnosed with Bipolar Depression. She was prescribed Latuda for her bipolar and Prozac for her depression. 
She took her medication for a while and went to see her psychiatrist pretty regularly. Though things were not perfect, she had days were she felt better. She found a psychologist that she liked and saw her once every month for about six months.
Presently, she refuses to go to her psychiatrist because they make her ""mad"" and the pills make her feel funny. I do know that she got a refill on Prozac from her general doctor (whether or not she takes it is something I'm not sure about, I don't live at home with her) but I do know she does not take her Latuda anymore. She also does not want to go to her psychologist anymore.
She doesn't do much daily, it's more depression than manic (she did go through some manic phases months after she go released from the hospital). She watches tv and does her crossword puzzles, hardly ever leaves the house. Doesn't do her laundry, very rarely does any chores. She kind of just coasts through her days. When I ask her how she's feeling she says not very good, but that she's going to get herself together (she's been saying this for over a year now). When I ask what she's going to do to change she says she doesn't know.
I can't just force her into a car and make her go to her psychiatrist appointments and make her take her medication. 
So what now? My fear is that she's going to attempt the very worst again, although she has said in the past that she would never do that again.
Is there any advice from someone who has bipolar depression or who has someone close to them that has gone through this? I'm not sure how to feel or act anymore.
Thank you in advance."

Sometimes the world is not really real."
2009,"Hi all,

I'm a 30 (in 2 weeks) year old husband and father of 2.  I am brand new to the forum, and decided to seek this out due to a recurring plague of manic rage that I undergo approximately once every other month.  It used to happen a lot more frequently, however, after having an episode this last Friday again, I decided to reach out to anyone else who may have experienced something like this in their lives.  

I'm not diagnosed bipolar, but I've never been to a therapist who prescribes--only one who takes a more behavior modification approach and specializes in male anger--still super helpful.  However, I'm starting to believe that there's something underlying my anger and rage that goes deeper than my behaviors and patterns...Here's Why: 

When I have these episodes, I become convinced that somehow someone--always my wife, (Years before her, my prior girlfriend of multiple years)--is somehow doing me wrong--most of the time by ignoring me or not attempting to empathize with me or willfully attempting to embarrass me or prove me wrong.  Something along those lines.  Once this idea sets in, it festers and grows and swells and, unbeknownst to her, I have a swelling rage inside of me to the point that I blow up completely in disdain and disgust for her.  I feel so ashamed even writing this because she's a wonderful woman and we have a great relationship, but whenever I get this overwhelming feeling, it's like I ""KNOW"" that everything is wrong, nothing is right, there's a problem, and it must be fixed--although I don't actually believe it can be.  Sometimes, in the midst of the rage, my rational mind will show up and I will have an awareness, of sorts, that everything truly is/can be Ok. But I still ""FEEL"" that everything is wrong--not just a lighthearted ""I feel this way or that way,"" but I truly feel like  everything inside of me is swirling and swarming like a hive of bees--somewhere between anxiety and rage, even as I'm trying to come down from the rage.  

Also, always before it reaches its height, I am in a manic, hyperactive, mood--wherein which I think, speak, and react more quickly than anyone around me and quickly grow impatience at what I perceive as a ""lack of response"" or of being ignored. 

The cycle continues as the rage and mania slowly depart me usually about 1 hour after the climax, but the episode is not over.  Afterwards, I feel extreme shame, embarrasment, and feelings of unworthiness.  Every time I've felt suicidal in the last 4 years has come at this phase.  I feel like an utter failure, and everything I was so sure of before in terms of how I was being wronged and how I just KNEW of the problems that existed around me that needed to be fixed now rings in my ears like a memory of the idiocy that I demonstrated in front of someone who loves me and that I love.  

I HATE this cycle.  And it's decresed in frequency as I've learned to control my anger through the therapy I did receive last year--however, these feelings that arise and seem to have their way with me, seem to exist independently of anything I know or actually believe---the FEELING of everything being wrong, and stressful, and super super urgent, trumps any and all reason.  

I'm going to stop now because I feel like I could write about this all night.  
Does anyone have anything of a similar experience they could share? I'd really like to get some more insight into this...

Thank you all so much for reading.

Thanks again,

BB"
2010,"Hi all as you were so kind to answer to previous thread that I posted I want to ask you whether spouse, partner have deserted you with the reason that you are sick? Please share your experiences and how you get it over with.  The reason I am asking is because I am currently going through separation with my husband who pointed out that since I have gotten sick I have became a different person and he cannot be with me anymore. His arguments are that I have periods when I sleep a lot, during depression I am not active and that bothers partners. On top of that he does not want to have children with me because the disorder is hereditary and I can pass it on to the children. So a lot of blaming and serious accusations. I feel awful because I thought that marriage and relationships are for mutual support not rejection. So please share have you had similar experience and how have you coped and handled it. I am struggling for the time being and will appreciate your advice."

This article may be of interest to some people, ignore it if it isn't. It is by a guy who went through addiction & a severe case of bipolar disorder & came out the other side. He sees things as differential - he doesn't deny that there is an illness, but nor does he deny the spiritual / transpersonal aspects either. He wrote the book - The Body of Chris: A Memoir of Obsession, Addiction, and Madness, which is worth a read maybe by some people, if it's an area of interest.

2012,"Hi all, Im new here and simply joined as im looking to see if anyone can offer me advice on my situation (or theirs)

Im 32, The lady is a few years younger. I met this woman at the start of the year. We met online dating. We hit it off immediately and had some amazing long chats. We met and it went extremely well. we met a few times after 3 maybe.
But she then started being distant. telling me she has bipolar and possibly anxiety too. She completely changed, hardly speaking, we go for days/weeks without messages and i really do try to keep in contact. 
She recently randomly messaged me saying she was sorry, bad time, shes in better place, she knows what she wants now and wants to take the time to get to know me etc. all amazing things and had good replies to any of my messages back ""i dont want you to drop me again, etc"".  she came over that afternoon and we spoke, but again she didnt seem like she was in those messages. not as genuine and kinda taking the piss and putting me down a tad (nothing serious). she blames this condition(s) on everything, its always her excuse. i feel shes in the habbit of using it and not trying.
Anyway we had some hugs and just watched tv for an hour until she had to leave. as she left she said she wouldnt be a stranger and asked me to text her later.

I messaged her later that evening and got no reply. Then the next day some point i did, very laxed one,. again, the same as before where it seems she just has no interest in talking.. she always just says shes been busy (we all are). She didnt reply and i didnt hear from her for a few days so i tried, i then only get a reply in the morning, and again only a couple.
i have tried suggest we meet at the weekend, get some food, have a drink and a good chat, no reply yet..

I dont knwo what it is about this one, but i want things to move forward. but i also cannot deal with not hearing from her for days, to me that shows a lack of interest and either of us could meet someone else is those breaks. 
I have tried to be nice as possible, offer her help in personal situations and offer my ear, all the normal things you would.

does anyone have any advise. I dont want to give up but also dont want to be simply waiting and wanting something which is unlikely. I dont want to be or feel hurt by it all either. I like to put my all into situations."

2014,"Brace yourselves, happy reading.


I seriously don't know what's wrong with me and I don't know if
there's anybody suffering from the exact same thing as I am right
now since I've been searching for answers for 1 year straight and
I still haven't concluded what is happening with me.
I'm not in a good shape but I'll try to explain the best way I can,
please read this you could be ""saving"" my life. Even though I'm not
suicidal I'm starting to get really desperate sometimes

Past

Everything started 3 years ago, I'm 19 right now so I was 16 y/o.
I had 3 states of ""mood"" 1 year after the beggining, I was either 
anxious as hell with my palms sweating, mind racing, heart beating fast and I
would be in intense panic during school or I would feel like I fell on a depressed
state where I would just not care about anything at all, my voice would
be slow pitched and I would just not care about anything. I guess I would describe it
as emotionally numb since nothing would trigger happy feelings.
The other state was anxiety mixed with happyness, I would feel inspired, great about myself and a little
anxious all together. It would be like a bipolar disorder but I would never reach full mania, it was a mild symptom I guess.
Now you can ask me, was that bad ? Yes, it was.. but now it's a lot worse.

Present

I don't have the ""Mild Mania"" like state anymore, I feel anxious, emotionally numb, I feel like I can't
fully relax to actually read something or take something in my mind, it's just so hard to explain..
For instance, right now I'm not feeling anxious but I can't stop and think about what I'm writing, 
I'm just writing, but writing this feels like nothing to me and it doesn't push my mind. It's like 
I'm on edge all the time mentally, even though I'm not really thinking about anything I feel like my mind
is blank. I'm on this constante mild state of worrying even though I'm not thinking about anything. Maybe
this sounds crazy/stupid, but this is what I'm going through. I wish somebody would just slap me and get me
out of this. I can't recall a lot of events during my teenagehood, a lot of events are foggy. It's there
but it's not at the same time because, like I said, I can't stop and focus.
Seriously, I'm feeling brain dead. Things don't have any effect on me. I could care less If I just won
100 million dollars, I'll be on my bed procrastinating all day until I have to get up to get to work.
I always end up procrastinating until I need to rush to get to work.

I know this is long but please.. Help me, I'm really so tired of this. I can't connect with nobody anymore
and that's killing me even more than my anxiety/bipolar state was before.."
2015,"Hi

I have previously been diagnosed with depression and anxiety but the last person I saw now believes I may have bipolar or bpd. My family fully believe I am bipolar and are really supportive. I have extreme high mood where I talk a lot have these amazing ideas (which I believe are amazing but are really not). I decide to quit my job and venture onto doing something else which I always end up hating once I'm out of the mood. I have done this multiple times. Spend a lot of money. I am a lot more social but irritable. Then I normally crash into depression where I sleep a lot and pretty much don't do anything or feel anything. I do have periods where I do feel normal but I also have periods where I switch moods so quickly throughout a short space of time and this is where I feel most out of control. I feel as if I see someone out of the corner of my eye and see figures along with switching moods.

My first psychiatrist appointment was meant to be an hour but they were running late so I ended up with a less than 20 minute appointment. They want me to create a mood diary, have a blood test and bring a family member to my next appointment but I am not so comfortable with a family member being at an appointment with me."
2016,"Sigh.

Hello. I'm new here. I'm struggling and need a place to vent that isn't burdening my husband and the rest of my family even more than I already do.

I'm 39 years old and have ""issues"" (ha. that is my mom's word for what happens with me. :) ) since I was 5. 

About 12 years ago, I was diagnosed as Bipolar 2. Prior to that was considered depressive. I've also had OCD added to the mix due to my obsessive thoughts and sometimes compulsive actions...but really, I don't care. Call me whatever...I'm just too tired to care *what* I am.

I was on a med roller coaster for about 10 years. I got very tired of nothing working, everything causing more side effects than I could deal with, so with my doctor's help, I weaned off of everything. I've been med-less for 2 years. (*disclaimer-I am not antimed and I am one of the lucky people who have an amazing support system, including a spouse, parents, sibling, friends and even coworkers. Never go off meds without medical and life assistance*).

I built a very structured life over the past 2 years. I go to bed at a specific time. I get up at a specific time. I avoid obessive triggers. I do not drink. I eat very clean, healthy food. I exercise a specific number of minutes each day. I have no instant access to money. Attended therapy every other week. Reduced stress through yoga and meditation. Spent time outside each day. Etc etc etc.

All was well...until it wasn't. For the last 3 months, it is as though the switch has been flipped. I'm extremely depressed, extremely agitated and extremely obsessive in thought again. I'm pretty devasted to watch this life I've so carefully built just crumble around me. 

I have an appointment tomorrow with pdoc and my therapist. I am sure meds are going to be pushed and honestly, I (and my real life support system) think I need them.

I'm just so tired. I hope someone here understands. :(

Thank you for listening."
2017,I feel like I'm nearing the end of my story... I can't start using street drugs again and I'm tired of trying medications... today I fantasized about suicide at least every 5 minutes... I tried to distract myself but it was pretty persistent... I don't wanna go back to the psych ward just to come back out in 5 days in the same spot... I reached out to a couple friends but they were pretty busy which is cool... they got their own shit going on so I understand and it's not like they know how to help either... I feel like I'm at the bottom of the rope... I've just become so comfortable with the thought of leaving... this forum is the only place I can say how I really feel so there it is...

2019,"Hi all,
I am new to this.
I am looking for some insight to understand what has happened.
Was it an episode, was it mania or depression?
My BF who has been diagnosed BP only recently started Lithium but admitted he was forgetting to take as prescribed.
we moved in together very recently and while I did not realize how ""miserable"" he was, I recently learned.
I noticed his temperament change, he was moody, never smiled, lost motivation and generally just not really happy.
I don't know if the move was a trigger.
one day he disappeared, broke sobriety and decided that was that.
we had some messy text messages up and down, mainly from me reacting and questioning and not understanding what had happened.
he always read my messages but often did not reply many words, if he did reply.
I questioned the whole event.
the day the last of his stuff was removed he wanted to talk to me again and I would not. I refused, knowing he was drunk and high, I knew it wasn't a good idea. He pleaded he needed to hear my voice and I knew it was his mental health.
he would make an excuse to connect with me and the get angry when I wouldn't reciprocate. After a week I decided to let out all my emotion and I sent a deep text, calling him out for his behavior and breaking his promises.
oddly enough he replied and I learned that he had a laundry list of issues built up over a few weeks which he never ever mentioned.
items that were mentioned once or twice and never mentioned again, some items he never ever mention to me. Nothing that I considered a deal breaker, but more adjusting to living together.
e.g. bed space, moving furniture/storage, a question I thought was answered and he felt wasn't and a hygiene issue that surfaced and got resolved.
he told me he took every word as gospel and overthinks everything, unknowingly this was happening with every single observation or adjustment together.
Now I learn that his reason for leaving was too many items buildling up. I feel the items listed above were not deal breakers, but just conversations to be had. some were even no longer open items, but he harbored his feelings and stated he had to leave because there were too many issues. no lying, no cheating, simple ""preference or comfort issues, or observations or comments I may have said or suggested""
he also has anxiety.
I don't feel in my mind that it was such horrible behavior to warrant leaving a relationship but in his mind this was huge.
is this a symptom of an episode? he wasn't settled in yet and had made that clear.
we have since closed conversation on good terms, but i can't help but wonder was this part of an episode or maybe he was just not happy? he was seen out and looked miserable. and yes, this is the guy that wanted to marry me etc etc.
As angry as he made me for disappearing I have a hard time forgetting that he may be struggling internally.

thoughts pls?"

I am new to this forum since I've recently have been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I am taking lithium and started having hand shakes and very unreasonable and unexpected anxiety.

2022,"Hi all,

I just wanted to ask you guys if it is OK to laugh when someone is verbally abusive when experiencing psychosis, or would this be considered insulting / disrespectful?

I have a friend who I've only just met a few weeks ago who is BP1 and schizophrenic, and has recently started to experience full blown psychosis. When we were talking the other day she kept running away from herself with her thoughts and was getting herself wound up, and I kept having to tell me to take a minute.. breath.. and she just kept apologizing, which I told her there's no need.

Then at one point she really lost it and lashed out at me, and I laughed because I know it the condition, not her... but then realized the phone had gone dead as I think she put the phone down, maybe because she lost control again for a second. Within a minute she phoned back all normal and nice and said 'oh my nana phoned and I cut you off by accident.

Was I wrong to laugh when she lost control or does it help make light of the situation?

This is all very new to me and I've got a lot to learn, but I am willing to go the extra mile to understand whats going on and how I can support.

Thank you in advance :peace:"

2025,"Hi, basically im undiagnosed with bipolar due to me avoiding mental health (anxiety) and the fact they wont help me because i self medicate

Cannabis to stop anxiety and silly mania decisions

Mania leads to cocaine consumption and obviously makes it worse

Im sort of stuck at the same cycle for the past 3 years since i first attempted suicide. For weeks i feel the absaloute dogs nuts, literally love myself i smash it at work, help everyone i can, drive like lewis hamilton, take my dogs for walks everyday and feel like im at one with them, i pamper myself n make sure i look my best everytime i leave my house.
This then leads to a bit unctrollable hyperness i drive extremely recklessly everyone irritates me i feel im smarter and more advanced than them. I get paranoid and extremely high sex drive. I then end up so full of anxiety and racing thoughts i result to inevitably taking cocaine and spending all my money on that. Thats not my issue i get obsessed with escorts and perfoming risky acts like no condom sex etc which im putting my life at risk. I literally cannot control this mania episode. Like ever! Once the rush hits ive lost control

This inevitably results in deep ass depression, i need at least 10-11 hours sleep or i cant function even then i become tired midday, high anxiety. Severe fatigue , no appetite.
This will last about 2-3 weeks and bang one day the cycle starts again. 

Your all gona think its a drug problem but even before the cocaine i can sit and browse escort sites imagening risky acts for hours on end. And the fact i feel unstoppable and pretty much on a higher level than your average person. I feel im just more advanced than everyone else at this point. 

Im currently on escitalopram 20mg eveeyday
And ive been on sodium valproate 600mg everyday but found this done absaloutly nothing to me apart from make me tired. So stopped it. 
So far the only thing that helps me keep mania at bay is cannabis but thats only to a certain extent. 

Ive nearly been sectioned twice and attwnpted suicide twice, self harm ive done and last mania episode i got arrested for paranoid delusions and strolling around with a knife (because i thought MI6 were following me)

Mental health are usless and ive ended up avoiding them

Has anyone else been through this im desperate for experiences and solutions! 

I know the drugs dont help! Im convinced cannabis does but the urge for cocaine and reckless behaviour when im manic is unstoppable! 

Anyone else been through the same? Obviously there is more to it than this but i need help asap!

Im 25 and luckily in a good job at the moment but my previous job i lost because of depression. I also have body dysmorphia due to past bullying in school etc"

I just feel so different on my medication. Maybe I feel different even before I was on medication."
2028,"I can't tell if I'm getting depression or fatigue having come down on my lithium to relieve the GI distress I had for over a year. I am terrified of my psychiatrist because he is creepy but he is willing to come down on my meds so he can be useful. He wanted me to switch from coming down on lithium to coming down on the buspar. But I am feeling so much fatigue, it doesn't make sense to start another drug reduction. For two days I obsessed about the shrink being scary. It's just not smart to mess with the buspar when I'm having a reaction to the lithium reducing from 600 mg to 450mg. And we did it slowly, over several months. I also don't know if I'm fatigued from coughing incessantly from a cold I had ten days ago. The coughing is truly tiring.  But I'm not what you'd call depressed as I still can feel love for my dog and bf and mom, etc. I wish I could trust the shrink. Maybe I have bronchitis or pneumonia ?? I don't feel THAT sick. It's just dragging to walk the dog. I don't feel like doing the exercycle. And I hate being married to a psychiatrist, so to speak. And my creepy shrink has a creepy dog in his office. It won't look at you, it won't come to you, it doesn't acknowledge you. Creepy fucking dog."
2029,"First of all let me clarify.  I'm not in a relationship.  I'll try to make it brief but my brief usually ends up long.

I met my ex gf last spring around this time actually.  I had recently been divorced (separated for about a year prior to divorce) and then I met ""her"".  She was amazing.  Beautiful, Honest, sincere.  Everything just clicked with us on every level.  The only problem was the distance.  We lived about an hour and a half drive apart but, we made it work.  She would come visit on one weekend, I would visit her the next.  Summer came and she stayed almost all summer at my home.  I had joint week to week custody of my child and she had two children ages 11 and 16.  Our children got along very well.  End  of summer came and school started back so we went back to our weekend visits.  We told eachother that we would make this work until her daughter graduated high school in her town.  She was starting her junior year. (first break up was in september about 3 weeks after she had small back surgery.  We had a minor disagreement over a recent message I had received from my ex wife about my daughter.  She shut me out of her life for a few days, shut down facebook, etc...a week later I finally get in touch with her and she just says I need to be patient and that she needs time and that she is turning to God for the answers.  A couple of days later, my sister texts her and asks how she was doing.  Her reply was brief and but also said that God told her to let me and my daughter go and she was thankful for the time god had loaned us to her.  (red flag obviously) but, then 3 weeks later a short text from me ended up with her inviting me to her sons football game.  I went, and here we go again...Everything starts looking fantastic and the relationship seems even better than it was before.  We did all the fun things, halloween, thanksgiving at both families.  An amazing christmas at both families.  I even bought her a promise ring for part of her christmas.  We had a small new years eve gathering with her family and mine and it was there that girlfriends sister told me that my girlfriend was bipolar and hasn't taken any medication for it in about 2 yrs.  I knew that it could be a potential problem but, I loved her and told myself that we would discuss it when the time was right.  Well, I never got the chance to discuss it.  3 weeks later, another small disagreement and she blocks my phone, blocks facebook....a few days go by and she we talked briefly and she said it was time to close the door on our relationship.  I was in total shock!  I did the wrong thing for a couple of days.  Begged her to reconsider, told her we could work anything out if we just talked it through.  But, no...she held strong.  That was late January.  It is now early April of course.  The only means of communication I have with her is through email and that has been used a few times to set times for her brother in law to retrieve her things from my house and maybe a handfull of messages from me (not begging) but, trying a little to open that door again.  She is not having it though.  Just before the breakup, her family dog passed away.  I thought this might have triggered her depression (google research).  I still find it hard to believe that someone can go from being sooo in love and being the best thing that has ever happened to her (she had 4 previous failed marriages in which some were abusive and some neglectful...I was neither and there was never even a raised voice in the few disagreements that we had).

Sooo...here I am maybe wanting to get back out in the dating world but, my heart still misses her and loves her so much.  Is it worth the risk to even wait it out and see? Will the odds be ""if"" we reconnected that it's going to happen again?  I did read that the depression state could last several months.  I just don't know what to do anymore and the love I still have for her is deep.  Any advice will be taken and thoroughly considered.  

Thank you"

So I'm pretty sure with out a court order both dissolvable tablets and injections are out lawed in state(in patient or whatever they are called) mental hospitals.

I was forced to take in my parents house growing up dissolvable pills by my parents for years and now I have permanent brain damage(I suffer from insomnia without a sedative).  Which means I can't take most medications except like Zyprexa and Seroquel.

Is there any legal ramifications I can take against them(Yes I know you are not lawyers).  Alternative against my Nurse Practitioner?  They didn't really give me a choice at such a young age.

Also is this a reason they don't use dissolvable tablets in mental facilities that I have been to?"
2032,"EDIT: fixed math

I'm on Olanzapine/Zyprexa and I have gained over 45 pounds over 3 years.

Doing quick math 72(age of death)-22(current age) = 50 * 15= 750 pounds.


I can conclude rather quickly that the weight gain can't be linear.

What is a realistic weight gain expectation in the long term?

Seroquel I have read has similar weight gain side effects maybe someone could describe their weight gain on such if you aren't taking Zyprexa."
2033,"This is something a lot of people dealing with bipolar might identify with.

I call it the mask of bipolar. The act you put on when the mania or the depression peaks.

Its the thing that causes people to say ""you look and sound much better today"" when you are either trying to claw your way out of the depression pit or wrestling with your mania.

Its the mask we wear to ward off those who like to pry, be they family, friends or strangers.

But what happens when the turmoil behind the mask begins to ""break through""?

How do those that read this post with a mask deal with the dilemma?

I've worn several in the last 10 years, a new one each time I am released from the psychiatric hospital. Some lasted months, one held out for 8 years...But the one I put on three weeks ago after my last visit to the psychiatric hospital has all but crumbled away.

The doctor cut my anti-depressants out completely and this has led to a rather nasty bout of rapid cycling. 

This lovely thing called rapid cycling has left me in shreds in the emotional sense. 

How do you cope with the effort of daily life when everyone you interact with notices that you aren't yourself and starts asking whats wrong? (not that I would know how I act when I am ""myself"")."
2034,"ugh. my bipolar is pretty much in check. Admittedly I had 2.5 weeks of feeling completely like myself and then the last 5 days i am back to feeling ok but not normal (if that makes any sense)

but my marriage feels like it is in shambles (note: we don't argue (or really talk at all) and both of us is completely loyal so there is no fooling around). 

I feel overwhelmed with trying to change anything and work on my marriage when I don't trust feeling well to last for the long term even on medication. 

And I think I behave totally differently than I did 2 years old (since then anxiety, depression and finally a bipolar 2 diagnosis). 

if you are married how does marriage work for you in all the ups and downs? 

Sure I think i will now survive my own life but now I have to figure out how to make my marriage survive."
2035,"So I have been on Zyprexa for three years, but now I can't sleep with out.

I have tried trazodone which was no  help.  Also tried mg, zinc and melatonin.

What are people here taking?
Does anyone know of a ranking system that explains which medications help the most with sleep?"
2036,"I joined this forum today in the hope I would find people to talk to that understand, though as I begin to write... I think to myself, how will that even help? What's the point? Haha!
I have bipolar disorder and they keep throwing the bpd thing at me recently in the hope it might stick. I am not yet accepting of that side of things as I feel my circumstances make it too difficult to tell quite yet.

At the beginning of December I moved house due to very stressful and emotionally difficult circumstances. At the same time, my relationship broke down and I moved into a new home alone with my two children. After moving, I became suicidal. I had had a really difficult year and had been off my meds for 10 months. I felt I had coped really well with everything till that point. 

Suicidal thoughts became intrusive, overwhelming, repetitive and torturous. You know how it is when u live moment by moment and every day lasts a lifetime?

I'm a professional, I work full time and have little to no support around me. Losing my ex partner was extremely hard and I'm still coming to terms with it. He was not the father of my children, but I always seen him as my last chance at a proper family, someone I could properly share my life with. I feel like the sense of loneliness I have now makes them think I have bpd, my devastation is labelled as being some kind of over attachment. 

Anyways... I became so unwell that I had to be admitted for several weeks and started on new meds. I am now home, back to work, miraculously making everyone think im juggling life. Smiling away.

It's all false.

One day I feel okay and the next I can't stop crying. I go about my day as much as I can with tears dripping down my face like a total psycho. I'm screaming for more meds. 

I'm sick of living my life as two different people. Always having to put a face on it. How do u even start again when you've exhausted that option already. Just when I convince myself I'm feeling better and things are gonna be okay. I find myself on my hands and knees again and again.
What do u do when you can't help yourself but the only person that can help you is yourself?"
2037,"Is suicide selfish if you have no family or friends? I only want to end my own pain, I don't want to cause any, but if no one acknowledges you or your pain whilst you're alive, what would be the difference if you were to take your life? If they don't care for your pain whilst you're alive, why should they suddenly care when you're dead? I wish I had just one friend to meet up with, even once a fortnight. Someone to care about, someone to be a good friend to, someone to explore with. So, as in, if the only person you get to socialise with all week is the corner shop assistant for approximately 2 minutes, is there a point? I've lost all confidence in meeting ""new people"". If my mood swings are so bad that the people who knew me and loved me couldn't stick around, what chance do I have with strangers, baring in mind I'd be meeting them whilst not myself and ""ill"", their first impression of me would be the mess they've met, not the happy person I used to be. My depression this year has gone so low and worsened and lasted so long, longer than ever before, that I've lost people this year, that I'd had in my life for years and had great relationships with.
I've battled my thoughts for years, with odd suicide attempts, but I always for the past 10 odd years told myself it would get better if I just tried more and stopped letting my head fall down. Learn to control my head a little more. I've tried so hard through the years every time I'm doing well at life, to try stay as healthy as possible and exercise and keep a routine to stay stable for as long as possible. I always fall back down into depression. Doctors and psychiatrist waiting lists to be seen let alone treated, are so long that by the time you get seen, you're told you're too poorly for treatment but not poorly enough for hospital. Ringing the crisis team leaves me feeling worse, it usually starts and ends with, ""we can get someone to call you back in a few hours as there's no one on duty atm, but if you feel even more suicidal in that time ring us back"". 

I know I sound so negative and I know I sound pathetic, but I'm so at a loss with solutions. I don't want suicide to be my only option, but it feels like it's either that, or a life of causing myself and others pain. I'm scared it's always gonna be like this, because nothing that I've tried to self help has worked yet, and I just can't seem to get the professional help from mental health services, no amount of asking for their help is getting me anywhere."
2038,So there's a chance I'm gonna have to go away for a while up to 18 months... does anybody have experience being locked up in new Jersey? I've only been in Union County jail for a couple days and didn't receive psych meds but if I'm in for 18 months will they give me medication or am I screwed? I mean I'm sure they won't give me my xanax but I mean the other ones without recreational value
2039,"I have recently stopped my antipsychotic medication due to horrific side effects and I am wondering if anyone has been sucessful in controlling the sudden spiralling down into dark pkaces and the ruminating intrusive thoughts with their own mind and a stronger personal insight?

2040,Well its been about 1 year since i was finished from work and around 15 months since i started to take lithium. during the last year the lithium has helped with the hypomania and i have only had 1 episode. but i have still experienced long spells of depression then maybe a month of feeling ok but abit dull (like having no emotion) and then i find myself falling into a depression. Like a previous post i posted i was offered ect but felt abit better so turned it down but i feel abit crappy again and think i may of made the wrong decision. i dont want to go and see the psychiatrist as i feel like he has tried loads of different medication and non of them has been the magic pill. ( i have also done talking theropys) . i do have a very stressfull life witch i know does not help but i just dont know what to do i feel trapped inside my own head.
2041,"Hello Friends
I have Unipolar Mania (in my opinion). I was diagnosed with Bipolar in 1998. I have never in my life experienced any sort of depression, not even for a moment. So I consider myself to ""suffer"" from Unipolar Mania.

I put the word ""suffer"" in quotes because my illness removes most suffering from my experience. The only times I remember suffering, are times when I am being locked up against my will.

The nurses corner me, and tie me to a bed, put a mesh bag over my head, stab me with a needle, and then I wake up locked up against my will. I am writing to celebrate that I haven't been locked up for a couple of years now. And I haven't had a manic episode for at least a year now.

Am I in remission? For the past year I have thought clearly. I have lingering delusional thoughts that surface sometimes when I smoke herb. Sometimes I get this feeling that life as I know it is unreal. Things feel really still. Shadows are more defined. Colors seem brighter. And I'm haunted by the thought that life is hidden by a veil of delusion, which tricks us from knowing what is really going on.

In the past year I haven't suffered from missed sleep. I eat normally and do not reject food. My mania causes me to feel no suffering, no need for sleep, no sadness, and no hunger. But in the past year I have slept, and eaten normally. With the exception of those few experiences I've had while high, I have not had any delusional thoughts for a year now. I have had a few injuries that I think should have been more painful than what I was experiencing (which is a warning sign of mania for me). For the most part, though, I feel free of symptoms.

I take 10 mg of Zyprexa. I'm prescribed two 10 mg tablets a day. I take one, and save one. I have saved enough to last me a few months in case anything ever happens to my supply. I can't tell my doctor this though. I told my previous doctor this and she changed my dose. I didn't have any extra back then, so I couldn't give myself extra when I needed it. Now I have plenty of extra pills. In the past my manic episodes happened because I just needed extra zyprexa and I couldn't get it in time, because of our messed up system. Now I believe I will not have that problem anymore. 

So I am very happy to think that I might never have another manic episode. Am I in remission? A couple of times in the past month I skipped a dose. The next morning I would be extremely happy and have giggle fits. Also, after skipping a dose, I feel euphoric and have no need for food. But I have not been haunted by delusion for over a year now.

I want to change my diagnosis from Bi-polar to Unipolar Mania. I do not suffer from depression, so it seems wrong to be diagnosed as Manic Depressive. I have always felt this way, ever since I was first diagnosed. My doctor seems open to the idea that another diagnosis would make sense for me. But in the US at least, there is no official Unipolar Mania diagnosis. 

I'm curious if there is any medication out there that might be useful for someone who experiences delusion, with no depression ever. Zyprexa works for me but makes weight loss difficult.

Are there any other methods besides medication that might work for me? I want to protect myself and my family from my delusional thinking and continuous hospitalizations.  

Does anyone feel they have this illness for a reason? I believe that everything happens for a reason.

My medication also causes my to be pretty sleepy sometimes, and I have fallen asleep at the wheel at least three or four times now. I chose to rarely drive now, and to not drive at night ever.

Any other advice for me?"
2042,"Hi,

I've been on lamotrigine for around 4 months and have titrated up to 200mg per day. It does seem to be having a positive impact on my depression. It hasn't gone away but I'm generally more motivated and when I do feel depressed it doesn't last as long or hit as hard. Just one thing I'm noticing is I seem to experiencing hypomania a lot more. It's not been too problematic but doesn't last as long.

There are other possible reasons for the increase in hypomania such as I'm more open with family and friends so have their support, and it's spring time (just) so perhaps this is affecting my moods. Plus I'm doing a group therapy course which makes you more mindful so maybe I'm more aware.

I was just wondering if anyone found this? Depression: yes it's helping, hypomania/mania: possible increase or rapid cycling"
2043,"Does anybody else find writing helps? 

Recently I've taken to a notebook to write my thoughts in, partially to just get them out without burdening an actual person, but also because I get a thought and think ""NOTE IT DOWN BEFORE YOU FORGET!"", or a quote or a song lyric that I mustn't forget Before something else wades in. Plus a build up of random notes on random bits of paper makes it hard to follow which mood was when and ends up accidentally in the bin as scrap."
2044,Hi I am travelling to Florida next Wednesday I have contacted a multitude of Insurance Companies and am turned down again and again and again. Can anyone help?? Have you managed to get a policy which covers Bipolar Disorder ? If you have could you PLEASE reply telling me which company x
2045,"Hey all :)

I'm new here and I joined up because I just need someone to talk too. I'm scared I am falling into psychosis.

At the beginning of the year I stopped taking my medication completely. This wasn't a spur of the moment decision I had been wanting to stop taking it for a while. So 10 weeks leading up to completely stopping, I began to gradually ween myself off the medication by lowering the dose every few weeks. My original plan was to stop my medication with the help of my Pdr. However, no one returned my phone calls regarding this matter. Everything seemed to be going well. I completed university, joined the gym, was working full time and was dating. It just felt good to be functioning at a good level. Well until 3 weeks ago. I went abroad for a week which was lovely. A few days after I returned home my mood began to drop. I stopped going out, stopped going to work, slept for 12-16 hours a day, started reliving traumas in my dreams (nightmares), crying and having panic attacks.  Not only this but I began to become suspicious of my best friend. I believed she was conspiring against me, lying to me and disrespecting me. I ended up not talking to her.  She has access to my doctors records just in case i become unwell. I became paranoid and phoned my Dr's surgery asking them to remove her name so she no longer has access. I believed she would phone my Dr and make out I was behaving crazy. I was even making plans to change my phone number, deactivate my facebook so she could not access me. I phoned a helpline and they helped me see a bit of clarity with the situation. This was my best friend, we have known each other for 17 years, what was the likelihood she would set out to harm me in anyway whatsoever.  
I have made the conscious effort to try and be as normal as possible. So i forced myself to go to my local shopping centre a few days ago. I lost my bank card. So i had to go into the bank to withdraw money over the counter. Whilst the cashier was checking my I.D. I was bombarded with paranoid thoughts that she may not believe that I am the person on my I.D, then I began to get panicky over being able to sign my signature correctly.

Now for the past 3 nights I have had hardly any sleep. I have been going out, drinking, dancing, socializing. A dramatic change from a few days ago. I suddenly have more energy, I've been laughing to myself, I feel as if I am disconnected from this world....like i know I'm here. But its like I'm in my world....and when i realise im laughing out loud to myself in public....I'm like oh shit I need to compose myself and behave normal. I'm still paranoid, I'm anxious around people and the most ridiculous thoughts just pop into my head and i end up debating with myself weather they could be true....or not. I was so paranoid the other night I thought I had to touch my limbs in a particular away or else something bad would happen. I didn't know what but I was terrified. I stood in the same spot for at least an hour doing this. 

I don't want to burden my friends or my best friend because they all seem to be going through the trails and tribulations of life at the moment. I'm scared and I feel alone in this."
2046,"I kind of feel I need to know what others experience, to try and understand myself and see that it's not just my brain that does this stuff (as I'm aware it's not.)

2047,What's the longest a phase of depression can last with Bipolar? Is it possible for it to last over a year if untreated?

2049,"This is so long guys...for those who read it, sorry for the book and thanks! 

Is it possible to be misdiagnosed with BPD instead of Bipolar? Could it actually be Bipolar I have?
The reason I'm asking, is because, there's a pattern I've noticed in my life. Last year I was diagnose with BPD and ADHD. For the past 10-12 years, life seems to have been a series of great ups, and dramatic downs starting to reveal most in my mid teens around from around 15.

This past year and has been one hell of a long, medically untreated year, of one of my longest lows yet. I lost a lot this time. From gathering motivation for the gym, to trying to keep busy at work and not break down (that didn't happen), to trying new hobbies from the ones that suddenly disinterested me, nothing has worked. The anti depressants, again, I've chosen not to take them, as every one they try with me, makes my depression more worse. Somehow, I feel slightly better without, but still, extremely low. I have attempted suicide, but only when I'm at a rock bottom low and not thinking straight. When I'm good, suicide, sometimes can pop up, but it's not my mission. I can only describe the low as feeling an empty feeling, constant suicidal feeling, I feel too much guilt for letting the people I love down, the things I say when I turn nasty and angry out of nowhere without even slight warning, but then after feel ashamed of myself.  Constantly with that inner voice in my head telling me to kill myself, telling me I'm worthless, a failure, a waste of oxygen. Sometimes I feel suicidal and I don't even know why, it just seems like a regular life option at the time, like it's just a reasonable idea. My opinions often were distorted and delusional at the worst stage, but felt ao factual to me at the time though. Then I'm just depressed again. Then I have an idea, a thought, write it down, and I'm on a train of discovery, hitting highs and lows, every few hours, for the next 30 hours, like I'm on speed. Then low again and self loathing. Right now, this is happening every couple of hours or so. The world just looks grey. 

The thing is, I've never been like this, for so long. And the shame doesn't stop at the low. It hits when I feel good. Before this depression hit, I was, happy, had a job, a partner, a life, i felt like I could rule the world. Energy wasn't a problem, I was extremely hyperactive, constantly having new fun ideas, adventures, waking my partner up 2 hours early for a road trip Id woke up and had as an idea as ""you can sleep when you're dead"" so they say. I've always described it like having fireworks shooting through your brain, and 50mph, in 10 different colours. My ex said when I was good, I was amazing, when I was bad, I was bad. We started to call the bad weeks or months episodes. The mentally well, hyperactive times, Ive never found reason to see a doctor. Although, people often asked if I was on drugs due to my bizarre dramatically friendly behaviour or wild behaviour, when I'm ""well"", compared to now. I wasn't. I always just saw that as my, doing okay at life, being hyperactive and feeling like I could achieve anything, was the time I achieved my success for months, the lows was when I lost everything I'd worked for that good 7-8 months for. When good, I reach for the stars it seems, and get results...then fall down months later and lose it. The hyperactivity can be embarrassing though as well as beneficial.

I've always had up and downs, I kinda felt like a YoYo my whole adult life. One minute I'm flying in life, the next, I crash and fall, then I'm flying, then I fall, it's 1 step forward, 2 steps back, I find makes it hard to progress in life personally. Lows usually last around a month, sometimes even 3-4 months, then back to the high, the me that feels like I could do a backflip down the main centre street. That can last from anything to a few months to up to my best yet, just under a year I managed to stay, NOT depressed. I have periods where I think ""wow, I feel normal right now, sorta"", but that feeling doesn't really last. 

In future, everytime I achieve something and do well at life, I'm just waiting for the fall, it's happened so many times. 

I'm so confused. I just want to understand what it is that's been causing what's happening in my head all these years."
2050,"Hi, My CMHT say that cpns don't offer counselling?"

In my head I see the good job I am doing. In my head I see the positives. but when it comes right down to it and I look inside well...I hate me. 

sucks because I can't get the truth of my reality into the part of my brain that makes me actually believe it.

2055,"I have been diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder from previous psychiatrists, but my most recent diagnosis is Bipolar I disorder from the psychiatrist I am currently treating with.  I had a month-long manic episode where I couldn't sleep, could barely eat, was go-go-going, craved change (I pierced my own ear without any pain one night when I couldn't sleep), amongst other symptoms.  She immediately prescribed Lithium Carbonate.  

I am now on day 4 of treatment with Lithium (300 mg per day), and so far everyone in my life has told me they have noticed a positive change in my demeanor and actions.  I feel that the Lithium is doing me good.  We will see how I feel after it is fully integrated into my system.  :thumbsup:

Does anyone else have experience with Lithium?

2056,"I have been doing ok. I usually have 1 week of pretty decent and 1 week of minor depression (with a couple days of moderate depression) and then it repeats itself over and over. It is manageable and it is only because I take meds or else I would be constantly depressed and only very occasionally have a touch of hypo mania.

BUT last night I drove into town (15 mins) to pick up a few groceries and go to the library. I pulled up the library to lots of teens hanging around outside and smoking and a cop car in the lot with his lights on a car. It sort of freaked me out (I live in a town of 15000 and it is a VERY safe town). I did the library thing and left for Walmart. 

Driving I felt unsettled. Then in the parking lot I was sure I was about to get in an accident (without reason) and I felt like people were following/watching me. All through the walmart it got worse and worse. I felt anxiety and slowed down my shopping because I was scared (a bit) to go outside, walk through the well lit lot in my safe town, to my van. Once in the van I felt like I was being followed. 

I went to one more store and had to sit in my van (with doors locked) and breathe for awhile before it thought it safe for me to drive home. Driving home I was sure the vehicles behind me were either following me or mad at my driving (I was driving the speed limit and no one was following me). 

So here is the questions....anxiety or something more related to hallucinations/psychosis. 

Once home I was exhausted and my jaw was so tense but I felt better almost as soon as I walked through the door to my home and husband.

2058,"I need some advice. Since July last year my boyfriend has been taking Mirtazapine for depression. However since he's started taking it I've noticed a change. He's become a lot more apathetic and passionless. It's like he doesn't care about anything. We're in a long distance relationship and before he started taking this medication we used to talk every day for hours - now I barely hear from him. It seems to have gotten worse as the doseage has increased. I hate to say it but I think this medication has taken away the guy I fell in love with.

For a while I've been wanting to say something to him, but I honestly don't know if it's appropriate? Is it my place to say what meds he should or shouldn't be taking? I'm just worried that if I said something he'd think I was making it all about me, which I don't want to happen. 

It's been a very difficult 7 months, and I'm not sure what to do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."
2059,"Hi. I'm new to the forum hoping to get some help/information. 

I've had a good dig through the forum but can't seem the find the answer I need. I'm sorry if I've missed it anywhere. (I'm really sorry if this is long).

Basically I'm yet to get my diagnosis. I'm being referred to a specialist in the next few weeks but I'm very worried about my driving licence. 

I have a full motorcycle licence (have had it for 6 years) and I don't know what I'd do without my motorbike. (I don't need it to get to work etc, its just something that brings me a lot of joy). I'm also due to do my car test in the next couple weeks as my OH currently does all the driving, and I want to help with that as well as gain a bit more independence during the winter months. 

If I did get a bipolar (or BPD) diagnosis I'd have to inform the DVLA. But is it pretty much guaranteed that I will lose my licence? 
I have never been hospitalised etc and my instructors have always said how good & natural I am at driving (even on my bad days they will praise how good I am). 

I'm just very worried about losing it. I do have other questions about getting a diagnosis etc, but I shall leave them for another day as I'm not so worried about that. 

Again, sorry if this is really long. I just want to ensure I explain it properly."
2060,"ok, so, I've been depressed and anxious all my life, literally since the day I was born, but lately I've been feeling everything a lot more than usual. I have gone through phases like this before, when I've also thought maybe I could be bipolar. I've been blaming my derealization/dissociation for my mood because more often than not, I feel like a complete stranger to myself. 
when I am ""myself"", I am very depressed, tired, and unmotivated to do anything. I'm never able to focus on my school work, or even simple tasks like just watching tv. But there are moments where I fall into this ""hyper-realistic"" state, everything feels 10x more intense. I call this my other me, but it doesn't feel like me. It doesn't feel like me talking or walking, I'm just kinda watching my body do it. And usually during this state my mood will rapidly improve and I feel immensely content and happy, or rapidly fall and I become self-destructive. 
And I can never really predict what will happen. Usually its triggered by absolutely nothing or tiny things that shouldn't matter. so, I really have no idea what it is. Does this even make sense, probably not."
2061,"So I'm in the process of being referred to a specialist for diagnosis as my GP has said he is not allowed to diagnose something like bipolar. 

I kept a feelings/thought diary for around 10 weeks and went back to him. 

He said some of the comments were interesting and highly suspects I have bipolar. 

However, he said he doesn't think it's in my brain, he thinks it's more personality based... what does this mean? Did he just get his words confused? 
Also what does the diagnosis period entail...? I know it can take around a year to get a diagnosis but I'm worried about letting people down. How did you all cope getting your diagnosis?"

the guys in the pub talk about how ""male"" they are, but I don't feel it, I just feel useless as a male being.

2063,"Hi all,
I am new to posting in forums but thought it could be a good way for me to talk out my problems living with my girlfriend who has recently been diagnosed with bi polar ||. 

We have been together for over 2 years now and have lived together for pretty much all of that time. It was only after the 'honeymoon' stage started to ease off that things started getting a little out of hand. Our fights would be these eruptions of yelling and screaming throwing things etc. 

I have had problems with depression and anxiety for years and I think the problem was that I would try and match her aggressiveness during a 'hypo' moment when something I would do/say that set her off. 

During her depressive lows I thought that I could understand and help get etc. because I I have been through a lot myself but when I couldn't understand why she thought some of the things about herself that she did I would almost always get frustrated and it would lead to more aggressive fighting. 

Neither of us had any idea about bipolar disorder so we thought it was just how we were together etc and sort of accepted it as how we would be. 

But finally a few months ago my girlfriend went to the dr and he diagnosed her with bipolar ||. 

At first I thought I knew enough about it to understand and help etc. but as of a few days ago when she was in a deep low I realised that my frustrations are unhelpful and I need help learning how to be with someone who has bipolar as opposed to thinking it's just depression and I can just talk her out of her moods. 

I'd love the just start a forum where people can share their own experiences and hopefully regularly come back to describe recent episodes and have a place to talk it out with others who understand how hard it can be living with some who has bipolar."
2064,"I have been depressed off and on for over a month. I suppose I may need to look at changing my meds. I am tired of feeling down. I am tired of everything taking more energy.

A couple days of overkill happiness and excitement and energy would be so lovely."
2065,spent my last few quid today on milk/bread  so its living on fresh air now for the next few days... debt and benefits isn't the way to live your life.
2066,"Hi there,
I don't like to self diagnose because I would probably be wrong and would be calling normal human behavior a mental disorder, so any help you guys could give would be great!

For the past few years I've struggled to feel anything but neutral to most things. Sure, I can enjoy playing a game or watching a movie but it feels like I am just doing something to stop being bored. 
I then randomly sometimes go from feeling nothing to feeling like a kid on Christmas morning who has just gone downstairs to find presents under the tree. That feeling is not over exaggerating. It's like I feel amazing and happy and I can't stop smiling and it's bought on randomly. (This is the only time I ever feel like posting about this)
The other times I go from feeling nothing to feeling so depressed that I have suicidal thoughts and just don't want to do anything.

The thing which makes me think this isn't Bipolar is the fact that the excited feeling I get lasts for around 5-10 minutes, never longer (as far as I remember) and the depression can last for either the same time or for a period of a few days.

Any advice you could give me would be great."
2067,"I know I shouldn't complain but how are we supposed to live?  I just got my monies today and already its gone, paid bills. got 10 quids worth of food and had a coffee out and now I have 3 quid to last 14 days..

not sure how thats going to work out :("
2068,"I feel its hard writing about this because of the bias that I might inadvertently introduce as I want an explanation, I don't want to live not knowing why I feel like this and having little sucess in combating it. 

I am tired all the time, I wake up tired, during the day I'm tired and during the evening I'm tired. Very often I experience severe mood swings that seemingly springs from nothing or are triggered by events that, from what I've gathered, are insignificant to ""normal"" people. Like just a week ago I was at the gym and all of a sudden this rage came over me and I wanted to self harm. 

Right now as I'm sitting in front of the computer I'm feeling so low also for no apparent reason, I just want to sit down in the corner of my room to cry or tear my face off or something anything to let the feelings out because it feels like I'm disintegrating from the inside out. I can control it though, some years ago I couldn't control the impulses and it made my life hell but I've somewhat learnt to repress the emotions, but I'm feeling so tired. Each time I push them down it feels like it wears me down a little bit more, I though that perhaps controlling them in this way would make the mood swings be less violent but they're the same. 

I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm burdening my friends too much with all my talk of feeling depressed. They're understanding enough but I feel shit for being a burden to them and I often cut off such people because I can't stand being a burden to others. Having nothing to offer other people besides my pain and the endless talk about it.

I just want an answer, some way to understand and work with this problem, because if this is how its supposed to be then I don't know if I want to live in this world. Is this something akin to bipolar disorder or is it something else? I can get periods of severe depression that lasts for several days, where I'm basically unable to do anything but I've never gotten a positive period. There have been times when I felt almost euphoric also not as a response to anything logical but those are rare and pass quickly. These mood swings occur everyday almost, usually being either depressive or angry/frustrated. 

Sorry that the post was so long."
2069,"I've started forgetting things and it's getting annoying. Stuff like names for things/people. Words I'm about to say or type then I go blank like it's been sucked out of my head, I remember the meaning of it but the word is totally gone and I have to Google the meaning to find the word. 
People's names that I may have used when I'm with them at that moment, but I then go to refer to them a few minutes later and it is gone out of my head.
I'm also reading more words wrong, I read then think that doesn't make sense and go back and see that the word which changed the meaning of the sentence is actually something else.
I'm putting this down to the meds because I can't see that it's anything else (except old age, but I'm only 36!)

Has anyone else noticed this?"
2070,"Haven't seen BDU on here  for a couple of nights. I hope she's ok.

2075,"I've made threads on other parts of this but I thought I'd just say on here cause it's more manic. I've been feeling really out of control lately. I'm in a dark place that I didint know I could get to. I'm feeling like I want to end it, because I know I have to. The only reason I'm not is cause of my mum. I lost my step dad to suicide a few years ago, and I don't want a repeat. But I'm feeling so out of control that i might,  I'm not sure if I'll even realise I'm doing it, I'll be so out of it. I don't want to, but that part of me is dying and I'm trying to hold back, but I feel like I'm gonna snap and I'm not sure when. I'm getting a comperhensive assessment in a few days, and I want to tell them this. But my worry is that will hospitalize me. I know that if I'm completely honest they probably will. Has anybody been through this? if you have please comment. What would they do? I'm just really scared I will be locked up. Deep down thats probably what I need but I'm just scared."

2080,Can anybody help me.  I started a new job back in July 2016 and didn't get off to a good start. I was bullied and intimidated by the manager. He walked out leaving me to run the place until they got a new manager. Because of what happened they extended my probationary period by 2 months. This probationary period ends in February but when I had my review today they commented that I do not show any emotions and have little reactions even though I believe I do they are struggling to see this and they say I have no confidence. I don't know what else I can do as I try my best and possibly try too much. I am more than capable of doing the job but they are saying I am not showing much progress! How can I improve things? Does anybody else out there struggle to hold down a job with bipolar?
2081,Has anyone here ever had dialectical behavioural therapy?
2082,"hello

2083,"So I have been taking Zyprexa/Olanzapine for almost 3 years and gained almost 40 pounds.  I'm concerned I am at risk for diabetes.

I have tried other antipsychotics but I can't seem to sleep with out olanzapine.

I have proposed to the doctor that I should take trazodone and something like abilify(along with lithium) instead of taking just zyprexa. 

Does anyone know how trazodone and zyprexa compare for sleep?
Alternative what do you take for sleep?  I meet with a nurse practitioner regularly and I think he is reluctant to prescribe something else for sleep so he has kept me on Zyprexa for a long time."
2084,"Mine are gone now because of meds but the last few days I think I see shadows and then I wonder if I was seeing 'things'. I saw a man in an odd spot and when I looked back I couldn't see him...not sure if it was a snowbank blocking him or maybe he wasn't real..

My hallucinations weren't scary. And when they went away I actually missed them a bit. Sometimes it is lonely (even though I am by no means alone in this journey). The thoughts in my head and heart are lonely when I struggle to keep my balance.

So sometimes I miss the woman in red who was always by my side.I miss the man who just rambled on about everything I was doing. I DO NOT miss the demon looking shadows of bedtime.

So I am curious....what is your relationship to you hallucinations?"
2085,"I feel so hopeless.. my depression has come back, and I've been having homicidal thoughts.. idk if it's because of my OCD or if it's because of Bipolar disorder. I was diagnosed with BP when I was a teenager and since then only OCD. 

I've never been one to have homicidal thoughts until OCD started. I experience thoughts and urges but I feel myself actively resisting.. but I don't know why it's coming on like this. 

I'm in between a rock and a hard place. I don't want to tell my husband and put a burden on him or my family and make them unhappy. 

I also feel I can't talk to anyone about this because of my kids and I don't want to get them taken from me. I have an image to uphold also.. I. don't. know. what. the. FUCK. to do. I feel trapped and not able to get the treatment I need because of the stigma. 

I'm visibly irritated and annoyed and being short with people..

 I don't know to attritbute this to my OCD or depression, or bipolar. I guess I just hope I don't actually have bipolar disorder, but in reality, I may."
2086,"Hi everyone

I was recently put on antidepressants (Prozac) for my depression. For the longest time i was feeling really low, like life wasn't worth living. I felt slow and empty, like my existence was joyless.

Then recently I suddenly started having loads and loads of energy. I couldn't stop jiggling and fidgeting and I was staying up all hours of the night because I couldn't stop thinking, and was feeling really creative, writing poetry at 2am. On average I've been having 3-4 hours sleep. I was suddenly a lot more talkative and social and couldn't stop singing and talking to myself, when before I had been doing everything I could to avoid social situations. I also noticed that my built-up energy was making me kind of on edge, especially at night I was jumping at every sound.

Then today it was like I suddenly crashed again. I feel empty again. And I've been crying for no reason. It's like I've hit rock bottom again when before I was on top of the world.

I guess my question is, could it just be caused by the meds? I never thought I was bipolar, but I do have a family history of it"
2087,"Ok my names Kim my story may be a little long but please I'm desperate please read 

My dad was brought up a gypsy he was taken away from family and put in special school he has learning difficulties he was abused for 2 yrs there by staff I only know this because he spoke with grandad about it.
He distrusts anyone in authority his mom was also abusive hitting him starving him 
He has been in prison a few times over the years I think because he is sick

I know he talks to people who aren't there on the few times he has admitted it to me he says he doesn't tell anyone course he doesn't want to be taken away again 
He still lives with our family but he and my mom have split up she can't put up with him any more 
We have a doctor coming round in the middle of Jan as he wont go see one and he hasn't left the house in 5 yrs that's why I'm here tonight he admitted he doesn't go out because the voices tell him people talk about him and he thinks he can read there mind 
All his doc says is he is depressed and gives more pills that make him worse

2088,"Aripripazole for depression in bipolar disorder/ your experience on Quetiapine withdrawal?

I have started on Aripripazole (in addition to Lamotrigine and Mirtazepine) - has anyone had much experience on this drug? The literature states that it is effective in manic states but not so much for depressive states... which is a bit disheartening as depression is by far and large a much bigger issue for me.

Also cross-titrating from Quetiapine, have stopped now and could not sleep at all... anyone has any experience with Quetiapine withdrawal?"
2089,"So I should have listened to my gut instinct about seeing a psychiatric nurse practitioner instead of a real psychiatrist.

While I am very reactive to medicine and can live a near normal life while medicated, I also require very high doses.  I have maxed out the FDA limits or blood level limits for medicines more times than I can count.  Up, up, up followed by augmenting or changing followed by up, up, up is a constant in my treatment.  Sometimes on the medicines that do double duty (anti-psychotics or anti-convulsants), my previous doctors have gone on past the FDA limits for mood stabilization and instead used the FDA limits for schizophrenia or seizures because I hit the mood stabilization limit and am still having symptoms to the point of interfering with my life, work and marriage/family.

The psychiatric nurse practitioner told me today that she adheres to FDA mood stabilization limits period.  No wiggle room for patients like me.  I emailed her my list of previously tried medications last week, she absolutely hates it because I've tried and failed on so many medications that she feels it's not leaving her a lot of options.  Funny, I look at the list and there's a ton of stuff I haven't tried yet or had a fair shot on.

I need an aggressive treatment provider.  I need someone like the doctor I had last year who looked at me as an individual and treated my symptoms as I presented them and listened when I said I haven't slept in three days because my mind is racing and I'm bawling my head off at work over a missing staple puller and decided to raise the mood stabilizer to levels more appropriate to seizure patients (it worked).

I am never, ever, ever seeing a nurse practitioner again.  All they do is screw up in treating people."
2090,"Hello :) I have just signed up because i am depressed right now and spending most of my time at home. I am so depressed it is the worst episode in two years for me. My Lamictal has stopped working for my depressions and i have just started an AD which i am not sure is working much yet. I am not in bed all day so that is a plus but i still cannot do much because i don't feel able to because of lack of energy and also a lack of interest. All i can do is eat and drink and wander around my home. I have been feeling bored for a while now but the depression makes me feel even more bored because i cannot occupy myself with anything, not even cleaning. I will have a bath later as that is something i like doing when i feel like this. 

Has anybody had similar problems with Lamictal stopping and did they add an AD? I am worried about a pole switch because i equally hate being high, i think. I really wish this nasty disorder would go away but it never does. It comes back again and again and even when it is not destroying me it is there in the background making me feel so bad. I am very tired with all of this and cannot wait to get to the end of my life."
2091,"So I forgot to take my midday antipsychotic dose today. I wonder if it has anything to do with my mood swings. I NEED a mood stabilizer. I wish I was still on depakote. It helped with my moods. The past couple of days I have found myself to be crying over nothing. Yesterday I was watching Tv. I forget what show was on but I realized that I was crying. For what reason I couldn't tell you. I have been irritable these past few days. I have been isolating myself in my room and getting angry for no reason. I feel like I'm on the verge of another episode. I guess I should check and see if I have everything I need in my duffel bag I keep for when I go to the hospital. I feel so lost. Without direction, and pointless. All I do all day is listen to music, watch Tv, and smoke cigarettes. Before starting sertraline I at least got some sleep. I would normally sleep 12+ hours. Now I'm down to 7 hours or so so now I have more time to kill during the day. I feel like I'm going mad, especially when I have a mixed episode. I rarely eat anything anymore. I just cant find the motivation to make food. Even microwaving something is taxing for me. I don't know what to do anymore. I almost self harmed last night but knew my family would see my wrist when I saw them today. I feel like my schizophrenia is somewhat treated these days but my bipolar remains unchecked."
2092,"Hello, I am new here and I'm looking for some advice. I am a 28 yr old female, and I have had anxiety for some time now..well over 10 years. Back in highschool i went to a psychiatrist who, very quickly, asked me some questions and prescribed me Klonopin and another medication for depression. I honestly feel like I didnt have depression back then, as i was experiencing more anxiety than ever. I never took Klonopin and I started using breathing exercises which helped for a bit, but weren't very useful in the long-run. I get very agitated quickly, and I almost feel like an ""itchy"" feeling when i get to my ""breaking"" point before I yell and get very anxious.  I went on Lexapro for about a year for my anxiety.  I eventually cut down on lexapro because it wasn't doing anything for me anymore. I took a new genetics test which pinpoints the best medications for anxiety/depression and the result was a medication like lexapro, but, i felt otherwise. Some weeks I just want to stay inside and some weeks i can't wait to go out and shop, etc. I sometimes feel random bouts of happiness, or excited, which lasts maybe about a minute, then I feel ""down"" again. I have never felt unrealistic confidence in my abilities, which Ive read is a symptom of bipolar 1. In fact, Im really afraid of failure. I have changed my college major atleast 5 times, and when i think i just CANT do it, i back out. When I get angry, I don't think about consequences, I sort of ""black out"" and go into a fit of rage. I have been having a really hard time sleeping lately. I feel like my mind is always racing and I don't get a full nights rest. I am constantly worrying and thinking about something bad happening. I just found out about Cyclothymia and some of my symptoms fit it. I really don't know what I have but I just want to feel ""normal"" and I'm so ashamed and embarrassed to go to another psychiatrist. I have tried talking to my husband but he is not supportive or easy to speak to.."
2093,"Okay Im 20, I have been seeing mental health services since I was 15. Ive been in hospitals, Ive been through the whole system. 

I had psychosis when I was 15 and was diagnosed with everything from depression to bipolar to schizophrenia. Now I feel so unwell, ive had anorexia aswell but I'm better now, my eating is very controlled, I eat the exact fods everyday at the same time. ROUTINE AND CONTROL is my life, I need it.

The past few days however I feel very unwell, I'm up and down, I cant control myself, The thoughs in my head was telling me to hurt myself, I didn't and now I feel better, I'm falling out with everyone and my sleep is disturbed, I feel really off the wall

Ive been stable for a year and I'm on medications and everyone has been saying how well I am however I'm very upset as everyone is saying I'm going back to my old ways.

I'm confused because my emotions are over the top and I'm simply overwhelmed. I have no diagnosis and its annoying I want answers, why am I well and then I go crazy!!!!!!! I'm very paranoid aswell, its like I hate everyone"
2094,"Is it possible for antidepressants to make someone manic/hypomanic without being bipolar?

I have tried 2 different antidepressants and they both made me hypomanic, prozac put me into a mixed state and Zoloft made me the happiest I'd ever been in my life but it also made me cycle horribly. One day I'd be on top of the world thinking I was the most important person who ever lived then the next I couldn't even get out of bed and just wanted to cry and I just didn't understand why. I was on this medication for two years, and i look back on the things I did and cry because I made the biggest fool of myself so many times and I thought I was doing the right thing.

2096,"Hi guys, I am new here. I have joined because i feel like I need some advice from people that know what it's like to deal with things I am because nobody in my surrounding understands me. Recently I have been diagnosed with a serious case of PTSD, from nightmares to flashbacks to distrust, mood swings and depression, to the overall feeling that I am dying every day. 
This thing comes from my family, my abusive father and my mother who has completely lost it for the past two years and all she does is put the blame on me for all the fighting and trouble she has with my father - which happens on a daily basis - they're screaming, breaking things and even physically fight. They don't even believe me when I say I have PTSD even though a psychiatist has given me a diagnose. I have managed to get my sh*t together because i had a loving and caring boyfriend - who also has bipolar disorder, and in one of his phases he left me. I don't know how to deal with myself anymore, alone, because all I want to do is escape from my house, permanently, and I have nowhere to go, no relatives. I want to help my ex boyfriend too by being there for him because I know he still does love me but he's going through a rough phase, but I can't find the strenght to do anything. I don't even like waking up in the morning.

Do you have any advice? A tip about what I can do to feel a little better?

2101,"Hiya guys,
    My names Kym I'm a married mom of 4 great kids.:) I was DX with Bipolar Disorder 2 with Schitzoaffective, BPD, and anxiety.  I also believe I have agoraphobia because whenever I go outside of my ""safe zone"" my anxiety kicks into overdrive. I have been on and off all types of meds till I found a combo that seems to work the best.  But it's still been an up and down cycle until I'm pushed or triggered by something and then I SI.  I was DX in my early 30's and until then just plain suffered cause I thought that was life. When I told my parents my diagnosis they responded that I was ""looking for attention/sympathy"" huh? My sister was DX Bipolar in high school and they just accepted it but because I was ""supposedly"" smarter and did well in high school, my DX just got pushed away.  

That was the begining of many fights between my parents and I, in their eyes I never measured up to what they expected of me.  When I told my parents I was pregnant with my 4th child my father told me "" You have no business raising three kids, nevermind 4"". yeaaaa ok whatever, I knew I was a good Mom and my kids loved me and that's all that mattered to me. Pretty much after that I cut ties with my parents who in turn made sure my sisters and brother (all younger than me) had nothing to with me also. So basically the only family I had was my Uncle and my cousin, which was fine by me, he was everything my father wasn't and I love him with all my heart. :inlove:
  
Anyways I was married for 13 years till one day my exhusband came home and told me that he was leaving because he couldn't ""deal"" with my depressions or SI and he told me to explain it to the kids. OH HELL NO! I stood in front of the door and told him if he wanted to leave fine but that HE was going to explain it to the kids , not me (my kids were all under 14 at the time the youngest being 7). Understandably the kids were upset and I was upset for them but relieved for me.  I wasn't stupid I knew why he spent hours on the computer but would shut the screen down when I walked in the room, he was talking or making plans with another woman.  I honestly didn't care, as long as I got the paycheck to pay the bills, he could do whatever. He would come home from work and start screaming that the kids were being too loud, now I have taught my kids about indoor/outdoor voices, so I knew that wasn't true they were just being kids and of course that would start an argument and I would end up going next door to have coffee with my gf, let HIM put the kids to sleep. 

HA! After the kids adjusted to him being completly gone (his work hours went from 7am- 5or 6 pm to 7am- 8 or 9 pm) which didn't take long, we had a great time, the girls and I were always watching Disney shows together, good lord I had to watch Hannah Montana lol, but we had fun, I got my 12 yr old into football because he really wanted to play and the kid was a natural.:loveshower:  My oldest who at the time was 14 had the hardest time with it, I tried talking to him but he shut everyone except for very few (like3) close friends out.  He would stay in his room on the computer and play role playing games or taught himself how read write and speak Japanese, he was into anime, so I looked into it and instantly got into Death Note and Inuyasha loved other too but those were my favs. I know why my oldest had such a hard time, it was because on our wedding day , my now exhusband promised my son that he would never leave him or me and he felt that his father broke his promise and was angry but never acted out, just kept everything inside.  It killed me to see my son like this but I tried everything short of a hospital and nothing worked. 
   
For 7 years it was just me and my kids and I was happy, of course I got depressed now and then, sometimes deep depressions but  I knew I HAD to get out of bed because there was no one else to care for my kids but me. 
  
2 years before I lost my apartment, my (supposed) gf had given me an Oxy 15 mg for my back pain, it was really bad pain. It worked great plus gave me energy to boot, so she told what Dr to go to, what to say to the Dr to get my own script, I figured ok. Now I was the type of person who never even took a tylenol for a headache and knew nothing of pain meds.  This Dr put me on 8 15mg per day, I was like thats a lot and he assured me it would work. Ok got the script filled, took the meds like the Dr told me and I remember telling my gf that I really felt ""loopy"" she assured me it was just my body adjusting to the new medication, ok sounded reasonable, well a month later I STILL felt that way and honestly didn't care.  Of course by that time I was addicted but because I had a script it was ok, yeahhhh NOT.  

I stopped cleaning the house, I was nodding off constantly, I had so many cig burns in my couch it was rediculous. But I still didn't care, I felt bad I popped a pill and everything went away. After years of abuse, SI, and almost everything else that a person could go through I had ALWAYS stayed away from drugs and now here I was pretty much a ""junkie"".  Of course living in the building I did someone called CPS on me THEN I knew I HAD to do something, so I weaned myself down to 2 per day, CPS went away and I was back to ""normal"".  

Well someone told my ex what happened with me and he made it his mission to take the kids away from me, when for the first year of seperation he never bothered to even visit.  It was and still is a control thing but he had me so triggered I started SIing worse than ever, I think I tried suicide at least 5-6 times, my poor kids saw this.:cry2:  After one hospital stay, actually my last one, I came home and found in my mail a letter from the courts, if I hadn't been sent home that day, my ex was going to court to have me committed, the Fing bastard!!! I was LIVID!!!! And called and told him so. 

Soon after I lost my apartment because he stopped paying child support, since I was homeless I had no option but to sign custody over to him so the kids could go to school, even though he told everyone that HE TOOK custody from me, which was not true. Now my kids are all almost 18, my youngest will be 18 in a year and half and already told me that she will be moving in with me. They ALL HATE their father and yet the thing is when they talk bad about him in front of me I still say ""hey thats your Dad don't talk about him that way"" although inside I understand why they do.  Stupid I know, but the way I look at is that I am the better person for doing this. Well thats my book, so anyone who feels alone or that no one will understand, just read this post.  I'm always willing to try to help out anyone I can.  At this moment I am in my 5th semester of college with a 3.8 GPA, I want to be a couselor for adolescents with mental health issues."
2102,"Hi all,

Been a poster and responder here for a while... But this time of year makes me feel very much alone and without social contact.  I'm 50 years old, and I don't know how to make friends anymore. I have a good job where I interact with lots of (work) people, but outside of work, well that's where it all breaks down.  How do I meet people at this time of life?  I have a lovely husband, but he cannot suffice everything, nor should he.  Does anyone have any suggestions?"
2103,"“Have I gone mad?” asked the Mad-Hatter. “I’m afraid so, you’re entirely bonkers”, Alice replied,“but I’ll tell you a secret… all the best people are.”
         The exchange above is from Lewis Carroll’s notorious fictional story, Alice in Wonderland,  which in my professional opinion stands with more validity than today’s  psychiatric and mental health paradigms. In fact, Alice shares the same  view as some of the greatest thinkers of all-time, such as Socrates who  once declared: “Our greatest blessings come to us by way of madness, provided the madness is given us by divine gift.”Plato too referred to insanity as “a divine gift and the source of the chief blessings granted to men.”

2104,"Hello Everyone.
This is MT.I am from Washington DC.I was Born in Pakistan in a moderate but religious Muslim family. I was born with Moebius syndrome. My life was tough, it is still very tough.I am living in United States for last 4 years.But I will not go into details much, I will stick to the main issues right now.

So right now I have two very serious problems. I was using porn since I was 13, Now I am 27 almost. Porn was very depressive for me.So recently I went to internal medicine doctor, he has given lexapro 10 Mg, now he has increased to 20 Mg lexapro. It is helping me a lot to deal with my porn addiction. I have been sober for 3 months in recent days.
But then I relapsed. But I am doing a lot better than before taking antidepressants.

But Now doctor has referred me to a psychiatrist also.So this was my first problem. Porn addiction is my first problem.Now lets move to my second problem.

So my second problem is that, I have been atheist for many years but my mother is religious muslim women. And she tells me a lot, how much I am missing. I should practice islam and be a good muslim. she always keep insisting me to practice islam.

After getting exposed to Western American Christianity, I read a lot about christianity also. Now I almost know everything about christianity.

But I don't like Christianity or Islam. because I think all religions are depressive.
I don't want to go into religious debate here, but I want to stick to atheism. Because it suits me, Because I was born with severe suffering of moebius syndrome. And I don't like concept of God or God.

But Now I am having serious trouble.I can't stick to one single faith. I am changing faiths. One day I am muslim,second day I am atheist, third day I am christian. And this swing keeps happening. I stay in atheism for longest time, but then I go back into islam or chirstianity for short period, and then I come back into reality.

Now I will be visiting psychiatrist very soon. 
I want know what is wrong with me, what is going on with me. And how to deal with me.And is it bipolar ?"
2105,"""Bad Brain"" is a code in my house that I'm not doing all that well and to leave me the eff alone because I won't be rational.  They are rare now, thank goodness, but today is a Bad Brain day.

I've had problems with coworkers the last couple days I worked (31st and 1st).  So I was already tensed up.

I tried to go to the bank before work, but the lines at both branches were unreasonably long, 20 people at one branch.  On a Tuesday, mid-morning (avoiding both the people going in before work and the lunch crowd), it's not a government payday (I live in a town with a lot of government and military workers) and it's not the final day of the typical grace period for rent.  So I don't get why the lines were so unreasonably long.

That built up a lot of frustration as the plan was to pay the rent, add a tenant to the lease and pay the pet deposit for two cats.

I gave up and decided to get some food before work.  The place I was craving was supposed to open at 11am, the door was still locked when I got there just after 11.  I called and they said they were open, went back and the door was finally unlocked.

I bought a drink and took my cup to the drink machine.  Coke Freestyle, for those in the US.  I hate the taste of diet and that was all they had available.  So I paid for a soda but I was stuck drinking water, so I wasted that money.

I was crying in frustration as I called my husband, and he did a little to calm me down but his attempts just weren't really working.

I asked to speak to the manager about the drink thing and I just lost it.  Cried my head off over the stupid effing drink.  I got in my car and was sobbing hysterically.

After several minutes, I knew I'd be useless for work.  I could go in and do the bare minimum of my job.  I knew I'd be crying off and on, right in front of coworkers and customers.  I knew that any little stressor, anything that normally would be just a touch of annoyance easily forgotten, was going to put me right back in hysterics.

I called out, told the manager that my disability was flaring up and I'd be useless to them today.  Now I gotta talk to HR when I go back to work.

I came home and told my daughter to just ignore me all day.  I made the mistake of calling the rental office and found out that I must show proof of rabies vaccine to add the cats.  The rabies vaccine causes cancer, so now I gotta risk giving my cats cancer.  I've already dealt with feline cancer twice, I really really don't want to deal with it again, especially knowing that this time it will be entirely my fault.

I tried a little computer time to calm down, no it ain't working.

I'm going back to bed.  Maybe that's what I need, a fresh start to the day whenever I get around to getting back up.

Edit:  Before I start a cat vaccination argument claiming I'm listening to junk science, here is the information from the AVMA, the NIH and the Humane Society, all reputable sites.

you got plans for tomorrow night?   or one in front of the TV with a take away? (my idea of bliss)


anyway, just take it easy..."

2108,"I have been doing better. But I just cannot seem to make meals and clean. I get the basics of cleaning done but nothing extra....nothing that keeps a house clean over time.

And meals....ugh. My husband is home more this week because of Christmas and I just don't know what to make and I have nothing planned. I go for groceries and buy random food...yogurt, cereal, bread. 

I am not interested in what my kids got for Christmas or what they are doing or saying. 

I just want to run away.

I am a bad mom. I am a bad wife (sex is whole other story ugh or lack of story because it doesn't happen). 

If I can't run away then I want to guzzle the wine in my fridge. I don't because I know that is not the answer."
2109,"This is not a joke.

I was just wondering if anyone had any insights into this question.

Last night I was somewhat mad. I shaved off half my hair - the right-hand side. I was laughing a lot at the time. I was buzzing (and so were the clippers).

It seemed to me that I was psychotic - there must be a reason for doing this to the right-hand side and not shaving the whole head - but I didn't know WHY. I mean, you wouldn't do an odd thing like that unless there was a reason. If there were a reason then that would be a delusion, an odd belief not shared by other people - but I don't know what it is.
Then I thought that it was manic behaviour - doing wild things that I later regret.

Then I thought that maybe that is the difference between psychosis and mania - that in psychosis there are reasons for what gets done - and in mania the reasons are unknown and stuff just gets done.

Anyway. I have rarely felt like this. Very rarely. 
I'd quite like to feel like that again though, it was fun."

I have been, am, feeling like I'm two halves of a person. 
One half is just normal, can be silly, just the regular kind of me I guess. 
But the other half wants to totally fuck up the first half. 
I feel like I could be a condemned man dancing and joking his way to the gallows.
I don't feel suicidally depressed, but I could easily take overdoses of my meds. I could easily drink a half bottle of something. I could easily take a bunch of drugs. I can easily harm myself by restricting what I eat, and purging when I think I should/could - sometimes more for harm's sake than weight. 
I don't feel the emotions of hurt and harm, but I am acting too easily on the thoughts. And at the moment I don't want to stop any of it. That destructive half is in charge. 
But it's like a hidden undercurrent, hiding under my other half who is the one out in the open. 
I forgot my meds this morning. Instead of calling home to get husband to bring them in, instead of taking them late when I got in, I was gleeful that it would cause chaos for myself.

2114,"hello
im 24 I run a very succesful business but has created a lot of stress, along with so much more. My girlfriend left me who promised to stay by my side. She's left twice, the second one was when i snapped at her for no reason and regretted it and forgot what I had even done. I was jumping out of the car at 20mph and just walked off. Fried. I have done some violent things in my life but I am a very caring person. I dont want to lose everyone and I feel I really now need to change. After seeing out of hours GP I was referred and referred again to a mental institute last night. People walking around like zombies. Scary stuff, I didnt want to stay but thankfully I have two nurses who come see me every morning with medication now. I still dont know what the diagnosis is. The first doctor said depression, 2nd said Mania, 3rd (My nurses) Are still assessing me and thinking Bipolar and ADHD. Thanks for listening and im open to help and advice as I dont talk to anyone any more"
2115,I am almost out of options. There are some new mood stabilisers around now and some used more in certain countries. What options do i have now? My current one i have been taking for three years at this amount and it is not helping my depressions anymore. I am also having problems with my blood count or something i cannot understand but may not be able to take it for much longer. I hate the antipsychotics because of weigh gain mostly. Any ideas?
2116,Hey I'm not quite sure what's going on right now. My rational mind is shrinking and the more strange thoughts are filling my head. I had a moment where I forgot who I am and where I was today. And the thoughts of the reptilian shadow government is filling my head more and more. My thoghts are getting much more sporadic and the whispers and screaming isn't getting any bettwr. I can't do this.
2117,Started Abilify today. We thought my manic / psychotic episode was an isolated incident.  Have experienced a couple brief breaks with reality.  Recognized and called doctor ... started on Abilify today to stay on the planet  ... feedback?  Likes?  Dislikes?  Side effects?
2118,"Hey everyone,

So, I was speaking to my psychiatrist and he has a lady that recognises her highs and lows and hadn't taken meds in years nor required psychiatric care.

This kinda fascinates me because as a bipolar sufferer myself, I couldn't do without meds and psychiatric care. I'd go crazy. 

I know some people on here don't take meds to control their bipolar and I want to know why? And how do you control your bipolar disorder without medication?
 
Thanks in advance."
2119,"Can anybody offer me any advice? I am bipolar but also suffer from horrendous anxiety. I started a new job back in July and the manager was horrible towards me. He was bullying me big style and talking about me to other staff and making lies up about me. He got found out though and ended up walking out and leaving me to run the place for two months on my own. Now we have a new manager but what has happened has fuelled my parnanoia and now I don't know what to believe as my head is telling me people are out to get me and if people bring things up that I have done wrong or I can improve on, I am overreacting and thinking they are trying to get rid of me. Because I didn't get off to a good start they extended my probationary period and now I am convinced they aren't going to keep me on and they just want rid of me! The thing is I am 100% sure I am right. It's causing me lots of stress. Any advice on what I should do would be appreciated?"
2120,"Well, the answer as to whether I needed to up the mood stabilizer has been definitively answered tonight.

I'm down in the dumps, so frustrated that I'm nearly ready to cry, not looking forward to work tomorrow, and I had to ask my manager for a pep talk to make it through the night.  I'm reacting far more strongly emotionally than I should be to adversity.

I'm in retail.  I worked Sunday, Tuesday (yesterday) and today.

Sunday there was a no call/no show and I had to do the work of at least two people.  They always assign a minimum of two people, sometimes three, for the closing shift.  I was told 4 hours to closing.  I got all the clothes off the floor and made the tables of clothes pretty and sorted through what needed to go back on the floor and that was that.  I didn't put away anything, the things I should have put away I had to leave for the morning group.  I didn't have time to go through places twice so customers could have dropped things on the floor after I went through.  I just couldn't do it.  I wanted to dedicate time to fix a big display, that was totally abandoned.

Today there was a no call/no show.  And the manager on duty didn't tell me right away, I found out when I asked 2 hours prior to closing.  I only made it through 11 out of 13 sections.  One table, the last one I did, I didn't make it pretty and someone's going to have to go behind me and fix that table.  There's three or four packages of socks and underwear still on the floor because I completely ran out of time.  I didn't have time to check anything twice and I think someone did mess up one table I had done earlier.  I did sort through everything, but I couldn't put it away and there's even more than on Sunday.

Twice in three workdays.....it's tough to keep my spirits up right now. :low:"

I have had a few strange experiences where I see someone I know, maybe crossing the road or walking towards me then I look again and they aren't there! 

Once was strange but it keeps happening, anyone else had a similar experience?

2122,"For the past four months I have been pretty off. Towards the beginning of the four months, I got into these weird moods were i would be kinda sad and not want to do anything. As time has progressed its gotten worse an worse. I'm sad almost all the time and i have no motivation. I also have a lack of energy. I don't want to bring this up with a doctor because I feel like it will do no good. There's three major things I want to go into more detail about; sadness, lack of motivation, and anxiety. 

Sadness: I'm sad almost all of the time. It gets to the point of crying. I'd rather sit in my room in the dark listening to sad music rather then go out with my friends somewhere. Its mainly for no reason but sometimes I see happy people or couples and feel that I'll never be as happy as them or have a relationship and die alone. I also have a lack of self confidence. I feel I'm no attractive at all even though multiple people have told me I am. I feel like if I'm around a group of people i bring everyone done because I'm so sad. Sometimes i can act like I'm okay and that I'm happy but it has gotten to the point where I can't act fine because the sadness takes over. I just feel hopeless that it'll never end. 

Lack of Motivation: I have absolutely no motivation to do anything. To go to school, to leave the house, even to get out of bed. I'm not sure how I'm able to write this. Its really affecting me because I want to have motivation but I just don't. I have no motivation to do homework/schoolwork and its bringing my grades down. I should be doing homework right now but here i am. I have no desire to even move. Sometimes i don't even feel like breathing, i still want to leave though because  have so much ahead of me to experience. I cry every morning before school because I don't want to go and talk to people. Then I go home and cry because I think about having to do it again the next day. I just want to stay home.

Anxiety: i never really got anxious before but now I do all the time. I especially get anxious about people. I feel like they judge me for what i say or do and that they are watching my every move and judging me. I find it hard to talk to people because I get nervous. I can't even get up to throw something away in class because I'm too afraid . It really affects my grades because one of my classes evolves lots of discussions that affect your grade. I'm way to afraid to even attempt to say anything because I think people will think I'm stupid. It frustrates me so much because I want to say something but I'm way too afraid."

2126,"Hi guys,

I've struggled with depression and anxiety for years now. I had depressive episodes and higher episodes( which I never recorgnised as bipolar). In my highs I felt like I was in love but I obviously wasn't, everything felt magical and attracting and I had the need to speak all the time.( a lot to myself aswell) 
I never knew what bipolar was. My Psychitrist gave me cipralex and Zoloft both made or make me rapid cycling alot ( from having suicidal thoughts to  hypomanic or even sometimes manic).
Can it mean that I am Bipolar 2? I kind of don't feel takin serious from my Psychiatrist and I really wanna know whats wrong with me this rapid cycling is so terrible!! 
Thanks alot for any comment!!!!!

2127,"Has anyone here had success with methods to keep moods stable? I'm open to any ideas regardless of how effective they've been, so please don't be hesitant to post anything 'doubtful,' so to speak.

2128,"Hello,

I have joined 30 seconds ago and am so desperate to be in a place where there are other people, i have come straight here. I have been on forums before but not for about a year and i have mostly been on forums with sufferers of OCD which i have as well as Bi polar disorder. I don't know which is worse but the two together are not easy to manage. 

Like i said, i am without people to talk to at the moment as it is Christmas and everyone is busy although they are nearly always too busy to see me as much as i need. I am not in work and so need to be with people more and my usual social group all have young children so i am all the more without anyone to spend time with or speak to. I have been through some friendship break-ups lately too and those who are still interested in seeing me after my last manic breakthrough, are distant.

There are so many things against my being with people and i am so in need of people, new places, life, anything. I need advice on how to get out and help to make sure i do it because the last couple of nights i have been drinking which is very rare for me. I have felt like going outside at night for a walk and i know that this is a bad idea too. I think i am doing well but also worry that i might slip backwards. Life is hard right now and i could do with some people who are going through the same to talk to.

Good evening all:flowers:"
2129,"I have been feeling tired for almost a week. Feeling tired and feeling depressed feel so similar that I THOUGHT I was just tired but I have been sleeping 8hrs or more at night. I sleep until I am ready to wake up but I am still tired and starting to feel down. 

BUT I seem to think that a couple weeks ago (or was it 1 week ago?) I was feeling quite happy and carefree. But of course I can't remember. 


EVERYTIME I feel down I think I should be keeping track of this and yet I don't. It would be so easy and I don't.

and now I am left wondering....did I see this down time coming? was there an up time before it. 

AND if I am feeling down and then what the heck do I do with my meds?!?! I see my GP on Monday just for refills of my prescriptions so I guess I will mention this to him then unless I am feeling better by then and then of course I will not rock the boat or raise any red flags.

This balancing life thing is tough!"

2131,"Hi everyone, I found this website by looking up this question.
I am undiagnosed for bipolar type two disorder, known it for at least four years. I don't know how this forum feels about self-diagnosis but I'm not allowed to see a therapist. 

Recently I've been feeling like I'm dying, I'd say it's been for a month. I have been suicidal for a bit but some of that changed when I met my boyfriend over a year ago. I broke up with him in September and I've caught myself saying, ""Now that we don't have a future together, I can still kill myself like I planned."" I guess I felt like I had to stay alive because I didn't want to mess up our promises. Now there aren't any and that's a bit of a relief. I'm not trying to say he cured me or something like that but I felt obligated to live. He is very happy with someone else now but this is only recent (as far as I know.) We still talk which might be bad but whatever. I don't feel like I can be like ""I need time"" because I've already had months and also I'm the one who left and he's happy and I suppose he'd expect me to be too.

I don't know how to identify what I'm feeling but it feels very final. I feel like there is a clock inside me. I feel like I am ready to go. I do not feel emotionally attached to anyone, I mean I love my best friend but I've already told her that I probably will not grow older with her and she understands and accepts this. I mean it saddens her, she is not indifferent to it but she has learned that I am annoyed by people speaking of the joys of living. 

Basically I feel final, I don't know what physical dying feels like but I do feel like I'm dying. I am not sad about it and I am at peace with the concept of dying. It has a bit of an ache and I feel like a lot of things don't matter. Everything is starting to feel like a memorial video. I look at friends or people and I think about how they'll live with my death. I have plans for my social media when I die. I have a suicide note I wrote a while ago. I do not have a future i am interested in or would be sad about. But I just want to go back to feeling suicidal, not like my death is going to happen very soon.

Does anyone understand what I am feeling? Or anything?? I don't know but I looked it up and can't find anything. I suppose it could be ""heartbreak"" but because I am bipolar and used to self harm and have some other problems, it's a different ride for me."
2132,I hope you are all feeling as good as you can do today.. its so a grey day out.
2133,"Hey guys, I'm really struggling at the moment, feel like giving up and have no one to talk to, guess this is a cry for help.

I'm just not coping at the moment, I haven't been coping for a long time, I'm not sure what to do to make things bearable again."
2134,"I am new to bipolar....I was only diagnosed earlier this year. I don't have much in the way of mania or even hypomania so though my depression behaves like bipolar I my mania is less than that of bipolar II.  Since being on meds I have been doing way better. My motivation has never really come back 100% but life is doable and I find enjoyment in things. 

BUT....I feel depression starting to rise in me. I am still in the self-educating place of bipolar, trying to figure this thing out, trying to figure myself out. And everything I read talks of CBT and mindfulness which I think is a bit of a farce....

BUT (again) now I realize that its not that I think CBT is a farce it is that I really don't want to have to work at being well. I just want to swallow my pills (albeit that is so hard some days) and be back to my old self.  

perhaps that means I am still in denial that I am even bipolar, that I have an illness that needs tending to. I just want to be lazy about it and not work at it. As I have been feeling more depressed I feel like ""screw it, just be depressed, maybe I need to change my meds""  but I haven't even tried to stay active, examine my thinking, or anything else. 

Am I the only one that feels lazy about fighting this whole thing? 

I don't care about triggers or anything else. I just want to pretend that I can swallow pills and be my old self.  (easier to believe when I am doing better than I am right now)

How do you motivate yourself to fight this thing? I mean I don't want to go back to being suicidal and having crazy delusions and hallucinations. I don't want that feeling of floating above everyone and then hurting the people around me b/c I think everyone should be as amazing as I am. 

but motivated I am not."
2135,"I used to think that having people relying on me would keep me going through suicidal times but this time, it feels that all the pressure is making me worse.

My husband has just had a cancer scare, found out today that he is clear.
My daughter age 10 is a school refuser and is being seen by the mental health team.
My 18 yo son and has girlfriend 17, have jsut had a baby and mum is feeling very derpressed.

I just want it to end!

Since becoming stable, time feels slow and I don't know what to do with myself. I'm going back to a voluntary job in January but until then, sitting, waiting for nothing feels unbearable. 

Any tips?

2139,"Hi guys. First post so be gentle...

I was diagnosed with bipolar II early 2014 and have been visiting doctors, psychologists and psychiatrists since that time, and my work has tolerated me taking some time off when needed.

However, for a couple of weeks I've been anxious and irratable and building into a mania, which came to a head at the start of the week... and have blacked most of out.  I can always tell, after the fact, when around it starts as i remember getting annoyed reading and can never seem to remember where in my book ive read from and til after.

Best I can tell Monday was fine at work from what I remember. But on Tuesday I suspect I might have been self medicating resulting in manic/anxiety on Wednesday.... when I stopped myself outside of work on the advice of two friends, and best I recall, phoned in sick wandered the streets for a few hours.

I've since done the routine that's became familiar after manic nights or intense bouts of depression. ...seen the doctor, had my meds changed, so on, so on.

But it's getting harder and harder to forgive myself for this shit.

And I'm worried that I could have done something stupid at work as I work with the public. The prospect of losing my job is not helping the depression cycle.

I'm worried I may have just lost everything.

Is their anything I can fall back on for support from the government, or legally to protect my job if need be?

Thanks in advance."
2140,I see my family post pictures with each other and I tend to hate them. I get mad and want to delet them all. Fuck them. What's wrong with me?
2141,"Hi everyone,

I've been stable bp1 for almost 11 years and therapy stable for about 4 years.  I got a bit of a shock today when a brother of mine that had disowned me that has other mental health issues seems to be doing better with family support.  However, my family is scared to death of me because of my BP diagnosis and my dad is a psychopath.  So my entire family has disowned me about 5 years ago.  I can't blame them for it because I was quite the as*****e before I got counselling.  But they are afraid that I'm a replica of my dad.

When my oldest brother told me about my brother being in contact with my family that I hadn't seen in 23 years, it broke my heart with overwhelming feelings of rejection.  The reason for that was I last saw them when I was 7 years old and it had left positive childhood memories.

I have a group of close friends that helps each other and have been a blessing.
When I talked to my counsellor about this in detail, it looks like the disownment is permanent, what tips would you have for copping with this?"

2145,"Hey all,

So, I'm a new BP-bear to the forum. Not really sure where to start TBH, so I thought I'd come and say hello here.

I'm 26yo and was diagnosed with BP 3 years ago after suffering from MH problems from the age of 15ish.

The last few years have been very rocky. Meds, meds and more meds, hospital treatment, the lot.

Feeling a bit more stable at the minute and trying to keep myself that way.

I'm a chronic insomniac so if anyones about after hours you may see me somewhere on the forum moaning that I should be asleep!

Best wishes

2146,"I've been gettting really bad pain in my hip joints for a couple of months. My pdoc believes that it's a side effect of either the Lamotrigine (150mg) or quetiapine (225mg), or both. ( believe it's most likely the lamotrigine as the dose was increased a couple of months ago.) The pain was incredibly bad last week - I couldn't get to the floor to change my daughter's nappy. I feel like I'm 80! It's ridiculously frustrating as this combination of med's is really working for me.

So...I was wondering whether anyone else has suffered from this side effect, and how it was dealt with? I've been prescribed Procyclidine to treat the pain. Although it helps, it also makes me feel a bit drunk/spacey; I just can't take it when I've got to work. I'm really hoping there are other options to counter this side effect as I desparately don't want to be messing around with the Lamotrigine/Quetiapine."

2149,"I have been formally diagnosed with dyslexia and aspergers. I take cipralex (Lexapro) for depression and anxiety, which the medication controls perfectly. Normally I am completely fine to have no connections with anyone and just keep to myself, with no highs or lows.

But when something bad happens to me the lack of social connections really bother me. The thing if, you can't form social connections and use them only when something bad happens to you. I really don't care if I have any friends at all, and I just want a partner, either casually or serious, and nothing else

Recently there was a girl who liked me quite a bit, eventually I started to like her too, but then she changed her mind, but kept showing a bit of interest whenever she felt me pull away from her. Eventually I forced her to give me closure and forced her to make a decision, which I knew would be a ""no"", and I felt wonderful.

Every day that passes I have maybe 6-7 large highs and large lows. I feel wonderful, and energized that this negative part of my life is over and I can finally move on. Then I feel awful and feel like crying, and every few hours I just cycle between these highs and lows, and I don't know why. I think that I was in love with the idea of being in love than anything else, and I thought I could have that with her because she was showing interest, but I just scared her off.

I know that people who are bipolar typically have highs and lows all the time, and not just after getting closure after being strung along for a couple of months, but I don't know what is happening to me and if it's normal or not."
2150,"Bipolar Diagnosis Linked to Childhood Adversity - 

Bipolar Diagnosis Linked to Childhood Adversity - Mad In America

""Given the ties between traumatic childhood experiences and the diagnosis of ‘mental illness,’ should we continue to focus on a genetic and biological approach to treatment?""

""A new study, published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, found that experiences of neglect, abuse, and bullying in childhood were linked with later diagnoses of Bipolar Disorder. The researchers, led by Dr. Palmier-Claus at the University of Manchester, statistically analyzed data from 19 studies, allowing them to combine the results of 34 years of patient records. They found that people diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder were 2.63 times more likely to have experienced traumatic events in childhood than people without the diagnosis. This suggests that whether or not there is a genetic component to the disorder, the impact of experiences such as neglect and physical and sexual abuse cannot be ignored.""

2151,"Just venting.

So I arrived for my appointment on Friday, only to find the office was closed.  Unusual, usually when the doctor can't make it, they call me.

So this morning, bright and early, I called to reschedule.  They closed because the psychiatrist had to go to the hospital (as in get treated, not treat a patient there).  He will not be returning to the practice ever.

Eek!  I wasn't fully stable on my medication yet. :eek: :panic: 

It seems my area just really doesn't have psychiatrists.  I must have called a dozen places within a 15 mile area.  I was in the middle of expanding it out to 25 miles when I got a call back.

The nice thing is that this area also doesn't seem to have much of a waiting list.  The last two metro areas I lived at had a mandatory 3 month wait for new patients.  I got an appointment for 3 weeks from now, and it was that far out simply because of the amount of time I need to request time off work.

She's a psychiatric nurse practitioner, not a psychiatrist.  But she's listed on Psychology Today website as specializing in bipolar disorder.  I told her I was nervous of nurse practitioners and why, and she was really, really reassuring.

So yeah, back to the psychiatric merry go round.  I hate finding a new provider, it's always such a crapshoot as to whether you get a good one or a bad one.  But talking with the provider directly, I'm feeling pretty good about this one.

But I will also admit that I was so panicked over not having a psychiatrist that when my daughter, full of concern, asked what was going on, I snarled a bit at her.  Tough enough dealing with my own emotions, having to deal with a panicky child (and she does tend to panic) was not within my ability."
2152,"Hi, i'm new here...I wanted to know about my condition. I've been an A+ grade student my whole life. Here are some symptoms that disturb me.
I have been struggling with these three problems in an episodic manner since last year:
Concentration level
Interest level in activities
Energy level
I'm not so clear about my mood patterns but yeah I've consciously experienced elated moods at the starting of my current semester, was really organized really social(which i am actually not!) self confident, multitasking (don't know if it was mania/ hypomania or i was really just HAPPY)..but now that i have exams I am a wreck (i even thought of quitting studies in one of my previous episodes 6 months ago)...don't at all want to study, can't listen to lectures anymore but I'm not sad or depressed nor that excited or elated... I'm almost the same in my social circles....can i be helped with these symptoms..."
2153,"Regardless of anything, or any mood or of any experience, i have this darkness about me  that never goes away. I forget sometimes that it is there and this is usually when i am browsing the aisles for a new this or that. When my benefit money is cut, i won't be able to buy this or that and so will not get as much pleasure from window shopping. I then won't have that escape.

Is it depression? Possession? Aftershocks of episodes passed? or is it past? They have passed but are in the past. There are more though, and will always be more. When i am well i wonder where it is, the symptoms, but the darkness is always there. Is it because i have been through the horrors of depression? Is it because i is peach?

I sat on my carpet this afternoon and wrapped some Christmas presents and although i have had a reasonable day, the darkness was there with me. It takes the joy out of everything. 

Don't forget the feeling that my life is over because i have the fear of benefit loss. Don't forget that if i could do it, i would have done it years ago without a doubt, i would have killed myself years ago. I am here breathing in and out but i don't want to be and so that might be the reason for the darkness.

What is this really all about? I have seen some frightening things both human and other being and i don't understand any of it. I don't want to either because i can only turn the light off at night because i tell myself my brain can throw up some old images and sounds and turn them into something frightening. Maybe that is the truth but i do believe in an afterlife and although i wish i didn't, i cannot push that aside and go to work. 

I have lost commitment. I am out of the rat race and the rat race actually booted me out. Pass the hot potato. The gp threw me to the htt and they threw me anywhere but there. I went to the a/e and they threw me elsewhere. I was thrown around and around until i moved into this apartment and here i am trying to stay grounded but i cannot expect free rent and money for the rest of my life, that i don't even want but we need money to pretend everything is fine and we are normal. I need money to get dressed in the morning in my pretend i-am-off-to-work clothes, in my posh car that is looking shabbier by the day, and go to Asda where i walk around pretending i am on my lunch break or that i travel around for my job. It is all pretence. 

I get home and am comfy for a while. I sit down with my cup of coffee and maybe eat a whole packet of biscuits. I later try to eat some proper food but that is not easy. I then busy myself making everything look nice and clean even thought nobody ever visits. I wrap presents for people who have lives and husbands and kids and don't hardly think about me. I try to make myself have a shower even though it doesn't  matter if i have greasy hair because i don't have to go out tomorrow anyway. i don't even have to get out of bed if i don't want to. I could sit in bed with ten packets of biscuits and 6 bottles of wine if i wanted to because i have no reason not to because i want to die anyway, but i don't. I get up early and do the right thing. 

I didn't want to stop working. I want to work now but i am often in a mood where i would be a liability in the workplace. I would more likely bring more shame upon myself and if i have much more shame, i will stay in bed with those 6 bottles and biscuits. Maybe this is all i can cope with, but i am not allowed to languish. I don't want to languish i want to live, but i don't want to live."
2154,"I'd like to know if I'm an attention seeker or if I have something wrong for the past 3 or 4 months I've had depressing moments at school I am pretty upbeat although I can slip out of this feeling at random times and when I get home everything changes i have nothing to do i dont want to talk to my parents every activity i take up i drop shortly after as i cant keep hobbies i cant concentrate whilst studying and it leaves me thinking my future will never ammount to anything. I don't want to tell my friends or family as I fear that i will be labelled an attention seeker.

2156,"I have been asleep since i last posted and i don't really know when that was. It was unlikely as long ago as i feel it was. Not much has happened to be honest with you as my life is same old same old. I do long for that manic energy and optimism again but after it ends i always feel like it will never, ever, return. If i thought stopping my medication would bring it on, i'd bring it on, but i would hit the floor. This medication is most definitely keeping me as up as possible and i am not feeling that well but i am starting to get out of these four walls again which i have not been able to do for months. I can drive when depressed but not when manic. When not too depressed to get dressed that is. 

This time of year it does feel normal to feel like this. Everything has slowed, including my mind. Anyone who has had racing thoughts knows that this depressed emptiness of mind is a very nice change. I can ride depression out as long as they are not accompanied by racing thoughts.

Benefits scare me though and they are always just around the corner. I was going to say coroner then, Freudian slip much! I don't see this life as worthwhile with the benefit fears but i also don't see it as worthwhile if i am not in work. I wish there was a compromise but there is not. I don't know how universal credit works but i am not on it anyway. The country's finances appear to be up sh£t creek though and i think us loafers/scrougers/idle/lazy/languishers, or whatever the latest name for us is, are going to continue to be targeted. I am still on dla too and i could survive without it, but if my esa were to reduce to jsa level, i would be in trouble. I would have to sell my car as i could not afford the insurance and repairs and my car is my ticket to work as i had to drive around the county for my work visiting clients and i cannot imagine what else i would do that would pay as well. 

There is more to it all as there usually is. It is not a black and white issue for me and next year could see me dead by accidental overdose or accidental accident, or living on the streets. I was homeless once before and lost so much, i don't think i could pick myself up again. I could pick myself up, but not up into living normally plus working too. Life not in work feels pointless though and i am very alone here. Everybody has their busy and full life and i am here trying not to appear feeble and a loner because loners kill young politicians don't they? A friend mentioned to me yesterday that many people with depression who live alone are killing the public in one way or another. My friends are actually looking at me as a potential killer now. I don't think they would let me fly their plane, drive them in their car or sit in a room with me and a sharp object."
2157,"TW.   what bothers me is people want to add you as a friend, then don't bother to answer you? If you are not well or a genuine reason that's ok, or you could at least say sorry I haven't been in touch because.....   

Like someone added me yesterday, which I answered, asked how they were so far no answer? of cause going to give them time, ie maybe busy ect, but i'm going through enough don't need added stress, or things to annoy me.

anyone else feel like that or have done? its like why did you even bother to ask to add me, if you haven't answered me ?"
2158,"Hi, If your partner unfriended you from face book, how did that make you feel? whoever broke the relationship up.

did you feel hurt? did you think they were being childish? did it make you feel they had something to hide?  how long IF you know, how long did they unfriend you for? 
do you feel they did this to punish you?  


For those who have been kind enough to share thoughts with me, I would like what you think on this please?

I broke up over an impulse moment, I know it could have been just a simple enough sit down chat. 


how many of you think this is just issues of a normal TW, sorry don't know what to put as in the normal bit,  of a normal break up behaviour..?

or to do with her mental health issues?  or bit of everything mixed in together?

please bare in mind I know our situation,,


I think bit of everything but I think she had no intenions to want to fix us,

her friends and family can think what they like, as they wasn't there!  I think for someone who said she would always talk ect....  


its now been almost 11 weeks still haven't heard anything!!  I don't know what it says about her for her to unfriend me, its made me feel we broke up over a lot worse than it really is, the fact we had a talk days before the break up saying we wouldn't in friend,   that was the first thing she did!!  I get she may have been hurt, but I don't think over an impulse moment was a good enough reason to just take me off like that?

I don't know what to make of it all.  at least if she had just deactived me she could have just logged in once she felt ready to talk!!  I think that was bit much over something simple and I bet shes made out to her friends and family, its worse than it really is ect...  again.... they don't know!! they cant judge me.  I was there supporting her for 8 months, so they cant say I was a bad person.  

I have gone from being sad, to hurt, to annoyed to, disappointed in her, to bit of every feeling. understandable I will still be hurting. 

does anyone think, that one day when ever that is she may ever re-appear to talk maybe even say sorry that she could have dealt with things differently ? do you think she may say we both could have? 

Have any of you had your ex say sorry even though it was you who broke it up over something you know you could have sat down and just talked about?

also recently I have often wondered if I was just a conviance for her? what if she has someone already? I know nothing I can do about it, but that would make me feel s,,t about things! what if she had them lined up... 


also, I feel it's too late because I feel my path is some place else,tw,,  with someone else, my ex, eg, if my recent ex had spoken to at least 3 or 4 weeks a go, then maybe I still would want me and her.

but I feel with this ex whos come into life again I feel my path for now is with her, however long that's meant for. I know I may get hurt again but its something I want to find out.  

I didn't expect to hear back from this ex whos come into life, and to me its the best thing because I wanted hope!!

soo much has gone on in a short space of time,  broke up..

feeling hurt, with ex I broke up weeks a go,
to last week in 3 years am talking to this ex, am glad,
yet if recent ex, wanted to talk it out I would, but I deffo wouldn't have an us!! 

talking would be as far as it would go, 

I know I deserve to be happy!! sounds awful, but maybe shes lost me to this ex!! 

I feel by now she could have talked to me!!  still hurt because, I don't know what to make of it all.  

If this now ex, whos back in my life we don't go far then that's something I will have to deal with then!! 

my questions are just for, what do you think to the face book thing?
and , do you think its more HER or her MH OR BOTH? as in normal behaviour after a break up? 
do you think she just didn't have any intenions to even want to try? from your point of view to try help me understand...  what do you think this says about her?
do you think inside she may think shes glad its over or even sad?

I know we cant know unless she was to ever tell us, but from her actions, just like to know what you think on that?"
2159,"Hi, I just wanted to introduce myself.  I have been diagnosed with Bipolar I.  I am currently stable.  More recently I stopped taking lithium with the permission of my psychiatrist, of course. So far I still feel fine.  If anything changes I will start Trileptal.  That is the back-up plan.  

I have been stable for 8 months now.  That is the longest I've been stable.  I have a lot of depression.  A little bit of mania now and then.  Being on medication makes me feel good in the sense that I am not depressed any longer, but I don't like the side-effects that go with different types of meds.  Lithium made my hair really thin out and it seemed like it was falling off too.  I am not bald but I have less hair than before I started on lithium.  Much less so that I cannot have highlights as it will damage it.  I have to have it short to show that it's got more volume.  I wanted to state that lithium worked wonderfully to keep me stable, but after 2 years of being on it, I chose to try another drug that didn't have these side effects.  Also not all people have the same side effects, I just happen to be someone who did get this one of  the hair thinning."
2160,"Please don't judge me, am only human, TW.  


The other week I sent my last ex a birthday card, and I didn't expect to hear back I had this urge to send one, I had to let her know I don't hate her, and that she is always in my heart, 2013 we broke up, without not knowing why? at the time I was really hurt, I sort of do know why, but it's something I couldn't say on here, I was hurt way up until I had met this now ex Christmas 2015, <-- the one I have recently broken up with.  

It took me all that time to forgive her, that is why I sent a card this year because it told me I truly.


 have forgiven this ex I sent a card to!!  It felt right to tell her so many years later!  I have always hoped our paths would cross again! when we broke up I did write to ask why we broke up ect, but got no answer, I tried a few times, got no answer.

But this year just before her birthday I had a really strong urge to send her a birthday card,and a little note saying how I felt!  maybe it was time to let her know how I feel.  in the past when I wrote to her and didn't get no answer from her, it would hurt, but this year I told myself, if I don't hear from her, I had to send the card for me, I had to because I forgive her, and even if she didn't answer me, at least id hope she would have read it to know I don't hate her.  I told myself, if I don't get no answer I can be ok now, this was my way of closure! and I felt I could hope that she would have a good life!! and that I never regret me and her!! 

but today, I got a letter from her! and she appologied for how she treated me back then!!  which I know she is sorry, and that must have taken a lot of guts for her to say!! and I really appieciate that!!   "" really sorry for the bad spelling""""

before I carry on to what i'll say,   This is prove that anything in life can happen!! when its time to and when its meant to happen!!  

before I carry on with this, maybe now with this recent ex, maybe now even though I still would talk to her, maybe now it wont matter, I do deserve better. 
maybe there will come a time me and this ex could talk again, when its time to, meant to be, and if not, that's ok!! Its her loss!! if she isn't able to talk over something that could have been talked about, why should I fight for something, if she isn't bothered about me? 

for me the moral of this story is or will be,,

anything can happen in life, everything happens for a reason, when its meant to, when its time to!  however long it takes, ok you may go though a lot of pain in life, but you have to carry on!!  and maybe that one day will come, when you either get the answers you want? or you get to a point where you say, you know what, I don't care any more, its your loss, I am worth better!! or you don't need that closure any more!!  and I would like to say, I hope for each and every one of you, you get what you want in life, whatever that is!! ALL OF YOU!! deserve happness!! and I wish that for all of you!!  for whatever you are going though I hope, good comes for you soon!! 

please don't judge me on this bit,  the ex that I am in touch with now, if me and her get back together, ok if we don't, ok, but for now I am going to see where it takes me, small steps at a time!!  If this recent ex pops up one day, ok? i'll talk then, if not.. 

I believe in spiritual world, so for now I feel the path I am taking is with this ex I send a card too! "" also it shows it is never to late to say sorry!! I think if someone is able to give you an automatic appoloige, then I feel they must know they have done wrong, without you promting them. 

what if my heart really belongs to this ex I got a letter from?
I know this may sound really hash a bit, but this ex I got a letter from, shes worth more than the last ex,  I wish I had the words to tell you..

even though me choose which way to turn, we don't always have control as to who comes into our lives and when? we cant control there actions, what they say or do?
Keep in mind, people say if they love you, love will find a way!! 


I am scared, because what if this ex doesn't work out? I know like I said can only take a day at a time, but I still would like to know from her the truth? I haven't spoken to her for, since 2013, have so much to say. 

I feel freaked out in a good way, because I didn't expect to hear from her all this time.  what if she is the person I am meant to be with? 

even though my recent ex, and I was going to live together get married, over lots of time, what if this ex, ... is my path way for now?

I don't expect a happy ending with her, but at the very least going to see how far it takes us this time, we were together about two years, and we had been though a lot. 

The bad thing is, what if the recent ex pops up, while I see how things go with this one whos re-appeared? 

too many questions in my head, 
what if this ex I sent a card to, what if we do go far?
what if the recent ex over more time pops up?
what if this ex who heard from today, say I take small steps and then what if we break up again? and I heal from that, and what if recent ex with the bipolar pops up and wants to talk and try then?

I can only go with,,  whatever is going to happen will happen, if it does, I can only cross that bridge if it comes to that. I can only take one day at a time.

I always for myself believe, when something bad happen something good most of the time follows.  

If the recent ex wants to talk one day, I would... but I feel now, she would have to be the one to come to me, I would want to hear from her to say,  we BOTH could have dealt with this diffently. I hope one day if we did talk,,,  I hope she could say, she is sorry and that we could have talked this out sooner! 

even before I got my letter today, for the last few weeks I had accepted this recent ex,  its her loss if she isn't able to talk, its sad that our relationship haven't 
meant much to her
  if this is how she wants it to be, then I am just going to let her get on with it.  


Happy, because of recent good news, 
yet hurt with the recent ex, that I couldn't have meant much!!

with the girl I got a letter from today I have a lot of talking to do before anything else. 

The thing is , why is love so complex?  

I have to know how far this goes, I have to take this chance while I can!! 
I may get hurt again a long the way, but again I cant control how things turn out in life,if we all knew what was going to happen next in life, then maybe we would know which way to turn for the better?

I don't know how things now will turn out or how long we will be in touch for...
I can only  now go with the flow as they say!  what will be will be!!"
2161,"Is anyone else having trouble actually getting diagnosed or speaking to a professional?

I'm new to this, so would like my first post to be a gracious rant!

From the age of 15 I have been diagnosed with depression, which swiftly partnered up with anxiety. Now I'm in my early twenties, I feel due to self management and self help I have relieved a lot of the symptoms but recently (past six months or so) I feel I am reliving this experience and experiencing worse symptoms, but with one big difference. I feel my moods fluctuate hugely. Beforehand, I would just be generally depressed 24/7.. Whereas now I kind of feel like I can't control my own moods. I'm easily irritable, can occasionally get bouts of anger for no good reason or have days or weeks where I get pretty happy and feel I can accomplish anything. This is obviously affecting my work and personal life. For example, I have recently this week had to hole myself up in a bathroom to stop myself crying at work due to some feedback presented by my manager - it wasn't even bad feedback! It was just a general comment, but I couldn't control my anger at potentially being judged, then the obligatory angry tears started, then I felt guilty and ashamed, then I felt depressed, then exhausted. Rinse and repeat.

The problem is, I have visited several doctors about depression etc over the past several years, but have just been chucked antidepressants at the first instance...which I'm pretty against being on anyway (personal choice) and no other treatment has been offered. I've never even been officially diagnosed by a psychiatrist or mental health professional. It's just 'probably' depression and anxiety and that's as far as I have got. I have been left to get my own support and help from local charities or organisations, which are not always helpful in my honest opinion. 

Has anyone else had this issue? Where they want to say enough is enough, I want to sit with a professional and actually TALK about how I feel and what could potentially be wrong with me?

My recent development of fluctuating moods has gone unheard, because quite frankly I don't think I will get the help I need. I have always been told I am not a high priority, as a large volume if people have similar problems...but how can I get better when im not even entirely sure what's wrong in the first place?

Rant over!

Also - apologies in advance for potentially posting in wrong area etc..newbie alert"
2162,"How I Healed my ‘Bipolar Disorder’ - Mad In America

""When my sister took me to the emergency room of the psychiatric hospital in January of 2013, I was simply a mess. I had barely slept for weeks, having visions of an evil, black shadow hovering over me and telling me to kill myself. All of this made me so paranoid that I began slipping deeper and deeper into suicidal ideation, which scared everyone around me.

The previous three years had been very tough on me. I had been through a separation from my cheating husband, which left me to care for my two small children alone. A severe hand injury threatened my career as a portrait artist. In addition, I had also undergone the stress of moving cities with the family. It was like fighting a battle from all sides without a break, and the constant repression of my own needs so depleted me mentally and physically that I lost my balance.

I started having mood swings that made me feel like a different person from one day to the next. Some days I felt like I was on top of the world—invincible, without the need for sleep. Other days I was a complete failure without energy or motivation and experienced a paralyzing lack of hope. The abrupt swings from euphoria to dysphoria and back were tough on me as well as my family. As an artist, the hypomanic phases usually seemed great at first because I got a lot of projects done working through the night. However, once completed, I felt as if I were burnt to ashes."""
2163,"Recently I had a massive breakdown and my life completely fell apart. My mum thought I might have bipolar, but I dismissed it. I have a sister who has bipolar symptoms, she isn't diagnosed. 

Basically my mood has generally been depressive throughout my life, but at times this has completely resolved and I've been happy. There is a specific thing that happened in my life which I'm a bit too embarrassed to talk about, but i'm wondering whether this was a manic episode. More recently, it feels my mood oscillates from depressive to happy every day. I seem to have a lot of ideas too, there are too many to count. I'm starting tasks and not finishing them, but in the past this hasn't been the case. 

I'm just curious as to what everybody elses experiences are and what symptoms you have. 

I could be completely wrong, I'm simply reaching out because I'm concerned. Please be kind."
2164,"Ok, here's another one.........

What do you think about this:

And this:

http://www.bipolaradvantage.com/index.php

?

As usual I have started to research this. I haven't gone right through it yet. But it looks like a drug-free approach to bipolar, that might be possible to do without special circumstances or facilities, although it costs money.

Personally, I go along with some of his concepts. A way of dealing with the highs and the lows by transforming how you react to them, and gradually gaining control over yourself within them or something suchlike.

Any experiences with this / his approach?

I have a kind of idyllic image of being able to go through the different experiences of bipolar without being crippled by feeling so wrong about it (for me that is now all 99% in the past). But I'm not saying my image is right or correct.

And I'm still not able to get to grips with the fluctuating sleep patterns and energy levels and other troublesome symptoms, besides the highs and lows.

(On lithium since last Friday. 50mg, going up to 600mg per day. Before that, med free. No effects yet, side or otherwise.)"
2165,"Why is it that mh issues are never straight forward?

With physical health issues things are slightly easier to understand... You have diabetes, take insulin. A cold, warm drinks and bed rest. Maybe there'll be a debate on whether paracetamol is good or not for that but that's it!

Let's move on to the dark murky waters of mh..
Depression, anxiety, bipolar, bpd, schizophrenia, eating disorders... The list goes on.
Any cures?? Whack a couple of paracetamol in and you'll be fine??
Meds or no meds. To diagnose or to not diagnose?
MI people must be idiots that's why professionals and society treat them that way, right??

I've been searching for soo long for something that will pinpoint a way forward. Every time I think I've succeeded, I fall again. 

I've tried medication 
I've tried hypnotherapy 
I've tried counselling 
I've tried exercise 
And healthy eating 
I've tried connecting with people 
I've tried letting go of the past
I've even tried just getting on with it regardless 
I've tried talking to my family and friends 
I've tried talking to my pets
Distractions,
Spiritual, 
Doctors, mht, hospitals... 
I've tried it all.

I. Still. Want. It. All. To. End. 

And I'm aslo terrified of dying :confused:

I.am.the.most.useless.person.on.the.planet.

And I'm priceless..


Can anyone explain any of this to me?

Am I mentally unwell or just lazy and inconsiderate and attention seeking and hurtful?? 

Do I need to acknowledge that I'm unwell to get well or will that just hold me back?

Why are the mht soooooooooo difficult to work with?

Will anyone care enough to answer?

Does anyone know the answers? 

My world is spinning and spinning and it won't stop. I've lost connection because the effort was one sided.

I hate him And I'm stuck with him because I cursed my ex with being stuck with someone who he'd be unhappy with.. I cursed him and instead cursed myself I still feel the roots of my hair hurting from being pulled...

2167,"Tw, my ex is bipolar. I don't want to go into too much detail. even though its not been 14 weeks I still feel at the very least she could have talked it all out with me, to me just says I couldn't have meant that much to her. 

when you have broken up with someone you being the bipolar one, how do you feel after a break up? how do you act? and go through.? 
do you go through different pazes? ie sad, don't know what to think and feel ect.,

how long has it taken before you contact your ex again to talk? weather it was you who broke it up or them? you may think if it was them maybe they should be the ones to talk first? but what if you need time and space to think? work out how you are feeling ect? 

with my ex I broke up over an impulse moment, and it was something that could have just been a sit down talk but shes the one whos made this out more than it really is. I haven't emailed only because I don't want to put any preasure on to her. and if she did ever email or text I would rather it came from her so then I would know she would be ready to talk.

also, for those who have broke up with your bipolar ex, how long before you ever got back together? what is the longest before you gave up hope?
do you think she could have moved on this quick without even trying?
does anyone think she herself doesn't know what to think or feel? or know what to say? could she just fall out of love this quick? 

for someone who said we would always talk, for someone who said she was soo much in love ect,  

All it had to be was sit down and chat,  its not like we had a big argument or anything.

just feel even 14 weeks later at the very least she could have just talked it all out with me and she wont even do that, so I don't know how we would manage to sort out something that's worse than this? feel gutted that I couldn't have mean that much for her to not even want to talk over something so small."
2168,"Hi all,

Its been a long time, but I am back with a new name. My old name was belblac:cool:

Question to begin with please

How long can you take Lithium? I was looking on-line and could find no definite answer. NHS was 3 months? Some said 6 months. I could only find other who were taking Lithium who were saying longer. I was planning on being on it for life. No-ones suggested I come off it and I do not want to.

It is because I have had my dose reduced due to one blood test showing level too high that I was looking around. I saw the NHS site and that was when I saw the 3 months. It could be a mistake, but 3 years is not enough for some and so I looked around for that then. I even looked on the Royal College of Psychiatry site and could not find the answer.

I know some can give me that answer here. So any help would be appreciated.:)

TIA"
2169,"The medicalization of ""ups and downs"": The marketing of the new bipolar disorder

""The concept of bipolar disorder has undergone a transformation over the last two decades. Once considered a rare and serious mental disorder, bipolar disorder is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in Europe and North America, and is suggested to replace many other diagnoses. The current article shows how the modern concept of bipolar disorder has been created in the course of efforts to market new antipsychotics and other drugs for bipolar disorder, to enable these drugs to migrate out of the arena of serious mental disorder and into the more profitable realm of everyday emotional problems. A new and flexible notion of the condition has been created that bears little resemblance to the classical condition, and that can easily be applied to ordinary variations in temperament.""

The medicalization of ""ups and downs"": The marketing of the new bipolar disorder"
2170,"Hello guys i'm AXL 22 yo been dating this 19 yo gurl for about 2 months,it all started with i was at a bar and a stranger appeared was bothering this random gurl and i went to help her then got her home safe she gave me her number Facebook etc so it started from there.
The gurl was 19 yo and her parents were like 30yo+ , so basically they were really Strict with her, she was like in a home Prison , because they made a mistake when they were younger so she does not get pregnant etc,it's her first year at Uni she studies Psychology.

First conversations at facebook were really great she was smart shared my world etc.

Okey firstly she was really sexual probably i hit her up on her Bipolar Phases or sth,then she would tell me tomorrow we should not talk i'm not a bitch i just can't really control myself sometimes,i told her i accept you the way you are and i love you the way you are.

We went out head fun etc she was connecting with me alot i supported her emotionally a lot,she told me i cannot live without you i keep thinking about you your bothering my mind a lot lately,i need you tho's kind of words,the other thing i noticed is that she told me Good things do not last long,and i don't wanna get hurt i told her there is no reason for me to hurt you i love you and i will to the last breathe.

In the other meeting she keept overthinking every little detail crying etc telling me your going to use me then ditch me and play with my emotions everytime i talked through it supported her told her i head no reason too, then she shared she was on a Depression a heavy one through summer and lost some weight etc, her parents fixated to her mind that all guys are the same and i told her to not be selfish because she has to think about me also not leave me and ruin sth good that it just started so it went like this.

So this is were it gets really weird, we would go out and does not matter if it's a female or male she would care less about physical traits,she would kiss females in front of me acting like a Bisexual beast anyways,she told me she loves me more than anything etc.

There was this other girl writing cute comments on my instagram she would get really jelly tell me that i love the other girl and i would always tell her your my only one i don't love anyone else and i blocked that random girl from my instagram.

Every night she would overthink everything cry and pm me telling me i can't help it i really love you tried many times to ditch me i told her i will do whatever it takes i promise you,talking about suicide drugs she never used them doe,how she feels empty i spark her etc how she feels alone,darkness seeing dreams with spiders cry etc.

In the last 2 weeks she went so cold so i decided to ask her what is the matter,and she told me she feels really tired,does not care about anything wants just to hang out in her computer,feels tired but she can't sleep and that she talked to many people lately and she is not talkative,and told me it's just not you you know i mean WTF.

She would give me the same emotional validation doe keep the texts shorter,the intervals got shorter and shorter to 1-2 messages daily no meeting no anything and she would be online the whole time,so it really pissed me off asked her again being a bit needy and clingy,she told me i'm really sorry that i made you feel this way it's not true that i don't wanna talk to you etc.

The last text is sent her asking her if she feels the same feelings she feelt before she would answer it's not true that i don't wanna talk to you and you should not be overthinking things imagine she is trying to use her Bipolar Defense Mechanism by trying to make me look crazy.

So then i really got pissed and told her why are you ignoring my question i'm talking about emotions and stuff,i asked her straightly do you love me do you feel the same feelings you feelt before she answers with''I don't know, can't we just change the topic,i told her just clarify this thing please why did you grow distant is it my fault did i do sth to hurt you??

Shes like''No it's not your fault,i don't know what to say,i don't have anything to say.

It's like every time i try to pressure her she grows more distant,gives me no reason ,i tried to bring old memories it's like everything is erased from her memory,i keep thinking of what i did wrong to hurt the love of my life i can't see a reason,she keeps the high self esteem respects me 0%,tells me i dont know what i feel ,feeds anger everything i tell her is boring tells me its not true that i don't wanna talk to you and keeps it with 1 message a day,likes other dudes photos all the time,probably talking to other dudes everytime i try to bring an old memories rather she forgot it or acts that way refuses it makes me look crazy,changes the topic.

I really thought at first she was playing games or sth,but right now i see she has all the Bipolar Sign's a really rude disrespectful Bipolar,so i told her i can't really continue like this everytime i gave her emotions told her she means the world to me she grew more distant at old times she would answer with the same emotions even more.

So i told her i will set you free give you space time like you asked if you really loved me you will come back if not it's your lost,i can't really continue talking with this kind of character aka mindset your sharing right now she answers with''Okey whatever,okey take care''

I left her message on seen and didn't pm back idk if this was rude,i really could not tell her i will support you to the last min and love you cuz everytime i keept saying that she would grow even more distant.

It's like her brain stopped working she feeds anger rudeness with me and enjoys everything else without giving me a reason.

I cant really keep it this way even doe shes on my heart and mind every second,she has to learn to behave,its like i'm talking to this total stranger that's empty feelingless emotionless sharing some weird death stuff etc in facebook and she wont allow me to help her.

I went on a NC it's the 11th day nothing from her it's like everything she said every live memory that we head just vanished and she does not care i'm sure she does not think even about me anymore,all tho's words she used to tell me.

I'm 100% sure right now she has a Manic/Bipolar Disorder it's my first time i'm experiencing the love of my life to have it,it's really painful and i feel like i'm on a living hell right now idk what to do if i contact her she will keep it short disrespecting rude angry and consider me like her bitch if i don't contact her i'm afraid shes gone forever.

The question is do they forget memories all tho's emotions,will they contact you sooner or later is there a slim possibility??I'm just so surprised how she forgot everything.

If they contact you should i act again with emotions it's probably that she is going to use me for something i guess i want to teach her to behave as she used to??

Please guys help me i'm really hopeless and you can really help me to clear my mind it would mean a lot i'm really alone thank you.

Additional Info:Every time she gets out she drinks like crazy gets drunk and she has fun with it,i'm so sure that if there was someone from the group doing drugs she would have done it too no matter what heroine coke or whatever, basically she follows the Motives of other people as i read it's one of the Signs of BPD.

I'm really sick and tired of saving her life many times i even got once stabbed in my arm trying to save her at the last minute of her being raped from a random guy.

I was eating my brain every second and feeling grief and really sad i can't even sleep thinking about all tho's fun moments we head,thought it was all my fault.

At first she sounded like she was playing games,but i did some research and all the Signs tell that shes Bipolar, she takes no med's no anything and continues going,it was really weird at first i didn't knew what to expect her fear of losing me,changing her thoughts every second in a single word,eventually she left me and does not share anything with me anymore it's like she lost her trust.

I really pressured her a lot to tell me what was going on all i got was I don't Know,it was really off the logic at first without a reason her being distant,answering hours later and it sounded normal to her,and being angry aggressive with me.

I really want to write to her apologize for pressuring her a lot but i doubt it will make things even worst,she will think she has the power and start playing again bitching around.

She should have reacted in the 3rd text which i wrote to her which was 5 pages long telling her how i love her but all she did was nothing simply no reaction, Just plain it's not true i don't want to talk to you.

Also forgot to mention in the first few convo's she was really private about her family every time you tried to ask sth she would not tell me try to hide it then i worked slow she opened up,everytime she head a problem she tried to act cool then again she opened up slow.

She told me she has to think all the negative things so they can become positive,she also told me you can't love me for a short period of time you don't know me that well i told her i love you and that's the realest thing i know for years,then she told me don't promise me things you can't keep i told her no matter whatever it takes i'll fight for you and prove you that i really love you.

I left the door open to her but i doubt she will ever come back!!!

Right now it's the opposite she does not give me a chance to talk about thing's plays it cool like nothing happened,i can't even talk to her she keeps the Conversation's really short,should i try to pm her with a sentence like''Hey i was really emotional on the last convo's i just wanted to apologize for pressuring you,i don't know whatever your going through if you one day feel like sharing stuff i will gladly listen to them and help you,nothing changed about my emotions i feel the same i love you and will continue loving you to my last breath, just wanted to let you know this hope your doing okey best regards i will support you to my last breath.

I wish she could find the Spark she head before with me it's like she hates me the most in the world tries to make me look stupid and keep that cool attitude,and enjoys everything with other people(god damn it it's killing me)

Would it change anything?

I really want her back and i don't wanna lose her but on the other hand i'm sick and tired of being considered with no value like a bitch she thinks she can control anything right now.

Is there a possibility that she will contact?I mean a slim chance of Bipolar people it feels like everything is erased from her memory,every time i tried to ask sth she would ignore the question it's like shes scared of me?

Do they get back to you or they forget thing's that easy i'm really confused i can't really anymore talk with her about anything it does not trigger any emotions to her,she's like i don't know i think the best option is to make her miss me NC,probably when some day she will feel really down i was hoping she would pm me(also note she is really angry and really temper she will keep that high self-esteem i think for a long time,telling me shes way to awesome,guys stare at her wherever she goes and when i asked her why are you keeping the high self esteem shes like that's not true your bullshitting i'm really confused i really am everything i do she gets mad angry i don't really know what to do from this point on)

She just straightly goes on defense mechanism no respect does not trust me does not talk anything no love and enjoys every second with other people i'm sure of it!

She also told me when i asked her if there is someone else shes in love with she told me''Shes not in love with anyone''and when i ask her do you feel something for me she answers with i don't know WTF is going on i'm flipping out i really am.

PLZ SOMEONE HELP ME!

2172,"I've been under Mh services for years now and Was originally diagnosed with bipolar.
Then an new psychiatrist said that because I was more motivated and got more done when I was high that it couldn't be bipolar and they removed the diagnosis.
Since then I've been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and also DID (split personality disorder).

My mood swings between low, stable, high and a mix.
I have weeks of feeling low and sometimes months then suddenly I'm on top of the world and my husband notices before I do. I have more energy, I want to stay up, I want to read and do things with my children, life has meaning and I feel happy!

A consultant in hospital in one of my many admissions believed I had bipolar and put me on a mood stabiliser which helped with my mood.
She has now died but I believe she saw something that I am beginning to agree with. She talked about lithium and so did my regular consultant.

Sometimes I feel I am special and have psychic powers.

I feel I can't ask for an assessment for bipolar because the metal health team feel I am obsessed with diagnosis, rather I know there is something wrong and want answers and help.

When they first put me on sertraline I went high as a kite and was sectioned, this was on 12.5mg!

What do you think? Could it be a mood disorder on top of my other issues?"

I've not heard of anyone ever getting a downgrade. Lots of like-for-like replacements. But never a downgrade. You occasionally hear of people getting a full reimbursement and then a kind of awkward 'courtesy' gift. That's when people get moved over to a personality disorder.

I've been upgraded a number of times and I must say each time has been very moving. A bit like how it must feel to hear a rumour that you've been nominated for some kind of award from people who always agree with you. Flattered and embarrassed all at once.

I'm a single white female in my late 30's who lives alone and is becoming crippled by anxiety, I have zero social life.

I wrote about this a year ago and people on the forum were very nice but I was afraid to change the meds. The GI issue is worse now. A year ago a Gastroenterologist told me it was the lithium. 

The new shrink says to use a 450mg plus a quarter of a 300 mg. I didn't really like the liquid lithium I had tried. It gave me a headache and it tasted like crap and I didn't want to volunteer for insomnia. This doctor said I have to be brave. Then he said I might need another medication and I said what for, more side effects ?? All the drugs suck. 

I'm not starting until after my birthday because my girlfriend is coming to celebrate. My birthday is the 3rd and she's coming on the 4th. We're doing Thai take-out/delivery. 

The doctor assumed I am obsessing about this issue all the time. On the contrary, I put it out of my mind and never deal with it. I found his assumption annoying.

2178,"This is just a whine post.

I was diagnosed 20 years ago exactly.  I've been relatively stable on medicine for some time, I could feel when things were just starting to edge towards instability and I would get medical help to get back to center.

I lost my insurance in June and didn't have refills and couldn't afford to pay for a doctor.  I had also moved and my old doctor quit the practice, so I didn't have any negotiating ability.  It was late August before I got insurance back.  Nearly three months without any medicine, I was miserable and my family was miserable too.

Between physical illness, moving, loss of old job, difficulty in finding a new job, financial stress, my stress level has been through the roof since the beginning of March.  Just a few weeks ago, my brain just couldn't take it anymore I guess.  So not only am I still trying to reach stability, I'm definitely veering into the depressed side of bipolar disorder.

I suppose it's not all bad.  I was feeling better, though not entirely stable.  The mood stabilizer is Lamictal, still edging the dose up, not quite therapeutic levels yet, but the Seroquel is keeping the delusions at bay and also means I'm finally sleeping again.  But I'm sick and tired of feeling bad.  That's all I want, to stop having my emotions all over the freaking place and so extreme.  The new doctor started me on an antidepressant last visit, so hopefully I won't get really bad depressed.

Sigh, whine.  I was always a little socially weird, I was told being undiagnosed as a teenager means my thought patterns were affected during a crucial time, but it was little enough that people would say ""That's just < insert name >.""  I just want to get back to that state."

I have been on antipsychotics since I was 13 years old... upon an intake at a hospitalization, they noted that I have a biological parent passing down an illness so they decided to put me on meds while I was young to suppress any symptoms from forming, being that I was entering the age of very early development. PLUS, when I got my menstrual cycle at age 12, that's when my moods begun to get out of control. 
the antipsychotics have helped me a great deal. besides the crappy side effects and an everlasting tremor I've developed from them, the outcome has been favorable and I am glad that I complied upon being given the medicine. many people have frowned upon my use of antipsychotics...but the way I see it is: if somebody has something threatening and inevitable in their DNA that could permanently effect their ability to live healthily, where is the harm in taking preventive measures to ensure sanity...? it's a controversial subject, and being a youth who was put on these medications, it hasn't been easy hearing the opinions of some people. 
SO, here is my issue today. after six years of being on antipsychotics, I have stabilized and my psychiatrist who has been treating me for 2 years now and I have agreed that getting off of them may be the best option...staying on antipsychotics can give everlasting side effects that I wish not to experience. I've stabilized on the medication Seroquel. I started at 400 and stayed on that dose for a year or so, then backed down to 350 and around March of this year is when I began my taper off. so now we're in the end of October and I am on 50 mg- I have taken this dose for three nights now. however...my body has begun to fall asleep naturally (without taking the seroquel), which has led to a couple of missed doses. being able to sleep without the seroquel was unheard of for me for so long, but I now find myself falling asleep before I have the chance to even take it. my doc said that might be a sign of my body beginning to really not need it. on the nights I've taken it, it's made me terribly lethargic on the day following; I'll feel like I can't even stay awake. it's yucky, so my current mindset is, why take this dose if it seems to be making me too lethargic? maybe my body doesn't need to be at the 50 mg increment...but I'm afraid that if I cease all use of the medication this early on in the drop, instability may occur. yesterday I experienced what I believe was some psychosis. it's only 11 AM now so I have yet to see what today holds. I need some guidance... one part of me is telling myself to just cut it off to 0mg, but the other part of me is extremely apprehensive. 
does anyone have any input, or information I may find helpful during this time? maybe somebody has some direct experience with seroquel itself, if so, that would be a good source of feedback for me. but regardless, if anyone has anything they can share that might ease this inner debate I'm having, feel free to tell me all about it! thanks in advanced to anybody who takes the time to share their feedback."

2181,"Hello,

I was diagnosed bipolar 10 years ago but I mostly get severely depressed. Can anyone please respond about long-term benefits you have had from any type of medications, therapy, ect? I know people tend to often get better in the short term but it always comes back. What has been the most helpful treatment for you? For me it's been medications, as frustrating as they can be. But I still keep relapsing into deep depression depending on the stressors in my life. I am currently taking abilify, wellbutrin, lamictal, adderall, and klonipin at night. I have seen many therapists and gone to many groups most of which have not helped. I am about to do TMS therapy even though there is not much research on help for bipolar with that. I am scared of ECT but will do that as a last-resort. I am seeing a wholistic doctor who is helping with physical stuff but not really with the mood problems. Thank you in advance!"
2182,"Hey everyone, 

Sorry I haven't been very active. 

I saw a psychiatric nurse today and she said that I don't have bipolar disorder because people with bipolar disorder forget what they did when they were manic.

I find that odd because mental illness doesn't tend to affect memory unless it's say, PTSD or dissociative disorder. 
People with Schizophrenia and psychosis can remember their delusions. 

I just don't get how people with bipolar disorder could just forget all that they did. 

I remember aspects of hypomania and buying stupid things that I don't need. 
At the time, I'm unaware I'm high. But come the depressive episode, I realise some of what I did and I feel embarrassed.
I forget bits and my friend reminded me of things I did. But in general, my memory isn't the greatest. But I don't put that down to bipolar disorder.

So, is it true? People with bipolar can't remember their manic episodes? 

I did Google this and from what I found, it is debatable but most people think that people with bipolar disorder do remember their mania and that they're aware of their episodes. 
But I couldn't find any reports or research papers into the topic. 

Anyone want to share their experience? 

Much appreciated. x"
2183,Anyone had any experience in applying for pip in the uk I'm currently on esa and awaiting a proper diagnosis with bipolar which I think I will get as I have spent time in hospital recently and I'm currently on a program called early intervention service anyone else in the uk been on that
2184,"So I think that being manic bipolar has to be the worst thing...  my mother had her moments when she would accuse my dad of cheating she was never diagnosed but she had a manic episode when she went full menopausal; like my mother she told me while she seemed to be possessed which of course was because she'd been through menopause and bipolar, 
My ego death is something that I don't want because having bipolarism makes me want to believe that it was real the cups falling over the lights flicking on and off the stupid alien thing I saw which I thought was the devil... my phone being hacked. Elevated frequencies HEARING frequencies..
 I have a talent for manifesting negatives  everything I've ever thought comes true all the good and all the bad when the bad comes it's my worst fear... I've prayed about it all because I want clarity and peacefulness I am seriously disturbed.... my reality during a manic possessed episode"
2185,"Don't know how to feel with the ex I broke up with, couldn't help it was an impulse moment,

At some point today I did feel I had accepted that I now am not going to hear from her.

Just still hurts 11 weeks later that at the very least she could have talked to me!! if nothing more!! 

its like I don't even deserve her time, like I have been punished for how I felt at the time!

I have sort of accpected she isn't going to talk, and it just wasn't meant to be, but hurts that I don't know how someone can just not want to talk?

she hasn't even emailed to say, I miss you, or I love you, or could we talk, no nothing, in my mind wouldn't most people at least want to know if it was really over?or say could we talk sort this out?

I get cant how someone could just let go so quick? I do blame myself wish hadn't said it was over, wish had said we are ok but talk later, but that is what an impulse moment is just that you don't sit and THINK, do first then think later!! 

even though it was my doing, I keep saying to myself maybe I done myself a favour, everything happens for a reason,   


This really wasn't a reason to have broken up!! but the more time goes on I don't know now if I want an us, maybe if she had spoken to me already....

in my heart I know she would have by now spoken to me its a long time to not talk to someone over something as small as this is.  That's what bothers me I would understand if we had a big argument or something,  


deep down if this was really meant for us to try again we would have talked it out!! I know that. 

just hurts and sad, just at the very least I deserved to have talked it out with me!! 

I don't think she is being fair in that sense! 

I know this sounds bit harsh, if I knew if she was still hurting, still felt sad ect at least id know she in the same boat as I am, guess I want to know that she got feelings , wish I knew she did think about me and wonder how I am, and wish we could just talk it out, 

Its sad because in some ways I wish this December , I wish we could have said we been together a year, last year was the first time we spoke on the 12th December,,

this year we could have skyped  chat or in person, if I hadn't opened  my big mouth, we would still be together!!  but then again it works both ways? she still could have just as easily, text or emailed me to talk? which says to me I really couldn't have meant that much to her!! 

In one breath, I know its for the best, yet... would I still be happy I don't know?
tw, its not easy to deal with someone who you don't know how they will be from day to day, mood wise ect,  that's the bit I feel maybe I did myself a favour from, because if you haven't been with someone with mental health it isn't easy, eg, the next time I go with someone and if they are not mental health I am sure I would be hard work for someone.  tw, from my own experience, she was bipolar and to me that's more harder to deal with, than border line. tw, my own thoughts on that, I know everyone is different. 

most of the time I am happy, bit a side things I am going though,, but other than that, ok I can go from, one moment being ok then something could trigger it off and then I could be in happy for the rest of the day, every day is different. but with her,, she had a lot more triggers, I didn't know how she would be each day, 

were as me, ok my mood could go up and down the whole day, were as her I felt like if I said something wrong on one of her bad days that was it,,,

depending on what it is, its soon forgotten about!! 

with her I felt like I had to think all the time, she made me feel it was all about her, and how she wanted things, her way ect,  I felt I don't think she would think,,, how I would be feeling? or thinking? its like I had to care about how she feels ect, what about me? 

like now, I feel punished like I said,,. all for what? just how I felt at the time? she made me feel that bad to want to leave...  she didn't try and stop me or anything?

shes made out its all one person?  and that is something I cant seem to get my head around as to why she just let me go out the door without even trying?? shes made out, I could have....

so she could she have tried? shes made this so much more than it needs to be!!

I feel so hurt, frustrated sadend,  all we had to have done was talk.. 


hurts she wont even give me that!! 

by now... she could have messaged me to talk,, I by now could have said, ok I could have stayed I am sorry, or she could have said, I could have spoken to you there and then..... and that could have been that!!!....simple as!! 

sorry I just feel so annoyed that its a simple enough thing,, yet I'm not even worth her time!!!   anyways no one should make you feel that bad to want to leave anyways!! again its not like I lived over the road and come back latter!!! sounds harsh,but I hope one day she sits and thinks about this!!"
2186,"Hello...

So today, in fact right now, I'm battling suicidal thoughts. It started with me feeling a sense of low self worth and then it evolved into the wish to kill myself... Yet again.

I feel that ""Normal"" people won't understand this, us, because it would sound like we are making this up and sometimes I wonder if it would take a real suicide to help people understand that our problems are real."
2187,"hello. I am new here.. I hope I post this in the correct place.. :) I am sorry that it is sooo long.

What is exactly Bipolar Disorder? And how do I help someone that suffered from Bipolar?
I have this friend which probably most of my friends hate.
how do you call a group of students in a major that started university at the same year ? Hmm.. let's say it's generation. I am in 4th generation in my major in campus.
There is this one friend in our generation who is a bit...weird. She is often talk non-sense, or talking about something that no one interested, especially in our group chat (with over 100members) and most of us agreed that she just wants to seek atention in our group. She likes to randomly send messages about things that she think funny while we don't think so. 
No one send picture of themself in group chat, we always avoid it. it's usually other friends who posted someone's photo. but her.. she likes to upload pictures of herself, even with his boyfriend and praise him in our group chat.  His boyfriend is our junior which from the 6th generation. We all don't know him very well so it's very uncomfortable to see that guy. she once flood us with pictures of herself on the group chat.
She often send some provocative chats. we usually ignored her (me too, because I am not really close to her and I'm kind of awkward person to most of members there), but sometimes someone just get annoyed and start attacking her..usually followed by other friends. they usually didn't attack direcly but use some sarcasm words. Based on my view, she often didn't realize that she got attacked, sometimes she realized and attack back..which lead her to talk even more non-sense. She's not persistent with her words. Some try to talk to her nicely so she can understand why people got mad. Like, asking her some questions one by one but her answers are contradiction to each other.
In the end, she always defend herself saying how she hates us and we never cared about her and also she act like that because she suffered from Bipolar for years and hard to control herself. once she also told us randomly on the group chat about how she got raped when she was young, and everyone got even more uncomfortable.

Some who still try to hold their anger tried to tell her kindly how is she wrong to write such things in our group chat (over 3/4 of members in our group chat are boys! (around 80 persons), the rest are girls (around 20 persons), it's because we are majoring in engineering :) Doesn't boys hate drama that girls often do? ) and try to listen to her over private messages(my best friend is one of them. she's very patient and try to tell her that it's wrong to write such things on the group chat. She can tell everything to her in private message if she wants.. Me? I don't know what to do.. I am afraid I said wrong things and not good in giving advice so I just keep silent and ask my best friend to talk to the girl)
We all are uncomfortable about her. instead of trying to understand, some of my friends decided to left the group chat. Because once the fight ended, she will repeat again maybe in a few days. Over and over again, it's like she never learnt anything from the past.. always same mistakes. and in the end, she always blame us again.

There is another drama when she think someone tried to steal her boyfriend. so she has a fight with the girl that she think tried to steal her boyfriend in.. lecturers' room... even the girl's father came and defend her daughter, she (my friend) also saying harsh things to him (the girl's dad)! in front of many people! just because of her jealousy. 

It's not that we never cared about her. We once did! At first when we didn't know her very well. one day,she told our leader that she got depressed and tell him that she wants to suicide. Everyone got really worried and everyone are gathering and discuss how can we help her. 
About 80-100 persons gathered straight away because we cared about her! Most of us are even in a middle of an important event (including me) but we decided to spare time to invite her to the meeting so she can feel better. she said she's sorry and now she's happy that everyone worried. but she never stop trying to seek attention from us. she keeps talking about her bipolar, and when someone told her that she's wrong she never listen. if someone started to argue with her and she lost, she will blame her bipolar again. In the end, most of us got so annoyed and decided to ignore her just like I told you previously.

So.. my question is.. well I was browsing about ""am I depressed or just seek attention"" and read an article saying that someone with mental illness indeed needs special attention. (the questions is not about her, it's about myself. I am really depressed from my work recently and don't know am I really depressed or just being weak.. My appetite decreases significantly recently and started to have thoughts about hurting myself so I wonder am I really OK or not.. hahaha. I feel like I want to post everything about my depression on Twitter. I decided to not and uninstall social media apps to prevent me post something weird.. until I am stable again.. Because I still can think clearly and I don't want to be like her.. my friends will be uncomfortable seeing my post on their Twitter timeline..)

well back to this girl again, she told everyone many times that she got bipolar syndrome.. I like to read psychology articles so from I learnt we need to understand her because she's different. She needs our attention. She needs our help. But... it's really hard to try to understand her. I personally think that she probably can't think normally.. or is her bipolar is really severe ? I want to try to understand her but at the same times I got highly uncomfotable too whenever she started to send weird chat messages again in our GROUP CHAT... the things that make me uncomfortable that she often talk about herself that no one asked.. and as I told you before, most of members in our group chat are boys! What do you think I should do to help her? Do I really need to understand her ? How can I understand her ? What exactly is ""bipolar syndrome""? From what I searched on Google, it's about someone who can change moods dramatically from severe depressed to severe happiness. Is she really okay? Why she can't try to understand us? I want to try to understand because I once got bullied pretty bad and got depressed in high school, so I actually understand how it feels to be attacked like that. but it's her own doing that makes people annoyed.. I tried to understand but it's really hard now..

I keep thinking now she probably can get more depressed because everyone hates her and how many people try to attack her whenever she send weird messages again. But what can we do ? In the end, it's become our fault. Not all people are kind.:low:"
2188,"Hi there,

For the past five to six years I have been dealing with a debilitating mood/thought disorder.  Despite seeing countless doctors/other mental health professionals, I've yet to get a solid diagnosis.  For insurance purposes, my current doctor uses the diagnosis of Bipolar II with me.  I've experienced severe depressive episodes and less frequent hypomanic episodes when I'm not depressed.  My depression has been deemed ""treatment resistant"" and at this point I've been on over a dozen meds.  Recently, I've been experiencing minor yet unusual success after being on the L-Methlyfolate Deplin for a few months.  My team discovered it after I had a Pharmacogenomic test done with Genesight. Hopeful.

That's my backstory.  I have an odd habit that I wanted to talk about, and see if anyone here can relate.  I'm not sure how it plays into my mood problems exactly.  Ever since I was very small I've kept two imaginary friends.  The setting they're in and the story around them has changed drastically as I've grown up, but the base personalities and names have stayed the same.
I don't like telling anyone about my characters.  I can't exactly explain why, but it has something to do with what these two characters mean to me.  I love them like real people, and it pains me to know that they are not real.  Telling a doctor, therapist or anyone about them simply reinforces that they are fiction.

These two characters are literally always in the back of my mind.  Sometimes I sit on the couch or pace around the room and think about a scene or conversation involving them.  I do not think they are voices, because I do not hear them outside my head.  I've been told that if I was hearing voices, they would sound like they were outside my head, and this does not.  Also, they don't talk to me, they're either talking to each other or another minor character in their ""story"".
However, sometimes these thoughts about my characters can become hard to get out of my head when I'm trying to do something real.  It's hard to explain.

At this point, I avoid TV shows, movies, books, podcasts, or anything that might remind me of my characters.  I find that the story they're in is often influenced by these things.  Watching a TV show or something can result in my mind feeling very full of ideas about my characters.  I also tend to have extreme emotional reactions to strong emotional scenes (positive or negative) in TV shows or movies.  All together I just avoid them.

I just want to know if anyone else has something like this.  I have a dependence on these two characters, and I am not sure why.  They've always been in my life, just sitting in the back of my mind.  Though often I feel they clutter my mind and life and just make things harder in general, I cannot and do not want to imagine them gone.  Whatever that means.

Thank you for reading this, please respond if you have any ideas.  Also, sorry for any typos, it's late."

2191,"Hi, 
This post will probably just be a long complaint so I'm sorry about that. I'm on 2mg of Risperdone in the morning and 2 at night. It used to be only 1 in the morning, but that wasn't completely stopping the delusions so we decided to up it. I haven't had a delusion in the two weeks since my Risperdone was upped. Since it was only two weeks it could be a coincidence or it could be the Risperdone, I don't have them like all the time, and I don't think I'm as manic as I was a bit ago. Either way, I'm going to assume the Risperdone is working. Still, it gives me this like mental fog. I catch myself just doing nothing. Not even thinking, but just literally doing nothing. I've never done that before. Sometimes thoughts are slow in coming. I also sleep more than I'd like to. I see my psychiatrist tomorrow, but I really don't want to go through a whole new med. The Risperdone's been helping with the delusions, and I hate switching medicine. Do I just decide this isn't a horrible side effect and ignore it? I'm not comfortable with my psychiatrist so I'm not super comfortable complaining to her, but I know I need to become more comfortable with her if this is going to work out. I'm scared to change my meds and I'm scared not to change my meds. Mostly I just need to learn how to talk more to my psychiatrist rather than just saying everything is going fine, but I generally try to be someone who doesn't complain a lot. Does anyone have any advice on how to be more open with my psychiatrist other than just do it?"
2192,"I initially took this medication after holding off for years - have tried other meds but developed weird side effects so had to come off.

My recent crises left me open to taking this med (when desperate will try anything),
and started of with a small dose and have been increasing steadily.  Had manic episode during this time thinking I had won the lottery.  Decreased the med then was told to raise it again.  I was in bed last night and my arms, and other parts of my body are twitching involuntary.  It is visible to anyone.  My next appointment with pdoc will bring another increase so have decided to stop this med.  I know they can give another med to stop the side effects but that med will also have side effects and on and on it all goes.  I am still going to take the old familiar med.

Have managed to access some crises counselling privately which begins tomorrow.  Had a chat over the phone and he specialises in crises work.  Appointment tomorrow.

I know where my vulnerabilities lie and why but the theory is not enough to get through.  

I am back in the driving seat again folks.  (hopefully)

Ok if, this ex whos re-entered is only for me to get the answers then ok, if goes more that's ok, I can and will only take a day at a time to whats meant to be!!

like everyone else if only we had a cystal ball, then we could see how far things will turn out ect, but then if we knew what if it wasn't the ending you would have liked and with someone you wish it wasn't ect?  that's why we find out a long the way in our journey, to learn to deal with things, good, bad, the ugly ect.  

It gives us, our life lessons to learn from.  

and because its been 3 years, I don't know what to expect, all I hope is that she is one person in my life I hope if we don't get this far this time, I hope we keep crossing each other paths in life!!  I cant explain how she makes me feel not enough words, for me my door will always be open!!  until the day I get old!! maybe my heart is meant for her. maybe time will only tell!! 


TW, do you have anyone who you would want in your life, who you hope to try again with? who you would also keep the door open for?"
2198,"So, have been on this for two months now. Can I compare with anyone here?
I feel it has levelled my mood swings, I can concentrate better and think more clearly than I have in a long time. I realised this when I was in the car yesterday and it occurred to me that I think I could get back driving again. I feel like I can think ahead, and be calm about stuff.

Although my mood is more stable, it is not very happy. I feel generally down with dips into worse depression, just not lasting as long. I don't feel like it's possible to feel happy, just more focused and productive.
Life is pretty stressful right now, but the stress isn't sending me freewheeling like it usually would. It is messing my head up a bit, but for not as long. 

So it's good. But also kind of not good.

Before, I was so caught up feeling one extreme to the other that I couldn't focus on my actual life. Now I can, it's not good and I wish I couldn't see it for what it is. I sort of want the oblivion back.
Also, at least before I was happy sometimes. Fake happy perhaps, but happy, positive, full of possibilities. Now it's just shit and blah.

There are some side effects, but not too bad. Hair seems to be falling out more. My sleep is a bit buggered with crazy dreams so I wake up tired. And if I take them too late I feel fucked in the morning. I don't have much of an appetite, which has fuelled the ed fire. And I seem to get more random anxiety."

On the other, I feel it is a bit unfair for me to live in and for her to experience my lows and highs and wonder what that's all about, and perhaps even regretting allowing me into her home."
2200,"I was diagnosed with Bi-Polar Disorder today and I am not sure how to process the information. I don't want to say that the Dr. was wrong but after reading other posts on here I just don't think my situation is the same. I know I am depressed. And I know that over the course of my life (26 years) I have had 4 bouts of depression broken up with periods of feeling ""normal"". I also cycle between having really good days and having really really low days quite often- often times in the same week. Right now is the worst bout of depression I have ever had. The last few months I have been plagued with thoughts of suicide (two of those times I almost went through with it) and I have self-harmed in a variety of ways. The self harm makes me feel better. About 4 months ago I was put on lexapro and it wasn't helping. About a month ago I almost killed myself, the Dr. put me on Effexor. Today I saw a psychiatrist for the first time and he decided that I was Bi-Polar and prescribed me some new medications that I haven't picked up yet. I have never had a Manic episode that I am aware of. I have really good days where I am happy about everything and hyper but then I can flip and the next day I am not super happy but not super depressed either, and then the next could be an extremely low day where I could sleep all day if my children would let me. I keep a clean house and I work (which seems to be impossible for most people with BP). Some days I don't feel like doing anything though and can barely do the minimum at work but I always push through and do it but then I'm too down and exhausted after work so we eat sandwiches for dinner. I always manage to clean up though, because a clean house is important to me...but then I spend my evenings irritated with my kids for no reason and wanting to just sit and play on my phone. I count down the minutes until bedtime. I workout because it helps me feel better but sometimes I can't even do that. 

Am I making sense? I feel as though I am rambling. I am just worried that maybe he was wrong and I am just a person with depression and not a person with Bi Polar Disorder."
2201,So this has got to be the worst feeling ever I'm just a joke and amusement..  I hear a whistle blow and then demons come out.. 😰😒 I do know I have an incubus because it's remote viewing and I've felt it's energy plus the dumb whore manifested itself and showed me  I have my kid around and don't want it transferring😞😩....  I did three separate weeks in a mental institution for this 😭But I know it's real.
2202,"If I was able to , IF ever spoke to the ex again I would at least ask how she is, I would say I was sorry that it was an impulse moment, I would say I felt to give you time and space. I didn't want to put any pressure on to you, as to why I haven't said anything since those last emails weeks ago, .

If she ever got in touch with me, this would be my ideal how I wish things could go,

wish she would either email or text me out of the blue and say could we talk? I miss you, I have been thinking about you.  I still want an us, I wish then she would suggest that we talk in person, then I would know she would be ready to talk, and I would ask did she want me to go up?  I would if I knew I wouldn't end up leaving again, only when it was time to. as in I stayed my whole visit. 

The reason I would rather her come to me is, then id feel she is ready to talk, if I was to suggest , going up to talk in person, I feel maybe I would end up coming back a lot sooner.  I feel I would rather invite me up. 

In an ideal way, I wish I could hear from her, sorry, I could have dealt with this a lot better, we both could, I have been thinking how we both could do things so we keep to what we say ect..   


This is just me saying what my ideal way would be, Knowing deep down this isn't going to happen. was telling dad again today, how sad it is over an impulse moment!

I am trying so hard, to accept this is it!!  one day without realising it, I wont look out for text or email from her.  just feel so gutted inside, yet know keep saying, if this is how much I mean to her, then that's the only way I am glad its over, if don't mean anything to her.  I am not glad in other ways,  even though we wasn't married, we sent husband and wife cards, because at the time that's how we felt towards each other, yet now hurts because she said she wanted to be my wife one day,  hurts because talking about getting married isn't something you do lightly!!

I tell myself why should I care? she probably isn't giving a t...s about me. 
The bigger picture is, I know its for the best, she probably has moved on, and just chosen not to even want to talk it out.  just wish my feelings would catch up with my mind, because it says all the time, forget her!! she isn't coming back ect, yet think its my heart that wants the hope?

we just wasn't meant to be!! maybe it was just all good at the time, maybe it is just one of those things in life, "" at the time you want this with them, want that, spend life with them, sounds all good at the time, yet, when its over just seems all talk from them? Tw.  dad always says to me, words are cheap! 

If it was meant to be, the bottom line is we would we talking by now!!  just hurts that we have both gone our separate ways.  its like I know,... but at the same time hasn't sunk in! what else hurts is, what if, she has someone already, its only been 9 weeks!! if I ever knew that, that would cut me up inside, because at least I am not ready for anyone. From what I have read with bipolar people, they will do the same again to someone else, I tell myself I will only feel sorry for the person on the receiving end.  I think my ex was very good at ""talking the talk"" but not very good at keeping to what she says!,  for someone who said she would always talk to me?? where is she now?"
2203,"Am confused,  My head knows she wont come back, just need my feelings inside to catch up!  I get what everyone has been saying,  I tell myself everything happens for a reason and that is something I have always believed in, maybe it just says to me we wasn't meant to be was all, and it's just one of those things in life! 


As much as I would have loved a life with her ect,  TG, maybe if had been married maybe I would feel a lot worse as in if no talking now over an impulse moment, then how would we be able to talk over worse things?  A part of me feels maybe I did myself a favour.   For those who are spouses with someone who is bipolar they will understand some of this.   

Yet in another breath, If we spoke,,,, we still could have it all....


for the last few weeks of all this, deep down in my heart it says she isn't going to come back and talk and I just need to accept that!!  I do, but still hurts and I know it will for a long time.  I know one day I will look back and think, it is for the best and really just wasn't meant to be, as much as I would have liked it,   things don't always work out in life how you would like them to, but I also know later today, or tomorrow ect  my thoughts and feelings will just keep on going around and around,,


from, accepting this,,, to,  wish she could have at least talk this out with me!!! 
to, its for the best, to could have us,, to, I'm not sure,

so confused about it all!!!   If it had only been two or three weeks not spoken then I could say maybe she just wants more time, but 9 weeks is a long time, yet I know its not like months have past!! yet it's still turned a corner where, time is getting on...

I feel like, she hates me or something to not even talk, yet I do get also she could be dealing with a lot of things,  In few weeks time TG, it shall be my granddads annivary of passing over,  my family had to watch him die! in his home, that's what he wanted,  say more on this another day,  which is next month, then later in the month it would have been my friends birthday, <----   she passed over 2008, again say more another day,  then dislike Christmas, only because of granddad going, but more so because I wish I wasn't in this flat!!! wish I had moved soon,,,

I am looking to stay in my town, enclosed garden as have a dog!! and a cat, once I have moved at least on that side of things I be happier.  Or the next town from me, but my town would be more ideal, am on home link, but its just only a matter of time when something comes up for me, just wish was a lot sooner!!!  

Once I have moved I do like Christmas, and then when I am out of this flat, i'll celebrate it again.  

Then in December it would have been his birthday and nan and granddads wedding annivary,  Then in April it will be my friends date of passing over, goes around ina circle, I know I am not the only one with problems, or worry, or lost someone,

I know this bit may sound silly,,,  but I wish the ex was on this site reading my posts because then at least she would know how I feel, and if she was on I would know the same,  ok we wouldn't be talking,, but at least we would be listing as it were to each other!  without actually having to ask.  and then when it was time, one of us then could ask to talk?  


The reason I feel I am not sure if I want an us is, just because she hasn't talked to me, and the fact it was an impulse moment,,  If this had been over a bigger issues then I would understand the no talking,  It just seems a long time not to have talked to someone over, in my mind that could have been a sit down chat!  for me, the ones would be able to talk and sort out however big or small the issue is, she told me many times she wanted to marry me because she hadn't felt like this.

If we did get married, I think from both ends we both would have to deal with things a lot more differently than we do now!!    I know I could have stayed, and I know she could have just talked to me while there, but it works both ways I feel punished,, just for how I was feeling at that moment in time!!  

again I get she maybe thinking and going through all sorts...  a part of me would want to say why now do you want to talk?
I just feel it is a little in fair over an impulse moment!  I get if she loves me she come back.  ....

I know I have to give up hope!!! I know I cant allow myself to think have hope when I don't, I'm sorry this is a long post...  it prob wont be the last long post! 

when we was together, I wrote a poem about her, and another one about her cat.

wont get to share them now!   got them published, I am a writer, for poetry and stories, one day I would like my own book, but they share a book with other poets.

I do feel it is my fault,, but at the same time...  if we could have been each other for that moment, then we both would know how each other felt at the time,  but we cant.  

yet at the same time she made me feel that bad to want to leave! I feel she is making it a lot worse than it really needs to be! a simple chat could have hapend when I had got back,  even in her email weeks a go,  no sign of could we talk? to me that makes me feel worthless...  like I really couldn't have meant that much if she cant even talk over a simple thing.  I am sorry, I feel, sad, annoyed, all sorts, I am bound to feel all sorts....  its not like it was a big argument this is what is the most up setting about it all, I feel like she is letting go over something so small!! if she can let go over something so small as this....  what hope would we have over something bigger? :(................. Its times like this...... that make me feel I deserve better?  sorry its a long post....  another thing before log off,,,  I feel I would only want her to get in touch if she really still wanted an us....  

I know I have said I would talk even if meant no us, but I know that would hurt, so maybe no talking is for the best? I feel sad that I would get it more if this was over something bigger!............."
2204,sorry for the long post... think you all  may need coffee to keep awake!.... and re read it ... sorry being sarky as its a long post... my mind is sarky.. but am hurting inside!!
2205,"Even though it has only been 9 weeks,  weeks a go when she did email me I did answer her back, but I haven't heard anything since.  we broke up over an impulse moment.  
I have accepted over the last few weeks if she wanted to talk it out with me she would have done by now, but do you think she may want more time? space? I haven't emailed since, as I feel if she wants to talk, when she is ready to.  

How long has your partner not spoken to you for? If your ex has after months of no talking, what was the first thing they said to you?  can we talk? I miss you I needed time?  Have you broken up over an impulse moment? or your partner did with you, if so,  did you both know it was impulse? If  they know it was, did they say to you I know maybe I could have dealt with this differently? 

For me I know we both could have sat down and chatted about it, again I don't feel to email her because I don't want to pressure her. 


does anyone think with more time she may talk even if there wasn't going to be an us?  even if you accept that by now if they wanted to talk they would have, but how long do you go on for without no hope?  for me I feel if my ex wanted to talk she would have by now, just feel hurt that at the very least she could have talked it out with me, and I am finding that very hard, in one breath that's when I feel I do deserve better,  that's when I feel if we ever had gotten married over time, how would we be able to sort out bigger things if she isn't willing to sort out this with me?

when I read more posts how people are hurting, TG, I feel maybe it is for the best because down the line things could have gotten worse and then I would feel even more pain than I do now, I do wish for those who have been waiting longer to know if there partner will come back ect, I really do hope for you,,, you can work it out! I feel sad because all this, over an impulse moment, people break up over worse things, at the moment in time she had made me feel she didn't want me to be there, so I went back home.  9weeks doesn't sound long, but the more time goes on the more reality hits me, knowing she isn't going to talk to me again..  

I am torn between every day, so far,  Its for the best if,,, she isn't willing to talk..

yet we could have us if,, we talked, both listen, both keep to what we say ect,,  then it just keep going back round again.  

I can relate to blocking,  she didn't block me she unfriended me, that was the first thing she done!! I only deactived mine so I could have logged in at any time, but I have gone from it for good now, because I don't want to be on and off it like a yo-yo! that only happened,  in the last month before we broke up, which also made me feel she had something to hide.  
any advice for, what if she is one of those who doesn't come back? 

Thank you for your time."
2206,"Hi, I wasn't sure whether to post in this forum or depression.  I have a diagnosis of bipolar which is well under control these days.  I also had an alcohol problem which I am in recovery from.  Anyway the one thing that persists is depression.  It's not too serious except for one thing which is that I just don't enjoy anything.  In fact, looking back I have had this problem my whole life, I can remember a handful of occasions when I actually felt pleasure in anything.  It's like I am emotionally one dimensional or like I have a plastic layer in between me and the world.  The only thing which has ever really got rid of it is smoking marijuana which I don't do nowadays.  Also I am on antipsychotics which I am sure makes it worse.  I'm hoping it is just the stage of recovery I am at in my mental health and substance use and it will get better.  Does anyone else have this issue?  I'm interested in other people's experiences of it.  Thank you for reading."
2207,"There is something very wrong about me. My life used to be so different than it is now. When i am not depressed, i don't feel this way and don't think this way, but it is all real and true anyway. I am dwelling on it more at the moment, but it is all real and true.

My first manic episode happened when i was at university. Luckily it was over the summer break so i only missed 2 weeks. 

I have been depressed now for one month and 2 days. It feels like forever. I am not enjoying anything. I start to get something out of a drawer or cupboard to do and put it back away again because i can't even cope with how untidy leaving it there on the carpet would be. I have a need to put everything away and keep everything clean. It is a need. 

When i do start to do something like unpack my winter clothes, i can be reduced to tears by a box that will not open properly. I can become agitated over a pile of clothes sitting there on the carpet looking messy and have to slide them back under my bed because i haven't the energy to sort through them there and then.

I only want to eat junk food. 

The days are a muddle of blurred vision and blurred thoughts. No clarity. Not much clarity. 

I am a bit better in the evenings but i still want to cry. It is that emptiness. I am so alone and hardly see anyone. It is getting to the point where i will not be able to see the good people from my past life who come and visit me, because i feel so humiliated over my past words and actions. Everything i seem to do is wrong. Everything i think repulses me. Past things i have done make me hit walls. 

I am so tired i am not interested in drinking alcohol. All i want to do is throw things away and give things away.

I was decoupaging boxes for people i love but i have stopped doing it now. 

Everything is getting worse and worse. Then i will have esa soon and i don't even care anymore. I don't even know what i should expect from life.

My medication is not at therapeutic dose and has stopped working or maybe it is working very well as i have not been manic since August. I know that it is October. I don't want to go through this. I cannot see my gp and he will only refer me. I don't want to be referred because the consultant seems to be diagnosing all of us with eupd as well as bipolar disorder. Everyone i knew at Mind, bar one person, so that is 9 other women with bipolar disorder, has been diagnosed with eupd in addition. This has lead to a big change in their care and how they are treated. Their cpn does not call them back anymore. They have lost so much support and the psychiatrist is becoming very rude to them all. It is not nice to have to sit through an appointment with a man who is acting like he acts. It is not nice to have your appointments cancelled 90% of the time. It is not nice to be in a mental h centre where everybody is so suspicious and paranoid. It is like being put through some mental strength test to join the secret service or whatever they are called. 

I left Mind a year ago nearly, because the charges went up and i don't have a personal budget now because i am not with the mental h team. They were always altering medication and trying to push anti psychotics. They were always misunderstanding what i said. They were always bringing things up and not listening to me when i tried to explain that they were wrong, and that i had not said x. It became more stressful than helpful so i left.

Now i am depressed and don't know what to do about it. 

Add to that how i am without friends and without family. That is how it feels. They call sometimes and visit sometimes, and i want to visit them but am slinking away more and more.

My flat is so quiet and hollow like i am. I don't know what to do. I am coping but i am finding the days harder now. I am not suicidal, but hope i am not put through this for much longer.

At the moment there is nothing i can do. I see the gp in 2 months to discuss my medication so i should rest until then and see what materialises. I am getting out of bed and i can do things, but it is this emptiness. It is part depressed and part how my life is now. I need something to do and people to spend time with. A community garden (which you now have to pay for at Mind). Everything at Mind is so expensive that i cannot do it. The things i want to do you have to commit to once a week for ten weeks all day and i cannot go there all day and sit in there like i am doing a college course in mindfullness. I am not well so i cannot sit there all day talking and listening. Are they stupid? Paying £200 for ten days when i will probably only go to half of that, is absurd. 

Empty
depressed
no way out
esa coming up"
2208,"I met with my psychiatrist and he bumped up my quetiapine from 300 to 400mg. I also have been taking Wellbutrin 300mg. He also started me on Metformin b/c of the quetiapine weight gain (this was my decision). 

He told me that in my case he thinks it is completely realistic to presume that with the right meds we can get me back to the real/normal me. This was the 3rd time he met with me and he is a very good and thorough psychiatrist so I believe him.

Them I met with my mental health intake worker and she said that in addition to the meds changes the team she presented my case to also suggested mindfulness and CBT. 

I think that is nonsense and told her so.

But my question is (and I need to just call her and ask) is if the psychiatrist is saying we can get you back to normal then why do I need the mindfulness and CBT garbage? 

I hate that I don't think well in meetings. I never have. I think of all the questions and concerns AFTERWARDS. sigh. 

just had to sort of vent. I feel like I need some good talk therapy because I have not made peace with the bipolar diagnosis and I feel like I have lost myself this last year and half. I need someone to help me rediscover who I am....but apparently talk therapy isn't the 'in' thing. meds and mindfulness is all they offer."
2209,"Hello everyone,
I just have to say how hard this is. I'm sure it wasn't easy for anyone, but oh man..... 
I don't really know where to start, so I guess I will just start typing. Over the last four years I've been going through bouts of depression and at times anxiety. I've battled most my life and been on every anti depressant under the sun. Nothing seemed to do the trick. During the period I met my husband and had our three kids I was fine, after that it hit again and way worst. Then I had a six month period of extreme energy and motivation I've NEVER before experienced. I had no need for sleep nor patients for anything slow!The first time this happen I lost 25 pounds and made some choices that definitely were not me and I HATE thinking about them. This all of a sudden went away and right as it did I had my thyroid checked. Sure enough it was ""hyper."" Doc said it just got out of wack due to being sick with strep throat. So needless to say I didn't think any more about it and didn't connect the depression that followed it. I went into a deep depression where I really wanted to hurt myself, just to feel something....anything. They put me on zoloft which made things so much worst. Then they wanted to add another drug on top of the zoloft when it wasn't working. I got so affraid and ""bad""that I would beg my husband not to leave me alone. I said no way to the other drug. I truly felt the zoloft was causing things to be worse. So I stopped taking everything even advil and went to counseling for about 6 months. It really helped. My counselor felt good about being able to stop. So did I. I went about a year before it hit again. GO GO GO, No sleep, feeling on top of the world. I can do anything I want. BUT, this time about two months in I would encounter days or weeks of extreme depression I really thought It was my ""hormones"". Then It would happen like every two weeks and randomly a couple days here and there. I couldn't take it any more. I was having heart paplitations, fever, hard to breath. they sent me to the ER a couple times, thinking I had a heart infection. Then they said it was panic attacks but I told them I've had those my whole life and these are NOT  panic attacks.This time I lost 30 pounds. pretty sure panic attacks don't do that. I started seeing a heart doctor. He put me on a salt diet. Upping my salt levels. I got soooo bad. When i went back for my follow up he said I think you're bipolar. I replied. I think you grabbed the wrong chart. LOL. He clarified the disease a bit and explained the cycles. I thought MAYBE! I still thought he was a bit cra cra. I agreed to see a psychologist. That was a freaking joke. She sat there for 45 min. telling me the cycles were too long and all the ways I didn't fit the criteria for bipolar. When people started knocking on her door because she was running behind she didn't know what to do with me so she started writing prescriptions for bipolar!!! I was so ticked off I told her exactly how I felt and left. (probably made me look pretty bipolar! lol) Its been about 6 months since then and the manic bouts and depression are still present but not too extreme. Then today happen....today was bad. I could feel myself getting irritable yesterday and today out of no where bam. I was depressed. I don't feel anything but self loathing. I HATE MYSELF and I have no reason. I just don't want to keep going. Then the guilt hits. When you hear your kids in the next room... I am so lucky to have a family and a husband that loves me so much. How could I possibly have these feelings? How selfish. Its like having a hole in your heart and you can't think of anything else until it's whole again, but for some confusing reason you don't want to make it whole again???? Why in this moment do I want to feel this horrible silent pain of nothingness that makes me want to hurt myself? I want it to go away so badly but I don't dare try to get on anything in fear it will make thing worse. This is no way to live. I do not want to be on meds. I've had meds shoved down my throat my whole life. I just want to be me, the happy me....or even the manic me! There is still so much to my story I guess feel like it's just to much to put into one post. Just a few more details. When I saw the counselor I was diagnosed with ptsd for things that happened to me as a child. I have been diagnosed with ADD as well. ADD meds are the only thing I'm on.
       You know when I got on here I was still fighting the thought that bipolar is a possibility for me. To be honest, and those of you who are parents can probably understand this. I am terrified of having this mental disease on my record. Heaven forbid something ever happens to one of my babies and they get hurt. Whose to say they wouldn't try to say I hurt them or that I'm not in the mental state to have them and take them from me. I don't know about any of you but for me, my children are the one thing that keeps me going. The one thing that gives me any will in these bad times. No one else is good enough for them. Sounds weird coming from the person who just divulged all the awful feelings above. In my eyes no one can love them the way I do.  
Now that I've poured my heart out. What is all of your opinions? My husband has learned to keep his opinions to himself when I am struggling, but I could use an honest opinion and guidance right now. I know I don't always see things clearly in this state of mind. Hearing a strangers opinion might sink in better. Thanks for taking the time to listen."
2210,"Trigger Warning...This is meant to be the time of my life that I enjoy the most...but i'm stuck playing Russian Roulette with my moods. Black for depressed, Red for manic. Every. Single. Day. At least 3 times, almost always even more. I self harm up to 3 times a day which looks awful. I can't control myself when i'm manic and usually get thrown out of lessons for being too distracting and loud. And when i'm low I can't go in my lessons because i'm crying or shaking and sick to my stomach with paranoia or anxiety. I hate this. What's the point anymore. Today I bought some implements. Girls my age are meant to be spending money on clothes, make up, lunches out. Not thing to severely harm and potentially kill myself with. I deserve to die tbh. I'm ruining everything for everyone and I can't stand it anymore. :low:"
2211,"I feel great. I know I shouldn't cause I have never been so skint in my life, in so much debt and it all came to a head this week.

I think the stress has sent me a bit high. It is such a gooood feeling. Been too long.

Is anyone up just now? I am lonely. xxx"
2212,"I am new to this forum, I was wondering about my ex boyfriend. 

We started dating a long time ago(1,5 years ago) and he was conflicted due to damage of his previous relationship. After a few months we got together. He stated things 'I want to move in together' 'we have to spend christmas together' 'you are amazing' when I was with him. Unfortunately, when we weren't together he got angry and said things were going too quickly between us. 

He was messing with my head and one day he texted me about pain in his heart, I told him to relax and he answered: If i die today, I wouldn't care anyway. I went over to him and all the affection was gone. He said 'I knew you would come' i felt manipulated.

I broke it off a few weeks later about an argument where he was sweet one text and angry in the next. It fluctuated while I was calm. After a few months he called me and said it wasn't me it was him, that he treated me badly and wasn't over the hurt of the previous relationship but was ready now. We called and he shouted: woman cant be trusted! I don't want anyone right now!! And then asked if I missed him. I said I did first, but because he doesn't want to be in a relationship I stopped missing him. He said: please I don't mean it that way let me prove myself to you! I gave him that chance and then he never said anything anymore.

Now a year later I saw him in the city, and my heart beated like crazy. That day I texted him that I missed him too. He blocked me and later messaged me on facebook after speaking to our mutual friends. He was mad I asked for the money he owef me and said he blocked me because he didn't want to hurt me and I should move on because he did as well. I was mad, when he texted me he missed me I was nice enough to talk to him. I texted him only once and he acts like I have been bothering him.

We spoke after that on fb messenger and he said he still isn't over his ex and later said he was. That he wishes me and her the best of luck, even though she had hurt him. And that we could be friends but not more.(he blocked me on app because he didn't want me to see things and forget about him and now he wants to be friends?!) and that after the call conversation from last year he didn't want to meet anymore, because of his damage. That he wants to be alone and work on himself and that he couldn't let me in.

I am so confused from the switch. I understand it has been a year later and I accept the breakup. But how come he doesn't even care anymore? He goes up and down and didn't want to explain himself because we are done and he wishes me the best. I understand if I stalked him or bombarded him with texts etc. But i have only sent one. Anyone familiar with this? I try to understand it"
2213,"Hey everyone. 

I made plans to go back to college. 
I started applying for university. 
I even got into the final of a baking competition. 

Since becoming depressed from a hypomanic, bordering mania episode, nothing feels exciting anymore. 
I have even been offered level 5 entry into university (skip a year) without recognition if prior learning (do not have to supply proof of work experience in the field or take an assessment). It doesn't get better than that. Within 3 years, I could have a masters. 
The world was my oyster when I was hypomanic - mania. 

Everything is coloured black and white now and my enthusiasm has been replaced with insecurity and the feel as if I will amount to nothing. Convincing myself what is the point and down to what's the point of living? 

It's so extreme. 
I don't have the motivation to do the baking competition this weekend. I've wasted today in bed watching TV and thinking about the life I believe I will never live.
I feel like giving up my voluntary job, I dread every thought of leaving the house. They don't won't want someone that shows up one day and not the next.

I want to put out there the very extreme sides to bipolar disorder and how it can be debilitating. 
Just when you think your life is back on track, it de-rails.

2214,"I wanted to post something positive so fellow Bipolar suffered know there IS hope - just one week ago I was sobbing uncontrollably from morning to night, I didn't want to get up in the morning and when I did I just longed to get back into bed, I couldn't see a way out 😔

I was started on valproate semisodium and Mirtazapine but it was having little (or no) effect apart from dulling the mania (which I missed because I used my manic days to get things done, but I was boardering on dangerous)

Last week my valproate was doubled so I'm on 500mg twice a dsy, the Mirtazapine was also increased from 15mg to 30 AND we added lamotrigine into the mix, just 25mg twice a day but one week on I can already feel a HUGE difference.

I'm still sad (a lot of this is normal as I've recently split up with my long term partner) but that feeling of utter dispar has dulled enough that I can fa e every day and even find things to look forward to.

Unfortunately there IS NO magic one-boot-fits-all cure but once you' d found the right combination you're well on your way to living a nearly normal life.

I feel a lot more positive, I haven't cried for days and I've started to make and eat decent meals for myself.  I think I'm well on my way to a decent life!!

Good luck to everyone still struggling, don't ever give up there is always hope xx"
2215,"i just left my old dept at work for a new one (within 10 mins of walking distance).

I left in a hurry, not letting anyone see me pack because I hate goodbyes and also because I keep hearing them say bad things abt me in my mind. I am now in an office that is rather quiet and that suits me to a tee. 

The unfortunate thing is that the quiet also makes me want to cry a lot more. Negative thoughts come to me time and again. I've been suicidal the last two days. And today, I threw up. 

My mind is in a complete mess and worst of all, I also feel as though I'm mistreating my buddy who has been very kind to me. I literally act weird or talk nonsense to him. I hate that. I hate bipolar. I really hate this."
2216,"Hi guys. 

I was hoping someone would be able to give me advice? This isn't about me wanting to get her back even though I would more than anything. This is more about seeking advice from anyone who's been in a similar situation and if they can advise if I done the right thing (even though I had no choice with her blocking me). 

I was in a short, but caring relationship with a woman with bipolar. She is 35, I'm 32. I was not aware at first that she had bipolar until we split up all of a sudden the first time, and she wasn't very nice at that point and a few days later she wanted to get back with me and now that I knew more about her I wanted to care for her. Because I loved her as a person, and her having bipolar was not an issue for me as that did not change my feelings (and still hasn't). I actually suffer from depression and have done my whole life but I told her this at the start as i felt it was the right thing to do. 

Anyway, we spoke about moving and and making a life for ourselves. Yes there were grand plans like setting up businesses and such but I knew she would change her mind about it so no harm done. I was even going to go to her fathers wddong reception, meet her mum and her partner and I had already met her brother by that point. 

We always got on,
Cooked together, go for dinner, some times when we were meant to go somewhere cool she didn't want to go and said she was ill so I didn't want to push it, so we stayed in a bit and I hoped she wasn't bored. I wasn't a big drinker and barely drank myself, -and She drank but not much. I had one vice that was weed which I did smoke when at hers but only one or two, which she joined in with me. But it was never something I actively looked to do, and there were times when she asked me to bring it. 

Over a month ago I had a low mood, and woke up on the bank holiday weekend in August on a Sunday feeling down. I was down because I'm searching for a graduate job and had no success. I work in a gym and she often told me I had no career. So it was bothering me she kept bringing it up. Anyway, I cried because I was down anyway, and i guess what was a good weekend turned sour. She became cold, and her car broke down on the way into town so that angered her more. I gave her space, went and got her coffee and looked calm. That evening I accidentally broke the shelve inside the fridge door. Offered to pay but she seemed even more angry. She went to bed and left me there. I basically spent most of that evening not feeling welcome. Come the Monday, she's booked me a cab and I was more or less made to leave. No kiss goodbye. 

For 2 weeks she barely spoke to me. Only responding to me when a present I sent her before she changed with a positive text but that changed soon after. When I asked her if any things okay? I got no response, when I asked again I got told I was needy and she was busy. Bare in mind up and till that point we spoke every day. Now over two weeks we spoke 3/4 times. 

I ended up being signed off work due to stress and I guess with what happened with her was not helping. I asked if she wanted to call it a day, explained how she doesn't seem to like me much at the moment, and that I'm not well as I've been signed off. 

She tried changing it onto me saying I don't want to move in with her and I should have said. Even though I do want to move in. She ended up saying she wasn't going to make me ill even though I told her I'm just down, and I just wanted to know where I stood with my girlfriend. I told her I didn't want to break up. I even said I found it hard when she kept bringing up that my job wasn't well paid and that I had no career progression because she knew I tried hard to find a graduate job and still am. 

But So she blocked me. On what's app, imessenger, Instagram. Which sucked because I never at any point harrasrd her, was never mean to her, when she was taken to hospital I stayed with her for a week, when she had an episode I took her back as I knew she couldn't help it. However this time I think she means it, and that she doesn't like me much. I felt like a douchebag as I only wanted to sort things out, so I sent a letter (not in a psycho ex way, just asking if we can chat and sort this out and mentioned about how I still want a future with her). She unblock me when she got it just to let me know that she appreciated the thought behind it (which is mostly likely to be that she took it the wrong way and I clearly made it worse even though there was nothing sinister). But she then reblovkrd me before telling me I need help, that I should talk to someone and that she can't be there for me. 

I know the story is long but I wanted to present a backstory before I ask if I did the right thing? By leaving her alone (even though she blocked me) I did stupidly reach out via email yesterday because she popped up on my Facebook (she once told me she doesn't do Facebook) and when I attempted to message her it came up with ""so and so used your number to reach out"". But then seconds later o was blocked on that too. So I emailed just to make sure she's okay as I do care deeply about her and will always care about her. Obviously no response. 

Does it sound like I did something wrong? Was I too needy? All I did was wanted to make sure she was okay and that we were okay. Things were amazing till that point. We spoke all the time, and did things what couples 
Do a lot. 

It does genuinely feel she hates me. I noticed she was on her other Instagram account and the one she originally blocked me on is gone (I can see how bad this looks but for some reason I can see her name on the search). I blocked that account too even though I hate blocking because
I'm sure she doesn't want to see me let alone hear from me. 

It's most likely that she just felt it wasn't for her but it did feel so sudden. Especially as we spoke about moving in, getting a dog. Etc. She did seem obsessed about me not being in debt and not owning a credit card (I have a debit card and didn't want to get into credit cards). 

in the last email a month ago she told me to move on. I'm under no illusion that we will get back together or that she will speak to me again, because I know she won't. 

Did I do the right thing by leaving it? Plus being the way I was, was I too nice?  I always gave her love and support and never asked her to take my feelings on. Only that if I were ever down that she would let me get it off my chest and listen. 

She once said I was the best thing that happened to her but I feel she maybe had her mania episode then.!

Anyway I like to know people's thoughts. Apologies for the length of the message"
2217,"Hi guys,

2219,"Hello everyone,

I am new here! :) 
I have had depressive episodes for a long time now. I never had any manic phases only maybe some hypomanic episodes where I felt like I was in love with someone but I obviously wasn't(it felt like butterflies in my belly out of the blue) . I am now on antidepressants (15mg Cipralex) and from it I have very bad mood swings from hypomanic/manic to depressive. But I am more hypomanic than depressed. I often have or had anxiety,too! When I was a child I sometimes had depressive thoughts, too. I sometimes see things which aren't there. It used to scare me alot but now I got used to it.
Has someone experienced something similar? Could I also be only m. depressive even I have these side effects from the antidepressant? 
Thanks for your help!!! :)"

2221,"I'm 19 and I was diagnosed with ADHD and Cyclothymia. I'm not on medication for either and my symptoms have been bad lately. Usually I am rapid cycling, up and downs throughout each day. Those days are interesting. But I've been in a rut for a while now and I can't seem to get out. I'm just depressed all the time. It's only really bad late at night (like right now), but throughout the day I just feel no motivation, zero optimism. 

My question really revolves around my relationship. I've had a girlfriend for over a year now and obviously I care about her immensely. However, with me not having a zest for life lately I don't seem to have feelings towards her that would indicate she's my girlfriend. I don't know if it's because I'm in a place where I can't seem to focus on anything but being sad, or if I don't love her. 

Sorry if what I said wasn't clear. I'm having a trouble articulating my thoughts and feelings.

2222,"Hi Peeps, 

I aint doin so well... i only got diagnosed with Bipolar 2 about 4 weeks ago.. Ive been on cipralex for 6 years for my depression. My Psych has put me on carmabazapine and quetipine. I started them last week and am slowly comin off the cipralex and feel it too.. 

I tried to come off them before and not coped but know it has to be done this time. I feel lost, i dont know whats real. I just wana hide in my bed and not speak to anyone. Im binge eating too which it makin me feel worse so i binge again and get stuck in a visous circle. 

I dont really know why i am writin this cause i know ive just gotta wait for it to pass and for the other meds to take effect but man i feel so low. I also feel rage aswell, deep inside like i might just flip! When i look in the mirror i feel disgusted in myself. I dont want anyone to see me...   

Has anyone else come off anti depressants when they have been reliant on them for so long??  xx"
2223,"Hi, I'm new here. I don't know if any of you can help me regarding my feelings towards a guy with bipolar disorder...

Me and this guy who I work with started chatting online about 5 months ago and we immediately clicked as we found out that we have loads in common and we have the same interests. We see each other about 4 times a week at work. We don't usually speak much at work, but we sometimes smile at each other or pull faces. 

Only after a couple of weeks of knowing him he told me about his bipolar which I thought was brave of him to tell me and he informed me of his moods switching a lot and that he has medication and has had years of counselling and therapy. But at that time I couldn't really see any changes in his moods. He asked me to go to cinema with him and i did and we had a laugh. He kept teasing that it was a date and said he wanted to hug me but didn't dare. Whilst we were on the date he kept telling me about his mental health and how his bipolar affects him. I said that I will try to understand but he said he is able to hide his mood changes so it doesn't matter if I don't understand.

But recently I've been seeing some of his mood changes. Last week he rang me up to just have a chat and we chatted about things that we hate. He kept teasing me and so I did the same to him and then suddenly he snapped. He shouted that I had pissed him off and that I had caused him to feel depressed and angry and that I was being an idiot (and another swear word). I instantly felt bad so I apologized but he continued shouting at me so I told him that I will try to understand his anger and will listen to him. He then said that I can't do anything for him and that it's just his mental health and that's the way it is. He told me that he wants to stop taking his medication and I asked him why and he snapped shouting that he wants to kill myself and asking if I would kill him. After a while he calmed down and he started laughing about a joke he remembered and then hung up on me. But he is always joking that he wants to kill himself and saying ways in which he will and it upsets me a bit. 

The next day he asked me to go out for a drink with him again, so I did. We met each other 20 minutes earlier than planned and he started to complain how he is always the one to get there first. We went for a coffee and sat in silence for a long time and he was constantly looking at me with a blank face. I asked if he was okay and he said yes, but then started moaning how I hadn't drank any of my coffee. So I ended up literally necking my coffee to please him and then he started laughing and we had a few jokes. He said he was bored and sad so wanted to go home and started to get up, then laughed and sat back down. We then went to the cinema and everything was okay as he was laughing at the funny parts and started to poke me and have a laugh. He also kept fidgeting and being really hyper in the cinema and when we were walking. 

Afterwards, we had a sit down and talked and he started punching and poking me playfully and laughing. He then talked about his bipolar again and how he's going to stop his medication because it means he can't sleep. I asked him about his mental health and he replied to me honestly saying how sometimes he is so depressed he wants to commit suicide but then he can be hyper, but most of the time he is hyper and can't help it. He also said he can get annoyed easily and angry so when he is at home he punches things, but he hasn't self harmed in over a year and a half. I told him that I don't mind about his bipolar and then he grew distant saying it's just the way it is and can't be help, which I understand. He then kept going on about how horrible his past relationships were and how all of his girlfriend's have been mentally ill. Then suddenly he became hyper again, poking and slapping my arms and legs playfully and teasing that we were on a date. 

He rang me the next morning and when I asked how he was feeling he said he was fine and enjoyed our date. He then started talking about what food he was making and I asked him to give me some, then he suddenly snapped saying I had ruined his mood and we left the phone call there. He texted me later and we just talked normally for a while and then he told me to f*** off after I hadn't replied for a while, so I didn't reply. We haven't talked since and it was 3 days ago. I'm now dreading going to work and seeing him. 

The problem is I have really grown to like him, because when he isn't having an episode he can be really nice and funny and we understand each other. But then sometimes he can have an episode and doesn't seem to try and stop it, but it makes me feel bad as sometimes he blamed me for feeling angry. I know that because I don't have bipolar I may not understand how difficult it is, but I am trying to understand for his sake. Sometimes I am able to look past his disorder and see his true personality which I have really fallen for and would like to get to know better. But I'm worried that his bipolar might become a problem and that I won't be able to deal with his episodes. I don't know what to do! I don't know if I should continue talking to him and going on dates with him and see how it goes, or whether I should stop talking to him. But I know that he can't help it, that's why I continue talking to him. 

I don't know if he is actually interested in me because of his mood changes. If he is interested, then I can't help but wonder whether it's a part of his mania... I really like talking to him and being with him, but his outbursts and sad episodes make me feel really upset and I can't help but blame myself, even though I know it's not my fault... 

I don't know if any of you can help me in any way... I don't know if to continue with this relationship, regardless of whether it's romantically or just as friends. I feel that If i do I might not be able to cope, but I really do like him and I don't want to stop this friendship just because of something that he can't help. But If i do continue talking to him, how do I cope with his episodes? And how can I help him? :unsure:

I'm really sorry for the long post!!! Thank you!! :)"
2224,"And tomorrow I go back to the psychiatrist...I was told it was a 1 shot deal and then I would see my family doctor (gp) to follow up and change meds. The psychiatrist put recommendations on my file

2226,"hi all :)

im trying to find out whats wrong with me and whilst im not saying id actively choose to be bipolar but i know theres something wrong with me whether it's bipolar or something else id want to know so i can get support and learn to help myself. When i think of bipolar of claire danes potrayal in homeland and ive never been that extreme.

I think about suicide on an almost daily basis.
I constantly have a feeling of sad that goes away for a while whilst im
talking to people.
I have a lot of energy and am quite hyper to the point that people have said that whilst they really like me they can find it hard to take.
i am fairly easy going but am prone to explosive bouts of anger once every now and again that are disproportianate to the situation
i am an anxious person
i want everyone to like me and i want to like everyone 
i lose my rag when people
dont respond to texts or messages and if i know they seen them and they are ignoring them i feel like shit and usually end up saying
 stuff that drives that person away

i want help but even when i go gp i feel like they being obstructive and even if they did know they wouldnt tell me 

any advice please?"

Does anyone else feel this way or know anything to help? I'm on risperdol and it helps with the delusions, but not the energy level or boredom. Still, the delusions are the part I worry about the most that needs to be managed, and I don't particularly want to switch meds again. Any self-help stuff that works?"
2229,"It feels like chaos inside my head.  I don't know how to make meaning out of my life.  My life feels like chaos.  I can't organize myself anymore, except at work.  Meds can't take away the pain.  I don't know how to set goals for my life, or work toward those goals.  I feel like the tasks I need to complete (cleaning, cooking, studying) take so much more energy than it takes for a normal person.  Grief, despair, depression, hopelessness, anxiety and fear all drag me down and slow me down. I've been afraid of life for almost as long as I can remember.  I don't even know all the reasons for my fear and anxiety as a child.  I just got really good at escaping into my own little world of books and daydreams.  But escaping is harder and harder to do now as an adult.  I feel like the only escape now is death, oblivion.  There is too much pain inside of me, and too much pain in the world."
2230,"Given a different diagnosis today - I'm gutted, scared and didn't see it coming :(

Stayed away from mental health services - for what I thought was the better. I had to stop work recently as things started to change out of nowhere. I didn't see it. I didn't expect to be told this today. I don't feel I can trust my mind at all. I don't feel like I can trust other people. I can't believe I didn't see this coming. I had to get help this time.

2232,"I've googled. And read. And spoken to my CPN. I'm still unclear about hypomania.

Firstly I do not have any bipolar diagnosis. I have cPTSD and BPD. This is a recent diagnosis but I've always struggled. Anyway, when I read about bipolar - particularly type 2 or rapid cycling it fits me (I think). I never thought I could actually have bipolar as I thought you had to have the full mania and I don't. Only recently did I find out about hypomania. A lot of it fits but I'm still unsure. My CPN thinks my highs aren't high enough...or that I sleep too much in a high for it to be hypomania. So I collated a wall chart of all my different moods over the course of this year and now I include sleep too. I respect that I am not a psychiatrist but it is difficult to get a psych appointment. I should be seeing one in October and want to go prepared.

I've just come through a 3 week depression which followed a 7 day high (I said I was so happy I wanted to cry at the peak). The depression was awful. Crisis point for days, pleading not to be made to live anymore, you know what I mean. Anyway I've switched. I couldn't get to sleep the night before last. Had about 3h in the end. Then yesterday I started the day crying and by afternoon - ping! - I was so productive. Given I haven't been able to move much for 3 weeks it was a very noticeable shift. I'm still up today. I have done soooooo much and I spoke to my GP on the phone but pretty much babbled at him. Suddenly my sex drive is back (happy husband!). In terms of meds I take a lose dose of propanolol (for anxiety), and promethazine occasionally (to help sleep). I tried some antidepressants but it didn't work out.

Thing is, I don't know what 'normal' is so maybe when I'm up I'm just normal? Or maybe it's hypomania. I do get super productive but I know there is so much more to hypomania that that. I know it can wreck lives for people. That's why I'm interested in the experiences of people who definitely have bipolar and know what hypomania is.

Thank you anyone who can reply."

I've had psychosis since I was 14,it was very severe but seemed to get better after many years of therapy. Now however it has suddenly got very bad again, only this time no hallucinations but lots of mood swings.  I am either high or very low, there's no inbetween. I get into states where I think I'm being cheated on, betrayed even though I have no evidence. I was sobbing for a whole evening and my psychiatrist had to prescribe me valium to calm me down.

Then come to find out he can see me at the second clinic location which I can literally walk to from my house. I told him I've been reading Peter Breggin and he was familiar with his books. I am hoping we'll have a meaningful conversation about my case once he's read my book. He said something about the right person comes along at the right time. He said he uses holistic remedies in addition to psyche meds but he did NOT know what lithium orotate is. Hmmmm

Dont know what to do its like now that once again i have been drinking i feel like taking another overdose well why not
2242,"I was harassed by my neighbours and it sent me into a sprial down and was hospitalised.  After being discharged I was finally diagnosedwith Aspergers but with bipolar affective disorder.  Apparently, no one believed me about my neighbours and put it down to paranoia.  My CPN seems to thnk so.  Also recently I started to shake violently and I got worred it was my neighbours holding up the power saw up to floor again.  Then so she thought I was being paranoid as I found out that was my medication.  She got the wrong end of the stick.  I said ""I am shaking violently and I do not know if it's me or my neigbours and I cannot sleep because of it"" not ""my neighours are making me shake etc""  

I am so angry.  I have never had ever been paranoid and I am worried if my neighbours harass me again no one will believe me.  So annoyed.  And if I get an emotion they go off one asking fabout my medication.  So, aren't I allowed to have emotion?  Also Aspergers people have highs and lows.  In my letter about my hosptialisation there so no mention in any way of a concern about my moods just tonnes of stuff about concern over my weight.  

I got a bit annoyed and said that I do not have paranoid delusions, I have never had any paranoid delusions and I also said that I right to feel emotion if something is upsetting.  She really frustrates me.  It just comes across as ""jobworth"" 

However I recognise that my frustration might be the bipolar.  But other social agenies in my care have been very mean and rude to me  and one shopped me to the SSPCA which was unfounded.  They thankfully discharged me out of the agenies but it still angers me and upset me greatly and I cannot watch anything Pet related without starting to cry saying ""they think I do that to my dog""  

My meds give me bad side effects and they do not believe  me and tell me that after some time they go away but they haven't.  I just feel like I am speaking to a brick wall.

Sorry about the rant."
2243,"Hi, this is my first time on there so bear with me.  So a bit of history:  I was diagnosed 16 months ago with Type 2 Bipolar/GAD/Panic Disorder, and I was put on a cocktail of medication.  I’m 36 now and looking back it all started when I was 18.  So I am pretty stable now and as I look at my life I feel like I have missed out on 18 years of it.  This is the first time I actually feel like I know what I like, who I like and things that I am actually interested in.  That probably sounds weird but I cycled very fast and things could be amazing to me, or just there or useless depending where I was.  So here is where the problem lies.  I am married, I have two children 4 and 6 and have a good job but I have no feelings for my wife anymore.  She is a great mother and friend but is nothing more than a roommate right now.  I mean I do love her but as the mother of my children.  When we first met I would go from thinking she was amazing to wondering why I was with her because of the things I didn’t like.  Then I would be up again and things were great.  At the time I had no idea of the bipolar stuff and just thought I was messed up.  I then thought if I bought a house that would fix things, and it didn’t.  Then I thought pets would fix things and they didn’t.  Then I thought marriage would fix things and it didn’t.  Then kids, and once again it didn’t.  The medication fixed things but now in the middle I see that I actually don’t feel the feelings I should for her.  If I was this way back when I met her, we never would have stayed together.
I want to leave and just be on my own for a while, but I don’t know what to do.  I don’t want to mess my kids up but at the same time I really do feel my wife deserves someone fresh that she has no negative history with.  And I feel the same.
Does anyone have any suggestions or gone through anything like this before?
Thanks!"

2245,"Hello,

I suffer from BP type 2 ultradian cycling. Now I am told how rare this is and tbh it doesn't interest me the statistics and demographics of the nature of my illness. However, I was wondering if any of you guys have been diagnosed with this condition also?

What treatment are you on? Does it stop the cycling? Are you on an anti-depressant as well?

I can not imagine a life without cycling at the moment. Its very odd but I will miss the more positive aspects of cycling. I have done the research into my condition and following stopping all medications again I have hit rock bottom and decided to go for augmentation therapy that includes lithium and possibly a non-sedating anti-depressant. 

Let me know whats going on with you guys!

Regards,

C"
2246,"I've been dealing with something lately. I never used to have a problem with it but the more stuff I've read I really don't know how to think. People saying that if you like shota your a pedophile and equating it with child porn and all that... I just wanted a little help from you guys.

I just I don't know... The reason I am saying this is because when I first started getting into it, I was like 14 or so and was like the age of the characters so it felt natural, but now that I'm a bit older I don't know if it's still appropriate to masterbate to the same stuff... 

My mindset before all of this was that it's not like I want to fuck little kids or anything, I have never felt that way about real kids. I always thought of it as going back to being that age and if it's a story about two boys I would imagine I was one of them at that age and that made it a much more acceptable thing for me. 

I've been really concerned because I hear people say that porn is a slippery slope and I feel like I have made myself this way. People aren't born pedophiles they become it by porn addiction and stuff like that. And I feel like now I'm afraid it's starting to connect to real life or it will.  

I have never been sexually attracted to kids. Although I really have been worried about what damage I might have been doing to myself long term over the years of watching stuff like that growing up. I don't know if it's possible that I can make myself a pedophile...

I also have now unwanted persistent thoughts all throughout my days now about it. I see a child and I think about pedophelic things, not because I actually have urges like that but because I am trying not to think about it. The only thing I can compare it to is when you're at church and trying not to think of sinful thoughts or sexual things but because you are thinking about not thinking about them, that's all you think about. So when I watch Sia's chandelier video and I see comments saying how it's wrong that the little girl is being sexualized, all I can ever think about is that. So now every time I hear Sia I think of more pedophelic thoughts. My brain has too many connections and it's driving me crazy and making me so guilty and I feel like I'm ruined myself and made myself a pedophile. I'm now where I can't go a day without it coming up In my head. I feel so guilty because I feel like I made myself this way and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I can't talk about it with anyone because this is not a topic you can discuss with people. Being a pedophile is the most evil dispicable thing a human can do and I can't talk about it. I need help. I feel like I ruined myself and I feel so guilty I want to kill myself"
2247,"Hi all,

This is my first post but I am desperate for some advice. I spent 2 years taking Sertraline for depression but found it didn't help much. After coming off the medication (I stopped it following a depressive dip and suddenly feeling happy and like I could take on the world so I went cold turkey) I seemed even before lapsing into depression for which I have been given fluoxetine but haven't yet started taking it (was taking 5htp) but hubby and I were talking a few days ago, he asked me if I'd considered bipolar disorder as for years since my depression diagnosis he has suspected it and watched how I've behaved. My euphoric highs have cost us a lot is retail therapy, my job when I've decided I want a change or the sudden joining of classes etc in education (I currently have 4 outstanding), my depressive states have seemed to be more and I flip between the two states with periods of ""normality"" in between. 
When I suggested this to my dr she said it is unlikely and that I'm probably just depressed and to take my Fluoxetine and we will look into it in a few weeks time. 
I don't feel like I'm being taken seriously. 10 years ago when I lived in another town I was under my dr and kept asking about cyclothymia. I was told I couldn't have it because I had no history of trauma. I tried to explain I did but had never disclosed to my family dr so there was nothing on record, he just dismissed it and said it was dodgy hormones and gave me the pill. He said likely I had pmdd or severe pmt and to get on with it. 
I'm sorry to rant on but I feel lost. Even if I ""just"" have depression  I'm still struggling and I feel lost. We are lucky enough to have private health and wondered if seeing a psychiatrist is something I could through that. I just don't know what to say in order to be heard :( 
Can anyone advise me?

2248,So I just wanted to say hi. I was diagnosed bipolar 2 about 5 years ago and have been on many different meds. Just recently they decided to diagnose me bipolar 1 and borderline personality disorder after a month and a half high followed by almost 2 months depressive. I'm taking ziprasdone and something for depression but forget what. I seem to be more stable right now but still in kinda a depressive area. I'm recently divorced but my ex and I have started to work things out together but we are taking it very slow so our kids don't get hurt again  if it doesn't work out. So ya just wanted to say hi
2249,Well I have been on lithium for over a year now and not had a high but the last two weeks I noticed a change in my behaviour. I have not been sleeping right possible 3 hours a night and been doing everything like changing all my bills and fixing everything doing lots of jobs. I have also been spending more money. It doesn't feel as bad as the ones I have had in the past but now I'm sort of coming out of that I notice that it was a change in my mood for about 1 1/2 weeks. Is this right that you can have a high on lithium but it is sort of dulled down if u know what I mean.
2250,"I wonder how many persons on this subforum have found their optimal mixture of medications against mania (inc psychosis) and depression. I myself use lithium, euthyrox, lamotrigine, seroquel and zyprexa, and sometimes a minimal dosis lorazepam. A rather steady effective mix . I have accepted the need to use medication since 1993 after several reductionattempts. In 2004 started my best mix. Sometimes symptoms or potential harm (kidneys)  force to increase of lower the dose of some above medications. I am aware of the fact, these,  that antipsychotics takes 15 years of your life, off course I seem a bit crazy to accept all these medications. but I prefer actual wellbeing, as long as possible. All above medications have their specific effect on finetuning my mood and lower symptoms and help to cope with tension. Also I found a way of live (structure, good sleep, deal with symptoms, and selective sharing) to increase possibilities in functioning in (voluntary) work. 
What is your experience and opinion about mixed medication?"
2251,"We wife for years has gone through phases and the phases all tended to be extreme but harmless even if expensive. 

Recently she has gotten lost in conspiracy theories and hard core religion (fundemental Christian on steroids). Last sept she pulled out boys out of school without my consent to take them to the mountains because a meteor was going to hit. We live near the ocean. I had to get a court order to get them back. 

Then she built a house in the mountains with a real deep steel underground bunker fully stocked with survivor food. The house is ""off grid"". She spent about 1.5 M US. She built it because we are in end times. Ugh. 

Then in Feb our son got sick needing a liver transplant. She refused to consent because she felt Jesus would heal him. Our son was end Stage with 24 hours to live. Fortunately the priest at the hospital was able to talk sense into her. 

And I am leaving a lot. 

But here is what I want to know. At times she seems totally normal. Wants to go to dinner. Buy me a shirt. Bike ride. 

Then she will go listen to end of times videos for 8 hours leaving me to take care of the kids. 

It's the occasional normal behavior that confuses me along with her having no idea she is behaving in a very odd way with outlandish delusions. 

When people have a MH issue do they know? She will not see a physiatrist because in her words she does not need meds. 

any comments appreciated. Trying to figure out what I am dealing with."
2252,"Ever since I was diagnosed life has been incredibly harder even harder then before I starting taking my medication.  The slightly bad thing is I can't fall asleep now without a medication which means I can no longer take no naps.

Have people lived as a successful life with bipolar disorder as before there diagnosis?
I'm looking for either personal stories or good examples of people in society.

I have read of a lot of successful stories of people with either asthma or diabetes managing successful lives and even depression.  Not really with bipolar though."
2253,":clap:

Good afternoon/evening all,

I joined yesterday as I was having an absolutely desperate few days and hadn't felt like that in a long time but for some unknown reason (not that it ever makes sense!) I feel fab today!

It was very scary yesterday and I have only just found out about triggers - how could I not know about triggers??? so i'm trying to work out what set me off (if anything).  I also read about making a plan for what to do if it happens again - does anyone do this? I had a pinterest board of 'things that make me happy' but that really didn't help at all.  I saw the post about creativity and the only thing that I fancied doing yesterday was some drawing so maybe I should have an art box ready for next time as I couldn't be bothered to move and look for stuff yesterday - Has anyone found anything that helps? 

Best wishes,
Sally xx"
2254,"hi everyone :)

I was formally diagnosed by my GP with depression nearly 5 years ago. At that point she confirmed what I already thought I was suffering with. I had low moods, little interest in doing anything, just wanted to stay in bed for as long as I could and ignore the outside world.

However, after a few years I found myself having more extreme mood swings - I could easily go from my lowest ebb to feeling on top of the world, usually without warning and without any real reason. My finances got out of control through erratic spending and I relied on other people to give me sense of worth. 

I went back to my GP and said I think I have bipolar (which is a big thing for me as I didn't really want to accept I had MH issues in the first place). She basically laughed at me and said that wasn't possible. I have since found out that GP's will only diagnose depression - anything else needs to be confirmed by a psychiatrist. 

I am due to (finally) see a psychiatrist at the end of September but I still think I have BPD - my mood swings are dramatic and often come without warning. I have just split up with my boyfriend and feel completely worthless - I feel like without him I am nothing. I don't know how to value myself without someone else.

Does this sound like BPD to anyone or am I just clutching at straws? :("
2255,"Lithium should be more widely used for bipolar disorder, researchers say

Lithium should be more widely used for bipolar disorder, researchers say | Society | The Guardian

How valid is this article? Do most people with bipolar disorder need medication or are other more healthy treatments viable? 

I would like to know these psychiatrists' links to the pharmaceutical industry, because it wouldn't surprise me if there was one. 

I don't know how antipsychotics are any better for people, though. :unsure:"
2256,"I have never rapid cycled and i never used to have the mixed state people have talked about, but my time on Lamotrigine has been something resembling both of those. I feel it is more like an antidepressant. This morning i woke at 4 and this would usually signal depression, which i feel, but i also woke with racing thoughts. I have more depressions now whereas in the first months/year, i would have more hypomania. I was manic initially for 7 weeks and had to take other medications to overcome that. 

My dose is only 200mg now, and i have been told that if i increase it, i could make things worse. I have also been told it may not be the medication, but the illness progression. I was also told it may be because i initially had antidepressants alone and this also caused rapid/mixed cycling. When i stopped the antidepressants, the cycling stopped and i was depressed. I have reduced Lamotrigine before, for 7 days, and i became depressed after three days so had to increase it again.

Is anybody having these same issues with it? 

It is very hard to find stability without flatness or other effects."
2257,"hubbys away off hunting on saturday for several days. I arent that great at the moment but he needs to get away to do something he loves. I just have not been sleeping great and feel like drinking. I did take an overrdose and ended up in  ICU  for a few days. my support worker today and my pdoc is more than happy if i need to  spend some time on the ward to keep me safe. while hubbys away. The thing is my dog whom i love i dont want to send him off to the kennels for a few days. But my support worker is like 'I am concerned about you, and if my dog spends a few days without me well he will be fine? Its kind of tempting to be somewhereuc safe but well I arent too sure really. what top do?? can anyone suggest what may be best thing to do. The other thing is that due to my meds I am so sedated I find it hard to wake up to any sounds at all. And being hard of hearing i dont hear much at night time and this is a concern for me. I could just take less of my night meds but then if i dont sleep well i am fucked anyway! I know i have  the answer but feel i dont deserve the help my doc is suggesting.Feel like they are kind of going out of their well for me, and feel like others need that help more than me. I feel like i am getting special treatment but dont know why
Anyway have just left a message for my support worker to give me a ring back to discuss this"
2258,"Hi - I'm not sure if anyone is going to read/see this....but I'm desperately in need of someone to listen and hear me. I'm in such a bad place with the BPD I'm so confused. I've had this condition for 13 years (recognised, probably longer) but I have zero support from my friends and family. It's my own fault, I spent so many years pretending I was fine and being everyone else's rock that people stopped offering to help. Problem is, i found that people treated me differently. I found people were skirting around me, not treating me the same and being overly delicate and that annoyed me more than receiving their 'help'.....it's been this way for so long now that even when I get to desperation point and am literally screaming for help, no one believes me. They all expect me to'pull myself together'' like I always do (go figure!) and those who give me time to listen end up saying things like ""well, I don't know what to do"" or ""what do you expect me to do"". Like I'm supposed to know when I'm in such a dire state. I'm getting to the point where I've been seriously considering harming myself....I've been to and fro from my doctors and all I get is my meds tweaked & told to come back if that doesn't work. I hate feeling like this.....I hate being so unpredictable, I spend most nights just beating myself up and being envious of 'normal' people or even just people
Who have lovely caring families......"
2259,"hi 
i am under a early intervention team with no diagnosis but past diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, psychotic, anxiety and depression. They stopped telling me any information on a diagnosis after an overdose that ended me in hospital.
I am on 200 quetiapine.
My mum has recently said she is sure that I have some sort of bipolar disorder and she wants me to have a bipolar screening but I don't know how to go about asking for this.  As I am already under a team they seem to be stuck in their ways of just treating me the same and not really helping. I am really stuck and need some advice, please, any advice on this situation would help. I would feel better with a diagnosis, bipolar or not.
thank you"
2260,"I am sitting here on my own as usual. I can honestly say that everyone i have ever met either pity me or hate me. I have lost the respect of everyone i have ever met. I have even recently lost the respect of some of the people who live in my neighbourhood because of my patheticness. 

If i met me, i would pity me, and not in a nice way. I would tell myself to stop being so pathetic. The only people who have respect for me or see me as a regular person are the people who don't know me very well. It is for that reason that i keep myself to myself as much as possible. It is a sad fact that when my mood elevates, i get myself out there and meet people, who later realise i am pathetic. 

I don't speak to anyone all week except my mum and dad on the phone. I see them at the weekend for half a day, where they listen to me, sometimes tell me to stop being so pathetic in an indirect way, and then drop me back home probably glad to see the back of me. 

All of that doesn't matter very much but i am unhappy also. I am not happy with my life and it has been far too difficult for me. At present, i busy myself with decorating my flat and buying things for it. I have made myself a nice home that feels safe. I am getting too attached to it and too attached to my belongings but there again i would be fine in a tent in a field with no belongings. I would quickly become mad but i am having some trouble here staying in the real world. 

My medication is sufficient. If it were excellent, i would still feel this way because my whole life has been manic, not literally, but manic.  

I don't know what i am posting for or what i am trying to write but i felt the need to communicate because i am suffocating in this loneliness."
2261,"I'm trying to confront this. But I can't. I don't want to be dependent on abilify for life. I was taking just 30mgs a night of abilify since age seventeen on and off for years. I'm twenty-seven now. I have no career job or education. I experimented when I was in college and I wonder if the medicine was the root cause. I was forced to take it at an early age of fifteen and put into hospitals against my will a few times. A couple times my parents exaggerated. But to me, it wasn't a mental illness, it was them disagreeing with me about my beliefs. I have over time tried to understand whether or not I know what is true. My label was changed from schizo to adhd to affective and now Bipolar1 and GAD. I'm not giving any substances like xanax or stimulants. He won't give me those but the other medicines are even more toxic. Like latuda etc. I have had so many allergic reactions trying new anti-psychotics. I had seizure or lesions when I withdrew a couple times from abilify. The dose was lowered a few months ago to 10mgs a day and since then I kind of slowly stopped taking it. Now there is nothing in my system. But I'm not having hallucinations or delusions at all. I still think a little eccentric, but more-so on Abilify because it repressed me. My emotions are still bad, like I am very apathetic. But im not hyper-emotional or cry as much. It's harder to cry. I feel kinda flat. I am having some trouble sleeping, but not all the time. I haven't been drinking much or even smoking much. I'm trying to see for myself the root source of cause of symptoms. Right now it feels like depression. I have bipolar because I can get really depressed and I guess over time that leads to mania or psychosis. But my behaviors are less risky and impulsive than before actually. On abilify and strattera they all made me manic and risky and impulsive more-so than before. Im sensitive. My vision is getting better too on abilify it's really blurry. I want to take abilify and sleep and be happy but i don't feel confident anymore that taking a medication will solve everything. I don't want to run away anymore, from who I am or what Im dealing with. I stopped having nightmares, sleep paralysis and dreams of being attacked, my dreams are very vivid on abilify and I Have lots of lucid and waking dreams. They are always happy. it scares me. I had to make a choice. my brother said at some point I was going to have to make a choice to either take medicine or not and be done with it. not go back and forth. So I feel like I made up my mind. But I don't know how to confront a psychiatrist, or father and the situation is so out of and controlled over me. I have no income, no resources outside my family and I want to stop taking medicine. My bf said I'm not as with it, or I seem out of it because I haven't been taking it. Abilify altered my personality. I don't want to go back. I get dysphoric and depressed. Abilify makes me suicidal just as much as all medicine because of my experiences with the system. Being restrained in the ER, wheeled into a hospital, overdosed on medicine that induced hallucinations and paranoia and recovering not from schizophrenia but a reaction to a schizophrenic diagnosis and medicine I was overdosed on for it like 6 different ones off and on at random times like a test subject in a rat trap scheme. I hate medicine. I hate psychiatry. I don't ever want to go back. I accept my destiny, the future, reality, and can think thoughts that aren't mainstream without hating myself.

I want to sleep and disappear into a happy dysphoric fog however I don't want to be dumb, have memory lapses, forget how to drive, feel extreme anxiety on abilify.

I can't trade myself for a happy pill to solve my problems. But am I being unrealistic. Is Bipolar even real? How can I believe that when they've been so careless and confusing and patronizing to me....I almost would rather end up where I promised myself I never would be, than to keep dreading the inevitable failure of science....and all this drama on tv makes me even more wanting to tune it out and not have my ears ring and my brain on high. I'm done with it. Im done with poisoning myself for them. I am not having the same symptoms that no one knows why i had them in the first place.

are there any other alternatives to help with sleep though. I want to take vitamins and anti-oxidents. Im getting healthier, losing weight and feeling happier but still not all there. Drinking milk more for vitamin D is good for depression. Prob why I started craving it. completely avoiding alcohol. I'm really trying to get better...."
2262,Bipolar? Or Gifted? – The Modern Day Epidemic Of Medicated “Madness” - RiseEarth
2263,"Bi-polar mom has complicated my life so much.  I dont know what to do anymore.

Here is the Backstory before I get to my question.  I am sorry if its too long, I am just in a bad situation, and I really need some advice from some people in my situation or who can relate.  please help!

I am 23, and I have been dealing with my mom having a mental illness on and off since I was a young child.  I remember the first time she was committed I was 5, and I think she was maybe 26 to 27.  She actually made somewhat of a recovery after that from what I can remember.  Although I definitely went through some serious traumatic experiences up until I was about 5 or 6 years old, my mom leveled out for almost 6 years in a row after that.

I actually was fortunate enough to remember my mom being a caring person. and a sweet person, who wanted the best for her kids...As I continue you will see why this completely rips me apart today.

So, to continue, when I was about 13 her parents started to pass from illnesses, and I think she was 31 or 32 at the time.  Then she started to slip. Finally when the last of her parents passed she went off the deep end.

She made my life from about 15 to now where I am 23 years old...hell.  She went to my school and work making accusations, and fortunately my father helped to protect me by getting restraining orders.  I moved out of the house, by my own choosing, and my brother who is a year younger refused to move in with my father (i think because he felt responsible for my mother).  In that time she did horrible things, went in and out of jail, and completely removed herself from her family because they were her ""adoptive"" parents.  She refuses to speak to her brother (My uncle) and refuses to have any connection with the family which I consider to be my mothers side.

I began to hate my mother after that, and all of the other horrible things that she did while I was in high school going to the office and accusing people horrible horrible things...  As you can assume...we did not speak for a very long time.  Then, about 2 years ago, I have struggled to rebuild my relationship with her.

Today I am at the point where I have accepted that she has an illness, and I have accepted that I wont likely have my mom back.  I have a lot of anger towards her, and I have accepted that and tried to tell her that as well.  However, every time our relationship seems manageable we have a falling out shortly after because she does innappropriate things, and accuses my family on my fathers side (which I am very close to) of ruining my and her relationship whenever I am mad at her.  She refuses to acknowledge my feelings and blames other people then sends me the emails that she sends to the police department and various other contacts about her nonsesical blabber.  Her illness has now grown like a tumor into a combination of bi-polar-schizophrenia- and a long list of other disorders I could easily associate with it.

I am completely tired of this.  I dont want to deal with this anymore, and I dont think I should have to.  However I dont know if this is the right thing to do, if she will hurt herself, and so forth.  She drives me nuts now.  If we are getting along she contacts me all the time, she refuses to listen to anything I have to say or how I feel, and she refuses to acknowledge me.  My conversations with her now completely revolve around her, and even her attitude.  When I try to accomodate her, she always makes me regret it.  I dont trust her anymore, and I dont think I ever will.  I see her as a shell of the person she once was, its like my mother died several years ago and is now just passing time on this earth as a peon doing what her mind tells her...this breaks my heart.

The part that makes this difficult is I can actually remember a time where her love for me and feelings for me felt normal, not forced, and it felt like a normal caring mother.  I know that as I child I was definitely not easy to raise, and those 6 years I have more respect for how my mother handled my anger and attitude problems with her illness (mind this is after she had recovered from the first melt-down and explained things to me as a child) than you could possibly imagine.  However today that puts me in a bind.

Lastly, my relationship with my brother has been terrible ever since I left the house and he stayed behind.  I love him very very much, but he has a lot of anger, and I get angry with him because he refuses to be respectful of my feelings.  He has detatched himself from our family in a lot of ways, and despite the fact that I have encouraged therapy for him he refuses.  I blame my mother for ruining my brothers and my relationship as well because he is not balanced now.  He has signs of what I would consider mild ocd, and self confidence/self-esteem issues.  We talk maybe 6 times a year, and are only a year apart in age.  We cant be together for more than a day without getting in some sort of fight.

What should I do?  Does anybody else know what this is like!  I miss my mom, I hate her sometimes to the extent where I wish she would just disappear...(that makes me feel aweful inside). I think about it at least 2 to 3 times a day when we are not talking like right now.  the last thing I told her was that she was entitled to her thoughts and opinions but that it was my choice whether or not I wanted to talk to her, and that I didnt agree with her and I was the one who had to initiate communication and that if she refused to acknowledge that I would cut her off completely...(I said this because I see her relationship with me as a priviledge at this point, which most times she does not respect)she seems to be respecting that so far since I said that but it has only been a few days and now im nervous all the time....Anybody who has to go through this kind of experience deserves an award for some sort of divine patience that they acquire.

I hope my venting made sense....I hope this forum helps."

2267,"Hi,

I have cyclothymia with borderline traces, but no one's sure yet.
I'm on 800mg carbamazepine and 10mg paroxetine (a upper that also helps anxiety)
I'll talk to my psychiatrist soon about being put back on an antipsychotic as it helps with anxiety, angry thoughts, rumination, and sleeping.
So far I've used:
amisulpride/soltian - low 25mg dose that took the peak away but added some weight
olanzapine/zyprexa - 5mg was enough to increase appetite and gain weight
quetiapine/seroquel - a 50mg dose knocked me out!

What are your experiences and which one (if any?!) helped you out the most?

Thanks"
2268,"Wouldn't you know it...my 10 year term life insurance expired in spring so we began the process of reapplying etc...just a couple of months after ""major depression with psychotic features"" and ""most likely bipolar"" were added to my doctors' charts.

So now I am 36 years old with 4 kids and no life insurance. Sure I don't make money anyway so there would be no loss of income from ME but if I passed my husband would need money for private school (we currently homeschool and public school isn't an option), childcare, funeral costs, therapy for him and kids and on & on. 

I am not talking suicide here I am talking a freak accident happens and he is screwed. i am not suicidal. The timing of all of this sucks! If my insurance had expired a year ago we would be fine right now.

They told us we can reapply in 2 years and I can keep my old policy with the old company b/c that won't require a physical BUT the rates are not attainable for us.

SO MAD AT THIS JOURNEY that I have been on this past year. grrrr

thanks for letting me vent. (I am in Canada in case anyone has advice)"
2269,"Hi Everyone, hope this finds you well. I am new here so wanted to say hello. Also, as my title suggest, I wonder if anyone is experiencing treatment resistance and how they cope with it. Forgive me if there is a thread about it already.. I have been struggling with severe treatment resistant Bipolar depression ( Ive got Bipolar 1 with rapid cycling) , after trying loads of meds, nothing works and my pdocs give up or dont believe its possible not to respond to meds.. Manias under control as on quetiapine. But nothing helps with depression relapses although on Quetiapine, lamotrigine and Buprioprion. This leaves me totally on my own at the time when I would need the most help. Anyone went or going through anything similar? Would be good to hear your comments.
Thanks for reading."
2270,"I have been reffered to OPTIMA service part of SLAM does anyone have any experience or opinions of this?


The OPTIMA Mood Disorders Service is an intensive day programme for people of working age with bipolar disorder.  The core programme, designed to consolidate recovery, can last up to three months and consists of specialist nursing, occupational therapy, vocational assessment and psychiatric reviews.

The second phase of treatment, due to open later in the year, will be for people who have recovered, but wish to reflect on their experiences through group psychoeducation and couple therapy.


My main concern is the following:  Is this a private company outsourced by the NHS and if so how safe is my data. Is this going to help me in dealing with episodes (my previous experience of group work has been very destructive). and on a bigger question can psychoeducation really help us?  I think to be aware of our “condition” and try to accommodate this within our everyday lives is a good thing but many of us are aware of this however it’s our friends, family etc that need this education."

2272,"Hi,

I'm new here, this is my first post on this forum so Im a bit nervous. 

I'm wondering if I'm bipolar maybe? I know I can't expect a diagnoses off here or anything and I don't want to self diagnose, but I'm just looking for other opinions really, I've asked a lot of people including specialists and they've all said it's a possiblitity but it's never gone further than that. 
Ill just explain some reasons why I think I may be bipolar. 

My whole life I've struggled with a sense of who I am, and I've never felt adequate, I've always struggled with anxiety and bouts of depression, even at 4 years old I was having panic attacks, suffering with insomnia, showing signs of self harm and feeling very low a lot of the time. As I've gotten older my issues have only gotten worse, I now very much disassociate myself with my own personality and I will constantly forget that my mind and my body are part of the same thing, I get palpatations a lot, anxiety attacks, I have sleepless nights at least once or twice a week, and when I do sleep I wake up very early and I never dream or even feel refreshed when I wake up, its more like I shut down rather than sleep. I have weeks on end where I feel hopeless and struggle to find a point in anything and then I'll suddenly feel fine and forget why I got so desperate, I'll feel like the world is on the tip of my fingers and I can do anything and I'll beat myself up for being so silly previously, which just ends up making me feel worse when I feel low again. 
I push my friends away and then try desperatly to get them as close to me as I can, I constantly think they all look down on me, I'm their least favourite friend and their secretly plotting against me, they're not really my friend they just stick with me to make fun of me when I'm not around. I will idolise my dad, who I love to bits and suffers from very similar symptoms to me but I struggle with so much contempt that I have for him due to him causing me problems growing up (due to his own issues ofc, he's a good dad) 

My life is basically black and white, I never get a neutral feeling I either feeling nothing or too much, either suicidal or on top of the world, as if every one hates me or as if I'm a goddess amongst men. This constant contradtiction of feelings and thoughts makes me struggle with my day to day life. I've been to GPs, therapists and psychs and none of them have given me enough for a diagnoses or have ever gone forward with anything other than treating my anxiety, which wont get better until I face all the other issues I have and I don't feel I can face these issues without knowing why I struggle with them.

Any advice would be really appreciated, I am very much looking for another persons opinion on whether or not it is bipolar, something else or just a difficulty fitting in or something, but I appreciate any replies. 

Thanks"
2273,"Hi

My name is Catherine and i am new to this forum. I am hoping to discuss symptoms and treatment with other sufferers. I am taking Lamotrigine at the moment but it is not working as well as i would like. None of my previous prescriptions have eradicated symptoms which i was hoping for, foolishly perhaps. 

I am out of work and honestly could not manage it. I had a miscarriage last year and felt relief as i know that i cannot take care of myself, never mind a baby. I am confused by the fact that some people are able to work and look after children but i am not. I have slept most of the day today, just like that past 6 or 7. I am exhausted and trying my best not to get back under the duvet. I am nowhere near as ill as i have been so i know that my prescription is essential, but i am living a poor quality of life.

It is hard when i read about the pressure on me to return to work because i then am unsure what i should be doing that i am not. Even if i take more or different medication, there are other reasons why i cannot function fully like drowsiness, agitation, anxiety or lack of motivation. 

I don't know what to do for the best so i chose last year that i would live my life day to day and not worry about anything else. The problem with that is that i am possibly wasting my life by not having higher expectations, but is there any point in setting myself goals that i may never achieve? I could take Olanzapine with Fluoxetine again, which made me feel the best i ever have, but then be seriously overweight and at risk of other health problems. 

I have settled into a life of doing what i feel i need to do and can do and what makes me happy. This is what i am sticking with for now but it would be nice to hear your stories and experiences and if you set yourself high goals despite depression.

2275,"Hi guys,

I am new to this forum and I am happy that I joined. I want to share something with you, but I am not entirely sure how to phrase it. 

I have been recently diagnosed with Bipolar II though my psychiatrist said that it may also be a personality disorder. I did a test for personality disorders and I got high scores for 2, namely BPD and OCPD. I don't think that I really fit into these disorders though, so I am still confused as to what exactly I have. 

What I want to talk about are 2 main fixations that I have. I obsess about these things when I am in my down phase. Then I can't stop thinking about them. These things are 1)  the person that I am in love with and 2) my condition. I will explain in more details.

Since the age of 18, I get obsessed with the people I fall for. I have to specify that I never had a relationship with any of my obsessions although we were friends and we communicated on a regular basis. The guys liked me, but I was looking for something serious and they were not. As my obsession was growing stronger, I would push them away. Most of all, I would suffer a lot because my behavior was bringing me great distress. I am still obsessed about a guy who I met almost 2 years ago. I went through the worst break down that I have ever experienced. I have always been very melancholic and I have had suicidal thoughts before, but as my obsession was growing, my suicidal tendencies increased a lot and I even tried to kill myself 2 times. I have never been that bad before. My main concern is that I really don't know why I obsess so much and the painful part was and still is that I can't control and divert my thoughts. The obsession pops up when I feel especially bad and I can't seem to stop thinking about this. The relationship with this guy became really bad as I shared my suicidal feelings with him and he even blocked me from Facebook (I know that this shouldn't be a big deal, but in my mind it's still a huge deal). 
My second obsession is about my condition. When I feel bad, I start obsessing about my mental health and I try to find the reason why I have a mental health problem in the first place. I read about different diagnoses and I try to find symptoms that match my own. I have gone through many conditions. I am especially looking for answers to the question why I obsess so much with guys, which triggers more obsessive thinking. 
I am sorry for the long message! These things have been bothering me for a long time and I feel a lot of pain because my last relationship with the person that fell in love with ended on such bad and dramatic terms. Now I am afraid to start dating again because I don't want to obsess over another guy and end up in a huge psychological hole. 

Thanks for your time and input!"
2276,"How long can someone stay hypomanic ?. 
I've been hypomanic most days for about 4 months and been feeling pretty good. 

Seeing my pdoc next month and worried that he will give me something to bring my mood down to its normal level which is normally flat. 

Don't really want to take anything as I'm more confident got more energy and generally feel best I've felt in years. But saying that I don't want to go high so is it possible to be hypomanic long term with out going high.

I am on a depot which is what I think is stopping me from going full blown manic.

Would like to hear Any advice and experiences.

2279,I have a 13 year old son that cant seem to be diagnosed and are totally at our wits end. Not only that his life is miserable do to the fact we cant get him help. He is a mentally challenged kid and he has what we call episodes about every two weeks. he starts to throw up over and over. He turns mean and aggressive. He continues to gorge on drink just to throw up. You look in his eyes and he is not there. He has attacked everyone in the family. He picks at his figures and cant hold his head up. when he throws up its dark yellow which we now is the bile. These episodes last about a weak and are progressively getting longer. We tried different mental hospitals bur since he cant go to group therapy do to his inability to communicate at a level of a 13 year old we are turned away. He is actually a sweet kid and we are afraid we will eventually lose him. Any advice or help is really needed. Thanks
2280,"Hey everyone, 

So as you know, I am currently hypomanic, but that can be disputed because I hear voices sometimes. 

I'm reaching my limit. I am not sleeping well and I hear voices. I'm seeing my GP on Tuesday but there is nothing she can do without the guidance of a psychiatrist. I'm seeing an NHS psychiatrist mid August, however he disagrees with my bipolar diagnosis because I was diagnosed at a private hospital.

Something else that is bothering me is that my speech has deteriorated. Most likely due to my muscle disease. Still waiting for biopsy results. 
But again, nothing can be done. And I think the scare factor has now hit me because I can't talk the way I use to. I feel dumb when I talk and I can't pronounce words sometimes. But I'm aware of what I want to say. 
 
I feel so angry. I feel so angry at the NHS psychiatrist and I know I'm going to kick off.
But I feel restless, I'm not sleeping. I have 101 different ideas going through my head. Plus I'm concerned for my physical health. 
In addition, it has gotten out to my mentally ill mum via the NHS mental health service that I'm under, about the sexual assault I endured when I was 18. So it has fed into my mum's paranoia and unstable mind set. There was no reason for that information to be shared. It was irrelevant and I'd rather not make my mum's delusions and paranoia worst. 

 I feel so out of my depths at the moment."
2281,I have been suffering with symptoms linked with bipolar for a few years now but only starting seeking help this year. I started by seeing my GP and she told me she definitely thinks I have bipolar but can't give me a full diagnosis without being seen by a mental health specialist. I was referred and seen by the mental health nurse about a month later but she didn't tell me what she thought it could be. I got for regular follow up appointments with both my GP and my mental health nurse but my GP told me it could take anything from 5 to 10 years to get a diagnosis for bipolar. How long did it take any of you to be diagnosed with bipolar? Because I currently feel like giving up. I've been given sertraline then moved to citalopram to help with my manic phases but nothing seems to be working. I was also prescribed sleeping tablets because I can't sleep due to my manic episodes. Can anyone give me any tips or information on their own experiences?

I can be firm and confident at times but with such a stressful assessment and me being worried about the whole thing I don't think I'll be able to put my concerns and wishes across properly.

2288,"What specialty/skills should a psychologist have for this personal problem i have below...

I'm a dark skin male and have this insane anger problem and resentment towards fair skin girls because i believe majority of them are racist and have no interest in dating me because of my skin color. When i see girls that are strangers in public i have intense anger episodes/blackouts that make me want to hurt them physically. This belief came from the many racist things i experience from fair skin girls (white/latin/asians) while comprehensively trying offline and online dating. I created an online dating profile of a black and white guy of equal attraction but the white guy got much better responses. Also i found alot of statistical case studies done online/offline that showed black guys were in bottom in the dating world. 

Please i don't want to argue or make debate over if these girls are racist or not since i've already had this debate many times with many other people and only made me more frustrated. I just want to know what type of psychologist is best to treat this problem and what should their specialties/skills be."
2289,"I thought I was misdiagnosed. Now I am not so sure. Advice or thoughts please?

I hope this is okay to post. I just joined and this is my first post. I never thought I would be here but at this moment, I feel lost and need some advice.

I was diagnosed as bi-polar II fifteen years ago. After years of hating the fact that I would never be able to live normally without taking medication, the unthinkable happened. I lost my job and the insurance that when along with. This was in 2011. I braced myself for the worst... I was waiting for that ugly monster to rear it's head and throw me back into the chaos that was my mind when I was a teenager, but it never happened. Do not get my wrong, I have my struggles. For a little back history, I am also diagnosed as ADHD and OCD and have eating issues and a history of self harm. But the crazy whirl wind that I was so familiar with of falling into a manic episode and feeling so completely out of control never happened. A couple years passed and I went on, completely medication free and I became angry because I felt like I had been lied too. That I had to accept that my life would never be medication free without consequences, and that I accepted it all for nothing. I summed it up as I was just a very passionate person in those years, who could not control the intense emotions. I do get very angry and that feeling of wanting to explode still happens, but I can control it now. It has now been 5 and a half years, when suddenly I just felt a twinge of what it used to feel like. I had an idea of what I wanted to do this afternoon, and my husband had his idea. I felt like nothing I said mattered, that he didn't care what I thought and I felt hopeless. I could not explain why I felt so stressed out, so angry, so anxious... I had no valid reason to back my emotions. He was getting frustrated trying to talk things out with me and this only further upset me. It ended with me sobbing in the kitchen and him hugging me but looking at me like I have five heads. I wanted to throw the coffee maker, I wanted to scream, I wanted to punch a hole in the wall... and POOF just like that I came out of it. I was still crying but I no longer felt like it made sense. It felt ridiculous. It was like I just suddenly snapped out of whatever I was in and I was embarrassed for my behavior. It felt all too familiar. Was I actually bi-polar and it just lay dormant for 5.5 years?! Then as this is all spinning in my head I eat two hot dogs, a piece of apple pie and pound a beer. Then my old eating issues start bubbling to the surface. I literally said ""get a hold of yourself, snap out of it"" to myself standing in the kitchen staring at the fridge and sat down and came here. I am at a total loss. Am I relapsing into what I thought I had overcome? My son is 1.5 and I am still breastfeeding, is it just hormones? Can having a baby and starting to wean make a seemingly dormant mental health issues come back? To be completely honest, this absolutely terrifies me and I'm not sure what to do. Has anyone else ever experienced anything at all like this? :scared:"

2291,"I suffer from Type 2 Bipolar Disorder. Although I have never been formally diagnosed for fear of stigmatization, I have been able to research and understand that that is my condition. 

When I suffer from manic depression, I hear voices telling me to commit suicide. Sometimes I get specific instructions on how to die. I deal with it through crying, hitting things (bed, sofa, etc) or tearing cloth. I used to harm myself but I no longer do that. 

The things I do not get are these - I am able to either reason with others or 'pause' my depression if there is urgent work to be done. So, two things: 1) I can be logical during depression and 2) because I can be logical and responsible, I will get what I need to do at the moment of depression done.

Distraction works on me but I think I need to first be ""willing to be distracted."" When I am unwilling, I continue to be depressed.

2292,"I feel powerless to my manic-depressive illness. Some people seem to wanna be with me as they find it fun to be around a manic person. But I suffer while in mania and I do things that I later regret.

It all started in mid school-years when they labeled me borderlinic with poor impulse control. Only a few months later they realised the clinical picture reminded of manic depression. So they asked some questions and came back telling me I have manic depression. I did not believe them in the beginning but they kind of forced me to take Litihum and Seroquel and other medicines too.

Now I accept my diagnosis of Bipolar 2½. I abuse nicotine and drugs and have lost many friends because of it. Especially meth is something that people have a problem, but I do what I have to do to not die. The alternative is worse."

I'm getting annoyed with anyone and everyone. 
The other day I broke the living room door due to aggression. 

I don't know where to go. 
My GP won't prescribe me meds without guidance from a psychiatrist. The NHS psychiatrist doesn't believe I have bipolar disorder and the private psychiatrist who diagnosed me, I need to wait a week on Tuesday to get £120 to see him.
But in the mean time, I'm deteriorating. 

I had a GP appointment when I first began experiencing a hypomanic episode 3 weeks ago and although there is nothing my GP can do to treat me, she said that if it gets worst, she'll get me in for an assessment. 
So I'm going to try getting an urgent GP appointment.

2299,"Hello all.  Very long time since I have been here.  Now retired from work.  Current stated diagnoses Recurrent Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD (with Bipolar threatening to be diagnosed if you understand).  When last around was struggling with alcohol.  The struggle continued.  Presently abstinent for almost 8 months and no desire to use.  Was in hospital for 3 weeks before Christmas and not touched it since.  Now on a Mood stabiliser (Topirimate) which also handily treats alcohol dependence and Amisulpride (anti-psychotic) for the depression.  Getting a really good dual-diagnosis approach and see a CPN every 3rd week.  Being a good girl - for once,  Taking all medication as prescribed.  But the thing is my mood is still confusing me.  About 10 days ago I felt I was in danger of running into problems with not sleeping again and getting a bit too bubbly/over-talkative etc.  Now I am finding myself crying, feeling low, thinking it is too difficult living, wanting to go back to my bed - just not bother (but I am making an effort).  Such an uncomfortable state to be in.  In think this is just my mental state and not a 'hangover' from my drinking days.  People's thoughts would be helpful.  Not so stable on a mood stabiliser!"
2300,"Hey there. I've just joined this forum as I looking to find out more about Venlafaxine. 
I've been taking it everyday (twice a day) for about 2 years now. 
I've had depression and low since the age of 13 and am now 24. 
I was diagnosed in 2014 with cyclothymia. 
After being on this medication for a while I have spoke side effects and I just wanted to see if it effects others in the same way. I'm having trouble working out if it's because of the medication or if it's just the way I am.
1. TIREDNESS  - I am ALWAYS tired! If I do one activity such as go shopping or meet a friend for a coffee, I feel like I need to sleep straight after. I have been to the doctor about this on a number of occasions and had my bloods tested. But they are all fine. I could just sleep my life away. I hate coming across as lazy!
2. URTICARIA/ HIVES - this is something I have never had issues with before. It seems like my skin has become really sensitive. I regularly get an itchy rash. I become very irritated and am put off going into the sun. 
3. SENSITIVE TO HEAT - I used to be a sun worshiper. However since taking these tablets I'd rather always be in the shade. Does Venlafaxine make you sensitive to heat?
4. RESTLESS LEGS - I lay there at night and I get this awful feeling in my legs. They are sometimes painful and cramp up. 
5. HEADACHES- I get headaches up to 3 times a week. 
6. WEIGHT GAIN - I was a size 10 before taking the medication and I'm now a size 14. I have gained over two stone. This makes me unhappy as I have issues with self confidence and low self esteem. But I'm sure this medication is what's doing it. This is the biggest I have been. 

If anyone else is taking Venlafaxine, would you be able to tell me if you get these symptoms too? I would be very grateful!! :)"
2301,"after having a couple of weeks of feeling hypomanic one hour and down the next and then irritated and on and on. I had 6 good days. I thought my meds were starting to regulate me. 

I have been on 300mg of Wellbutrin for 5 weeks and I have been at 300mg of quetiapine for 3 weeks. 

But now I am depressed again. And this will be the 3rd day. 

Are my meds not working or do they need more time. I know they say meds need 6 to 8 weeks to really get into your system and to work but after having 6 days when I didn't feel hypomanic or depressed I sort of thought the meds had kicked in. 

Now I feel defeated and discouraged. 

Maybe the 6 days were more hypomanic than i realized. I did get a lot done but i didn't have racing thoughts, I didn't overdo it, I was probably more up than most people but I have never experienced life without feeling more up than most people (except when I am depressed of course). 

I don't know what normal is. I am so sad that maybe my meds aren't working and I have to start all over again. I saw my psychiatrist and counselor on the 6th good day and they seemed  happy with how I was doing.

I feel 'ugh'"
2302,"I am new to this site so not sure where exactly to start. I was recently diagnosed bipolar and manic depressive. I am a 35 year old female married with four kids. I have been depressed and exhibiting bipolar symptoms for some time that got missed. This past year it got bad, I began drinking and doing drugs to try to escape and when that didn't help I engaged in an affair. This of course sent my depression into overdrive and I attempted to take my life. I was hospitalized for a week and eventually got the diagnosis I have today. I did good for a bit but because I felt good I stopped taking my meds. This lead to another, even worse episode, massive drinking, blackouts, random sexting, just all around horrible. I went back into the hospital, back onto my meds, I quit drinking and while it's a struggle I am doing better and I know I'm on the right path. My husband had decided to stay with me for now. I am only five days sober and compliant with medication and he now feels the need to test my strength by telling me how awful I am to see how I will react. I know I have done horrible things but I just don't feel like now is the time to test my resolve. I have explained this to him but due to the fact I deserve what is dished out, it continues. What do I do? Is this something I just need to deal with now."
2303,"Hello All,

It's been a long while and it's a shame that it's nothing happy that has brought me back to this forum. I really need a bit of support.

I have spent the past 1 & 1/2 years medication free! Living a productive and healthy lifestyle, re-building socials, building my career & travelling etc.

Only then to be hit with a destructive hypomanic episode for the past 3 weeks which ended in overdose on Friday. The noise in my head was becoming unbearable. 

This is the 2nd time I've had a hypomanic episode (1st time was years ago and I was in hospital high for 3 months and it was turning into full on mania).

I feel exhausted and very emotional, thinking about all of the signs I missed and the fool I have made of myself. Tell my work I would quit, booking an appointment to cut of my hair and dye it green, going out on my own and joining people's parities that I do not even know! I slept with randoms and unprotected, I just feel so ashamed.

I am not sure how to re-live life at this moment, I feel this illness will never leave me and I do not want to get close to anyone. How can I build relationships with people? How can I consider having a stable career? How can I have children? I have so many questions and feel so lost.

Please help. I really need others experiences and advise, I feel so alone."

Its been hard to deal with to be honest.
Its bought up lots of memories i didnt realise I had. Shes my dads (who is also dead) sisters daughter. She and her brother lost both thier mum and dad when they were young.
Both my cousins had no partner or children. It feels like so many of my relatives are gone. My mother fucking sucks shes a nasty self centered bitch. I cant explain it all. 
But when i took the overdose the hospital put me in an icu bed when they actually had someone else who needed that bed. Makes me feel so sick

2306,"I've been dating an amazing man with cyclothymia. He is not currently taking any medications for this, as we just learned of his diagnosis. He seemed amenable to doing the work to feel better. We have a really intimate and close relationship. I am almost 45 years old (he is 53) and I've had several long-term relationships with great men, but this is the first time I have actually considered planning a future with someone. He is my soulmate.  He has not had a partner of any kind (beyond casual sex) in over 12 years and he has been adamant about wanting to spend the rest of his life with me.

My story is below, but in case it's too long a read, my question is this (and perhaps those with cyclothymia can chime in): When your partner with cyclothymia has rages and says it's over, is it better to give him space and time to reach out to you or should you reach out to them to let them know you want to support them? After the rages, he is never the first to reach out to me, but when we do connect, he admits he is so remorseful, embarrassed and ashamed. He ALWAYS wants me by his side during his depressive states...this I do know.  There seems to be differing opinions out there. If you read my story, you'll see that historically, my partner does respond to me after a couple of days...but our last bout was especially extreme so I don't know how to best handle it. Of note, he also has serious insecurities about us and abandonment issues.  I don't want to lose him. I at least want to give it a chance since he is open to treatment and therapy.

We have had issues in the past involving his extreme rage and outbursts that were far disproportionate to the issue at hand. In the past, he would rage and say awful, hurtful things to me and then stop responding to my attempts (via texting and calling) to work things out. After a day or so, I'd call again and he'd respond. We'd meet up and he'd eventually get really emotional and cry and express his remorse. He told me he didn't know who that person is and it's as if he's possessed. He told me when he gets like that, to just wait for it to pass.

More recently, there was an episode like I'd never seen. He had been in a depressive state and felt he was coming out of it, but I wasn't convinced. We were getting along fine and I started talking to him about some concerns in our relationship. He was receptive and sweet and understanding. Then, the next morning, when it came up again, he was fine until suddenly he goes, ""I can't talk about this anymore"" and gets up and starts spastically doing chores. I try to talk him down, but then he leaves the apartment. In the past, I would make a couple attempts to talk, but then leave. This time, I decided to stay with him, because he had told me when he gets like that to let it pass (I now realize he maybe didn't mean literally staying by his side). He kept yelling horrible, threatening things to me the whole time, telling me to go away. 

When we made it make to his house, he slammed the door in my face and so I went to leave. The next thing I know, he's back and lets me in...so I assume he is calming down and wants me there. But he claimed that wasn't the case. He said not to talk to him while he slept. I sat there with him for a couple hours and would try to touch him and he'd lose it on me and tell me to go away. He also raged that it was over and that he never loved me. I eventually came to my senses and left.

Here's the thing. Historically, I am always the one who reaches out and he is eventually responsive, but it's usually because the fight happened by phone and it didn't escalate. A couple days after the incident, I sent an email saying that I was foremost his friend and he can reach out whenever he wants. It's been less than 48 hours since the incident and less than 12 hours since I wrote to him, but I am not doing well. Each time this happens, we agree that we shouldn't go a night without resolution, yet here we are. Since learning of his diagnosis, it makes more sense to me that he doesn't yet have the tools to stick to that agreement.  Advice anyone?"
2307,"So I was pretty much told by my husband that I was fat last night. So today I feel unmotivated  self conscious and, depressed. I know I'm not in the best shape but I felt like he could've spoken to me better than he did. I felt like he was treating me like a child the whole time trying to get me motivated to exercise.

2308,"Hi
I was wondering people opinions of if my symptoms are consistent to bipolar. My dad, his dad and his sister have bipolar so I know it is more likely that I will have it because of genetics. I am undiagnosed at the moment, have never been to the doctors about it. I've been suffering for well over 5 years, mainly due to the fact I have two kids and was so concerned about doctors judging me and getting involved in regards to them but now I've realised I can't keep on the way I am as it will just make things worse in the long run. 

I won't go in to much detail as don't want to make this overly long.

I am either up or down. When I am feeling depressed I will lie in bed, cry for no apparent reason, send the kids to my mums as I lack being able to do anything. 

When I'm high I will stay up all night doing irrelevant things. I will feel stupidly happy for no reason, talk fast and want to go out and have fun. My moods change from low to high in a flash. In these periods I also have begged recklessley such as one night stands and spending lots of money on things I do not need. I can literally feel depressed and down one minute then the next I will just get an overwhelming sense of happiness. 

I find it hard to express emotions for people I love on most occasions. I feel awful saying it but of course I love my kids but 70% of the time, when I am with them I just feel irritated and bored and like they do not interest me. But 30% of the time I will feel such an overwhelming desire to just hug and be with them and I get very emotional about them. 

Apart from these main factors, I am very irritable, caged in and emotionless. For example if some one tries to talk to me about how I act and how I could have a problem I tell them I'm fine and laugh at them then I will go and cry to myself, I am not open with anyone and feel I can not be unless it's people that do not know me as on here. 

It's horrible as im already on a final warning from work due to taking off too many days, due mainly to this. The job I have worked so hard for and I rely on to get my kids everything they want and I would have nothing without it. Therefore I now know I have to go to the doctors and get a diagnosis so I can better my life and take the time out I need to recover with a sick note. I'm just wondering if it's probably due to bipolar and if the fact that it's in the family already makes any difference to my chances of having it."
2309,"*TRIGGER WARNING* 
*EXPLICIT DISTURBING CONTENT BELOW*

Hi there, 
I'm not sure how to keep this reply coherent but I'm in dire need of help.

Before getting into the details, I have been professionally diagnosed with both Bipolar II and Severe Depression. There have been a few breakdowns and some voices have been heard periodically. For a long time I've been having intrusive thoughts about many things, mostly doing with the past. But as of late, after a certain event, I've been having constant intrusive thoughts about something incredibly sick and disturbing. 
 
This event was a few months ago, which had occurred during a visit at a family friend's house. It was my sister, her best friend, best friend's mother, brother and his wife, and their small daughter. It was a nice visit, we were having fun, and eventually, the daughter needed changing. She was changed, but the thing about it, it's the thing that caused me all the grief and despair I feel now. I... Just watched her be changed. That's all. And immediately, IMMEDIATELY, I begun to have horrible sick and disturbing thoughts about her, all sexual in nature. Ever since, these thoughts have been intrusive and disturbing in nature, my mood immediately drops like a rock when they rear their ugly head. They'll even come out of random, completely untriggered. I don't know what to do, and I'm terrified of what I may be or may become.

I have never ever harmed anyone in a sexual nature, Hell, as an asexual, I have never even pleasured myself before. Sex is such a foreign thing to me, and for this to be happening, I have no idea what I'm feeling, mentally or physically. I've thought of OCD being a cause, but I just don't know. 

Okay, I'm sorry to make this about me so much, but this is becoming worst and worst as time passes on. I know these thoughts are horrible, disturbing, and sick in every way, but it's so hard to get them out of my head. Since having these thoughts, I've been questioning myself if I may actually be a true pedophile. And when I think I'm not, I always second-guess myself. Like, I wonder how many real pedophiles have felt the way I do now? How many have tried what I'm doing and have ultimately failed? What if these never ever go away? What if my loved ones found out? What if ANYBODY found out? 

I don't want to be a pedophile, I'm absolutely terrified of the thought of being one or becoming one, these thoughts have left me in tears and sobs on several occasions. I feel like such a horrible, disgusting piece of garbage about all this, I can't believe it. It's even been driving me to suicide more than anything, as something that also constantly bothers me. As for the thoughts, when I think of them, I quickly try and morph it into a more acceptable sexual act, but it's hard as a sex-repulsed asexual. I've also gotten the idea of conditioning myself to not think about these things,  But I don't know, should I do that? I'm scared, I really have no one else to talk about with this, not even a therapist, it's too expensive right now.

Please please help me, if I can't rid myself of these thoughts, I can't promise to live to 25.

I'm so sorry if this has been an ordeal or a bother to you, but at the very least I am extremely grateful that you've read this far. Please don't judge me too harshly, I do NOT want to be a pedophile at all. Anything you can offer will be so appreciated, you won't even know. And also, if this is in the wrong thread, I am very sorry for that and anything I've done thus far."
2310,"I was wondering if I could have some feedback on my visit with my psychiatrist today ?? I went thinking we'd discuss getting off the lithium carbonate and getting onto the lithium orotate. But she said you don't know who is manufacturing the orotate, buying it off the internet, it could be from India and not even contain what it says it is. She said I could cut the carbonate in half and see if the GI problems stop; plus see if my moods are okay at 300mg.  She also said I could get on abilify instead. I told her I needed some time to think about it. Abilify can give you diabetes. I told her I may be getting a minor surgery done to my back and I can't do that and play with meds at the same time. She said we should get together after the surgery and decide what to do.

Jumping into Abilify is assuming I am going to have extreme mood disorder. I think I'd like to see what happens lowering the lithium dose from 600mg to 300mg. It would entail about three days not sleeping. ""sigh"" She said I was talking myself into it but I know perfectly well what causes me insomnia. She's very sincere and maintains eye contact. She actually jokes a lot and is silly. But she said I can't go on with this GI problems from the lithium which she took rather seriously.

I would be interested in hearing from anyone on Abilify ?? 

There's this whole psychiatric idea that more drugs is better and she said maybe if I quit the lithium I could take more of the navane I am on. But more than 2mg of navane gives me a monster headache. 

It's very disconcerting discussing DRUGS."
2311,"I have read both that it does get worse and that it doesn't get worse with age on the beloved world wide web

What has been your experience? Has your bipolar got worse as you aged? Were you consistently on medication and yet is still got worse? Bipolar 1 or Bipolar 2? 

I sort of freaked out when I read that it gets worse with age. i am still trying to wrap my head around that pdoc thinks I am bipolar 2."

2313,"Hi. I've smoke weed off and on for several years and I just recently quit. Hoping that's the problem but anyways let's see...
Even when I'm not smoking I feel like people can read some of my thoughts. This causes me to automatically think bad thoughts about them for some reason. In so many cases afterwards, this person will start talking trash in an indirect way. For example, he or she could be talking with friends, but in an indirect and clever way talk about me and try to make a joke or be rude. Sometimes it may be ideas of reference but other times it's so obvious and other people look at me like aren't u gonna make a comment back. But since its not directly made to me I ignore it. It's still annoying though.
Also, I feel like everyone or a lot of people are against me. I've always been cool with people but in the last two years I've been having this problem where people look and smile about something. Since it happened so often whenever I go out I feel like someone will talk trash in the indirect way I was talking about and I feel uneasy. Anyone else have this problem. I've had manic episodes and depressions but this is something totally different and ongoing. Any help is appreciated."

2315,"I've been diagnosed with hypothyroidism and a number of mental health problems including a mood disorder. I'm taking Levothyroxine 75 mg, and when I first went on it I was fine, but now I'm having issues, but I haven't gotten any answers.

I'm taking Depakote, 500 mg
Gabapentin 800 mg
Effexor 37.5
Valium 5 mg
Topamax 250 mg
Ambien CR 6.5

On saturday I took my Ambien and I felt a little bit of a racing heart but it went away within a few minutes. Then tuesday I took one and I had a really bad racing heart and went to the emergency room. They gave me propanolol 20 mg and it went away but I'm not going to take the Ambien anymore for now.

Yesterday I took my normal dose of 3x 800 mg Gabapentin for sleep and I got this really weird feeling, like dizzy and my feet and hands felt really cold. Then about an hour later my heart started racing, and I drove to the emergency room but I had taken my propanolol and by the time I got a room the racing heart was gone. They checked my EKG and blood pressure and they did blood tests, checked for drug interactions and couldn't find anything.

They told me both times though that my thyroid was low, and to not stop taking my Levothyroxine. But I've only been taking it for a few weeks, if that(I took a break for a couple months) and now all the sudden I'm having all these problems with medications I've been taking for years. I just took only one half of my 800 mg Gabapentin, because they told me at the hospital they didn't think it was my medications, and the propanolol has been bringing down the tachycardia. I have a cardiologist appt on Monday but I'm just wondering if this could be the thyroid medication? I know it takes a bit of time to work, but it can cause problems if it's too much. I've never had problems with my heart like this, or really strong reactions to my medications. Anyone had any problems with racing heart and these medications in general or with Levothyroxine, or know if they can cause interactions? I know adderall can. I know I have to find out Monday what I can but any tips would be much appreciated."
2316,"I am on meds 300mg and 300 wellbutrin. I think they are starting to help. I have more up days than down and when i am down it doesn't last for a whole day. My counselor sucks. But now that the meds seem to be helping will talk therapy even benefit me?

I have an appointment booked Tuesday with a new counselor. But there is no one situation that kicked off all this. I am not even 100% I am bipolar 2 or NOS. 

when I was younger and saw a counselor (two different times) it was more situational depression that worked itself into a major depression. I had things to talk out....abuse, ptsd from another event. 

This time I don't have anything specific to talk about. And I present well even when I am suicidal and am feeling a bit better so will present even better. 

Talk therapy and bipolar...is it helpful or do I just stick to the drugs and be glad that I am feeling a bit better?"
2317,"Hi.

I have cyclothymia with borderline traces, but no one's sure yet! 

They say it can take months for a mood stabilizer to kick in properly! Is that so? I know we're all different but what's your experience? 
I surely haven't been too stable with carbamazepine so far, but I only started it 3 weeks ago and have been on 800 mg stabilizer dosage for 7 days!

I'm also on 5mg Olanzapine at night. I started it one week ago and it feels better now, with less grogginess in the morning. And it helps with carbamazepine which on its own was making me somewhat more hyper, anxious, with less sleep. 
Valproate made too depressed and lithium was not an option due to all the side effects and complications.
Thanks"

2320,"Hey all,


I have been diagnozed with depression for around 7 years. However, I have always suspected there was more to it than that. I get periods where I am incredibly impulsive. For example, I decided on impulse the other day to embark upon a drawing course. I bought all the resources and set up an area in my flat to do this. A few weeks later and I haven't touched it all since that first day. Other examples are subscribing to music channels or monthly food plans. All for quite alot of money. I also gamble and drink excessively. 

I don't know if this behaviour constitutes mania.. but I feel like something is not normal about this.."
2321,"Hello. I'm new to this forum. I look forward to participating when I can.  I've seen a lot of comments elsewhere in the net from people who have clumsiness with bipolar disorder. Some think it's just part of being bipolar.  Anything here want to discuss this? I never used to be clumsy.  I was highly coordinated.  I could type 90 words a minute and was a professional.  I even started and owned a secretarial service, and did reasonably well financially.  What prevented me from doing even better financially was bipolar, but I didn't know that at the time. My stamina has never been good, and I need to rest, as well as ""get away"" from other people and be by myself.  I'm very social, but also need much, much alone time and rest.   I now take Lamictal and Lexapro.  My pdoc and I raised Lamictal from 200 mg/day to 250, now 300.  The increases were due to me getting to feel irritable and underlying anger all the time.  I know that Lamictal can cause clumsiness.  I will talk to my pdoc about it next week. I have a new pdoc because my other one went to a different clinic.  My previous one said he had never heard of the Lamictal or Lexapro causing clumsiness.  I hope my new one has more info on that.  My clumsiness is harrowing.  Today I knocked over a whole new carton of catnip all over a dresser with all sorts of stuff on it -- so the catnip is everywhere in that area. I plan to get the vacuum with the hose and try to wipe out the catnip. Later in the day I was attempting to kiss my boyfriend goodbye. He was in the driver's seat in his car, I was standing next to the car. I leaned over to hug him, and crashed my head on the roof of the car. Whack!  It didn't hurt near as much as it p...d me off and majorly annoyed me that I just keep on, and on and on making stuff like this happen, every few minutes of every day.  I always have a least one accidental minor cut or prick on my hand/s.  As soon as one heals, or as soon as I take the band aid off one, I cut myself again.  This clumsiness is really bothering me and getting me down and irritable at myself."
2322,"Hello,

A friend suggested that i sign up to a forum because i don't have anyone to talk to! She works all day and i think i call her too much. I am not working at the moment and have not been for longer than i would have hoped.

I was diagnosed in 2007 with Bi-polar Disorder but had been unwell since i was at college, off and on. It has taken its toll on every aspect of my life and i would rather blame it than myself, naturally. I am inclined to call myself all of the names under the sun, so i try hard to blame the diagnosis and the medication or more to the point, the times where i was not taking medication, rightly or wrongly. 

I live alone. Unhappily single but i feel too unable to cope with close relationships of any kind. There is one friend that i am close to but i try to keep some distance. We lived together from college until a couple of years ago. 

I suppose my question is how do you find a balance between staying stable and having a life. I find i am very drained after any conversation or activity. Going to the market for food and then driving home, tends to wear me out more than it does for other people i know. I understand sensory overload but i also need to get out there and meet people. By people, i mean i would love to have a relationship with a man again, hopefully long term and who knows what else. I'd like a close male friend and possibly husband if everything went well. I am so scared of how other people can disrupt my balance as most of the time i am actually just coping.

I don't know if i can even go about internet dating again. I don't go to any social events because of being anxious around other people once they get to know me. I don't feel comfortable with lots of people knowing me because my symptoms eventually surface and then i become very embarrassed. My mind is full of embarrassing memories and when i do go out, i am always worried about running into most of those people. I also really do wish i was not here, not alive, and so trying to meet someone that doesn't know about my diagnosis, my history or my current problems, where i have to pretend initially, is going to be difficult. It feels impossible. 

I am looking forward to talking to people on here because i don't speak to many people. My family are either very busy or other ones can be hurtful and lie so i don't like to spend much time with them.

I am stuck, very sad and very alone. I'd love to take action to fix my life but also i am keen to rest and look after myself without rocking the boat.  I need to find a balance between the two. 

Thank you for reading this far.

Today I have been feeling very tired and achy. I have not been motivated to do much of anything so I expect I am startinf to swing low again.

2325,How I Cured Myself of Bipolar (Without Medications or Doctors)
2326,"HI 
This was very hard to write up because for some reason I find it hard to explain what is on my mind.
 
I think I may have a bipolar disorder or some kind of brain unbalance because one minute I feel on top of the world loving life then within minutes I become the complete opposite and I feel depressed for no reason at all and then get frustrated with myself for getting depressed for no reason. 
I also have depression episodes which is the worst part where I might feel depressed for the day or even for days and then all of the suddenly out of the blues I feel great again.
I also find my mind is constantly thinking and sometime it get to the point where I can’t even think straight or focus it feels like my brain is going into overdrive for no reason and the crazy thing is most of the thoughts are pointless but I am still processing them.

I got mild Asperger syndrome so I'm not sure if that could be the source of the problem but I don’t think it is. Also this up and down or rollercoaster/episodic mood swings has only affected for about 2-3 year and it came sudden rather than gradually."
2327,"Pdoc says one of the reasons he thinks I am on the bipolar spectrum is because my hallucinations don't line up with the psychosis related to unipolar depression.

I have spent lots of energy these last few days and I have nothing to show for it...my house is even a mess.

Now it is Friday and I feel trapped between wanting to sleep and wanting to go, go, go. And then in the midst of it I see all the medicine bottles on my window sill and think bad thoughts. 

My insides feel tightly wound like I need to punch something and kick and scream. That never gets out. It just dulls and is more easily ignored and then comes back. 

Feeling lost and hopeless. Thankful my kids got home from an ice cream run with their grandpa so at least the house isn't empty. 

I really am not a suicide risk but there are times when I feel so freaked out about being alone. I don't know what that is about. :eek:

just needed to get my thoughts out of my head!"
2330,"I just need to talk, because my brother didn't seem to understand how I was feeling. 
I finally asked my husband to leave. He has neglected our marriage for 7 years because of his work. He projected his anger onto me, disliked it if I would try to express myself and rarely was understanding or empathetic. 
My husband retired inJanuary and just began playing chess on the computer from morning till he fell asleep. He had no interest in doing anything. Eventually he started getting out for a little while. But he still became angry if I tried to express myself. He is very controlling. 
I tried to get out of the house as much as possible. But when I was home, it would upset me to see him glued to the computer and not help out or go out.
My therapist doesn't believe in divorce, but I know I can't live with my husband.
I don't know if I should bother my friends with this situation right now. I ask myself, Will they just brush me off like my brother or try to be there for me. 
Thank you for listening. Now I have to replace my unhappy thoughts with happy,happy, thoughts."
2331,"After months of seeing a counselor who couldn't decide what was wrong with me and taking anti-depressants that helped with the psychosis but not with the depression today i met a psychiatrist. We went through the whole life journey blah blah blah. 

and in the end he says well I am pretty sure you don't have depression with psychotic episodes. I am pretty sure you are bi-polar. Probably bi-polar NOS (not otherwise specified) yes he said that. I was huh? What the heck is that? 

Then is proceeded to list a bunch of meds and side effects and then looks at me and says ""do you want to go home and research this before changing your meds?""  I was like I have waited MONTHS for this appointment I want to change my meds NOW. And then he asked what meds i thought I would like to try. WHAT?!?! I was so mad. I said ""so you are the doctor and you don't know what I should take so you are letting ME pick! I don't think that is very fair.""  

Finally I got him to decide what to try (I am usually very involved in making medical decision for myself but not today). So I am going off of citalopram (no duh I have been on it since February and it hasn't helped at all) and I am upping my quetiapine from 100 to 300 (slowly yes over a couple of weeks but yikes I hate that stuff) and adding in Wellbutrin. 

I told him I was ok trying something and if it didn't work trying something else. I made sure he knew that I KNEW that this could take some trial and error but I pretty much had the force the guy to tell me what meds to try. 

I DON'T KNOW. I finally looked at him crying and said ""you know what I want?! I want to be better! I don't want my kids to wake up in the morning scared that mommy is going to have another poopy day. that is what I want."" 

I left so frustrated and so disappointed and so questioning of his professionalism and knowledge. 

I feel broken and scared. And I was much happier thinking I was just oddly depression than somewhat bi-polar. What difference does it make to me? I don't know. The diagnosis doesn't change what I am experiencing but the diagnosis of bipolar no matter how light? small? less? I don't know. I don't like being diagnosed with this. 

Sorry if that is hurtful to anyone on here. i just am reeling in shock and my hubby is working out of town and my family is far away from me."
2332,"When I was manic I would die my hair a different color every two to three months. They were normally bright and crazy colors. My favorite was purple. Does any one else like to do this. I always thought it was fun to stand out! Now I kinda try to fit in, but sometimes I miss my bright red hair days and getting dressed up just because I could. Might just have some fun again with colors soon!"
2333,"I've been trying to make new friends recently, but for some reason I always end up mentioning my mental illness. I don't know why I do it, it just seems like such a big part of me, but then I get worried that they won't like me or make judgments about me due to a label. When I was manic I was wild and crazy and didn't care but now that I'm stabilized it matters to me, I just want to feel security and have a normal life. I guess there's not really such a thing as normal anyhow. It just hurts to mention my weakness and I feel very sad to have the problems I do seem to affect so much. I've become very paranoid to, which doesn't help. Just kind of having a rough day."
2334,"Hi guys 
Im wanting to have a baby 
I understand lithium can cause heart defects, im just wondering if anyone has stayed on lithium during there pregnancy????

Also how have people managed with there bipolar during pregnancy on/off medication?"
2335,"My therapist told me that I should just try to ignore my husband. I just have to think of him as having an illness. But his behavior triggers my bipolar. He has neglected our marriage for 7 years, won't allow me to express myself, gets upset if I disagree with him, is dishonest and hasn't been considerate. How does the therapist expect me to go on with my life and pretend my husband is not at home. Just seems irrational.
PS my husband has moved out and I feel more at peace. Next time I see my therapist I m going to ask him if he could live with someone like that. I allowed the therapist to make me feel like a failure because I couldn't ignore my husband"
2336,"SO today I woke up from my drug induced fitful and dream filled sleep and easily got out of bed (yay) BUT my kids are irritating me so much. My hubby came home between jobs and I didn't even want to look at him. I managed to be civil and I haven't yelled at my kids but they have mostly played on their own leaving me to read and do nothing. 

BUT I feel so irritated by them and as soon as I am still I want to crawl out of my skin. I don't know if I am entering a hypomania time or if my drugs are just easing my depression enough to let me be irritable.

Thoughts? experiences with irritability and hypomania? 

:scratch:"
2337,"Hi, I have an elder sister whom i love so much. She wasn't that good in studies and also we werent that rich so she was put into a goverment girls school. And family didnt try much to improve her. Then at an early age of 18 she got married. A couple of years later she also got a baby to handle. And on the other side my brother started getting success after all his hard work. But as people say sometimes for few people, its hard to digest success. And so the two started having issues in between them. If i talk about now then she has teo kids but their family is at the edge of separation which will destroy kid's future.

Sorry to tell u all this but everything is related. I, my brother in law n even my family has noticed that her mind has not grown after the age of 17. 
She is still addictive to many things like phones as a teen ager does.
She still make friends with her school friend and talks only about things when she was 17.
She lies all the time and never fear anything.
She doesnt even care if her life is destroyed by a divorce.
She is so much addicted to cellphones like thats her world. Till her last breath she wants to SMS and she will die with her phone.
After taking marijuana, one mind doesn't cares about anything and never admits the mistake.. The same thing is with her.
She doesnt feels that she is married to someone.
She is not in control of anyone. She still talk like a kid. When u scold a kid for any mistake, they will remember that for a day. And when u talk normally with them.. Kids go normal again like they never did amything wrong. The same case is with my Sister.
ALike kids wants a lot of toys and after a day or a month they throw it or break it.. My sister is.

Please let me know if there is any disease in which mind doesnt grow, and different kinds of Phobias happen. I want to cure my sister. Help me fix her. Sorry to right this long. I feel like writing more and wish if i could express my feelings."
2338,"Hi. My name is Adam and I'm having some serious issues. I think it may be caused by going off my Invega injections, but I'm not sure. I keep having these episodes where everything begins to look sort of..surreal, I guess, and odd? And then I have racing thoughts to go with the vision alteration. They're such odd symptoms; my doctor has no idea what I'm talking about, and I've never heard anyone else talk about anything like it. Could this be from going off my Invega? Has anyone experienced anything like this? Please help."
2339,"Hi,
I need help, I have some questions that I suspect my mother has  a psychological disorder.

My mother is suffering from epilsepsy caused by brain virus 10 years ago, so since then she gets seizures at least once a month.

But her psychological behavior through out the years, are becoming uncontrollable. She used to be fine.

Now, she often threatens to kill herself, and gets excessively angry for the most ridiculous reason, such as someone in the house accidentally splattered a bit of water on the sink, she would be extremely enraged and say ridiculous things that are absolutely out of the context/jump out the window.
She does not have any friend now, since the ones that she had, she fought a lot, and everyone kinda hates her (she is 57 years old), in fact she has a problem with almost every friend, practically saying, her common sense is lost.

Like right now, she has been missing for 2 days, and she sends money from her bank account to me saying ""keep the money, take care of your brother and father, i'm going away on a train, you will not be able to find me, goodbye"", and says ridiculous stuff like those, JUST because yesterday my brother hurried her to go home because he could not hold his pee (he was going out with my mom.)

This doesnt happen once, or twice or 20, but it happens over and over and over and over again. Usually after 2 days she would be extremely sorry, but it happens over and over again. She is extremely extremely kind when she is kinda in her ""normal"" state, but when she isnt, when she has no common sense, she would go crazy and do ridiculous stuff. She goes to church so often, and religious, but her commons sense she has none.

When things dont go her way/someone disagrees with her when she is not in the mood, she would throw things in public to us, and gets angry or shout in public.

I am pretty sure she has a psychological problem right? Our family has been wondering for years but we are just too ""afraid"" since we do not want to assume our mother is ""crazy"", or maybe we are in denial. My father is extremely patient.
I just want to know if this is bipolar or not.

Your help is very needed. Thank you."
2340,Does anyone overeat and by over eat I mean shovel back loads and loads of food when their starting to go Hypomanic? I know when people go Hypomanic/manic traditionally it's thought that they loose their appetite. Just wondering if anyone else has had an increased appetite when Hypomanic?
2341,"I have read that many people who have experienced mania usually end up feeling very bored, due to stability or a slight depression from coming down from the manic episode.

I find this to be very true, after I have experienced a manic episode, I take my medication and I do feel better, but comes this intense boredom I can not seem to handle at all.

Being completely honest, I for the longest of times was not consistent with my meds. I also smoke from time to time. 

Has anyone else experienced this intense boredom? If so how do you deal with it?"
2342,"I know you will say yes but...

My pdoc prescribed me Ativan months ago to use when I really need it. That's when I want to hit my head to the wall, namely, irritability, mixed episode etc. He never prescribed benzos before but on those days I was highly irritable. So, I have taken 15-16 times 1mg tablets in 4 months. Not much. I took them not just for irritability but sometimes for sleeping.  
Then a mixed attack hit me very badly. I went to the closest pdoc. My pdoc was not available at that time. I asked him for 1 mg Ativan. He looked at me and said 1 mg will not be enough for me so he prescribed 2.5 mgs x2. I bought the drugs but did not use them before asking to my pdoc. Since I still had a few 1mgs, I took them. 

Then I went to my pdoc, we talked a lot, he arranged my medication and prescribed me 1 mg Ativan again for use just when I need it. There he said ""once in a while is ok but if you need to use them more often then we need to find another solution"". BTW I did not tell him about the other pdoc and 2.5 mgs. 

To make the long story short, in the last two weeks I'm abusing Ativan because my life is very bad right now. I'm not depressed. I'm just unhappy. I need psychotherapy (as my pdoc says) but they are so expensive and I can't handle it at this moment. Everything is awful. I'm so unhappy. And now I'm doing this. 

I feel sleepy and need to stop here. I hope I could explain myself."
2343,I just wondered if people are normally encouraged by their pets. I have been wanting to get a small dog. I wonder if that would help cheer me up or if it would just be another responsibility to take care of. It would be nice to hear positive feedback from people with their pets. Just something fun and positive.
2344,"Within the last couple months, I started to feel the need for sex at least twice a day. My Dr tried to cut back on my anti depressant but I began to feel more depressed. Now he wants to increase my Lamictal. Has anyone else had this problem. I tried not to focus on the urges, but doesn't always work."
2345,"I have bipolar II and was diagnosed back in 2009/2010. I grew up with a verbally, emotionally, and physically abusive mom, and when I was diagnosed she told my doctor that I couldn't possibly be depressed or have anxiety (as was my first diagnosis) and that bipolar seemed made up for what she believed to be ""teen attitude"". When I go through my depressive stage I always am upset that I can't be okay or normal. Sometimes during a panic attack I will feel such agony over not being able to control my feelings that will lose all strength. I'm tired of being upset about things I can not help. Does anyone else feel like this during a depressive stage? If so, what helps you the most? What helps the least? I've tried reading what others have said about how bipolar disorder affects them, and sometimes that helps me. But I haven't really read anything about wanting to be normal. Is this as common as I want it to be or is it just me?"
2346,"God the Anger …………I woke up this morning with such a burning anger in my head. I don’t let it out I can’t, let it out, mustn’t let it out. Kids all up happy mummy breakfast, uniforms, like a little army regime tick, tick, tick out the door all happy headcount in the car and off to school. 
Why do I feel so angry? I’m stuck in this cycle in my head all of the time, sometimes headphones on will wipe it clean, sometimes a walk can numb it. Spending time with the kids doing silly things, doing homework just being a mum is like a magic potion that keeps me from walking out that door and never ever looking back. I’ve wanted to disappear for as long as my memory goes back. 
Thoughts racing through my head and today, in fact for the last week these are thoughts I don’t want in there. Things about my childhood, thoughts of frustration, feeling sooo very trapped in my own head. Never comfortable in my own skin. No one can see this all going on and for the most part I disconnect and hide it pretty well but if anyone were to see me right now I would turn to a puddle at their feet.  It’s a constant torture. Do I open up reach out and what really happens if I do or do I just carry on pretend I’m grand and not worry anyone. I feel if I was to speak to someone today they would think I’ve totally lost the plot, I’d be judge on previous addictions (not my imagination) but my biggest fear is that they would think I can’t look after my kids. This could not be further from the truth.  I have grown up with 1st hand experience and do everything in my power to stay on top and never let my kids think for one second that mental illness will dictate the sort of parent I can be. I am very open and honest with my kids which sometimes can be very hard but I reckon it’s the way to go. I don’t want them to fear me, to fear mental health, to worry about things they can and can’t say. We have an everything goes moto I will them to talk about whatever is going on big small and everything else in between. I never had this growing up, everything was shushed, covered up and never spoke about. This had such an impact on me I would never want my kids to feel they were alone or frightened  or had no one to speak to because like it or not I’m their mum and they are stuck with me until I die. I love the problem shared is a problem halved 
The only way I can explain itis if you couldn’t control your arms and legs from waving like crazy in every direction possible and sometimes in directions you never even knew they could or in ways they really really shouldn’t.  Imagine how hard it would be to function with all this going, school runs, reading your own child a story, making a phone call, sleeping infact just about anything is near on impossible. This would be open and plain for anyone to see, you’d be embarrassed, ashamed, and self-conscious, you’d hide yourself away from everything and everyone that you could. But mental illness aside I have 4 kids who mean more to me than anything. I will not let this dictate the kind of parent I can or cannot be. So back to the arms and legs you’re sick of it affecting your life so over yrs you perfect the skill to keep them fucking limbs under control each step, each task, just to live really and not be a weirdo. This takes a great deal of time, energy, will power and a belief that you are not more than just a mental iller or a limb thrower. I just want normality I want my brain to stop , I want to be in control and I am ish ( except for depression which is consuming)  Then one day BOOM I lost the ability to do it, any of it. Back to an unpleasant mixture of a puppet on ecstasy and a slug on tranquilisers, sometimes I can be a puppet on tranquilisers and most scary for me a slug on ecstasy. Through no choice of my own I was being pulled any which way my mind chose to take my , no off switch, no control, no planned route,  no time of boarding and definitely no eta.  
Now I’m trying to get that control back. But I need to not just be listened to but actually be heard. At the moment I can go 4 nights with no sleep usually 3rd and 4th night I will cook or iron nonstop with my headphones on to focus. If I’m a puppet on ecstasy I will use click and collect so I don’t go in to a shop for toilet roll leave £100 down with no toilet roll (I still have the odd blow all your money outburst but I never see it coming it’s past before I realise) . If I’m a slug on tranquilisers I will use home delivery so I have food and whatever else the house needs. 
I have always had a pretty hyper sex drive but sometimes I can actually be ashamed of how I feel or have acted. I look at people in a slightly different way. I feel much more confident during these times and feel like I could pretty much have anyone I set my sights on even though 98% of the time I know I’m ugly that 2% should I act on it I will be in your bed tearing your clothes of before you even realise I already have mine off. Hot, sweaty, full cardio vascular workout sex. This was never really a problem for me when I was in relationships in fact it’s probably the only reason my 1st relationship lasted for 5 1/2 yrs. I have noticed it much more now I’m not in a relationship It is a feeling that you can’t shake, I also seem to get cramp in my toe lol I once asked a sports massager if there was a link (he could not offer me an explanation but he did a few days offer me a solution) This is all fun and games until you come down. Then I get the guilt and shame and sluty feelings as this is not like me and out of character. 

I’ve lost all train of thought now………………….but I don’t feel as frantic as I did when I sat down so I suppose I can carry on with the housework before the school runs start up again. 
Over n out"
2347,"Maybe Bipolar, scared to go to GP again, might not need to if I can mange the symptoms?

So it's taken me a VERY long time to admit this to myself, and now here...

I've been experiencing some worrying symptoms that seem to point to Bipolar Disorder, for a while now. It started off with the dark, long, suicidal depression, then I started cycling from severe depression to extreme happiness quite quickly. I also became irritable and snappy with people I never would snap at (mum and little sister who's under 10). And have gone for several days without sleep easily.

I would become really hyper and say stupid stuff and make crazy plans. Then I'd flip for no apparent reason and become suicidal and have tried many times to end it all.
There are times where I'd become suicidal even when I was hyper?

I've been to the doc for the depression and had a horrific experience with the MHT. So now I'm scared to go back again and say all this stuff.

But after having a life changing realisation about self worth and how it makes no sense to hurt myself, that safety issue is gone. So my question is, do I really need to go and get an official diagnosis and possibly ruin the new resolve I have about staying safe and turning my life around? Is there another way to manage/cope/deal/maybe cure whatever is happening with me??"
2348,"Had a pretty rough night while having dinner with my family. My brother doesn't really understand the extend to how much my mental illnesses have debilitated me. And started saying it's my fault I feel the way I do and only I can fix it I just need to pull my head out and want to get better, saying no one should walk around eggshells anymore some pretty hurtful remarks. it ended in a heated argument, I tried to explain to him that I don't chose to stay in bed for 3 months and then suddenly have the energy to take on the world then relapse again, I would love to feel normal and maintain study and jobs. But I physically do not have the energy to even pull the covers off myself for weeks at times, let alone shower. Does he think I enjoy this feeling?how about the crippling agigtation with so much energy where I'm literally banging my head on the wall because I feel so depressed and revved up at the same time. How do you go about explain to those who don't understand/have never experienced mental illness that we don't chose to feel the way we do. I know we don't have to prove ourselves to anyone but any advice would be helpful thank you: sorry about the rant. He's just witnessed a lot of my Hypomanic episodes where I am the life of the party and anxiety free. So when he sees me in the dumps he thinks it's my fault."
2349,just wondering did anyone have any extreme stresses in their life and then was diagnosed with bipolar? Because I have no genetic history of bipolar in my family. So I'm still really confused.
2350,"Hi been feeling ok but my boss had started being a bitch!
But i initiated a meeting with her on thursday about me getting unwell if i get stressed and that I am under the care of the mental health service and see a support worker twice a week. When i asked to have this meeting she told me she thought i was going to resign!!
She has been so good since and said if i am struggling have a talk to her and if i need time off or some support i need to talk to her!
Very pleased its out in the open!
I now have thursdays off, and may give up my fridays also didnt tell her that though.
I have been offered a casual job helping people in the community. Its just fill in work it might just be a few hours a week  but I will see how i go.
I also had a cousin who took her own life just over a week ago. It makes me feelreally overwhelmed and anxiety is back again. I am managing and explained to my boss that this has also been effecting my stress level again she was really good!
But anyway thats how it is for now but i am doing ok."
2351,"The past 3 days I've had about maybe max 4 hours of sleep and haven't felt the slightest bit tired, if anything so fricken energetic to the point were I am talking over people and just can not stop talking. And I can see others were getting annoyed with me. I just felt amazing literally, just so confident and important. Like I could achieve anything I put my mind to and just so sociable like I could literally start a conversation with a complete random and feel like I've known them for years. This didn't really last long (doesn't usually last long for me) and now I can start to feel myself feeling really down, wanting to isolate, overeat, sleep, suicidal thoughts/plans basically severe depression. This depression lasts sometimes for months and sometimes for as short as a week and then I can feel that other mood mentioned earlier. I was previously in the past diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and now recently with type 2 bipolar Does this sound like a typical occurrence with BPD or is this the bipolar? My pdoc is even considering that the first doc that diagnosed me with BPD misdiagnosed me. after feeling so elated (whether it be my bipolar etc) is it normal to feel so anxious and SEVERLY depressed after the come down I can actually feel myself slipping into it. And I hate it!"
2352,"I've been taking Lithium Carbonate for almost a year now, I just recently had a dose change and have been noticing weird things going in with my hair. I don't have super thick or thin hair, but my strands are really strong and curly (but not too kinky). Lately they've been falling and my hair has felt thinner. When I first started the lithium last year I didn't notice it this bad. I heard that lithium will make your hair fall out, too. Has anyone experienced this and noticed it to go away after their body gets used to the medicine? I've had acne and sore muscles and they are beginning to go away. But I'm just worried for my hair...I love it so much..."
2353,"Everything I read about taking medications for mental illnesses say this, Drink lots of water!! I'm not a medical doctor but I've heard its very very important to your liver and kidneys. I also find that drinking lots of water causes me to eat less and consume less sugar which helps me not be as jittery. Try the flavored kind, anything that makes it easier to drink. Summers right around the corner so I will try to have my water bottle always handy and consume fewer sodas."
2354,"My retired mother has shown some symptoms of bi-polar disorder, and I it has been a tough 2016 for me as her caregiver. It’s been difficult for the family. I’m torn between believing she has drastic episodes of mood swings, and suspecting that her suspected problems come from some disorders. More than that, I find it tough to accept that my mom is mentally ill. The psychiatrist is a professional, but after all he just met my mom. I am just wondering if there was any misdiagnosis. Is there anyone with past experience with that?

Could anyone share with me about difficulties in keeping track of the patient’s emotion? Are there any tips on what to look out for when taking care of a “patient”? 

Lastly, what frequency of visits is optimal and how much should I be paying for consultations and medicine? I am trying to estimate how much I have to put aside to keep us going.

I would greatly appreciate any input, thank you for reading my post."
2355,"So I posted on here last month some history of my mental health problems and some symptoms I had been experiencing. Without you guys support I wouldn't have had the kick up the arse I needed to seek proper psychiatric help. Today I received the diagnoses of being bipolar. I hope with the diagnoses I can understand what is happening to me better and learn how to cope. I've been prescribed quetiapine, just a weeks worth as I need a blood test to see if it agrees with me or something, but I feel like this is positive steps to leading a normal life. Thank you online friends xxx"
2356,"Hi my mother is diagnosed with depression/anxiety. She is 60 and for the most part just likes to relax and watch tv and she loves her sleep. But every couple of weeks she will stay up for 2 - 3 days cleaning, organizing and a million other things. Sometimes when this comes to an end she has a panic attack.

She is very very focused and multi tasks like crazy. For 30 minutes she's painting, for 30 minutes she's vacumming then 30 minutes later writing a letter or whatever. She has COPD so staying up for 2 - 3 days is not healthy and she has ended up in the hospital multiple times after staying up. After she's been up for 1 - 2 days i try to get her to go to bed and then she will take 2 Imovane (Sleeping pills). So she turns the lights off and lays down to go to sleep and i go in my room. Then i go to check on her 30 minutes later and she's got the lights on and she's reading a book for example. She also looks dead behind the eyes. You would think she is on Meth by how she acts but she has never touched a drug in her life.

She just can not get to sleep no matter what. When she isn't having one of these episodes you can't wake up cause she loves sleeping so much. It is so frustrating. She thinks she acts completely normal while this is happening too. 

Anyways have any of you heard of stuff like this ? Does it sound like Hypomania ? Bipolar ? Any help would be great, thank you."
2357,"Her mental health problems are well known but now apparently due to family issues she has vanished on a bike in Chicago which we all know is not exactly a safe place to be vulnerable and alone.

Now I feel like ive been stood here with my mouth open watching the show. Watching her crumble from afar, and shrugging my shoulders.

Im not alone in that.

Sinead HAD loving partners, children, family resources (unlike me) and fame, yet she still appears to have also slipped through every crack there is.

Why oh why is it so hard for any of us, including the rich and famous, to get any sort of Actual Help?

I so hope she is found safe and well and then gets the CARE she needs rather than finger pointing or drug therapy that kills her personality.

2358,"Transcendent hypomania followed by a year of anhedonia/ emotional numbness

Sorry for the repetition as I've also posted this in my introduction message to the forum. Hopefully its not too abrasive to mention this issue from the off. Over a year ago, I had a spectacular episode of hypomania (perhaps bordering on mania but it fortunately didn't go that far) where I felt super high, ecstatic and utterly joyful for six days in a row. The city of Newcastle at the time where I was visiting seemed like heaven on earth and I borderline felt my feet levitate off the ground, I was so up. It gets complicated, however. Ever since having these episodes since 2012 after taking citalopram, I'd usually just fall back to normal/ very mild depression and carry on. After this episode in April 2015, I woke up to a strange emotional numbness where, whilst I was resilient to negative events, I couldn't experience positive emotions either. Whilst I seem outwardly high functioning and fine, I genuinely can't feel my emotions and a physical numbness has emerged in tandem, for over a year. Perhaps the hypomania damaged my dopamine receptors akin to drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy? Is this unprecedented in the mood patterns of those afflicted with some form of the condition? I mentioned how terrified I am to the doctors and have tried Zoloft which ended up a disaster. 

I'm paying the price for my short, mega high. More bizarrely, the doctors refused to believe I had bipolar disorder, saying they only look at more extreme cases. Its a Kaftaesque situation where no one believes I'm ill. If it were mere depression, the only way would be up but this anhedonic flatness is a complete quagmire. I've already speculated about searching for novel anti- d's known to resurrect emotions, eg. tianeptine and the hard to obtain NSI-189. Its such a nightmare scenario and I'm confused as to why this has happened. Does brain chemistry self correct or have I really paid the price for my hubris?"
2359,"I'm confused. I always believed the power of meds actually. I believe psychiatry. I do not believe the talking therapies or other kind of things like meditation etc. Don't ask me why, I do not have any reason for this. 

OK, now the meds protect me from major depression and hypomania. You know, not fully but they at least shorten the time I spend in depression. 
But, I'm not well in general. I'm not happy. I do not enjoy life most of the time. I'm about to lose my job for the first time in my life because I do not care. I do care but you know. I'm lazy. I have no motivation, no energy. 

I miss those happy days. Life without medication was more painful, I accept this but it was also more fun. Life is not good like this. 

Don't think that I'm on heavy meds, nope, just on Lamictal right now. But I was on a combination until the last month. 

Maybe I still do not accept my diagnosis. 
I'm on the edge now. No medication or medication. I do not know. I just know that my life is not good."
2360,"Hi all,
I have symptoms that fit the spectrum of cyclothymia (I think), and I will be seeking professional advice on this. I sometimes wonder if I'm being dramatic about the high vs the low. To me they are significant and notable, however I am asking what others have experienced? Particularly with the elated periods, how up is up and how down is down? I'm not seeking to compare my episodes for a who is worse than whom situation, merely to explore whether I am justified in my concern regarding these changes!
I would be grateful to hear of your experiences"
2361,"I am so irritated and TIRED of dealing with GI problems from foods I use to eat with no trouble last year. Now I can't have a whole apple or peach, a large salad, a lot of cooked kale, bran cereals, more than one yogurt a day, and now I'm semi lactose intolerant. I just had a bipolar spell from getting sick from food. I'm afraid to EAT. I feel like I should be embarrassed to share this on this thread. I feel like I should be empathizing with someone else's irritation rather than talking about myself. But to be thrown into a bipolar spell from FOOD is just aggrevating. I am completely stable except for this food issue. I am going to have to be super aware of what I am eating. 

This is so stupid because the lithium that is making me stable is causing the GI sensitivity and therefore causing the bipolar episode. WTF"
2362,"Everything is all backwards. For five years I always had to take a morning walk to be able to sleep at night. Now if I walk it Prevents sleeping at night. Disconcerting. I don't expect anyone to answer this thread. No one answered my Bipolar from FOOD thread. ""sigh"""
2363,Anyone diagnosed or think they have a dependent personality? Do you lack a relationship with yourself? Loss of identity dont know who you are.and starting wondering whether youve never had a personality of your own
2364,"Hi I'm new here,

I don't know if I have a mental illness for sure, I've not been diagnosed with anything yet. I went to my doctors and got referred to counselling. After a phone ""interview/chat session"" with the counsellor she put me on the waiting list for one on one sessions and possible CBT. I've been waiting for like 6-8 weeks, I maybe more I've lost count.

I'm 19 years old. The first time I went to the doctors about feeling like this was when I was 15 but because of my age I didn't really get taken seriously. Now I'm at uni and I'm really struggling, I feel so lost and helpless and I'm failing classes and not handing in assignments.

I don't know where this thread is going but I just needed to vent. I'm not doing so well right now, and not having a diagnosis somehow is making it even more difficult. I try to talk to my mum about how I'm feeling but she doesn't really understand. Anyone at uni/in education and struggling too?"
2365,"Yesterday evening I had a heart pain and hot flushes. Then sweating, nausea, I don't know I felt strange. I went to the closest hospital. Told them ""I have a heart pain and may die"". They did some tests, all came back normal. I don't remember but lets say enzyme x normal levels are between 7-28 and mine is 16. If this enzyme is high then you may have an heart attack. Mine is 16 but why not 7? My question was this. I mean. I thought that if it is 16 this means that it's high, I know very well that this is not true. 

There they told me that my heart is fine, I'm fine, this may be just because of iv iron. I just need to rest. BTW I had iv iron at 2pm and this happened at 7 pm. This is not my first iv iron, I had it 3 months ago for 1 week and this week on monday and tuesday. 

At the hospital I was fine, just feeling tired. When I was about to leave I had strong hot flushes. I felt like I was going to pass out. I told the doc, he said I'll be fine if I rest. 
I came home at 11 pm. 
I felt cold, I felt hot, at the same time. Somebody was burning my skin, literally, I was feeling it, but when I touch it, it was cold. I thought that I have high fever, I measured it and it was 34.5 C. My hands were ice cold and I can't feel them. 
I was feeling each one of my cells. The temperature of each was different. cold, hot, cold, hot... I had a heart pain at the same time. I slept at 5 am. Until this time I wasn't fine. 
When I wake up I was fine but after a few minutes when I question myself if I'm feeling OK or not, hot flushes came again with heart pain. Then my foot was burning etc. I was feeling really weird. It was like I came to a different world, like waking up from a coma. I stayed in bed for a few hours. Then get up, eat something. I was better. Then I started to write this and hot flushes, freezing, sweating and chest pain are with me."
2366,"My doc has me on an antidepressant and antipsychotic. I ask whether I needed this combination and he said you 100% need to be on medication, and then when on to say how I will need to basically stay on it for ever. He said the antidepressant will help with my severe depression and the antipsychotic will help with not allowing me to get too ""high"".. I really don't get it at all, he hasn't mentioned anything about having bipolar or anything. So why would he be concerned about me getting ""high"" I'm really concerned with the weight gain potential"
2367,"I haven't been diagnosed by a psychologist, I know what's going on. I'm suffering from depression the past few months,plus bipolar and anxiety  disorder. The worst part is that I'm completely alone in this, I have no support from family or friends,since nobody knows that. I look a very happy kid at school,always cheerful,funny that you can't think this person is actually going through hell the time we speak. This is horrible. Some days are so hard because I cry myself to sleep,crying in the shower and trying to calm down and not think about it. Other days I 'forget' i'm a sufferer. I just don't know what to do anymore. I can't take it. My furure is unpredictable, I don't know what I'm going to do with my life and all 'my friends' have abandoned me by the time I moved in another country. It I have so many problems and worries when I'm a teen,what am I supposed to do later with my life?"
2368,"I'm sure many have seen the short video about the black dog called depression. 

In my case it's called Cyclothymia in the 9 years since we first met it's got very big...  I've seeked support before, I had counselling last year but this only lasted a short period of time. 

Does anyone know what else is available? 

I feel like when I do go to my doctor I'm really low, by the time the counselling comes I'm high and the counsellor just runs the course and ticks the boxes to discharge me. 

Any other advise is truly appreciated."
2369,"I've had depression since 7th grade. I've been hospitalized twice and put on medication. I just found out my official diagnosis is bipolar disorder. This whole time I just thought I had depression, and now I have to go back to square one. I don't even know where to start (I've tried googling but to no avail)."
2370,I have just been diagnosed by the Mauldsley hospital south London with Bipolar disorder of mixed depression and mania and it has taken over three years! The NHS was useless the shrink told me a year ago it was SAD but I tried to explain I get low all year not just in the winter! But I paid private and went to the Mauldsley and saw professor Y and Dr S who immediately placed me on Quetiapine. I have been having manic episodes on and off since December 2013. It is sad I had to go private at a NHS hospital but now I have no faith in the mental health service in my area for good reason. The GP missed it and so did the shrink and that is worrying! it is just like people who have cancer missed just like my sister did who died 6 years ago  because they misdiagnosed her with another illness! All I can say is God save the NHS because it looks like nothing else will.
2371,"Hello everyone. This is the first time I've joined a forum about anything anxiety related. 

Anyway I've been going to counseling since January and two weeks ago went to a psychiatrist for the first time. She diagnosed me with Cyclothymia and put me on Lamictal. It has definitely done its job so far at preventing highs and lows, but the problem is now I'm in the middle all the time and have a sort of lack of emotion. I'm about to go on vacation with my girlfriend of a year and I'm not excited anymore. I don't want to feel like this on our first trip together. I even have less of a desire to be with her now. Not having lows is not worth this. 

I'm just wondering if anyone on here has any experience with it and if this is just a temporary feeling or is Lamictal just not for me?"
2372,"Hola……..
Only me. So where do I start and will it be a never ending story?
I have been awake since 2am Sunday 8th May it’s now 20:43 Thursday 12 May. I can’t switch off. 
I try to sleep but my brain keeps going, round and round about everything and anything from the weather to clotted fucking cream and just about everything else in between.  Night times are long and frustrating it’s like being grounded as a kid. I’m trapped in the house and all I want to do is paint my garden wall, walk the dog, and generally just move a lot more than being in bed requires. My brain runs a marathon and still wants to keep on. 
During the day I can put my beans to use. Yesterday I cooked 2 chicken and ham pies, 2 shepherd’s pies, 1 fish pie, a pot of chicken soup, some Bolognese, a chicken casserole, a sausage casserole, a chicken curry, some mince carrot and onion, and a mega batch of meatballs (which kick ass). Today I cut the grass (back gardens a bastard), cleaned the car inside and out, stripped all the beds washed, dried and back on before dinner. This all fits in around my 4 kids, 3 school runs, 2 walks with the dog and a visit to my mums.
Music works wonders for me. I stick the headphones on and bam. It can help me focus when my minds going overdrive. I find it mega hard to stay focused on the task in hand. 70% of the time just listening to some music will stop me from absconding. 
I walk a little quicker, spring in my step. I consciously slow myself down when I’m talking. I do my own fucking head in. 
Casually stopped smoking on Monday. I’ve went longer without a cigarette than I have since I was 14. Go me. It’s really quite strange, I’ve found it oddly easy. Bearing in mind last time I tried to stop I ended up so frantic I thought I was losing my mind, smoked 20 cigarettes in the space of 4 hours and resided in bed for following 3 days wallowing in self defeat. Nevertheless I’m not smoking here’s hoping when I’m back in the land of norm I don’t want to smoke again. I’ve wanted to stop forever. 
Off track again. So I’m up. Not up to the point of taking risks or trying to open up my chimney breast on my own, just up and aware. I get a lot done so it’s not that bad but what scares me is how high will I go, how long will it last and when will I fall. 
Falling is a fear that is not optional and you can’t run away from it no matter how much you try. I’ve struggled on and off with depression since I was 14. It’s cold, lonely, empty and bleak. I hate me. I hate my past I see no future. I torture myself. I cry 100+ times a day. I have to remind myself to move, to wash, all of this fits in around 4 kids, 3 school runs and 2 walks with the dog. I turn my phone off.  I hide as much as possible. I can’t do simple things like make a phone call or make any kind of decision. Music is also good at motivating when you’re too tired to think about functioning.
Panic takes over me all the time. My body freezes, mind goes into overdrive, I sweat, I shake, my heart races and the world around me stops and I’m left in a rabbit in the head lights sorta state. This takes over a big part of my everyday life. Stops me from doing a lot of things and takes an unmeasurable amount of energy to enable me to even take my children to school. I do what I have to and not a thing more.
I’m exhausted, each and every day I battle within my own head either to get in it, or out of it, to ignore it, to will it to work to plead that it will stop fuck it’s never ending. I feel like the grand old duke of York is my merciful minds master. Only difference being that when I’m only half way up I’m both up and down. 
I want to sleep. Go to bed fall asleep wake up tomorrow and not go through a million thought processes just to get the kids to school. I wanna come home and feel like joining in with the world and not feel the need to hoover and bleach my house from top to bottom or curl up and be swallowed. I wanna live. I’m so tired of this being a way of life coz it’s in no way a life. 
Please I just want to live. I don’t have an issue with speaking out openly and honestly about my mental health. All my life has been dictated by mental health issues not just my own. Mental health issues have taken so many things away from me…….My childhood, my friends, my relationship with my mother, my confidence, my self-belief and my father. I want it to stop taking now. I’m giving everything I have to keep it at bay It’s robbing me blind!!! It’s taking everything I have and all I wanna do is be it’s friend. 
BIPOLAR !!!!!!!"
2373,"Hi everyone

Hope we're ok today. Just a quickie...

Anyone on lithium who gets called in for Liver Function tests?? I've been sent letter to say mine is due. I had routine bloods done 7 weeks ago before I started lithium so maybe there was something abnormal. Anyway, I'm shitting myself a bit, and just wondered if anyone on lithium could throw some light on the subject?

Cheers"
2374,"I haven't been on any medication for two months now (found out I was pregnant, didn't want to take medication during but lost the baby)

Im not doing very well can't control my  moods and I know the easy first step is going back on the medication. But if I'm honest I don't think it helps much. And Im kind of tired of feeling this way all my life. And even somebody without mental health issues would surely be having a hard time with the events I have had the past few weeks. 

I don't know. Put bipolar aside, I just have so much baggage going on. So many haunting memories. Been considering private psychiatrist maybe. But I'm so faddy I don't know if I would stick to it.

I just think I am out of a lot of the dark environments now and yes things haven't been great lately but I don't want to spend my life constantly traumatised by my upbringing and family and abusive relationships. Something was pointed out to me the other day - nothing will ever make me happy nothing will ever be enough. Because I can't let go. 

There has to be some kind of release surely. 

Ah rambling."
2375,"A new study suggests there may be an overlap between rare genetic variations linked to bipolar disorder (BD) and those implicated in schizophrenia and autism.

The study, by researchers at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and published recently in JAMA Psychiatry, adds to the growing understanding that many psychiatric diseases share genetic roots, but is among the first to suggest a genetic overlap between bipolar disorder and autism.
