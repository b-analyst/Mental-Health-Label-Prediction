You ever go totally off the deep end?,1,mlraex,1,"I'm talking things like psychosis. I had the whole C-PTSD package, extremely depressed since my earliest memories, constant suicidal ideation/depression with chronic health problems and isolation, but that all paled in comparison to what happened a few years ago, which I suppose was the climax after all those years of buildup. I have no specific memories of that year, only the thoughts that passed through my mind and so I call it ""Hell year"" or just ""that year,"" I was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features which helps me remember that it actually happened.

My self-loathing and critic were so intense that I wouldn't allow myself the smallest luxuries and I was consciously dedicated to self-destruction and degradation. I'd physically harm myself as punishment for doing things like moving my eyes around. If I looked around a room, I'd get angry at myself for having the nerve to try and gather information about my environment. I would refuse to turn on lights for a similar reason and I'd often lock myself in a pitch-black room for hours on end and remain motionless. I once typed up 10 pages about the functions of hands and why I should be deprived of the privilege to move my hands, or how I didn't have the privilege to walk and decide where I was located in the world. I would try to analyze the structure of every emotion I felt and logically reason out why I should be incapable of experiencing that emotion since having emotions requires having relationships to entities or objects and since I can't have those relationships, I can't have emotions. It wasn't as easy to eliminate thoughts since thoughts appear randomly, so I tried to induce health problems to slow down the rate at which thoughts would appear in my brain.

There are a hundred more weird things I did but those are the first ones that come to my mind. I don't know what I'm looking for by sharing this humiliating information, I've just never talked about it before and I can't talk about it to anyone in person. I know it's not relatable for most. I've been crippled ever since that year, even though all those habits are gone I never managed to get a life going. Have any of you gone through something like this and scrounged together a life afterward?"
"Dissociation & holding off panicked tears during MRI, and being on my back...",1,mlq0rw,5,"
I had to have an MRI, and found between the *loud* sounds it made and being stuck on my back caused me to alternate between internal panic holding back tears (biting my tongue) and dissociating. I kept catching myself and ‘bringing myself back’ so I wouldn’t move or start sobbing during it and prolong the experience. Being “stuck” on my back is a major trigger for me; completely helpless feeling with disgust that washes over me. I wasn’t so much bothered with claustrophobia as others usually are in those as I was with my position; I had to stay in there like that for 40 minutes. 




I guess I’m just venting sadness and a stressful day. I hope I don’t ever have to have one of those again; along with an angiogram some years ago when I had to stay still on my back for *3 hours* (I did cry on and off then). *Miserable!*"
Selfishness vs. Self Care,4,mlpxg7,1,"I was trying to explain my thoughts to my therapist a few weeks ago about how I needed to figure out how to put myself first in my life but without going to the point of being completely selfish. Then the other day while reflecting on one of my dad's stupid rants I realized that I need to remember that sacrificing my comfort for the wellbeing of others is OK but sacrificing my wellbeing for the comfort of others is not.
Do things that are a little bit annoying but keep someone else safer, healthier, etc.
DON'T do things that are a detriment to your own mental or physical health to prevent someone else's annoyance.
Really just a long-winded version of don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm but I wanted to share."
My birthday is tomorrow. I wish I could just skip it.,2,mlpuor,1,"Tomorrow is my birthday, and it is just bringing up a whole bunch of things that I'd rather not think about or feel. My parents want to video call with me for dinner, but I don't want to spend that time with them. I also know that if I don't video call with them tomorrow, their feelings will be hurt. It just feels like they are performing the ""good parent"" role, aka ""good parents spend time with their kids on their birthdays."" And to be honest, it is so much emotional work to talk with my mom for extended periods of time that it seems like a terrible way to spend my birthday. 

I just keep going back to being a little kid and having to make decisions for my birthday that I didn't want to make (Where do you want to go to dinner? What specific present do you want? Where can I buy the specific present? Send me the Amazon link. What kind of cake do you want?). I always felt SO MUCH anxiety about picking a place for dinner that everyone would like or choosing a present that my parents would actually buy for me instead of telling me ""oh, you don't really want THAT."" 

My dream birthday would be for someone to plan a fun day/ dinner for me and not make me make any decisions, but my birthdays have always had to revolve around me making ALL the decisions for the day because that is easiest for them. They never cared about what I actually wanted (to have someone thoughtfully plan something they think I might like and take the burden of planning off of me), and have always just done the minimum to show everyone else that they're doing what parents are supposed to do. If they really knew me, they'd know that the way they ""celebrate"" my birthday doesn't actually make me feel thought of or cared about, and feeling thought of and cared about are the only things I really want for my birthday. 

I feel sad and lonely, and I'm grieving for the little kid who just wanted to feel seen and loved."
I'm starting to resent therapy?,1,mlptzq,3,"A little background: I was diagnosed with CPTSD in the last year, but (like everyone else) it's been constantly present since I was a kid. I tried to go to therapy at my undergrad but there was a shortage of therapists in my city so it was impossible to get an appointment. In the last year I've seen three therapists, one of which was the perfect match for me but since it was through my grad school CAPS program it was only short-term. I was recently moved to a long-term therapist, but I'm starting to resent therapy generally.

For some reason, I don't respond well to CBT. It's not that I don't do the work associated with it or I'm actively resisting my therapist and the treatment. It's more like I've done the work on my own for a long time, but the symptoms of CPTSD are still there. With my previous therapist we focused on what we both thought would be helpful and integrated different forms of therapy together. It was especially great because I would be able to research things on my own in between sessions and bring what I thought was interesting to my therapist. I told my current therapist about it and she said that would be a good idea, but I brought her ""The CPTSD Workbook"" because it's helpful to me and she basically said ""that isn't empirically tested so it's invalid"" and I spoke about ""The Body Keeps the Score"" and she said ""the author didn't actually do any research of his own so I don't recommend that book at all."" 

Since I'm a grad student in a pretty analytic-heavy program, I understand what she was saying. It's easy to be a guardian of your subject and gate-keep in that fashion without realizing it. I don't think she meant any harm by it and she didn't say it in such blunt terms, but you get the idea. 

In my last session she gave me a book to read called ""When Panic Attacks"" and I'm more than halfway through it. I use the daily mood logs to challenge negative thoughts whenever they come up, but these are (thankfully) few and far between because I've made a lot of progress in terms of anxiety. Still, I don't really like the book at all and find myself having to force myself to read it through before my next session. It feels a lot like blaming people with anxiety for their thought patterns without considering the causes of the problem in the first place, especially when it comes to trauma. Obviously the book is effective and has helped a lot of people so I don't want to discount that because parts of it have been helpful to me too! 

I also resent the fact that my therapist keeps saying ""when you get off substances you'll be better"" or ""everyone I've treated that has gotten off of substance has been better off."" I smoke weed at night using a pen because it's helpful to me. I have terrible insomnia, chronic pain, and it is nearly impossible for me to release the tension in my body. I only take one or two puffs before bed - not enough to get high - and it addresses all of the above. I stopped for two weeks and I couldn't sleep because the pain was too much, even with gabapentin and advil. I only started up recently because my lack of sleep is affecting my everyday life and emotional wellbeing. And even though my therapist says there's no judgement and that weed is preferable to medication, I just feel like I'm inadequate for having to rely on something to just be ""off"" enough to sleep. I also feel like I won't get better if I don't stop, even though it's not a ""problem"" per se. Even here I'm explaining myself away and that in itself is frustrating for me. 

I also get frustrated because why can everyone else walk around with their toxic af behaviors and not have to put in such hard work every single day? It's exhausting to heal and become better and sometimes I just want to give up. I feel like I constantly have to be on my best behavior and monitor myself every second, because if I'm not doing that I'm not getting better. So yeah, I'm starting to resent therapy."
Short term memory loss/confusion episode after triggering experience?,2,mlpsuf,2,"Ugh This is a bit long....sorry!  I could use some hot takes and support/advice on this.  *deep breath because this is hard to admit*

Last week I had a triggering gyno exam to investigate a problem I am having and found out I need some follow up procedures that are particularly problematic for me due to some past traumas.  I was upset but doing ok I thought.... I worked, did normal stuff for a week.  Then yesterday afternoon I had a period of about 6 hours at home where my husband says I was making sense when I talked, but was lost/confused, kept asking the same questions over and over, and appeared to have no short term memory.  I apparently acted like a person with a bad concussion or dementia.  I cannot remember any of it today - the whole thing just completely blank even when he describes our conversations and stuff we did it rings no bells at all.  Also things that happened the day before that I do remember fine feel like they happened a week ago, like time dilated or something.  

Pretty sure this episode was psychological in origin based on prior experiences.  The other time I had this sort of severe reaction (plus severe depressive symptoms not currently on my menu) I was hospitalized in a mental ward and the docs agreed it was definitely psychological that time.  That was 5 or 6 years ago.  This episode was a little different but similar enough to convince me it is my mind not my body doing this.  If it happens again I have agreed to see a medical doctor to make sure, since as a middle aged lady I know some things can get wacky with thyroid, hormones, etc.  Doctors are one of my triggers so I really hate to go down that road unless it is super urgent.

I do have a history of dissociation, time loss, and cognitive impairment when super triggered, but consider myself recovered for a few years now (25 years of therapy/meds before that recovery and I thought it was solid) and this episode took me completely by surprise.  I am physically a little shaky/panicky today but my mind is working though I am still kinda weirdly distracted.   I am having some crying jags today that start and stop abruptly, but have been able to talk with my spouse about the underlying traumas so I think I am getting through it without too much walling off....dunno.  

I called in sick to work out of caution (I have a somewhat tricky/hazardous job and cannot forget/lose focus at it) but feel like I can probably go back in a day or two assuming I stay on track.  I am going to try to journal/cry it out for awhile each day to try to discharge the emotion.  I graduated from therapy and meds last year and was hoping to still do some EMDR for some landmines like this that I know still hide in my mind, but unfortunately every therapist I checked is booked solid because everyone is struggling these days due to *gestures at everything going on in the world this year*.

Anyway, looking for some advice, reassurance, or commiseration from any others who may have this sort of experience in their journey.  I feel like I am losing my mind....again.

Unfortunately I still need to have this super triggering gyn test and biopsy procedure and am unsure how to handle it.  I told them I have a couple of flavors of PTSD and needed a little time to prepare myself before scheduling it but I really can’t put it off much longer.  Advice on navigating this in particular is welcome."
So how much social interaction do humans actually need?,1,mlpsm1,1,"I would say I'm an introvert. I have friends but I spend a majority of my time alone. Part of this is a coping mechanism. ""If no one is close to me I can't be hurt."" Type of thing and also the fact I'm an introvert and I gain energy from being alone. I'm also no contact with my whole biological family so  I don't have really many social connections. I do have a therapist and other professionals who help me.

I'm trying to work on it though, reach out to my friends more and spend more time with them. But I notice that after I spend just a few hours with them I need a week to recharge, even when they're my only actual social interaction I've had in a while. So how much social interaction do humans actually need?"

Tips for frontal lobe development?,1,mlpa1g,1,I find myself operating on an auto pilot that acts on hunches. Would love to know how I might be able to advance executive functioning.
on bad unproductive days,2,mlp7nf,1,What's something we should tell ourselves on the days where we accomplish mostly nothing? Today I was filled with anxiety. Spent most of the day in bed on my phone/watching TV. My brain just goes over all the negatives. Everything feels so heavy and I get so tired of fighting this battle....usually all I can do is remind myself every day won't feel like this. What about you guys?
So It Seems Going Out in Public Gives Me Immense Anxiety,2,mlp3h0,5,"I wrote a post a few days ago, and it briefly mentioned me going for a walk in the park. I’ve been trying to go on some exercises to get myself moving.

I went for a walk today and I came back home feeling horrible. I was exhausted. My mind has been foggy since. I feel so awful. As I was walking I felt like I was going to die. I still feel like this.

I’ve always been anxious going out in public. But it’s gotten much more difficult to manage the past few months.

I know I’m not the only person who struggles with this. I’ve read about other people feeling similar things, just different scenarios.

But… fuck man. I never realized my anxiety has been this bad. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this either. I don’t see my therapist until next Monday. We’re doing EMDR, but my visits with him are so spaced out that waiting becomes agonizing. I’m thinking of finding another therapist on an online service like BetterHelp. Someone to supplement my other therapist. I get so tired of waiting. And I need a professional I can keep in touch with.

If anyone has any advice, I’m willing to listen. For now I’m just spending the rest of my day in bed or taking it easy. I’m so tired."
"“Tapping the Healer Within: Using Thought-Field Therapy to Instantly Conquer Your Fears, Anxieties, and Emotional Distress” by Roger J. Callahan Phd",3,mlomvb,1,"The techniques I have learned from this book have been extremely helpful with emotional flashbacks/panic attacks that put me in a fight or flight panic state (or freak state.)

not a want, or a saving grace, but an emotional need. 
i tried really hard, but pleasing you makes me miserable, for i want to love you, and my heart is bleeding but a relationship for me, just feels like a ceiling. it traps me, squashes me down, an anxious feeling. breathing? meaning? find one, find both. i cant fit your relationship box, maybe i’m poly, or maybe i’m just broken. take her out the box, brush off the dust, hidden at the back of the shelf. open the engraved golden clasp, let the ballerina dance, smiling in bliss, none of this confusing romance. but this dolly is broken, someone damaged her in the night. stole her batteries, crossed her wires, convinced her he was right. before i met you, my only experiences were hollowing. love wasnt something worth swallowing, for sadly in this lady’s life, teachers touched school kids, abuse takes a life. tell someone you said? cut me open with a knife. see how my heart is mouldy and brown, lie me on the police station table, examine me for evidence, who cares if i’m mentally unstable? at worst he’ll get a few years and a mark by his name, sadly the victims too caught up in her own self indulgent blame. he still teaches, i checked, facebooks got that sorted! after that, your profile, i finally reported. because i don’t want my fucking abuser, to like my shiny new profile picture, notifications are off now, blocked in a flicker. and no matter how many instagram posts on self growth, feminist tweet or sexual assault statistic, no one will understand the way i miss you, it’s sadistic, ballistic, i’m screaming, but only silence echoes out. drowning, still just praying my parents don’t find out. they’d kill you, then me, at age seven? or age nine? see i can drag a straight line, from your hands up my school skirt, to the dirty living room floor, where i got fucked like a whore. it’s like sexual trauma makes you hot, the male gaze isn’t clandestine, it’s not wrapped in fine wine and sunshine, it’ll rip out your insides. devour your soul, keep your relationship, i’m doing just fine."
Feelings after a traumatic event,2,mlojzg,5,"TW: CSA, FT, EA
Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long read

So a bit of backstory about what brought me here. A little while back I had a pretty bad nervous breakdown in response to CT scan that told me I had mild brain atrophy for age. I had a follow up MRI that disproved it but the damage was done and I had convinced myself in that time period I had dementia. Now I still struggle with that thought, and every day I’m scared because I’ve been struggling with memory issues and some word retrieval stuff that was sudden onset after this traumatic event. Everyone keeps telling me I’m healthy physically but mentally I’m pretty unwell. In the past I was diagnosed with ADHD, MDD, and GAD but here recently my therapist and I have been talking about my extremely traumatic past. Here begins the TW: Essentially I was molested for a good portion of my childhood from about 3-11, parents divorced at 9, I was then forced to act normal around my abuser after the abuse was discovered and my family effectively covered it up for several years, my parents remarried, then divorced again two years later following my mother’s infidelity to my father, she then forced me to lie to the rest of my family about that which put further strain on everything, i then moved in with my mother and stepfather making things really bad, mom got pregnant and lost my only brother and then six months later I lost my grandmother, a year later I had to report my sexual abuse because I went to counseling at 17 which caused a huge case and family problems galore, all of my friends turned against me over the course of a summer then proceeded to drive me out of the college I was in during this time I lost my great grandmother, fast forward a couple years later my stepfather who ironically cheats on my mother decided to leave and make me have to care for my mother and little sister for a time before he came back. My life gets constantly uprooted and turned upside down. He told me to look into CPTSD and turns out I have a lot more in common here than I thought I did. I honestly wish I didn’t feel like I had dementia as being 22 it’s extremely unlikely but fear has really taken ahold of me."
I wish I could go back to high-functioning me,9,mlof8i,1,"That’s all. Life was easier when I put everything in a box and hid it. Now I see that box before me every day. Sometimes I look into it, but not much. I wish I could hide that box again but it keeps coming back. It was so easy to forget about it before, why can’t I do that any more. It’s annoying."
I turn 23 today,10,mlobi6,2,"It’s just after midnight where I am, and I turn 23 today. The last year has honestly been the hardest year of my life, and I can’t believe I made it. Just wanted to share"
can anyone else not hold a job due to fear of rejection/criticism?,5,mlo2k0,2,"I’m 21, and have had three jobs before — I walked out of all of them.

For example, when I was 16 at my second job, I walked out mid-shift after only four days, because the coworker training me told me in front of a customer, “You should know how to do this by now!”

I was flooded with so much panic. That black dread that always comes with rejection/criticism. They were both staring at me and it felt like I was collapsing in on myself. I literally ran out and never went back.

Looking back I know my response was totally disproportionate to the situation but it really felt like I was going to die. It’s been like this every other job since, too. I know it comes with the territory, but I’m really terrified of criticism.

Does anyone relate? Have advice?"
The only time I've felt that life is even worth living is when I've been in a relationship.,2,mlnwo6,1,"I seriously cannot understand how anyone can be happy single.  When I'm in a relationship, I take so much better care of myself and I just feel more alive in general. When I'm not, it's like my brain is like ""aight I'm out"" and then unplugs itself and I'm left floating through life. When I'm lucky enough to feel anything, it's usually intense anger, self hatred, or anxiety."
Repairing ties with family?,1,mlnkoz,2,"I was wondering if anyone else here whose family has been affecting by things has been able to restore a good bond with them?

My family went through some long term trauma, and now, through no fault of their own, I find it very hard to trust/be close to my mum and step-dad. Even looking them in the eyes is very difficult for me. I'm not sure why this is. Maybe I'm subconsciously being avoidant or defensive.

Would family therapy be worth looking at?

Also, can anyone relate?"
I am tired. I am scared. I am angry. But I will never hate. I wish I could. It would be easier that hope.,5,mlniyf,5,"Some explanation: I am diagnosed with CPSTD, depression, and anxiety. I wrote this to help me articulate my feelings. To help people understand that they are not the only ones who are feeling this way. To release these feelings, to help me process and understand them more. I’m trying to convince myself that I’m not doing this for attention, or validation, but I am still and feeling guilty over this. Maybe one day I won’t be.

I thought life was supposed to be enjoyable. It’s not. The only thing keeping me going is the hope that one day it might be. That I won’t feel hatred for myself. That I wont feel guilt for eating food people give me. That my car will have working ac and windshield wipers, and up to date registration. That my shoes won't have holes in them. That I’ll be able to stop sewing patches in my pants. That I’ll be able to sleep at night without waking up not knowing where I am. That I won't have to rely on anyone ever again. I’ll be able to afford my medications. I haven’t bought myself shoes in two years. That I’ll have more than -40 dollars in my bank account. I won’t feel guilt for telling people I’m not okay. I hope that one day I’ll be able to tell people that I’m not okay. The hope that one day I won’t flinch when people try to hug me. That I can look up and know where I am and what year it is at all times. That I won’t feel abandoned. That I won’t feel crushing guilt for every kind word someone tells me. That I won’t feel like an imposter in my own life. That I won’t feel like I have to be happy around everyone. That people realize that my normal personality isn’t joyful. That my joy is a mask to make everyone else feel comfortable around me. 

I used to believe that if you worked hard, that if you made all the sacrifices, you would be happy. But I’m afraid that I can never be happy. 

Yet through all of this, I don’t really feel hateful. I feel tired. I feel suicidal. I feel guilt towards myself and disappointment at others. I’m angry at God. Because of the sense of justice he gave me. I’m angry that he lets people do terrible things in his name. I’m angry at Christians for not being loving. I don’t understand. How can people hate? I’ve had trials and tribulations that have broken me. I hate my life, but I will never hate people. It would be easier if I could. It would be easier if I didn’t care. I could walk away from it all. But I love. I feel too deeply. I’m angry at God because of that. Why did he have to do this to me. Why did he have to make me feel this much. I don’t want to. I want it to end. 

I want to make others feel love. I never want others to feel the way I do. I guess that’s how come I don’t share. Because its easier to keep it inside. I guess its kind of selfish. I don’t want to deal with the pity. I don’t want to deal with the sympathetic pats on the shoulder. I don’t want to explain myself to people. I don’t want to defend my feelings. I’m comfortable here in misery. It’s all I know now. Life isn’t enjoyable, but I hope that one day it may be."
The thing with boundaries,5,mlnh19,2,"They’re putting A LOT of perspective on how badly I was mistreated. I set boundaries with the people around me and they’re usually like “okay thanks for letting me know. I respect it.” But when I did that with people who used to be in my life, ex friends, ex therapists, my biological family. They’d get passive aggressive and do war campaigns on me. Like wow... 🤯"
Peeling the layers,10,mlnelz,1,"First I've realized that I can say no.

Then,

I've realized that I can want things.

I've realized that I decide.

I've realized that I deserve respect.

I've realized that people can lie.

I've realized that I was betrayed, that I was abused.

Then,

I've realized that I don't know who I am.

I've realized that I don't know what I want.

I've realized that I've never lived, that I was abused to be a mere Pavlovian doormat obeying puppy.

I've realized that my time is limited.

I've realized that I'll never get it back, and now I need to face the paradoxical consequences of it.

I've realized that I have feelings - ""I am sad"", ""I am happy"", not sure how it works yet.

I've realized that what people say I am, isn't necessarily true.

I've realized that I can enforce boundaries, that if I say no, it is A no.

I feel like it's too late to live my life, soon, in a blink of an eye, I'll be 30, the same way, without noticing, I turned 20.

It's depressing, I'm a mess, I'm trying to make it, but it's hard and I don't want to give up on my dreams, if, they're even MY damn dreams.

J'accuse! I blame! I blame my parents, my family, the bullies, the useless therapists, I BLAME.

They were all either straight abusive, lazy, blinded by their own disbelief, I blame them for messing it up.

Now, I've got to repair this broken man.

There's a saying - ""It's easier to build strong children than repair broken man"" and oh how true it is.

Because this broken man, and yes, I am broken, needs to repair himself, take of his inner child and prepare for his future self, and it's daunting, tiring and I'm on pits of despair.

The thoughts of what if, should've, could've terrorize my serenity.

This is my life unfortunately, this is it.

And fuck it, I am a victim. I'm not victimizing myself. That's what fate has given me - To be a victim of never being truly loved by your parents. To never know what true love is (except from Grandma). To never have a happy fulfilling childhood and teenage years.

This is my hand, but I'll play it well, hopefully.

I'm sad, as being realistic, I'll want to have children, but how can I have children, or even think about children, when there's this child here, this poor child who wanted love, warmth, recognition, inclusivity, a comforting shoulder and a listening ear which he never truly got?"
Compulsive picking,9,mln3zs,15,"I've always compulsively picked. My skin, hair, nails, anything. I've recently been compulsively combing my dog to get his dandruff out. I'll literally ignore the rest of my life to give into this compulsion. Anyone else?"
And it continues!,2,mln3pn,6,"First time poster here, long time lurker.

Both parents are awful and I am completely NC with my mom. Several years ago she found out my phone number and I can't remember how. Ultimately I blocked her from calling. The fun part is about my cell phone provider is that when you block a number, it doesn't ring but my phone notifies me that the blocked number had called. She is also allowed to leave voicemails that I can listen to. That is pretty much not helpful at all and triggers me every time she calls. At least it doesn't ring so I don't feel compelled to answer and get into a fight. 

Well she has now decided to enlist her friends to call and harass me now! Got a lovely text that said ""What a horrible young woman you are to do such things to your mother. You will regret it. Your Mother is one of the nicest and generous people I know. You should get to know her. You must not take after her. Good luck. I wont contact you again."" 

The last time this individual texted me I said no more texts would be tolerated and they would be considered harassment and therefore I would be filing charges. I called the police department of where my mother lives (i moved out of state) amd they told me that I needed to contact my local jurisdiction. Well I don't wanna do that because then when they call my mom to tell her to stop they will have to announce which department they are calling from. Then she will know what city I live in and that can't happen. 

She abused me, and abandoned (and probably abused) my two older half brothers. She ended up stalking one of them so I am afraid she will find where I live and show up unannounced. 

Dunno what the point is here but I'm just upset that I am 31 and she refuses to leave me alone."
I think I have CPTSD,4,mln32g,4,"I have ADHD and an onslaught of physical health issues. I also grew up in a very abusive home. 

I get into these anxious feedback loops when something triggers me but I always thought it was my ADHD brain causing this to happen. I dissociate but I thought that was ADHD too because of how inattentive I can be.

Yesterday my landlord spoke to me extremely aggressively. It reminded me of how my father used to scream at me. I cried for hours and I dissociated for the entire day. I barely felt connected to reality at all. It has never been that bad but what I realize is the few episodes that came close to being that bad have always been instances where someones behavior reminded me of my father. Every time.

I brought up CPTSD to my therapist this morning and she said that it seems very probable to her and she’s thought so for some time now. 

Tbh it makes a lot of sense as about 4 years ago I started zoning out and losing chunks of time. My perception of time was way off. My previously sharp memory got so foggy I could barely remember the names of people I’d met multiple times or knew back in high school. I thought it was my ADHD so I went back on meds, but I didn’t see much of an improvement. Now I think I might know why. 

This is ruining my life. I think I’m going to have a productive day, I get triggered, and it’s all over. I spend the day in bed. I can’t go on like this anymore. Has anyone here found treatment that helps? Was it hard getting diagnosed?"
So sick of feeling miserable,7,mln2av,1,"Not even just the mental and emotional aspect anymore. My body is usually tense. Past three days though it's been extra tense and rigid combined with almost anxiety shaking. I'm already sore from an injury, but I thought I was getting better. The past three days though it's just been constant rigid shaking and I feel choppy. It feels like the aftereffect of a crash, but without the crash. 

It doesn't go away and stuck in the environment that damaged me and their snide comments are just icing on the cake. I can't even cry it just turns to uncontrollable laughter. So sick of bullshit and misery and shit stacking. I hate feeling it all just shut down. I try to heal and do what I'm supposed to do and something else waves over to drown me or stacks. 

Over and over and over and over and over until I just don't know. So many cravings and needs not being met and getting burned and now I'm physically getting screwed.

And nsfwish, but it's been rough and been lonely, but terrified of people so I tried just soloing myself a bit to try to relax and I couldn't even do that. I tensed up so much I couldn't even move. Just ended up crying and frustrated. 

Now I need to eat and I want actually food and there is just unhealthy crap they got and I can't afford to get anything better and just so stressed and irriated about so much pent up shit. There's no one to go to. No comfort physically or mentally here. I'm beyond my limits just irratable and hurt so much I'm angry and I don't want to be."
"When I was 21, I had the police pull a gun on me because I was suicidal",27,mlmrah,7,"I've never told anyone the whole story before. I had a friend call 911 on me because I was suicidal and alone. He told me he had done it, so I was waiting for emergency services come. I was expecting paramedics. But when I opened the door it was the police. They told me to step outside, and I did, but when I closed the door behind me and turned back to face them, I realized the officer closest to me had his gun drawn and pointed right at me. I was 21, 5'8, 115lbs of weeping mess. I didn't have a weapon or anything in my hands. Just a young woman in pajamas and sandals who wasn't sure how to keep being alive when she was in so much pain.

All that was going through my head was, they're going to shoot me and the newspaper won't say my name. It will say, mentally ill woman, but it won't say my name. And no one will care because I have a history of psychosis and therefore I'm not a real person. He shouted hands up, and I put my hands up. He told me to turn around. I did, and then he told me hands behind my back and then they cuffed me and told me to sit on the steps. And after a short while of sitting there, they picked me up and threw me in the back of their car and when I couldn't cry quietly enough they yelled at me to shut up and then I'm pretty sure I just froze, all the way to the ER.

I never told anyone because I thought I deserved it because I was suicidal. I never told anyone because I thought they would judge me for being afraid. But ever since I've always been so frighrened of the police. Every time I see another mentally ill person has been killed during a wellness check, I'm thinking, it could have been me. It could have been me so easily."
getting anxious about antidepressants,3,mlmmp9,4,"i have been on 20mg of prozac since the end of 2016, so about 5 years now. im getting anxious about how long i’ve been on it and it’s possible effects on my brain. im also worried if i’ll ever be able to get off them :(( does anyone have any experience with this or insight?"
[Trigger Warning] Domestic violence survivor 8 years later...still hiding and living in fear,3,mlmlet,1,"Hi there. I was in an abusive (physical, mental, sexual) relationship for 7 years. From age 15-22 years old. My abuser (ex bf) physically isolated me from the world. I was imprisoned in my bedroom for many years and was told he would kill me if I left the house. When I finally decided to leave him, he stalked me every day and threatened my life 100x per day for almost a year after.  I am now 30 years old. I have worked hard to get my driver's license, put myself through college, and now I am in grad school after a lot of trial-and-error, dropping, enrolling, depression, etc.

People are often so proud of me when they hear my story and what I am doing now. However, I still live in fear every day of my life. Although I have moved to a new city to create distance between myself and my abuser, I still stay up at night wondering if he has found me or if I will wake up to him in my home, or in a parking lot, etc. Because of this, I have always stayed anonymous online. I don't even write my name on packages I order. I just use my initials or a fake name. I have one social media account and I don't even use my real name on it (it's private, as well). I also ask family to not post photos of me.

My current problem is that I am getting close to graduating with my Master's degree and entering the professional world. With that comes LinkedIn pages and other online portfolios. Also, the profession I am going into requires that I have my name, photo, degrees, etc. on a webpage. I am afraid of making waves and refusing to do it if I land a job.  This would mean that my abuse could easily google my name and find the location I work at.

I've considered changing my name but I am so attached to my name and it would break my family's heart. Plus, in my education, degrees, and internships- I am known by my real name. If I get hired at my internship, I feel like they would be confused by a name change.

Friends and family get annoyed with me when I bring this up and tell me to stop being so egocentric and that my abuser had moved on and so should I. They don't understand that I am always in survival mode and it won't go away.

Any advice on this topic would be so helpful. Or anyone that has been in a similar situation?"
Crave for physical contact but flinch at it,8,mlmjut,2,"I hate this. today i had an awful experience at hospital. i had to have a biopsy done with about 5 minutes notice (didn't go to hospital for a biopsy)

so that was pretty traumatic - 2 stitches.
but what i wanted to talk about; The nurse touched me on my back.. bare skin and i flinched like she was a hot flame.
Then... she stuck a large needle into my back that i was forewarned would really hurt! and i was totally accepting and willing to endure it. if theres anything im good at its tolerating pain... i think i thought maybe at some point

no emotional response merely physical 'nerve ending' response.
But her touch terrified me. it was like being electrocuted. she said sorry my hands are cold.... but that was just a convenient excuse for me. she was really nice so i think she may have been helping me out there.
i had an emotional freak out from her merely touching me but a metalic needle causing me pain feels safe somehow.
Im feeling pretty damn alone right now after that feels like i have a literal bubble around me- im not personable!!!!"
"I have this intense need to make absolutely sure that the things I do are truly mine, not forced by somebody else, not influenced by somebody else. But that it's me.",9,mlmfvm,2,"I feel a bit dumb writing this, but I have this intense need to make things my own way. I feel like I've lacked an identity for so long and I fawned a lot during my teens especially that it became weird to even hear somebody say my name out loud. I couldn't connect that to me. 

Honestly I still quite struggle with who I am, I can't for the life of me say who I am if somebody asks me what I like or who are you. I get so confused and I try to really intensely research everything and rationalise (which I think is more of a flight response) to try and decide on very simple things. 

So here's where I'm at. I will literally spend hours just deciding on a product, whatever it is, is this the right match for me, is it truly me, was I influenced by somebody to get this. I need to truly feel that a clothing is mine, the food I eat is my choosing, the book I read is my choosing, the activities I do are my choosing. It's truly tiresome way of living. And maybe linked to my OCD, but I just don't feel good about things if I feel at all that they're not my choosing. Is it part of hypervigilamce or what, but I feel almost infantile trying to protect whatever small pieces of identity I've gathered together."
The only time i feel alive and like myself is when i am high on weed. (obvious triggers inside),3,mlmb80,1,"Preface: I am male, i am in my 40s, am drunk, i am angry and frustrated. Continue reading at your own peril. But thank you if you do!   
Trigger warning for sexual things.  

The title pretty much says it all.  
I do not really feel by body, i do not really feel emotions. I do not ""feel"" most of my body parts.  
I do not notice when i need to pee or need to poo in a reasonable time.  

When i feel like i need to pee, my bladder is about to burst.  
When i gotta poo, it is either, be on the toilet in 30 minutes or you shit your pants.  

I have a active sexual desire but i can not stand being touched. I do not enjoy being touched.  
But i still have this intense longing for some human connection.  
Most of my time among humans is spend calculating ""what would someone normal do"" and come up with a appropriate response.  
There are parts of my body that are not ""there"" for 95% of the days i spend awake.

The only time i feel connected to other humans is when i am high on weed.   

I spend 3 months as out patient and after that, a full 12 months living full time in a psychiatric facility.   
That means i slept maybe 5 days out of 365 of a year *not* in the loony bin.  
For 360 days i slept, ate, worked and lived in that place.  
Because i wanted to get myself together.  

But it did not help. They did not listen. After i talked about this, once, they just labeled me as a ""self medicating addict"" and just stopped caring beyond that.  
And this is not something my head made up, i got it in print, 30 pages worth of discharge papers saying just that. Despite me only talking about drugs like 2 or 3 times.  

I know why i distrust people, plenty of them have abused of tortured me.  
But this is beyond that, they ruined the connection between me and my body.  
When i am alone, in the dark, at home, in my bedroom, under the covers... i still do not feel good, safe and fulfilled.  

For the past year i could not even spend 60 bucks (i do not have) for a hooker just to get a hug and some comfort.  
Because corona has shut down every last brothel in my entire country.  

I am 40 and the only thing i want from live is to just once, just once, wake up next to someone who does not want to get away as soon as they open their eyes...  

I CANT EVEN GET A HUG I PAYED FOR! FOR FUCKS SAKE!  

FUCK YOU ALL WHO THINK CORONA IS NOT ALL THAT BAD!  

And fuck you with a rusty rake to everyone who is married or in a relationship who told me ""we all got it bad"".  
NO ASSHOLE! You do not. I talked 20 words to another human being in the last week.  
All talking to the person at the register when buying groceries."
Anyone feel like they need a slower pace of life because of all the trauma? Or wonders who they’d be instead without it?,9,mlm67j,1,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m not trying to discredit myself at all. I have suffered a lot of abuse in my life at the hands of both parents and ex partners and am surprised I can even get up and face the day sometimes.

I was very high functioning when I was younger, very academic, sociable, outgoing. 

A girl I work with is the same age and I just marvel at her, she works 7 days a week right now (4 in a lab and 3 with me in our retail job) runs a finance insta and is so educated about money, has solid friends, and is in her third year studying medicine.

I try not to compare myself but I look at her and think that if I had a better upbringing, that could have been me. 

Instead I am working just to keep my head above water, I don’t have any passions or career path and I feel like I’m not getting ahead. I almost feel frozen and not able to live my life as effectively as I should be"
So I might be traumatized again,2,mllmpk,6,"TW: Abuse and child trafficking mention, car accident 

So I already was traumatized over my parents and the multiple abusive relationships I was in and being child trafficked for a bit, and then about a week or  so ago I watched my dog get hit by a car. It’s been kinda affecting me a lot, when I hear car horns or tires screeching or beeping I get freaked out and I’m so worried about it happening again. But it also feels ridiculous, my parents have said it so many times. He’s not injured at all and we’re so blessed and all, which we are. I just kinda can’t get over it. He luckily just bounced off then ran away loudly whining instead of going under.. So I feel kinda over dramatic to be affected this way

Thoughts on learning a musical instrument as a way to help rewire your brain?,3,mlljlq,5,"I don't know much about this topic at all, so I'm on a lil bit of a limb here. 

I've had CPTSD since I was a toddler (31 now) and have tried many forms of therapy, including neurofeedback and EMDR, to help my situation. Haven't made much progress with any of them. About a year and a half ago I tried a session of Accelerated Resolution Therapy that basically short-circuited me and escalated my situation into a full-blown panic disorder in which I felt panicked at everything my body did and was constantly convinced that I was actively dying. So I guess that session stirred something up. 

Since then I've gotten my B12 and D deficiencies tended to -- which helped significantly! Take your supplements, people! -- and started exercising and sleeping with a weighted blanket. I keep wanting to try meditating but having to stay still for anything is a major trigger for me. 

I keep hearing about how specifically learning music helps with neuroplasticity and adaptability, and in theory it makes sense. I was just wondering if anyone here had experience with that. If I take up an instrument it'll be a bit of a financial investment and I want it to be worthwhile."
I'm so tired of being tired,4,mlldo4,2,"I've been in trauma-specific therapy for almost two months now, and I know it's vital that I get treatment. I avoided my trauma for years using alcohol, and I've been more or less sober for about four months. I knew that trauma therapy would be hard, but I had no idea how hard. Some days I just want to give up because the world seems so much darker, so colorless. My therapist and my boyfriend both tell me how much work I'm doing, and that I'm doing great, and that I'll get through this, it just takes time. I get that. But I'm so tired all the time now. I quit my part time job because I was having constant panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, and some days I just can't find the motivation to do much more than get out of bed. I feel worse than I can remember feeling. It just sucks that even though I'm doing everything I can, or maybe because I am, I still feel like shit all the time, and I still want to die every day. I know I'm moving forward, but it feels like I'm going backwards. I feel like I'm swimming with all my might against a much stronger current, and I'm doing good if I can stay in place."
Fearing psychosis,4,mllahs,2,"For a long time I've had an ever present fear that I'm going crazy. That I'm losing it and I'm going through psychotic episodes. But at the same time I don't think I am. I just think I'm really afraid. 
Is this common?"
Not sure what I’m experiencing anxiety/panic attack/ something else?,2,mlkxsd,1,"After going out and reading about anxiety and panic attacks, I’m more confused about what I am experiencing.  

To paint the picture what happened - an appointment got changed from a 1300 to 1130. I didn’t mentally register the change, and neither did my calendars. When I missed the appointment I was having full blown fight or flight adrenaline surges. I think it’s a combination trigger flashback, as much of my trauma from childhood was from not picking up on instructions due to an LD. 

Any help/suggestions on identifying this? 

Closest thing I found was I over in  r/cptsdfight - but that isn’t exactly this."
I have to see my parents at my grandma's funeral tomorrow. How do I keep my sanity?,2,mlkxgu,2,"They don't know about my diagnosis, and I have no interest in telling them about it. I don't want to see them, let alone give them hugs pretend everything is ok. But if I don't, they'll get pissed and demand to know why I'm acting distant. They'll also be mad when I tell them I don't want to get dinner after the funeral.

When they see me acting normal around my brother and distant around them, they'll wonder if I've been talking to my siblings in secret. (I have. They're are all leaving the Mormon church, and my parents think I'm ""leading them astray"", which is ridiculous. My siblings reached out to me after their faith crises for support.)

Losing my grandma is hard enough without having to deal with my parents' shit. What do I do?"
"If childhood trauma is so common, why do only some of us develop CPTSD?",18,mlktd6,13,"I was thinking about this lately after talking with a friend about his childhood. He had a horrible childhood too, his father was an alcoholic and his mom was mean and dismissive. He confessed it all to me while he was drunk one night. But he’s doing well for himself. He struggles with certain things like addiction and whatnot, but he’s overall doing really well for himself. 

I had a horrible childhood and developed C-PTSD. He had a horrible childhood, and managed to stereotypically flourish outside of a few things. Why does this happen? What’s the difference?

Edit: to clarify, HE was the one that told me he’s doing well for himself. He told me he has addiction but doesn’t make a big deal of it because he’s had so many successes in his life"
A thank you to people over here,15,mlknv7,2,"Thank you for sharing your stories over here. The last few months have been terrible for me. Knowing that other people are struggling through something similar gives me a strange sense of community, a result of our tribalistic mindset perhaps."
Does PTSD make anyone else feel like they embody two different thought patterns?,1,mlknoj,2,"Okay my question might be a little hard to explain, but basically I’m extremely self aware of my ptsd and anytime I have an intrusive thought I immediately recognize it and I sort of split that thought off from myself. In a way I feel like this creates two very different ways of thinking in my mind because there’s my PTSD brain that gives me reminders of my trauma & then there’s what I call my normal brain, which I feel is my regular self. Does this happen to anyone else? PTSD for me really just feels like it’s an intruder trying to get me to feel bad about things I had no control over."
I'm losing friends.,6,mlkhak,4,I've never had many friends. Just one or two friends who I am losing because of my fight with my trauma and insecurity. I used to trust them enough to confide my problems (not all). They've become judgemental and easily irritable. I do not talk to them everyday but whenever I do they make me feel like a burden. It's come to a point where we have stopped talking. I feel absolutely alone with no one to turn to.
DAE love/dislike well written characters?,2,mlkg6q,5,"The better a character is written the more real it seems. This also means I feel the character’s emotions better. I am currently struggling to disconnect taking on other people’s emotions.

Have absolutely no memories of the traumatic events,4,mlka1s,2,"When I was a kid I had no memory of my childhood before the age of 5 but I was riddled with anxiety and nightmares of events I had no idea about. I had no recollection of what happened in those early years and nobody in my life would tell me until earlier this year when I finally reconnected with my half sister who proceeded to recount all of those events, and having the blanks filled in finally was both enlightening and terrifying. It’s scary that such a important moment of my life just got erased like that. Did anyone else have this happen to them?"
How does someone who neglects and hates them selves learn how to love them selves?,9,mlk2yx,4,I feel like I have never loved my self. How can I start? What is a good way start? I tried affirmations but they don't really seem to work. Can you please give tips?
I'm done.,4,mljmaq,1,"Called it quits today with someone who works with me to try and find, well, work. I live alone and am only able to afford this because of receiving some type of disability. Started drinking again so that the bad thoughts stop since meds never help and just make me gain weight when I'm already huge and disgusting and I can hardly afford them. Not looking forward to therapy tomorrow.

I'm avoiding certain people so that I don't have to answer any more of their questions, as I never know how to respond, their questions frustrate me, and because I just give up for now. Maybe forever. I'm not open to talking to anyone about this in depth because no one understands, or it's not their problem. I feel guilty trying to talk to them when they're busy/already stressed with their own problems. Most of all, ultimately, I feel like no one actually cares about me that much. That could very well be false, but it's just how I feel, especially when I get like this, and no one's here.

Then again, I pretend to be okay, and like I said, I avoid talking about it. However, it's hard to open up when you feel this way. And any comfort received will feel superficial. I'll also feel pathetic since I feel like they're pitying me and that makes me even less open to talking about this to anyone."
How do I get my heart rate down?,7,mljllr,13,"I am overwhelmed in the amount of triggering information I got a few days ago. I am not okay. I think I have been stuck in an emotional flashback to a time when I was 7 and I was abused horrifically the entire night. I just found out my sisters are all going through the same thing and my heart just keeps pounding and pounding.

I went to the doctor and he didn't seem to take me seriously. Gave me all of 60 seconds to explain my symptoms. Gave me hydroxyzine, 25mg tablets. They aren't helping.

Meditation has helped a little but I have work and cannot meditate for most of the day.

Does anyone else know of a medicine that helped or how they can get themselves out of the emotional flashback?"
Obsessed with Revenge,7,mljb6n,3,"What's the link between C-PTSD and obsession with revenge? I have this A LOT and don't understand it.

the tough it up mindset,12,mlj56c,7,"my dad just tried to get me to read a book that he hasnt read yet, says ""its a true story about a guy who had a horrific childhood and got through it through just sheer mental toughness and discipline""

for some reason, this short interaction has made me incredibly drained and sad. for someone to overcome such tragedy and abuse and still ""get through it"" whereas i can hardly order at starbucks without freaking out is...humiliating. something along those lines. my dads values are along those lines of discipline, that if someone has a mental illness theyre just not trying hard enough to not have it. the type of person who didnt want my sister on medication for depression. somehow so smart, yet so in denial of science, and yet i still care that he would be disappointed if he knew how broken i am from him. i would be seen as lazy and manipulative, just as he saw my sister. i hate this ""suck it up, push through it with discipline"" mindset. its led me to extreme isolation and my mental health issues worsening. im disappointed that there are self help books like this, but then again, i guess anyone can write a book about anything. it doesnt mean its correct just because its in a book.

it also saddens me because its pretty hypocritical for him to advocate for ""mental toughness"" and ""discipline"" when he so often goes against his own values, yet getting angry at others when they dont follow them. im realizing the greatest thing i struggle with is validating my own pain. im so tired."
Guidance needed,2,mliyht,1,"I recently got out of a very difficult relationship after 10 years being together. My ex boyfriend had been cheating, emotionally and physically, for more than half of the relationship. And as you can imagine, the relationship itself was full of Gaslighting, manipulation, lying, etc. In addition to the cheating. 

Since I got to know about the years of cheating. I've not reacted in the way I expected to. There's been very little crying, feelings of hurt etc. It almost feels like I'm watching from afar as this trauma unfolds in someone else's life. 

That being said, I'm also unable to come to terms with the end of the relationship. It almost feels wrong and that I'm clinging onto some lost sense of hope of us being together. I'm not sure what this feeling is. 

Can you pls help me unpack these feelings? I've been doing some research and I'm not sure if this qualifies as a trauma bond/PTSD/anything else."

My wonderful marriage of bullying and physical abuse,5,mlgzy8,1,"I’m 41. When I was 12, one of my frequent bullies hit me square in the forehead with a rock. I passed out and had a few stitches in my head. There is still residual tissue under my skin from the initial swelling. 

I was thinking about this incident, and I remembered that for quite awhile afterwards, the whole world would shake and I’d loose my balance.  I know realize this was the result of a concussion. 

The long-lasting effects of a concussion?  Irritability, concentration and memory problems, and depression. 

So combine those with the anxiety that comes from my job, and it sets me up for all kinds of fun. After periods of prolonged stress, the part of my brain that can regulate my irritability starts to get overwhelmed and it fails. 

I’m in a period like this right now. I’m trying to do work but I wind up in full shut down mode almost weekly.  My manager is supportive, but all I want to do is quit so I can curl up in a ball and not move."
Emotional Flashbacks from Boredom,2,mlgs7u,1,"I'm new to accepting I have C-PTSD and identifying/making connections around flashbacks.

Does anyone else ever have emotional flashbacks triggered by boredom?

I have ADHD but I also realize some of my ADHD symptoms are actually trauma symptoms.

However...

 I've noticed sometimes I feel antsy in an annoying sort of way that tends to stem from ADHD. It's irritating to be bored but I can laugh about it.

And other times, like if I don't take a walk on my lunch break (I'm an admin assistant and spend a lot of time at my desk) or do tasks that require getting up throughout the day (like making copies or filing)... by the afternoon I start to get those ""I wish I could die"" type thoughts and dissociated feeling like I do in a flashback. 

I'm wondering if it could be because I associate boredom and having to sit still even though it's not what I need with being trapped?

A decent part of my cptsd comes from religious trauma (and I'm a part of that subreddit too). I spent a lot of time since childhood stuck sitting in services or youth/college groups, forced to be there by either my parents or my own gaslighting of myself, having horrible, scary, and/or toxic  teachings forced down my throat, often by people I have what seems like an unreasonable hatred for today. Teachings that have really messed up my self esteem and relationship with my body, esp being a woman.

I'm not sure if I provided enough (or too many) details. Does anyone else get triggered this way?"
Am I a monster for not being affected by my traumatic childhood?,5,mlgobq,5,"I'm perfectly aware of what happened to me and I remember every detail. I've never repressed it, I've never been hypersexual, I've never had any symptoms that other people had after similar experiences. It's almost as if I didn't find my past traumatizing. I don't feel anything when I think about it, I don't hate the person who did it to me. I don't feel scared or angry or hopeless or disgusted with myself. I'm wondering whether it makes me sick or it's just a part of the process."
I guess I’m in recovery?,4,mlgnd9,1,"I still get dysregulated.  But for three or four weeks I have felt good. I have encountered a few major triggers and haven’t frozen or dissociated. Been in some minor and major arguments and haven’t frozen and have been able to think and find my words.

Of course I do get triggered and can have a morning into the evening disrupted. But I’m able to function and think and feel. There is not much escalation beyond my body clenching up. I don’t rabbit hole into shame or fear. I’m not devolving into a depression nest or feeling like I’m going to die.

The loud neighbors don’t bother me as much. And I don’t think I’m dissociated. 

I’ll have to see if this continues into the holidays as that’s when I seem to get the most wired.
Heck my mom doesn’t invite me to holidays anymore  and I’m not triggered by it. (She likes to try to punish me for not wanting to be around my abuser). Maybe a little sad but it’s so much better that having to fight about my feelings.

I learned about cptsd around this time last year. And have had two therapists since. I’ve almost come to terms with my ex best friend. The social trauma of that has calmed and it still bugs me but it’s better. I’m planning to get rid of the last thing of hers some time this summer. Through fire! Ritualistic burning of my journal depicting her stuff and my own trauma reactions. 

I’ve come to terms with my first ex and his stuff. And I have a better understanding of my abuse and the home life before that. I maintain my boundaries for the sake of my inner child. She will never be put in harms way again.

I can call for my job. Sometimes I may have to breath and recover after but I can do it. I can just hang up on people. Telemarketers and rude insurance reps. Boom no longer letting them rule my life because I have to be polite and not hurt their feelings.

Still have dark intrusive thoughts but that’s usually a flash back and my grounding methods are helping.

I’m not healed and it’s still early, but these all mark recovery to me! Only time will tell. I think I’m just writing this to say Thankyou to the community! Reading your stories and just the general support helped me get here. I’ll probably move my activity more to CPTSDnextsteps as I don’t think I’m helping much here anymore.

I hope everyone can continue their healing journey, and I’m just putting good energy out there for y’all. You deserve to be human! You deserve to live a life in the way you need, and to love freely!"
Still feeling like it was my fault.,2,mlgh0d,1,"I had a moment of clarity earlier, while experiencing an emotional flashback. I was feeling that helplessness from when my dad was angry at my mom for a decision she made in parenting. She was letting me off easy on some homework that didn’t matter (an art project), and my dad was pissed and making it into a big deal. Because the whole situation was about *my* art project, I felt like it was my fault that my dad was angry, and I felt so helpless to stop it. That outburst is the only time I ever remember my dad getting physically abusive. Toward the end of the fight, he shoved my mom and then he walked out the door to go for a walk. 

So here I am, almost 20 years later, and sometimes I still get triggered back to those feelings. Even though I can objectively see the scenario and how the only person at fault was my dad (being a total asshole), I still *feel* down deep that it was my fault. 😕"
Pretend you were someone else?,6,mlg9xn,1,"This was mostly when I was younger. I remember imagining the lives of my peers. A healthy family, good friends, etc. I would pretend I was living through them and I basically assumed their lives were perfect. Was I just that weird of a kid or was this a coping mechanism for anyone else?"
Seeing Family Again,2,mlg9rt,1,"I haven't seen my out-of-state family for about a year and a half now because of COVID. We are all finally vaccinated (them before me, I still have a little bit of time) and making plans to see each other. I'm generally looking forward to seeing them because it's been so long but there is deep grief and fear surfacing that I'm about to put my healing to the test and might not be ready. 

My sister, who is the source of much of my childhood pain, has been really pressuring me about when I will visit because she had a baby during the pandemic that I have not met yet. Keep in mind I'm still squaring the fact that someone who made my life hell as a child is now a parent... 

I haven't been giving specific dates yet because I want to make it clear I'm not rushing to see them just because she demands it but now the rest of the family is questioning when I will visit and I just don't feel ready.

I'm doing a good job not committing to anything I'm not ready for right now but the questioning about it wears me down and makes me feel like I'm the problem.

Is anyone else experiencing this? How are you coping? I really wish I could feel secure enough in myself to handle a visit but I feel especially tender now that it is in the close future. I want to protect my healing more than anything."
What are good environments for CPTSD folks?,29,mlg59e,24,"I live in Philadelphia and it's killing me.  I'm going to do what's right for me and find a new, better paying job in a healthier environment where hopefully more folks share my hobbies and values.  This is a big step in my recovery I believe.

So that got me thinking, what are good environments with folks with CPTSD?  I am a nature boy, so my mind automatically wants to move to a cabin a hundred miles away from the nearest town, but the more practical, mature part of me knows that I need access to resources and good people.  The suburbs kinda freak me out because I grew up there and the competitive lifestyle really isolated me.  I found the urban thing to be so rewarding for so long, but people are just dying every single day.  This place is a post industrial hell hole and I gotta get out.  I love to bike, so maybe living in a less toxic City with a good bike culture might be perfect?  I dunno.

What do you think?  Where do you live?  Is it good?  Is it toxic?  What do you like or dislike about it?  What should those of us with really active and aggressive triggers aim for in finding and building a home and community?"
Forming habits is so difficult.,12,mlg4zh,5,"My Therapist and friends are recommending all the time that i should form positive habits, especially taking care of my flat and taking more care of my personal well-being, but all this does, is making me feel left drained and not very positive at all. It's exhausting just to think about it."
Anyone do the Predictive Index?,5,mlg44u,2,"I applied for a job and it went well so the recruiter had me take this test called the [Predictive Index](https://www.predictiveindex.com/blog/how-does-the-predictive-index-test-work/) and it consisted of two sections. The first asked me to choose words from a list on how others would describe me and then the next was to choose the words (same list) to describe myself. My results came back the following:

>[Operator](https://www.predictiveindex.com/reference-profile/operator/):  Operators are people you can count on. Patient and conscientious, they're usually among the most cooperative people on any team. Operators will remain stable, thorough, and relaxed in most circumstances.

It had me wondering if this is related to the trauma I have and all the peace keeping I have done to survive... Curious to know what others have gotten if they've taken it."
How to stop getting suicidal when I have flashbacks if my trigger is racism and I can’t escape it?,78,mlg3zn,20,"Every time I have a flashback, I get suddenly and intensely suicidal. I can’t see the point in living at all if all I’m staying alive to do is constantly be reminded of all the horrific things I’ve experienced. And being black in America, I can’t escape racism triggers at all unless I sit in my house and do absolutely nothing. 

Since racism and racist bias and microaggressions are literally everywhere, all the time. I can’t go for a drive without seeing Trump and blue lives matter signs on cars, billboards, people’s houses. Shit I even passed a farm today that had a huge sign of Trump’s name in their crops. 

I can’t go into a diner without having the white waitress give me a weird look, I can’t turn on the TV without being reminded that people like me are automatically so hated we’re excluded from even having a normal amount of black people in a TV show, or they have subtle racist jokes, I can’t even chat with my white friends without them showing some level of white fragility. Or I get gaslighted. I can’t just come home from work without being reminded that I’m different because my white neighbors lock their car doors the minute they hear me get home. I can’t get a tattoo without the tattoo artist going off into some rant victim blaming black people for getting killed by the cops as if I’m gonna agree with him. I can’t go into the comment section of the Chauvin trial without seeing people call him a HERO for killing a black man that did nothing wrong. Or even the folks that probably deep down don’t have bad intentions but are performative and tokenizing. 

I guarantee even sitting here begging for some help on this subreddit, I won’t be able to escape it. 

I literally can’t do anything without it being right in my face, even from people that I love and care about and thought cared about me too. 

This is ON TOP of the horrific things that happened to me when I was little, that I’m also triggered on almost daily. There’s no where I can go where I’m not being reminded that I’m not wanted because of what I was born as, ON TOP of being triggered into remembering all my other biggest traumas from childhood

I just want to feel okay, but it’s like I can’t get away from triggers no matter how hard I try. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m always just “hanging on” but barely even doing that."
What makes me so untreatable???,9,mlg2jy,7,"I spent a whole day with a psychologist and all that we were able to conclude was I have dependent personality disorder and adhd.

I did a long questionnaire (maybe 250 questions?) and the results inconclusive...apparently my entire world and inner view can literally change by the time I’m asked the same question (worded differently) a little later on.

So on the plus side I don’t have an issue changing my thoughts or beliefs based on new information. Downside I have 0 attachment to my own views...

I am so tired of surviving and having to literally teach myself in order to actually make progress...
Thankfully my psychiatrist diagnosed me with CPTSD so I read some clinical books.

I see a therapist once a week (3 months now). This therapist has over a decade of experience, is trauma specialized. And told me “I don’t know how to treat you.” (Not the first time I heard this.)
I am glad she was honest and is working hard to help me make progress.

I do not have an inner critic. Like at all. I literally push myself to be better and pull myself up instead of down.

I am fully aware of all my major traumas. I can talk in great detail about them. 


I think the problem is I still live with the people who abused me (parents) and when I leave (realistically 3-5 years) I will be in a much better place mentally. 

Also I have saved their actual lives multiple times. And took care of my dad for over a decade by myself. I raised myself, took care of them since I was a child, and they kept me financially dependent on them to keep me from leaving. 


Just want to say shit fucking sucks...But it is what it is. I’m doing my best and that’s all I can ask for. Little by little I am on the road to becoming a better version of myself"
DAE get homicidal thoughts and fantasies?,5,mlfup1,4,Yes I am seeing a therapist and no I’m not going to act on these thoughts. But sometimes I daydream and fantasise on getting revenge or killing people that are abusing others for their own personal gain. I’m finding it really hard to get these thoughts out of my head but I know I’m too empathetic to actually hurt someone.
DAE feel like they have multiple layers of wounded inner childs like a Russian doll?,84,mlfqnw,7,"Each inner layer contributed to the creation of the next outer layer.

* My first inner child was me at toddler age. I felt a prevailing sense of humiliation even then. My parents grabbed me gruffly and screamed while forcing my face to look straight at their terrifyingly angry eyes. I have memories of physically shrinking my body and slinking away quiet, scared and sad. The kind of fear where a cold wave washes over you (the trauma). I'd go to a corner of the house and pee my pants because I was afraid to ask them for help going to the bathroom. They'd do this to me for being too loud, speaking like an ""idiot"", being a crybaby. My trauma response was fawn to my parents and all adults.

* My second inner child is my primary school self. I had no shred of self-esteem and lived in a haze of humiliation. My parents were malicious with their comments and followed up with hour-long beating episodes (the trauma). They were paranoid every little thing I did meant I'd become a delinquent etc. etc. and violently stopped literally anything I tried or did until I did nothing. The cold-wave fear of being beat loomed over my head all the time. Looking back, most of my behaviors were normal for kids. It would be concerning if I *didn't* do those things. Bonus: My parents would say I need to be ""tough"", ""smart"", ""popular"" to be a worthy person, then they'd strip me of any dignity, so I felt like they didn't think I was none of those things (and therefore that I wasn't). I felt ashamed trying to curry approval from them, so I'd go to school trying to convince kids I was tough, smart, popular and get them to tell me I really was all that. 

* My ""last"" inner child was my middle school and high school self that lived in a state of perceived social rejection (the trauma). I couldn't connect with my peers because I was horribly insecure and used all social interaction as a way to flex on others to feel good about myself (characteristic of people who feel a strong sense of humiliation). My trauma response was fight at this time. I had to control people into giving me validation and if they didn't, I exploded. I had a strangely strong need to try forcing the reality I wanted to believe myself onto others for validation. People brushed me off and it was painful. My peers were my last resort at getting love and I thought I had to ""prove"" how awesome I was to get it. When I failed, I hit rock bottom and forced myself to fold into a pretzel as my second effort to get love. To my present day self, I ""am"" this kid back then who couldn't level with others. Who was weird. Who no one wanted to be around. Who has control issues.  

* My present day self has issues with freeze and fawn response (people pleasing and approval-seeking).

How far back am I supposed to go? If I ""am"" my last inner child, how do I keep unraveling that? God, at least if you're going to give me a puzzle of trauma, give me the brainpower to solve it."
Does anyone find physical intimacy expressed through text to be extremely uncomfortable?,12,mlfkxf,3,"I'm dating someone I love and we're starting to build a life together. 
At the moment we aren't living in the same place so we rely heavily on texting to stay in touch. 

They love words of affirmation. They like compliments and hearing what and when I'm thinking about them. I'm mistrustful of words and I look primarily to action to see the truth of a situation. 

I have noticed that every time that our texts turn in any way physically intimate / sexual in nature, I feel ill. 

I find it so cringey and upsetting. I freeze up. I can't reciprocate. I get immediately suspicious and just want it to be over. I get this urge to crawl out of my skin and leave my body entirely. 

I've told them about it and they've stopped bringing it up, and/if they bring up something mild then they don't expect me to reciprocate at all. 

I really appreciate all this, but I don't know what to do and how to/ if to get past this. I don't know if I should just accept this about myself or if I should actively be working to retrain my brain. 

Does anyone else relate?"
Don’t take Benadryl and SSRIs together,28,mlenxb,13,"This is more of a lighthearted subject for this subreddit. With the pollen count so high, my allergies have my eyes burning and I can’t stop sneezing. I started taking some Benadryl to get rid of the symptoms. Well, uh-oh! Turns out drowsiness is a side effect in both medications, and I can’t seem to stay awake after taking them both in the morning. Oopsie! Gotta get some non-drowsy Claritin instead, since I don’t normally take Benadryl for my allergies. Haha! Time to chug some green tea."
I’m only ‘such a nice guy’ because of trauma.,213,mle7se,39,"Due to childhood trauma I literally can’t upset people. I was taught that everything was my fault and that I was responsible for my parents moods etc. 

So If I get the tiniest whisp of a hint that someone is upset with me I feel sick to my stomach with guilt. I just can’t cope with it. 

Because of all of this I’m constantly told that I’m ‘such a nice guy’, but to be honest it never gets me anywhere except a bunch of responsibilities and co-dependant relationships. 

I wish I could learn to put some of my own needs first. I don’t mean going too far the opposite and becoming “a nice guy” selfish type. But I wish I could stand up for myself. Just a little."
Does anyone else find job hunting incredibly triggering?,31,mle6h5,4,"My current boss is nightmare incarnate, down to shoving blame onto others and stealing credit. I need a new job, because day by day this is wearing me down to a shell.

However, looking for one has resulted in frequent panic attacks, breaking down into tears, and put me in a constant state of hyper vigilant fear. I’m trying to find a situation to improve my mental health, but all it seems to be doing is making it actively worse. Interviews where I feel I’m judged for everything, unfair deadlines they refuse to negotiate, a crippling fear of both change and failure... I don’t know how to do this.

Is this just me? How does anyone deal with this?"
What's the snarky remark you heard most as a kid from your caregiver(s)? [TW for verbal abuse],33,mle5w9,54,"(Prompted by [u/Flaky\_Web\_2439](https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaky_Web_2439/) 's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/mk0cjy/ask_a_stupid_question_get_a_stupid_answer/)  “Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer”)

You know, that 'default' insult that was likely passed down from earlier generations. Said in a dismissively snarky or sarcastic tone that was completely inappropriate in a parent-child relationship.

For me, it was ""Don't be ridiculous."" Not helpful for a kid who took everything literally, seriously, and personally."
"Can I use an old picture as an ""anchor""?",6,mldyl9,5,"Hello everyone. I recently came across the concept of using certain objects as an ""anchor"" to the present, a reminder to stay in the here and now. I don't have many interesting or meaningful objects where I currently live, so I was thinking of printing an old picture of me and a close friend of mine and keep that as an anchor. It has a soothing effect on me as it reminds me of a person who means a lot to me. But I was wondering, since the picture is 10+ years old, does this defy the concept of staying in the present? Should I opt for more ""neutral"" objects, but from the present time, or it really doesn't matter as long as I have a physical object to focus on?
Thank you for reading, I'm looking forward to hearing your opinions on this."
How do I explain this diagnosis to friends?,5,mldlo0,13,How do I “come out” about CPTSD? I’ve had a really difficult time opening up about it as an early 20 something and wanted to ask what you guys’ experience is
I am not crazy. I am not overly emotional. You're deluded. Long Post - Sorry,5,mlcx9l,1,"As some background, my dad has been sick my entire life, he has a disease that just grows cancer pretty non-stop. I have a weird relationship (if you can call it that) with my dad because of this. When he was home he would often backup my moms abuse, doing things like coming into my room after she beat me and telling me to go apologize to her because I made her feel bad. He was also physically abusive in his own right like throwing me into the pool in December (in southern CA but still) when I was only wearing a sleep shirt and then just locking me out of the house for the night. 

A few therapists have commented that, even with the abuse, I put him on a pedestal because of his illness and the fact that I was trained to always expect him to die within soon, and this went on my entire life. Don't get me wrong, he taught me how to ride a bike and one year he left the hospital on October 31st and went straight to the Halloween Carnival at my school. He wasn't always bad but then again, neither was my mom. 

Anyway, I cut contact with my mom on Valentine's Day in 2020 after she lied to me that my dads procedure had gone well and that he would be heading home that day. When I finally found out he had been bleeding internally and went through 2 exploratory surgeries, I lost my shit on her and she tried to blame me for not being a good enough daughter to be informed of my dads medical emergency. I told her I was done and haven't talked to her since outside of a single letter.

In 2018 my dad had his worst bought of hospitalizations and ended up in the ICU for 6 months after a ground-breaking new surgery at a special symposium left part of his intestines' necrotic. He spent close to a year in the hospital and he came out in bad shape, constantly in pain and actually taking the prescribed pain meds that for the past 30+ years he never touched. He's on a feeding tube and gets multiple IVs a day to get his medication and fluids; it isn't a great existence. 

He ended up going out and getting Covid, I'm almost certain purposefully as some sort of assisted suicide but he had no symptoms and they didn't tell me my mom was sick until her oxygen was at 80% (thus the one letter I wrote). Anyway, I've been more distant with my dad than usual over this because it was so negligent. 

Last night out of nowhere I get a text giving me a schedule of upcoming doctor visits and procedures. None of them were routine but I played dumb and asked if they were simply to manage pain. He responded by telling me he's been having a lot of trouble breathing, he's been in more pain than usual, he's been getting transfusions because of bleeding they can't find, and they're pretty sure the cancer is back. He ended it with ""Nothing is ever just easy. Sorry .""

That sent me spiraling, both the information and the blasé way he shared the information. Whenever I react to shit like this my family calls me a crybaby and over emotional because it 'isn't that big of a deal'. Ignoring the fact that he has next to no GI tract left, he is a medical fucking marvel and has been written about in a few medical papers over it so cancer is a bigger fucking deal than last time. 

I didn't feed into it and just said: I'm so sorry, thank you for letting me know. Please keep me up to date. I figured a diplomatic response would be the answer but instead he told me more serious and life threatening medical issues he's facing and followed it up with: Love you kiddo and sleep well. ♥️ Hi to \[my husband\]!

They make me feel crazy. It's a big deal but it's juxtaposed against smiley faces and heart emoji's. I have to keep reminding myself that they aren't normal so I don't spiral further than I already have. I don't want my dad to die but sometimes..."
"How do most people here manage their work? Emotionally, nerves being open with colleagues?",6,mlcjne,1,"Hello,

I don't think I'm really asking anything in particular. Just wondering what other people's experiences are. 

I started EMDR at the end of February and I worry I've been underperforming at work. Does anyone else worry they're not doing a good job? I feel like I'm always making small mistakes or misunderstanding things, not being fast enough. I work 2 PT jobs but I often feel too guilty to count all my hours in one because I think I could have done the work faster. So if I do a 7 hour day, I count just five hours for example. 

In one job, my work is all online and remote, in fact my conversations with my new boss are all email. They're very understanding and never put me down for any mistakes but I can't help but feel I'm more of a burden than asset because of my questions and mistakes. 

I'm also just really very tired and have trouble focusing sometimes. I haven't told my email-only new boss because I don't want it to sound like I'm making an excuse. And it's also the only relationship I have right now where my recent healing journey is a total secret. I'm  torn between  wanting to share and wanting to pretend I'm 100% okay. Meanwhile with my other job, my boss/mentor knows what's going on but they want me to be 'okay'... It come from good intensions but there's definitely a pressure to be okay and happy. It's come to this point where I'm muting the call because a word I've read in the report we're reviewing me has triggered me and I'm crying."
I can't relate to other people's problems,6,mlcjhr,3,"I've struggled to talk to anyone about this topic because I feel like a big part of me thinks I sound rude and think I deserve special treatment or something. But I feel like this community will be able to understand what I mean.

I've stopped talking to friends about my problems because I feel like my problems are so much worse than theirs and they never have an easy answer so all I get is pity. I struggle listening to other people's problems because they seem so incredibly simple to me. I am never rude or will belittle their issues, but I struggle to relate when someone says ''I'm so angry at my dad, he keeps making broccoli for dinner even though he knows I hate it'' because I've had to make my own meals for myself and my siblings for years because my narc mom didn't care. 

I feel like everyone else's issues have a clear solution whilst mine are just the effect of 20 years of abuse and cannot be ''fixed'' only slightly dealtt with through years of therapy. I cannot share how I haven't been happy in more than 10 years and I cry almost every day with someone who's biggest problem is ''getting nervous about exams''. 

I want to be supportive and I want to be able to share my problems with friends but I just know they won't be able to help so what's the point? I don't want pity.

I feel like an awful person but I can't help feeling this way constantly, like I know there are people in the world who have it worse than me but I feel like everyone around me has easier problems than me and I cannot share anything.

Am I a horrible person? Am I exaggerating and making things about me? (This is something I was told a lot by my abusive parents growing up)

Am I alone in this? I just don't know anymore."
What can I do?,7,mlcctk,1,"I really was doubting whether or not i was really being abused even though I knew i was until last night when it got confirmed once again

I just don't know what to do, they act like nothing happened and I'm feeling even more suicidal

I can't find anything to distract myself

I'm seeing my therapist in a bit and i really want to tell her about my suicide attempts but i can't mention this and i don't want to keep living with them like this either"
My parents have given me the gift of eternal loneliness,13,mlc5fp,8,"As I was waking up today I felt a pain in my chest, and it occurred to me, I’ve always felt this pain. My entire life. As a child, as a teenager, as an adult. On top of the deprivation and neglect, I had this realization that I’ve been grieving the metaphorical death of my parents for the past 5 years and it isn’t fair.

5 years ago they bought tombstones for themselves and in the past 5 years they’ve only called me and never visited me. Every time we talk, the topic of their death comes up. It’s always talking about their deaths and regrets and they refuse to just live. They refuse to believe things can change. It forced me to want to rush milestones in my life so that they could experience it. I tried to rush getting married and having a kid but then realized deep down, I’m doing it because I feel responsible for their choices and I’m still trying to create this happy life and family that we’ve never had.

It all feels like a messed up joke. They ruined my childhood which was filled with neglect and abuse. And I still want to please them and now it’s just death plaguing every single interaction. And it makes me so angry. Even as an adult, they can’t even spare my emotions and want to make me feel bad. Bad that it was my fault that as a child, I didn’t talk to them often enough. Always reminding me about death around the corner. 

They never gave me any meaning or plan for life. My purpose, as they’ve beat into me, was to take care of them when they’re older. So they deprived me of all experiences they believe would not make me successful. I was locked in the house for a decade and every summer, I’d sit at home alone while I knew my friends were outside having fun. I’d be screamed at for doing poorly in school and when I would ask them if they could get me to a doctor because I think something is wrong with my head because I’m struggling academically, they’d scream at me that if there’s something wrong with my head that I should just drop out of school. An impossible double bind because they expected me to finish school and take care of them. 

Now I’m an adult and they realize that their neglect and abuse has caused me to not care about them. I don’t even care about myself either. And I don’t have the luxury of death being right around the corner. If I live til 100, I get to live with this for the next 75 years. It feels like one big and cruel joke."
Confused with diagnosis on paper,1,mlbybl,5,"So I was seeing a therapist every 3 weeks for over a year. I needed a piece of paperwork to try  for disability from her. At the bottom of this paper it said ""ADHD anxiety depression and c-ptsd?"" What does the question mark mean at the end? The adhd and other stuff I knew I had. I wasn't able to stay in therapy long enough after to ask. I can tell I do have some form of ptsd"
"I'm sorry I'm just in real pain now, I'm so sorry",29,mlbxwq,7,"I know probably no one will really read this, and that's okay, I'm just I'm sorry. I just maybe need some support rn because I'm so tired of being broken down all over again and it's all because of me. I just ended another therapy relationship, the one before that really didn't end well and I'm still struggling to heal from it and the one now, after everything that happened with the last one, and money issues I just couldn't go on with it, I told her beforehand that I'm not coming and we knew it meant goodbye and I've been crying about it for the last few days on and off between work, school and general house chores. I just got a text from her, today was our last appointment and she left me the option to come or not, I'm not gonna pay to say what I already said and hear what I already heard so I didn't go, she sent me a text thanking me for putting my trust in her and still trying, and that this is goodbye. It's all my fault, I know it is, I know I chose to end it and all the reasons behind it still stand but it really is all my fault, and everything that happened with the last t, and he was nice too but still I am so so hurt, I'm tired of myself, I'm tired of not healing, I'm tired of being blamed for my suffering and just go to therapy and just why are you so suicidal, so unstable, as if this pain I'm carrying is nothing but air, so why aren't you normal yet?? And I'm tired of having no memories at all and the depersonalisation that makes me want to slit my wrists almost on the daily just because it's too much, and I'm tired of being hurt by people who claim they just want to help and I'm tired of supporting myself and having no one in my life who can understand and code switch just so I can function, and failing to kill myself because I actually maybe care about myself and think I deserve so much more and can offer so much but also know I have no why of achieving it and why do I still get hurt by those people and systems, the only conclusion I can draw is that it's me and it's my fault but I can't fix it, and please please please I tried killing myself so many times these past two years but I keep actively or passively (by dissociation) stop it, so now according to my psychiatrist and the way doctors and therapists look at me I'm just unstable, insane, maybe I'm (god forbid /s) borderline. I'm just so tired of fighting this world.


I'm so sorry I'm sorry"
Feeling sick in the shower or in bed and PTSD?,3,mlbxtu,3,"I can be having a day not feeling ill - which I often do with panic and anxiety but even on my relatively chill days stepping in the shower or getting into bed or being woken up by my very kind, quiet cat, makes me jump so much I feel like being sick and it’s such a sudden shock. 

Does anyone else have experience with this and can anyone think of why this might be? I know it must have something to do with fight/flight and “vulnerability” but I can’t think of anything more specific."

Buying myself flowers for the first time,43,mlb7bq,4,"I'm turning 23 this week, and have decided to buy myself flowers, took a step further and customized it!

This whole self appreciation thing seems too foreign for someone from my household - I can count by one hand the number of times we'd get 'gifts' from either one of our parents or the times we'd see them gift each other. Only time we'd get them were when we excelled academically, which didn't happen often btw (My siblings and I were well above average, just not by the standards of our Asian parents). Interestingly, in some occasions we would be asked about what we'd want, but get something completely different?? 

One time, my dad gifted me a set of books he chose and decided to add a personalized note, writing about how proud he was of me and how much he 'loved' me. Later that day, I walked into his room and found the exaact same set of books with the same note. Turns out he borrowed a friend's gift to his daughter, and copied out everything word for word bc he couldn't really bother coming up with anything himself. I didn't feel anything at the time, probably because it was the first time I felt 'appreciated'. Now I'm just mad, and it adds to the resentment I already have for him. 

Idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but I've started expressing to people beforehand about what I'd like to be gifted with, and if I got something I couldn't use/wear, I'd donate it. My family does give me shiiiiit for it lol"
Advice for Dealing with NIght Terrors and Sleep Anxiety TW: incest mention,12,mlb0ts,11,"I’m looking for advice dealing with sleep avoidance due to severe night terrors, panic attacks during sleep, and nightly sleep paralysis. I practice good sleep hygiene...and am able to maintain a good sleep schedule for a week or two at a time, but when I sleep at night the night terrors get worse and escalate until my anxiety about sleeping doesn’t let me sleep while it’s still dark out.

Any advice on:

Dealing with night terrors (I’ve been on prazosin and it did nothing, I’m on meds that help mitigate physical symptoms of anxiety and panic, but they have failed to reduce symptoms in my sleep) I have them whenever I sleep and I keep all my senses in them. Any tips that help reduce how often they occur would be amazing. Any tips on decreasing the number of dreams I have about rape or assaults...I’ve had the night terrors for basically my entire life...and have gotten used to a lot of the content...but reliving...what my parents did...it’s a lot...just figuring out how to shift them...from the most traumatic of content would be hugely beneficial. (please no recommendations on lucid dreaming...I tried for several years...and it’s not something I can do.) 

Dealing with the aftermath of night terrors (the wake up part and calming down...I’m really stuck on how to do this at night especially...I wake up screaming or crying and shaking...and I...really just don’t want to go back to sleep because they start up again...whenever I sleep. Tips for calming down and feeling safe would be amazing.

Dealing with sleep anxiety (calming down before bed, putting paranoia to rest, dealing with anxiety brought on by it being night, things beyond the general advice (journal, to-do-list, mindfulness) especially.

Any tips, or descriptions of what’s worked for you would be really useful. I’ve done a lot of research and tried a lot of things but nothing I’ve done has really improved things.

Thanks in advance!"
DAE have troubles with forcing themselves to do things no matter how urgent they are?,151,mlaxyf,18,"I'm experiencing this sooo hard right now. I really, really have to study but no matter how hard I try I can't force myself, it's almost like there's something invisible stopping me. 


Studying generally triggers me into flight or freeze and it doesn't help that my teacher is an unpedagogical, unreasonable ass hat that expect us to understand things on our own and sets too high expectations of us. Another reason is probably that my life depends on me studying right now because if I didn't I would be homeless without any money...
There's just so much toxic shame and panic buried within this."
How I got over my psychological problems and issues,1,mlaoak,1,"Hello everyone I opened Reddit lately and after a long time and I saw this subreddit that I used to scroll through regularly half a year ago. Lately my life has changed a lot I went through some pretty harsh bullying in school years back with a lot of physical abuse, everyday I would go to school get beat up and back home to play video games and the same loop everyday my parents didn't give a flying fuck, so I was 17 with a lot of problems, anxiety and depression and I read somewhere that difficulties help the mind like excercise the body, I was near suicide at that period so I just told my father I will be back in 5 days as usual he didn't care so I took my motorcycle and went to the nearby town without knowing anyone there I slept in park benches and in apartment building basements I saw many different people and even started talking to girls in the street something I never imagined you could even do and after the 5 days I came back home took a shower and left again doing the same thing just better this time I made friends and a friend group let me stay In an old house we used as a place to hang out and with literally nothing I was happy, really happy and I realised something my personality changed a lot in these days I became psychologically stable and I had either happiness or felt content because I didn't really had or still have any needs expect cigarettes and tobacco, now I'm back home I made my basement my living space and I live here now with 2 chairs 1 table  and 1 bed and I'm content with that I work small jobs father some money that it takes me months to spent because of how cheap I live and I go riding with my motorcycle around Greece the  towns and villages near me now but Im expecting the lockdown to end so I can travel to many places, that is my life story and my advice would be to see the world,get through hardships in life because if you don't face your fears they will find you at home"
Advice for first time triggering and meeting with new psychologist,4,ml3ayl,2,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with complex PTSD and major depression, panic disorder and some general unhealthy social behaviors. I put in the work and my life changed so much for the better. 

Much to my surprise, my traumas were recently triggered and now I'm a full blown mess. I don't know how I didn't realize it could all be triggered alas here I am. 

I've luckily gotten en queue to meet with a new psychologist, alas it is starting over from the beginning (I am living in a different city than my old counselor). 

With my past, including interactions with medical professionals, I am very generally skeptical. I'm also not sure what to expect from counseling with a psychologist (before it was just a mental health counselor). 

Any advice on what to expect from my first few sessions? Any red flags or green lights to look for or seek out? 

The traumas are extremely complex and I just don't believe I have much of anything left inside of me at this point... Meaning pretty much a full mental and nervous breakdown, constant panic attacks, it's a miracle I am going to work and keeping that steady though I'm extremely hypervigilant so it's not easy. Anyways it's all to say I don't know what my options are to work thru this with the new psychologist but I don't wanna do a story time where I run thru everything that's horrible and happened to me because I don't have anything left in me to traumatize myself further. Does that make sense? Any advice here on helpful approaches to talk with him about or things to look for?"
Trauma affects the health of the body in ways I never thought,10,ml3n1t,0,"For awhile now I have been trying to find answers. Why was it that I use to be great at school, and now I instantly cry at the thought of homework? My memory use to be great, and now I barely remember what I did earlier today. I feel so spacey so often, so many hours of my day is wasted on who knows what. I get anxious over watching a movie that I don’t know the ending too. Every day is a constant feeling of dread under my skin, but for no reason whatsoever. 

I am happy that I have supportive people in my life. I have spent so many years in therapy trying to find answers to my life. But what I discovered was that trauma didn’t just affect one part of me, it affected all of me. My anxiety has gotten to the point that it triggers asthma attacks, my allergies / breathing issues have gotten worse too. My body aches everyday, it’s like I’ve been carrying too much weight for too long. Im tired everyday, no matter how much I sleep. I thought my trauma was something that could be buried away, that it wouldn’t affect me after all these years. I had even forgotten a lot of what happened, but my body never forgot. It never did. 

Finally I am starting to listen to my body, to understand. So many times I am mad at myself, why cant I just function like everyone else? But there is a reason. Its crazy how it took me this long to realize how deep it affected me, to think that it exaggerated so many other health issues in my life but I was too blind to see the elephant in the room."
I need some hope or reassurance.,2,mla6d9,1,"BIG BIG BIG TRIGGER WARNING: SU!CIDE. 



An old acquaintance of mine took their own life. They seemed so happy and had such a big friend group. I never ever could have guessed. 
I am so so shocked & scared.

If it could be him, it could be anybody ever. 
I’m scared if it could happen to someone like him it could happen to me. 
I would never ever want it to get that way, what do I do?"
Here is a list of things that has helped me - I hope someone can find this helpful!,91,mla01h,19,"I have found this extremely useful with getting my life back from an extremely dark place. I hope this can help someone. 

* Stop seeing people who caused you trauma and or trigger more flashbacks while you work to heal. For me, this meant stopping seeing my family and it was really hard to do. 

* Come to a realisation about who you are. You need to accept the bad and how it has shaped you. There is good in who are are. Consider taking the Myers briggs personality test and printing out the good things about your personality. Also research how trauma can effect your personality type. The information is out there.

* Knowing what happened to you and how it shaped you is very important. It can help you stop focusing on the bad and your trauma. Find out what happened and how you were effected. Knowing and accepting what happened and how it effected you can help you move forward. 


* Setup a vision board. Buy a cork board. Setup your goals for the next 5 years and your short term focus. Setup your budget. Research and write a list of activities that you would like to do - Eg, specific places you would like to visit in your area. Find some truths that really hit home with you. One for me was: “Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die” Print it all out and put it on your vision board.

* Read Pete walker from surviving to thriving and the body keeps the score. Check out neuroscientist scientists Andrew huberman podcasts or YouTube. I learnt from Andrew useful insights regarding habit forming and insights into the mindset of highly successful people.

* Fight against the victim mindset. It’s an easy trap you can fall into. I struggle with it myself because hell, most of us are victims of horrible trauma. But the victim mindset places the responsibility for your happiness and progress elsewhere. It’s a dangerous trap that can hurt your progress. The mindset I want to strive for is a nobody can hurt me mindset. 

* Microdosing shrooms. This helped me due to anti depressants robbing me of almost all feelings. Shrooms helped me feel again amongst other things such as feeling of well-being and increased energy. I’m not recommending this for everyone but it did help me.

* Reconnect to body, listen to it. Exercise more and make diet changes. Consider cutting caffeine and reducing sugar.

* Reconnect with feelings and trauma that is being suppressed. Accept your feelings and process the trauma. Easier said then done I know. It’s likely the toughest thing on this list by far. Microdosing helped me with this a lot. EMDR and other methods may help others. 

* Reduce weed, alcohol and anti depressants. I personally find it all helps suppress feelings and sometimes can reduce motivation. Weed is a bit different sometimes but ultimately I don’t think it’s very healthy for the mind unless it’s CBD based. Please don’t reduce anti depressants until you are ready, and see a doc first."
I feel very tired and worthless today,2,ml9yc6,1,"It was a hectic week last week, with both good and bad moments. 

Today I'm taking a me-day. I dont have anything planned or anything to do. So I can relax... Or can I?

I've been struggling a lot with body image/self image lately. I have this image in my head that i have to look a certain way to be attractive (thanks media) and so I try to work out, eat healthy and lose some weight. But this is hard since my body is still so exhausted and working out makes me feel even more fatigued. I also crave more unhealthy foods whenever I feel so down. 

I've had a long history with eating and exercising struggles and I tend to become overly obsessive with them because they give me a sense of control and make me feel more worthy as a person. But the last year or 2 ive been pushing my body beyond its limits and now often have little aches and pains. A lot of my muscles have been cramped up for that same time so that makes exercising even more difficult because I cant do the motions properly and my breathing is very shallow because of it.

Long story short: I can't work out and eat as healthy as I  think I have to. So here I am. On my bed, exhausted. Beating myself up because today it just aint it. I know resting and gentleness is all I need today and maybe also tomorrow and the day after, but the critical voices in my head keep telling me that I should work out and that I am worthless now. Which makes me even more exhausted. I tried a little exercise but I almost broke down crying so I stopped. 

But I just feel like Im never good enough just the way I am. I am overly critical on the way I look and I cant imagine that anyone would want to date me. Even though other people always tell me the exact opposite and I rationally know I am decent and there is nothing wrong with me. Uhg.

I needed to get this out. Dont know if others can relate. Thanks for reading."
Is it okay to stop seeing therapist?,6,ml91tp,4,"I feel like I can't talk to mine, I don't understand the sessions. I leave as I entered.

A rant and some questions about parts (if anyone wants to give some insight or support),2,ml8qeh,1,"I recently got my hands on *""Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors: Overcome Internal Self Alienation""* by **Janina Fischer** and so far it's really good! I use it as a modality for self therapy since I don't have access to a therapist as of now.   


I've recently found myself in a situation that I'll try to describe as an example of what I perceive as different parts but I'm not sure of I fully understand the concept of parts and how to interpret and apply them.   


So, about a couple of months ago I was dumped by my then partner of almost 2 years. We had a really good relationship and I definitely saw a future with her but things didn't work out. I've had a bunch of more or less serious relationships in the past and I think my attachment is somewhere in between anxious preoccupied and fearful avoidant.  
   
At first I was devastated, of course, but found myself to get back on my feet pretty quickly. A couple of weeks ago I met this girl who's a friend of friend and I felt like we where checking each other out, since then we've met each other maybe 3 times and talked for a bit, every time with a small group of other friends around (Covid-safe of course!)

This is where I'm starting to have pretty mixed, confusing and ambivalent feelings at the same time and I'm wondering if it's different, fragmentet parts of me that makes me feel so emotionally confused or if this is what a ""normal"" non-traumatized and dissociated person would feel as well. 

  
\- One part of me seems to get into this obsessive kind of mode, where I think about her a lot and finding myself augmenting the situation and my feelings for her even though I barely know her. I would suspect that this could be a child part that's **desperate to attach** to someone in order to not feel lonely and abandoned and to feel cared for and appreciated. This part is a strong one.   


\- One part of me feels kind of depressed and hopeless, like what's the point? I'm just tired of relationships failing and people leaving like nothing ever mattered, and why should I even care about this girl, she's probably not worth it and will end up disappearing any way.   


\- One part of me just feels avoidant, anxious and a bit angry, like I want to avoid her or ever hanging out with her again.   


\- One part of me, which I guess is a grown up part, tells me to let it go and take it easy with myself and my own feelings (and hers). This parts also tells me to not engage in any romantic relationships since I really need to work on myself and stay single and heal. I think this parts also tells me that I'm not ready to be dating and should be responsible and force myself to be by myself.  


\- Another part of me, who I also suspect is a grown up one, is generally positive and sees no wrong in getting to know someone and take things easy and see what happens. This parts also thinks that some company would be nice and that if anything would happen between me and this girl, we'll be able to communicate and take things slow and easy. This part is also curious about the person and wants to get to know her and care about her. I believe this part to also hold some kind of self-compassion and is telling me that there's no wrong in wanting to connect to another human being.   


I haven't got it professionally or medically confirmed that I suffer from C-PTSD or structural dissociation even though it seems kind of likely. This is just my random thoughts about myself.   
Does anyone have any insight or wise words to share in this whole mess?"
How do abusers realize who has been abused in the past? Do they have a natural radar for such things or do victims give them selves away by their body language and (naive?) behavior?,28,ml8kan,10,"I just want to learn how to mask my self and stop being a prey for abusers, it is like they can see through me. I don't know if it is my low self esteem, or my quietness that they assume is low self esteem but abusers are usually dumb people that are used to agression, conflicts and loud places and if you don't scream or act like them they for whatever reason start getting agressive and taking out their shit on you, making you physically sick from their mental,psychological,emotional abuse and gaslighting. They are not fucking safe and you live in constant anxiety, never feeling safe for you life because any new potential friend could be your new abuser so you are left like a living corpse, barely living day to day just waiting for the days to pass, living in misery and just wanting to die because no matter how much you hide it is like you have been cursed, it is like you have been marked by other abusers and you don't know why they choose always you and not someone else, the more abuse you experience, the more self hatred, people hatred, self isolation you do. Even though self isolation is not healthy, getting out there, meeting new people hurts extremely more"
"Hello people with comlex ptsd, I have a question - How does somebody who has been marked by other abusers as a victim - deal with people who seem to smell/somehow quickly realize that I am an easy victim and have been abused, because I can't avoid such people?",93,ml8hv2,14,"For whatever reason it is easy for people to corner me, gang up on me, hate me for no reason and trigger me. This is why I hated group projects ever since I was the age of 12. It seems that everyone else is usually an asshole who can't work in a team and puts all of the responsibility on me. While I have had positive groups where different members take their part, it was usually more rare. I don't know how do I give my self away, is it that clear that I am emotional, am weak due to certain symptoms of ADHD that make me vulnerable, hyper emotional, sensitive to rejection and I am also an ex people pleaser and am codependent. I really really really struggle standing up for my self and putting boundaries. If I don't put a overly serious and cold demeanor people just start taking advantage of me. I don't know how dumb people find each other and start to bully me, but it always happens. I am afraid of going out because of it, because the outside world isn't safe, there is always going to be either a group of 12 year olds who imitate and smirk at me, or a group of drunk men who harass me. I don't know why the abuse doesnt' stop and how this dynamic forms. I don't understand social dynamics well and I don't understand how my friendly kind persona somehow screams - I AM WEAK, COME BULLY ME, I WON'T DEFEND MY SELF ANYWAY, FEEL FREE TO RAPE ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

&#x200B;

 I want to understand what gives me away and how to stop this cycle before it even begins. How does befriedning a group of new people somehow transforms into 6 or more people starting to bully me for no reason when they barely know me and I didn't hurt or provoked them, I  have always wondered what makes an easy victim and even read many articles and unfortunetly easy victims are intelligent people like me who are not dumb and agressive and don't scream or fight with other people which people see as - standing up for them selves. Jesus Christ, how can I stop this madness where people out of nowhere who barely know me create group and start bullying. I am tired of this mob mentality because I haven't done anything to deserve behavior where people gaslight me, can't apologize and don't care what they do and want to project their insecurities onto me"
Need someone to relate to,19,ml87df,5,"Hey guys 18F here, I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 12 which got corrected to CPTSD at 17. My life has been really rocky. I was born to my crack addict mother, she locked me in a room for days and wouldnt feed me until I stopped crying, she had a gang ready to molly toff the house me and my nana were as a kid (decided against it last minute), at the age of around 4 got taken off me because of crack, abuse and apparantly she tried to drown me. My dad never wanted me,  I loved him and I always tried to live with him but he just simply didnt want me. He wasnt really there but enough to tease me about being in his care. I mostly grew up with my grandma which was good, she spoiled me. Just she was very depressed and her husband (my granddad) and son (my uncle who was really like my brother) both committed suicide and I'd come home from school and she would tell me she tried to drown herself in the lake today. It was all too much. I was quite bullied in school.  By the way I tried to do EDMR therapy and it was working but sadly I couldnt see my psychologist anymore. I'm in a good point in my life now though. I am really happy and finally in a healthy relationship.

But anyways, my point in this other than the vent is that I hate that I cant relate to anyone that I know. I wish I atleast new someone who didnt grow up with their parents, not that I want anyone to go through what I went through but just so I can feel less like a sad story and more like a conversation with someone who has gone through similar things."
Why Is This Always So Hard?,2,ml7y8s,1,"My father and step mum visited yesterday.  I didn't see my father from the age of 4 to 21 ish, partly because my abusive stepfather didn't like it, partly because he was pretty terrible at coming when he was supposed.

We have a reasonably good relationship now, and get along well.  But after a few hours, I was exhausted and overwhelmed.  Why can't I just have a nice time?  I was crying by the end of the visit and had to go to bed after.  

I am so unhappy about being such a mess so much of the time.  I wish they would just understand me without me having to explain the ins and outs of cptsd.  

My step mum is great, but she says ""you can't change the past"".  I know she is trying to help and be kind, but I end up feeling like there is something wrong with me because I can't just let it go....

All this with the lovely additional layer of ""if I'm not perfect no one will ever love me"" that cptsd throws in....."
Has anyone legally changed their name as a way to heal/cope/move on from the past?,369,ml7pbi,184,
I really love how people will just get up in your face unprompted like that's a perfectly ok thing to do,66,ml7ea9,15,"I don't even have much to say other than people need to learn some boundaries. No, it's not okay to wave your hands around inches away from my nose to demonstrate a point. No, it's not okay to shove things at my face in the middle of a loud conversation. No, it's ***not okay*** to get up all close to me and yell (or speak loudly at all), even though it's just supposed to be for the sake of humor. And it's not okay to just fucking grab me! Honestly? I never say it to them, of course, but when people do that I'm about an inch away from shoving them to the ground and/or knocking their teeth in. Not because I consciously want to, not because I'm a violent person, but because the first instinct that my CPTSD monkey brain comes up with is ""Get threat away ***now.***"" People do NOT understand the massive anxiety spike it gives me and I don't know if I'm just around inconsiderate people or what, but it drives me insane. 

'Personal space.' Learn what it means. I feel like a perpetually irritable housecat. One of these days, somebody's going to spook me because they think it's funny and they're *going* to get clawed."
I am stuck in a vicious and significant cycle of anxiety avoidance,11,ml79vi,3,"Hi everyone, 

I originally began a draft explaining the traumas that happened to me during my childhood in the hopes that someone could help explain why I am currently stuck in a significant anxiety avoidance cycle. However, I decided to not continue with this draft and instead focus on what the current problem is. I felt if I could articulate the problem well enough then there is probably no need for all the details surrounding the traumas that happened to me. I will attempt to do this below.

So, what is currently happening to me? Well, I am stuck in a vicious and significant cycle of anxiety avoidance. What do I mean by anxiety avoidance? Well, anything related to anxiety and the feelings that accompany anxiety I avoid. Although I have known for a long time that I have avoided anxiety, this recent bout of avoidance is much more significant than what has previously occurred. It is affecting every aspect of my life to the point where I need someone with me 24/7. I cannot go to things like appointments or family visits and I cannot drive alone and struggle to let my partner do things on their own. If no one is around I feel terribly anxious and which triggers fears (i.e. health fears) and what I believe are traumas associated with my childhood.  

I'll try to explain this avoidance further. Anything that has the potential to trigger anxiety and stress in me creates a significant level of anxiety/worry/distress in me. It's basically fear of fear, but more so fear of the physical symptoms of fear. It has crept into every corner of my life. For example, if I was able to let my partner go somewhere alone (which would mean I would be alone at home), I might be able to manage aspects of the experience, but other aspects would just trigger anxiety/stress in me such as not hearing from my partner when they got to the destination, or picking up my partner from a location where other people I know will be there (such as extended family). Another more important example includes not being able to talk with a therapist because the experience of talking with one would trigger stress which then triggers anxiety. And this includes online therapy. This significant avoidance has continued since late 2019 non-stop and I have not been able to break through it despite my best attempts at being brave and courageous (on a handful of occasions I have managed to stay home for 6-8 hours by myself while my partner worked). I have basically been isolating at home since then. I guess one would call this a panic disorder without agoraphobia as I can still leave home providing someone is with me.

The reason I find myself in this current situation is due to a major (and one of my first) panic attack that happened to me following a run back in late 2019. Although I managed to get myself to a hospital and be cleared (everything was fine with the diagnosis being a panic attack), the effects of the panic attack have lingered in the form of chronic obsession about my heart health and health in general. It's not a hypochondriac type of obsession where I am constantly checking in on my heart health. Rather, it is situational such as in something triggering my heart rate like anxiety or exercise. What drove me to the hospital was my fast heart rate right after the run which I now know was largely due me panicking about it. The obsession has crippled me because prior to the panic attack I was already significantly sensitised to stress and anxiety feelings. As I previously mentioned, avoiding anxiety has been with me since my childhood because of all the traumatic things I went through. Prior to the panic attack, I was able to tolerate a level of anxiety when I challenged myself (i.e. go to a medical appointment) in known stressful situations. I would use tools I have learnt over the years to do this including the face and acceptance method by Dr. Claire Weekes. But I want to make it clear, even though I was able to do this at times, I was still stuck in anxiety avoidance prior to the panic attack. It's just now that it has become so bad that I can barely do anything. 

In the past few years I have come to an understanding that I have CPTSD and that my Generalised Anxiety Disorder diagnosis many years ago was just a symptom of this. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, I had originally described the most significant tramuatic events that occurred to me during my childhood, but I omitted this information so that I could rather focus on the main issue. However, there is no doubt that the events that occurred during my childhood are the reason for why I am stuck so badly right now. Therefore, I want to put some dot points outlining the main trauma characteristics of my childhood: 

  
 

* Physical and emotional abandonment during moments of intense anxiety 
* Emotional neglect 
* Spiritual abuse 
* Witnessing physical abuse between parents 

  
 

Avoiding feelings associated with anxiety (including stress) no doubt has it's origins in these characteristics. CPTSD essentially leaves an adult with a dysregulated nervous system and a strong inability to self soothe. However, I have never been able to break through as to why I still struggle with anxiety avoidance. I understand it conceptually, but it feels like there is a roadblock that won't let me go the whole way and pass through to normalisation of anxiety and it's feelings.  

I know most people will say, ""you just have to face the fear!"" Well, I have tried this already since that panic attack and in fact that is what I have been doing for many years, but have never succeeded in breaking through to the other side where anxiety feelings no longer bother me. It's not that I don't want anxiety at all because I know that isn't realistic. Rather, I just want a body that has normal anxiety and not overwhelming and debilitating anxiety that shuts me down completely both mentally and physically. Facing the fear in this current state is extremely difficult because of the obsession that I have developed. Anxiety and stress by default cause an increase in heart rate which at the moment terrifies me. Despite medical reassurance at the hospital on the day of the panic attack, I have doubts now over my heart health and health in general. I wish I could go clear these doubts by seeing a doctor and cardiologist, but unfortunately the current situation won't let me do this. I attempted to do this at the beginning of 2020, but outside of the doctors office froze in fear and went into complete dissociation. I had never felt such terror in my life. That is what the current avoidance is like. It's that bad.  

I then thought well if I cant get to a doctors at the moment, then maybe I can talk with a therapist who can help me get there. Nope. This is just like the doctors. The same thing happens. The feelings of anxiety are just too strong and paralysing. I have tried everything with therapy too even asking over 20 therapists if they were willing to communicate vial email. Email for me seems to not cause too much stress. It's the live situations that trigger me particularly anticipation about upcoming scheduled appointments.  Maybe if I provide an example below of what happens using a hypothetical therapist appointment it may help you all to understand the kind of anxiety I am dealing with. 

Let's say I decided to make an appointment to speak online with a therapist (new). Ringing to make an appointment would induce moderate anxiety in me. This kind of anxiety is enough to make me not call. Let's say I made it past the phone call booking stage, well the next bout of anxiety would come in the form of anticipation about the upcoming  scheduled appointment. This too would be mostly moderate anxiety until the few days before the appointment where it would increase significantly. Let's say the day of the appointment arrived, well on the morning of this I would be experiencing moderate to significant anxiety levels. Let's say I managed to answer the therapists online call, well here is where the most severe and debilitating anxiety would occur. My heart would race like crazy and that would be enough for me to run and leave. I couldn't sit with it because of the current heart health phobia I have. All of my severe anxiety right now is about my heart rate and that is what is stopping me from getting help. 

So what can one possibly do here when they are so trapped by anxiety to the point that they can't even speak to a therapist without getting triggered into severe anxiety? This is ultimately what I am asking you all. If I can't get help for severe anxiety due it triggering severe anxiety, then what I am supposed to do? I know the avoidance isn't helping, but not avoiding is just so overwhelming for me at the moment. I want to reiterate that I have spent many many many days and weeks sitting through many periods of difficult anxiety and its symptoms and sensations including a fast heart rate. So the answer isn't for me to sit with these sensations to desensitise from them. 

I would be truly appreciate if anyone could offer me any advice or suggestions on what I can do here. I am desperate to be able to function somewhat normally (i.e. not need someone with me 24/7). I want to recover from CPTSD but this anxiety avoidance cycle is preventing me from this.

Thank you all for reading. If you weren't able to read all of this I have provided a TLDR below and breadcrumb navigation explaining the situation.

TLDR: I need to get help, but the help I need will trigger severe anxiety which is perpetuated by my heart health obsession. All together it triggers off a multitude of fears which I believe originate from the traumas that occurred during my childhood. Desensitising from the feelings of anxiety by sitting with intense feelings of anxiety has not worked. I have tried this now for over 10 years. I believe it hasn't worked due to unresolved childhood trauma. 

Breadcrumb: Need help -> help triggers severe anxiety (and stress) -> this triggers off many fears particularly the current heart health obsession -> mental focus strongly shifts onto heart rate and physical sensations of anxiety -> panic over fast heart rate -> further avoidance -> stuck -> thoughts about how trapped I am -> need help....."
Addiction,6,ml6vem,4,"Today was a good day. 

I took it one step at a time, I got productive, I listened to some wise words on addiction (a place I’ve lived in for a long time) and felt inspired by others who have realised their traumas as the driving force behind their dependencies. 

Today it felt like there was hope for a better life, and I want to thank each and every one of you who is brave enough to share yourselves and be vulnerable so that we may all understand better. 

I love and am eternally grateful for you all, wonderful strangers. 

Stay strong❤️"
What have you done that has helped you keep a job?,14,ml6d9i,11,"I feel terrified of working because it triggers me immensely. I have been able to work at temporary jobs in the past, but I don't know if I will be able to work 40 hours a week and pay my rent. Ideally, I want to find a job that doesn't require me to work that many hours, but I feel lost and stuck. I have made it through one year after going no contact with my abusive parents and have grown a lot as a person. Working doesn't feel *as* terrifying anymore but it still feel scary. I need help and advice, since Pandemic Unemployment Assistance won't last forever. Additionally, I want to feel financially independent. I want to be able to pay my own rent and really feel like an adult. I have needed this break and am really grateful that I've been able to survive on unemployment, but I also feel that sense of doom of ""what will I do when there is no help left"" approaching.

“what if you were in my body n could experience the reactions i usually have to things?”,40,ml5op7,8,"i asked my bf that with the idea of giggling at period pain or something. i quickly realized if he had to experience that, he would have to have my random thoughts that suck, or the sudden drop in mood bc of something just sucking me into some memory that hurt more than i thought. i said this and the mood of the car dropped, but i was laughing. i told him that then i could ask him if i’m really just being dramatic.

Help Understanding Flashback States?,5,ml4sry,4,"My girlfriend is prone to reading into my facial expressions or when I'm quiet as me being upset with her. She also gets in a defensive or anxious state if she takes something as criticism or I call her out of the blue.

When she gets in a heightened state, she seems to take a long time to get out of it and we are having some problems. I will try to make things better but it doesnt work and she seems almost annoyed by my reassurances or efforts which I don't understand. This gets me frustrated and feeling a little panicky myself, and I'll ask why she is mad at me or why she's reacting poorly, she'll say shes not and shes fine, and it just gets worse and worse. 

If she's thinking im mad at her and I explain the action or word and reassure im not, you would think there would be relief there but theres not. She will say okay, I will try to move forward and i can just feel in her words, tone and body language that things still seem not good. So i comment on it and it upsets her more.

I'm guessing this is essentially an emotional flashback, and she cant just come down out of it that quick? What feelings are going on there? In that state is she feeling like im a danger still, or is it frustration/shame at herself? How can I help this situation when it happens? And is there anyway to do it with me being the type who needs to fix things right away and feel like we are okay?"
Remembered Something from Childhood and now I’m worried I’ll become a bad person,11,ml4jm2,8,"When I was younger, I met someone online playing Xbox, who proceeded to groom me over the year that I knew him. I was told to tell him I loved him, that this love was platonic and between friends, but I was told to do it every single time I would leave calls with him. I was also, at times, told to remove parts of my clothing while calling him. Along with this, he would pretend to empathize with me over everything, saying it would be better if I could just stay on call with him indefinitely. Eventually, I got a new console, a PS4, and would never hear from him again. I forgot about all this, perhaps due to some form of repression, until recently.
        Four years from then I am now an 18 year old porn/hentai addict attempting to quit, and I fear that while I have never once searched for, downloaded, distributed, nor indicated an interest in anything illegal, I may have accidentally or unknowingly seen it at times on hentai sites. This fear has led me to continuously think I am at risk of becoming like this groomer, for some irrational reason. I am attracted to adults, to clarify in case anyone is concerned, but I still cannot help but thing this. I don’t want to be a bad person, and I would rather just forget this ever happened to me. I want to succeed in life and follow my passions, but this event, my addiction, and another event in my past have shaped so many habits and thoughts that I don’t know if I am capable of moving on anymore. Apologies if this seems off from the normal content posted here, but I needed to talk about this with someone, and my friends/family are unavailable at the moment."
Emotional flashback from feeling loved?,7,ml4j79,4,"I'm still new to understanding trauma, but I'm realizing that emotional flashbacks (or something else?) might be a regular thing for me and just experienced one last night. What confuses me is that just before it happened I was feeling calm and my boyfriend said ""I love you"", and then all of a sudden this wave of sadness and distress came over me, and it didn't help being completely confused. He was doing everything he could to help, but hearing him say comforting things just made me feel even worse, like I didn't deserve kindness. I didn't have many words going through my head, but the emotions made me feel deep sorrow and unworthiness, so painful I started to just imagine punching myself. It lasted 20 minutes or at least that's what I'm guessing.  


Have any of you experienced being triggered by feeling loved? Also is this an emotional flashback or just something else?"
I can’t do psychiatrists and their nasty pills anymore!,10,ml4efn,18,"I just can’t keep on this ugly roller coaster ride these doctors put me on. Get on a medicine.

Book Recommendation “All about love” “The Road less travelled”,4,ml49x1,5,"The first book
“All about love”
Is about the definition of love. Those of us who did not experience love growing up do not know about the definition of love when we want to self-love. Does love mean criticism, does love mean abuse, does love mean neglect? These are the problems that we encounter. This books gives a precise definition about love and its description resonates with some of my experiences.

——-Note and warning: Religious themes concerning Christianity in the second book.——

“The Road Less Travelled” also teaches about love and teach about discipline under love. For me, discipline means physical punishment, and has nothing to do with love. It’s like, either I’m hardworking and bombarding myself with self-criticism, or I’m completely slacking off and giving myself some love and compassion and acceptance. This book tells you how to have discipline without hating yourself."

How do you sleep alone?,2,ml3z4g,3,"How do you sleep alone when you’re having a full on mental breakdown from being scared/paranoid. I deal with SEVERE sleep paralysis especially when I am sleeping lightly/alone. Having to sleep alone for the first time in 3 years got sprung on me last minute and I’m not prepared for this. I don’t think any amount of time would prepare me for this because I simply can’t handle this. I’ve been having the most insane panic attack tonight realizing the severity of this issue and that I will be awake all night tonight and for the next few nights. I don’t know if I will be able to relax my brain enough to get some rest during the daylight hours or not. These issues are not as bad when the sun is up because my visibility is better. I can’t see in the dark or very far at all without my glasses which makes my fears a lot worse. As a woman I have a lot of anxieties and paranoias as it is but these are made worse with the fact that I’ve dealt with my abusers in life stalking me and putting me in actual danger. Not to mention my intrusive thoughts, hyper vigilance, serious trauma dreams, etc. I talked to my therapist about this which took up a whole session but it was not helpful or effective and nothing that was said made this a palpable situation for me. I’m not sure how to get through this. Especially if this becomes a regular thing. How do I explain to people what this is actually like and that I’m not trying to be crazy/immature but I am feeling really unwell due to this? I will say that if I had a pet right now this would not be so bad. My apartment doesn’t allow pets however an I am broke and waiting on a disability decision. Also, phone calls late at night like this are not an option if that is something anyone would recommend. I have no one to go to at night in this circumstance, I am stuck with myself hanging on every sound and bad possibility which is the worst punishment imaginable."
"Cutting father off, but ex taking grandchildren to him",2,ml3vup,5,"Hi,

As I began to heal and start standing up for myself, my relationship with my father ended (3+ years). Soon after my relationship with my husband ended (2+years ago). 

I have tried to work things out with my father but its been entirely one sided and he's never made any real effort to repair our relationship. Mostly the issue is he prefers to spend time with his new wife's kids, not supporting me at all and cancelling on my kids - but ​I'm just an ungrateful child after all he has done for me. 

My ex and my father never liked eachother, but since the break up, my father has taken this as an opportunity to see my children. I've told both of them I find this unacceptable and have gone as far as to put it in my parenting agreement with my ex. Yet,  my kids came home after spending Easter with their father only to tell me that they had not only seen my father, but had been told not to tell me about it. They were also told I won't let my father see them (I will, and I even ask if he would like to see them). My daughter was distraught after she told me and asked me not to get mad at her Dad and apologised for upsetting me - which makes me so, so much angrier as I am trying to stop these patterns of behaviour. 

I've worked on so many of my emotional triggers but this one I can't get over. My dad and his wife going to spend time with my ex husband, his new girlfriend and my kids. This is somehow preferable to trying to work on some  kind of relationship with me.

I don't know how to move on from here.  It hurts just as much every time it happens."
Only evidence i have is how fucked up i am,16,ml2vmw,1,Your honor i am defenseless. Is it a crime to just try to survive? I have no scars or paper trail.

"""Recognition-filtration""",3,ml2r5t,1,"I have discovered my own adaptation of ""forgiveness"" that is more tailored to my current emotional needs in healing, which feels more validating and empowering in my experience. I call it ""recognition-filtration."" Recognition-filtration helps me recognize things from an unbiased, objective perspective, such that my parents are not well, and act out of trauma projections that I don't recognize them wanting to change; this is information that I can ""recognize"" and then filter out. I am not meaning ""filter-out"" by dissociation, but more so acknowledgment and empowering understanding that I can release in a way (I am wary of saying ""acceptance,"" as I don't necessarily ""accept"" these notions.) Doing this has helped me a lot with the rage/anger I experience, and provides an empowering tone.  It also takes a bit of the emotional power they have historically had over me, out of their hands, which makes me feel even more empowered--though, I will say, I definitely still am experiencing anger. I despise when victims of abuse are pressured to ""forgive"" the circumstances they've endured prematurely or inappropriately. For example, it would be highly inappropriate for me to ""forgive"" the circumstances/relationships I am still entangled in that cause problems for me. Forgiveness implies past tense, not dealing with it anymore, and likely a lot of support, different life circumstances that make reflecting in that way more possible, etc. So, in this process, ""recognition-filtration"" helps. I  hope this makes sense or is helpful to somebody."
Stuck and feeling hopeless and completely lost.,1,ml22b8,6,"long read but please please bear with me. 

so I just came across a post that said “you can’t heal in the environment where you were hurt”, so then what the hell do I do? Keep hurting? I feel hopeless about the future because my physical health is suffering, my face covered in acne and body in anxiety rashes, I barely eat so my hair is becoming brittle so it falls out and I also pull at strands, digestive issues from anxiety, hormonal problems, also I don’t like shaving/waxing or anything, obviously no guy will find this attractive and having never had a boyfriend I can’t imagine ever finding love if I keep feeling like this forever, trauma started when I was 16 (22now) I never got a chance to know myself or know what I like, I’m young but don’t want to “hustle” because I have nothing inside to give, heck I can’t even feel my own legs, forget hustling or pushing myself to work or achieve success or have ambition. I wanted to move out by this time, be pretty and have a boyfriend who loves me and be in a good uni, what the hell happened? I’m so fckn abnormal. 
I literally have not talked to boys since the past 3 years, have not went out or connected with friends, because of how different my experiences have been, it would be heavy for them, and I can’t lie and faking to be happy is so much work. So I just avoid it completely. 
What do I do ? Do I leave my house go to a different country? or keep living with my parents who physically hit me & emotionally & verbally abused me up until I was 18 (btw it is culturally acceptable to live with parents,I live in asia, though it affects my mental health) 
They don’t beat me or anything anymore, but they look at me like I’m a failure and we are enmeshed and have no boundaries. When I’m dissociating and having an existential panic attack I can ask my sibling and parents for physical & emotional support, and in that moment despite the past drama, they try their best to be supportive and physically support me. But i don’t know who to go to?!!!
Now I’m confused what the hell do I do? I don’t want to move to a different continent and lose this support too? Also I have no energy physically or mentally to take on financial stress or university application/acceptance stress or corporate competition. Not right now. I just want to go to a beach and live there for at least 3 months, but we are in a pandemic, I have sexu@l trauma so I won’t be able to live alone or really relax and be able to have that experience. 
But I have to start somewhere? Or am I stuck forever ? I try to be optimistic but at night the true fears come out. Please help me :("
"Trauma from every single period of my life CW: S*xual abuse and Neglect, Verbal abuse",5,ml20zs,2,"So I just for the sake of needing to get it all out because I tend to not be able to, I just wanna list all i've been through from childhood to adulthood. I'm a gay male with DID btw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Ages 3-5: I can't remember a lot, from ages 3 and I assume even before I would be neglected, not physically, but emotionally by my mother and my father had abandoned me as a child and would be completely neglected via not being hugged or comforted ever and being forced to ""Cry it out."" I would be sexually abused at either age 4 or 5 by two men whom I still can't remember who had forced themselves on me and hurt me and as a result I would be very frightened and unable to attend pre-school initially because I would cry and scream and hurt myself so much and be so clingy that I couldn't attend my first one and had to be swapped to a new one.

&#x200B;

\*Ages 6-8: At these ages my mother would be sexually assaulting me, forcing me to shower with her in which she would expose herself to me and make me touch her body. At this age as well if not sexual abuse by her I would be forced into emotional incest, being forced to comfort her at the same time as she was assaulting me because she would cry about being a bad mother and I would be forced to play the role of her husband and tell her I loved her, gave her back rubs and hugs. My grandma who has bipolar 1 like me began to stop taking her meds every now and then and became extremely abusive as well verbally and she and my mom would neglect me or constantly insult me every single day. I would begin to start showing more signs of sexual abuse such as bedwetting and other behaviors. As well I would be constantly bullied by students. At this time I had also protected my friends from a robber and hid them as a man stole my brothers items. As well at this time I told my mother I wished to die to go to heaven where it's safe in which she laughed it off and walked away.

&#x200B;

\*Ages 9-10: At this time I would be harassed and bullied by students and then my own teachers as well as my mother and grandma and grandpa who was a drunkard. My mom became boyfriends with a man who would also terrorize me, I was witness to him smashing a chair into his brothers head repeatedly and had to be the adult in the situation and protect him by stepping in front of him and saying ""You wouldn't hurt a child would you?"", then afterwards bandaging his brother myself. I would be witness to his cocaine addiction and him coming home cracked out and scaring me while he was having bad trips. Him threatening to kill me or beat me, and other stuff of that nature. Being around my mother, him and his friend mocking and yelling at me while they were drunk and I was crying, and telling me intimate details of sex life and how they were selling drugs together to addicts. I was repeatedly told that I was a bitch, always complaining and the abuser.

&#x200B;

\*Ages 11-14: I would be forced to move into my grandma's house because of my mom's frivolous spending, in which every single day I would be screamed or tortured by my grandma, grandpa, cousin, aunt, sister, and mom and be forced to pick fights with every one of them and be harassed by them. My memory in general is extremely poor but I remember extremely little of the sexual abuse when I was younger and this period as well. My mom broke up with her boyfriend after moving in as well. During this period I would be routinely mocked in a group by most of my family members as I cried. I was forced to go to therapy because I was a ""problem child"" and in those therapy sessions my mom would talk to the therapist and the therapist and my mom would never allow me to talk during sessions with two therapists, with both therapists the only listened to my mom's needs and wants and never gave any advice other than ""Go do breathing exercises I guess.""

&#x200B;

\*Ages: 15-17: I was living in an apartment with my mom after she moved out, in which she would refuse to sleep and go into psychosis and terrify me and abuse me verbally every day and act even more childlike than she already has throughout life. At 16-17 when I entered high school my mom's ex-boyfriend dumped his ex-girlfriend on us and she lived with us for two years in which she stole from us and I barely had any food to eat, she shouted at me and was also an addict. Was forced to endure my mother's psychosis even more and was not allowed to sleep for two days straight because she would wake me every 30 minutes on the dot. At age 15 I had begun to engage with older men online for sexual gratification and was at 17 groomed and sexually abuse by an older man. Due to my feminine appearance and desire to shave being called the T-slur by my mother and was insulted for my sexuality and tried to be convinced that I was straight.

Are these panic attacks/anxiety attacks?,3,ml1xed,2,I work at a restaurant and sometimes when I get overwhelmed I hide in the bathroom for hours crying until I can go home. I feel so scared and ashamed to come back out and face everyone that’s how I’m able to stay inside for so long. It can be for small things for example there was this one time I was working as a hostess and this huge table came in and the only table that was available to them was the one right in front of me. They were so loud and making all these noises and I got so overwhelmed that I couldn’t do my job properly like when a customer from the table would try to ask me something I could not respond because when I get nervous I start looking around everywhere and I’m not able to concentrate. As the table were leaving one of the guys called me stupid and I didn’t even say anything back to him because I felt like I couldn’t do anything I was so overwhelmed. This was the first time my coworkers ever saw me like this so they did not know there was something wrong with me and I saw one of the guys in the kitchen talking about me and copying the way I was looking around everywhere and making fun of me to everyone. And today a customer’s order got late. He was a regular customer and he was always friendly towards me even when his order was late.  But his food never was this late before so today he was a little upset. He did not even yell at me. He just complained that he had to go back to work and now that his food was late he did not have any time to eat it. But even this caused me to get so upset. And then an hour later the restaurant got a prank call and I just couldn’t handle it so I went to the bathroom for two hours and cried. Again I was so scared to come out because I felt like everyone outside was talking about me and it caused me to stay in the bathroom for hours and hours. Do these count as panic attacks/anxiety attacks?
40F suddenly feeling like a chastised 6yo because I didn't do someone's job for her.,2,ml1tea,3,"I absolutely, without a doubt know I am in the right here. It would have been totally irresponsible for me to do the thing she was upset that I didn't do, for reasons I will explain. But I have spent the last 3 hours feeling like I fucked up. And I'm incredibly shaky and panicky over this.

I am currently overnight ""sitting"" for an elderly couple 95M/93F. They are extended family, but not blood relatives. They are my aunts (through marriage) parents. I have known them since my birth, and our families have always been close. I love them dearly. Because of dementia issues, they don't even know who I am anymore.

They are currently living with their son and his wife. They are retired and are now full-time caregivers, and have had this arrangement for the past 18 months, and it's a lot of work. They NEEDED a vacation and wanted to travel across the country to meet their new grandchild.

So they (and my aunt) worked to find an in-home health service to come and handle their daily needs for the week that they're gone. Medications, meals, helping with dressing and bathing, etc. It is ridiculously expensive per hour. However, they are in bed by 7pm every evening and don't typically get up until after 8am. 

So my aunt asked if I would mind sitting overnight in case of emergency. Like, fall out of bed and break a hip emergency. Call 911 if necessary, direct them back to bed if they wander, but I'm not supposed to have any caregivers responsibilities because I am nowhere near qualified to do so. This allows them to cut the bill in half, so I agreed. 

Last night was my first night, and everything went fine. They were in bed with their door shut when I arrived, and I didn't see them. My aunt was here because she'd been here for Easter dinner, and she left after showing me where I should sleep (on the couch near their bedroom door so I can hear if they have an emergency) and chatting for a bit.

This morning, the CNA from the health agency arrived right on time at 7am. We introduced ourselves and I left, saying I would be back at 7pm. She was very pleasant.

When I arrived again this evening, she seemed kind of stand-offish. I asked her how her day went, and she said it was fine, except that 95M had soiled himself when she went in to wake them for their pills, and made a terrible mess. Went into how awful it was to have to clean him up and do the laundry, and he had gotten it on the light switch, and all over the bathroom as well, and she'd had to clean it up too. I kind of commiserated with her because yes, that sounded terrible. I thought she was just venting. 

But then she went into a lecture wanting to make sure I knew where all the supplies were kept (incontinence products, fresh wipes to clean him up, clean absorbent pads for the bed, etc). I tried to interject that I was only supposed to be here in case of emergency, and that I was not a CNA, and I was not to have any contact with them unless there was a medical emergency or they wandered out of the bedroom.

""Well then why are you even here?"" was her response.

I reiterated that I was here to direct them back to bed if they left the room and call 911 if needed. She kind of grumbled and said she didn't see the point in that, and then said someone else was scheduled for tomorrow,  but she ""guessed"" she would see me Wednesday, and left in a dramatic huff.

And now it's after 10pm and I'm feeling super anxious, spending the night in a place that I am not at home in, feeling like I've been judged a failure by a complete stranger for not doing a job that SHE is being paid to do. Like, I agreed to do this sitting thing out of love and am not being paid to spend 5 nights away from my home and family, although knowing my aunt she will probably gift me a generous check at the end of the week. It will still be a lot less than the $50/hour that she's paying to this agency, and yes, I know the CNA is not getting all of that money.

But.like, why do I feel so helpless and lost and like I did something wromg?"
How do I bounce back from socially-devestating nervous breakdown at work,11,ml1jd5,8,"I don't have the capacity to monitor and organize what I'm about to say, so I'm just going to word vomit. And I shut off grammarly, so my spelling and grammar is going to be shit,

A guy at work I'm good friends with. He's a chill dude and shares my sense of humor, and, too be honest, is the only person who will even try to tolerate my dumbass shenangians. Today we caught sight of a pretty girl and he said he never wants a daughter because she'll wear outfits ""like that"" which cause men ""to not be able to control themselves"". He went on to say how he would never do anything like that (and I believe him, as he's a nice dude whom I've never seen, even remotely, make an inappropriate comment about anyone) but that most men cannot control what they do when they see a pretty girl. He went on to say that women have more control and that they should wear clothing to fend off batshit crazy men who need to rape at the sight of a female shoulder. I argued with him fervently, though I appeared just to be slightly ruffled. I proceeded to go to the bathroom and fall apart. I was sexually assaulted, as a child, wearing an oversized t-shirt and sweatpants—and here's the kicker—by a woman. I had a full-on 30-minute breakdown, several trips to the bathroom to have dissociative episodes, and bite the shit out of my hands to keep me from screaming. I've had tons of episodes at work before, but none this bad. Normally I can bounce back, even if I'm crying, and get on normally (save for odd looks). Today though, I lost it. My mother has always been a stickler for socially appropriate rules. She's told me time and time again that I don't have friends because I make my trauma of too much importance or try to talk about deep topics too quickly. She says that I should stick with just having acquaintances, as having friends is too hard for me. Basically, I am to create a shell of myself and present it to people in order to fit in and be even the slightest bit liked. Well, I broke. I told him in an abrupt manner that I had ptsd by saying ""Damn ptsd decided to really show up. This fucking week."" After collecting myself a bit, I straight up told the dude in the calmest manner I could muster about my background, nothing too gruesome, just the truth. He was obviously very uncomfortable, but I tried not to back down. I asked him if he was okay with me giving some pretty harsh feedback, and he permitted. I straight up told him that his narrative was chidish and that he'd have to grow up one day, because if one thinks that sexually assault is anything more than evil people (if I could even call them human) with an insatiable crave for control, then one is mistaken. I am not an anomolous statistic; I'm a real human with a real life. People who don't have experience with a topic may generate opinions about it with broad strokes taught in the home or community, but broad strokes do nothing but erase many. He's a stand-in manager, and though he wasn't managing that night, he let me clock out asap, and offered to finish up some of my work. Though I made him promise not to walk on eggshells around me (and apologized for bawling like the pussy I am) I was too thankful to go home to refuse the offer. He told me he'd try to be considerate now knowing that about me. Will he forever think I'm a weirdo now? I don't know how normal people think about these things. I've never not had this experience under my belt, so I don't know what it's like approaching the topic without any related background. Will he think of that every time he talks to me now? He's really the only person willing to talk to me, but I'm afraid it's gonna be all weird now. Will it only be weird if I make it weird? How do I not feel super uncomfortable talking to him after this. This took me almost a year to tell my therapist and I've known this dude for like 4 months.

I think it'd be best to just go to my next shift rejuvinated and back to my oddly bubbly self, hoping not to highlight the incident too much. I have absolutely no friends, and I really wish I had right now. I wish more than anything that I had someone to listen to this story and sympathize and be okay with the fact that I made the choice to share this part of myself (be it a stupid choice). I did that and there's no point in criticising me for it now that all is done and said. How do I be okay after all that? I'm scared. I really want to hurt myself. 

I flaired it emotional support, but any advice would be amazing at this point. I don't know how not to spiral on this. I know he probably doesn't give a fuck, but it's bothering me so much. I want to die. I don't know if I can go back to my job. I'm freaking out right now."
To those further along: Who are you if not your trauma? How were you able to let go?,28,ml1gnt,15,"Warning: I feel not ... great right now and I'm sure it shines through so if this might drag you down please don't read on.

My core beliefs are all my trauma. I'm a freak. I'm worthless. My anxieties, my depression and my fears, my subconscious thoughts and acts. Sure, it gets better and you learn to cope and appear normal and okay but underneath it all I'm not. I started EMDR and the road to healing HURTS. all. the time. 

I can't imagine coming out the other end.. and then.. as what? Since this is our childhood, our learned behaviors the subconscious thing that drives us so much more than we even realize..  can you really change that so that it's only ""just a thing that happened""? So that you're an actual person (sorry that's my beliefs shining through of course we all are people right now) but like.. a normal person? You don't need to pretend your inner self, your core.. is not hurt and feeling alien but.. actually okay?

How do you fill all that? How do you let go of all that? what replaces it? Do you actually feel normal, like one of what I would now call ""them""?(I know that's wrong, I just feel so freaking alien and don't know how to better express it) 
Can you actually let go and become whole?"
Started Therapy,19,ml18f8,4,"I have been doing okay on my own. Healing, learning, but I decided to start therapy. Had my first appointment today. That’s a big step for me. So yea. Just wanted to share that"
Finals and Freeze/Flight Response?,2,ml0t9z,4,"I’m a freshman in college living at home due to the pandemic, and this has been the most taxing year of my life mental-health wise. My finals week is coming up and I can’t stop swinging between hyper vigilance and dissociation, and it’s starting to get to me.  

On better days, I charge up with caffeine, run long distances, complete the assignments I can and make an effort to take care of myself. Today is the first day of reading week/last week before finals, and I had bad nightmares and couldn’t focus in my 11am class. I napped after until 3pm and physically couldn’t will myself to do my homework until 6. I have procrastination issues but I’ve gotten a handle on them recently so this is weird. 

My flashbacks have been really bad today. I just drank 2 cups of coffee, I still have so much to do, and all I want is to sleep. And cry. I almost puked earlier lol. I’ve just been listening to music from an NYC band I love (The Strokes, I go to Columbia)  to remind myself that soon I’ll be able to leave home, but I just can’t focus."
Why do people dislike us?,160,ml0pmc,15,"TL;DR:
Half of the reasons for you getting rejected often is that you aren’t, you are just extremely sensitive to anything that could ever be perceived as rejection. The other half consists of us being shy and avoiding people, looking unapproachable, focusing too much on ourselves and being awkward because of it, as well as being overly friendly and needy. 

My CPTSD has been affecting my behaviour ever since I can remember myself, however it has only started severely affecting my socialisation since I was 12. There’s a lot of stuff I did to turn people away from me. I was very insecure, I lied, I expected the worst from everybody, suspected my peers would ridicule me and saw ridicule in any interaction I had with anyone. I was clingy with people I wanted to befriend. Made jokes all the time and just wanted to be close to people so desperately, but I never managed to. I criticised everyone i knew, I got mean. I didn’t check up on people that used to be my friends. I was very emotional when it came to negativity. I stopped wanting to listen to people, I only ever wanted for people to listen to me. I let people be mean to me because I believed I deserved it. I lost my sense of self. I never felt wanted. And it was all so painful because I couldn’t handle rejection either. 

I stopped talking to people for a few years and only started slowly coming back into the social life this year. My social anxiety was crippling at first. Only things I could do was shakily answer basic questions about myself and smile all the time. If I ever was at a social gathering or if I ever was hanging out with someone, that means I was invited there, because I never initiated anything, so I always felt wanted, even though I never connected with anyone. Now that I’ve gotten more confident in myself, I started talking more, initiating conversations and get togethers. The price I pay for this however is getting triggered many times a day. I fear humiliation, I fear criticism, I fear being left out, I fear being weird, or boring, or worst of all - needy.

I experience a lot of rejection and even more perceived rejection that I don’t know how to handle yet. I feel pain mentally and physically when that happens. People usually don’t gravitate towards me and sometimes it feels like I am just a broken, needy, stupid person with an ugly soul. But I think it’s probably 50% in my head, and people actually like me or are neutral; 15% they feel that I appear mean and unapproachable through my body language, my facial expression and my closed off nature when I first speak to someone, 15% they are turned off with me being overly friendly (which is exhausting for myself, although I can’t just easily stop) and needy as we start communicating; 10% is me being insecure and awkward and not knowing how to develop a friendship and the other 10% is them rejecting me for the same reason they would reject any other person (they don’t like my interests/my politics/my values/my humour, any reason really). 

It really fucks with my head sometimes when I have just met somebody and they already are talking to everyone else in the group and ignoring me, but I really think that the reason for that is I’m either imagining it and being jealous because of a trigger, or it’s one of the reasons from the other 50% of my breakdown, although it’s usually both. 

It’s really hard for us to socialise, because we raised ourselves while everyone else had parents. No one taught us how to be around normal people. It’s okay to need more time and mindfulness to get good at talking to people. However, we all also have the inner child that hasn’t grown up yet, because it didn’t get it’s needs met. The child inside desperately needs attention and affection, more attention and affection than most people need, so it becomes very sensitive when someone ignores us, talks to our friend instead, when two of our friends are just talking, but are not talking to us, when no one has asked us about our opinion or our day, or worst of all when some of our friends hang out without us. 

So in conclusion, half of the reasons for you getting rejected often is that you aren’t, you are just extremely sensitive to anything that could ever be perceived as rejection. The other half consists of us being shy and avoiding people, looking unapproachable, focusing too much on ourselves and being awkward because of it, as well as being overly friendly and needy. (Yeah that’s the tldr, L if you read it twice)"
introducing myself and my specific big challenge,1,ml08jd,1,"I recently found this sub. I am 36F and have been in therapy with multiple different therapists & psychiatrists since I was 18. About 1/3 of have said I exhibit features of BPD, 1/3 have said C-PTSD, and 1/3 garden variety depression & anxiety. I don't actually care what my exact label or diagnosis is; I just really really need to manage the following particular symptom that has followed me around my entire life no matter what because it's destroying me.

Basically, in romantic relationships, I have a constant fear of abandonment, and after breakups (if the other person ends it, aka they in fact do abandon me) I attempt suicide and end up in the hospital and once out I'm still suicidal until I find a new long term partner. This has happened 4 times now. I feel extreme emptiness and no interest in being alive when I'm single, regardless of other things in my life (friendships, career, etc). To cope with these feelings I self-harm, oversleep, and don't eat. 

My therapists can't seem to help me with this. It's hard to know what caused it - I have an anxious attachment style and experienced emotional bullying in school as a kid/teen, but no abuse from my parents. I've tried DBT, CBT, and psychodynamic talk therapy. I've taken SSRIs, benzos, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. 

I've gotten a lot better/smarter at fine-tuning how I would successfully attempt next time but I'm willing to try to stay alive for ONE more year if I can find something that helps. Has anyone had luck dealing with this particular tendency?"
I feel like there are different people inside me? Please help?,5,ml03iv,5,"Today, I was in the shower, I looked at my body, and I just dissociated the fuck out. Happens from time to time. My head was in a fog, I felt completely numb. When I felt a little bit more clear, I felt..younger? Like I felt like a child. Later, I had dinner with my parents, and I (?) was acting totally strangely. I physically felt smaller, more tiny, and I pretty much acted like a child. All the while I was thinking *""Who the hell is this?? Why are you so weird???""* Now I think I'm back. A while ago I was getting ready to sleep, and then suddenly I felt very overjoyed, and I felt like my name was Steven, even though that was not my name. I also felt like a different gender.

This is not the first time something like this happened. I remember I was having another dissociation episode a while ago and I heard two people(?) arguing inside my head. Also, when I was being verbally abused, I felt like a totally different person. This other character would come inside my head, and basically try to protect me. They (?) would think **""I have to protect (my name), this is my purpose. I have to make sure that (my name) is safe.""** After the threat was over, I would sorta feel like myself again. All I know that this person is older, and probably female. Not sure though.

Who am I? Am I even myself? What is this? Please somebody help me"
"Is it normal to feel triggered when other people are ""too"" friendly w/ other women. TW CSA",3,mkznjy,5,"hello im f(18). this is my first post and i just wanted to know if anyone else felt this way. 

a little bit of back story so others can understand: I was sexually abused as a child by a cousin and was in contact with them well into my mid teenage years. i don't do well with any affection, physical or emotional really which is why i've kept to myself when it comes to romantic situations. 

ok so there's certain things that trigger me and it's with everyone, doesn't matter if we're close or not. Some examples are, getting too close, too touchy, stares, etc. i don't like people looking or talking to me in a way that i can tell they feel attracted to me. but now im realizing that i also don't like seeing it happen to other women. the woman i just saw this happen to didn't look uncomfortable and it really wasn't a bad situation at all. it was a group of older people talking, mingling and all that. very casual but of course you could sense attraction from all the men, towards the woman. anyways so they were all talking and they looked genuinely comfortable but there was a man who kept talking to her, he would casually put his hand on her arm. it wasn't anything bad but i guess just the fact that i could see he was interested in her made me upset and overwhelmed.

i feel bad because i did step in a little (i know the man, he's a good man he is but i just told him not to get so close and this and that) but it genuinely made me feel so bad and it just triggered me so much. i feel really bad right now, i had plans but i just want to go up to hotel room and cry about it all. does anyone else feel this way? because its easy validating myself when it happens to me but i don't know how to feel when other women have people show interest to them. sorry if i make no sense. thank you for reading."
needed opinion on possibly having cptsd,5,mkzesp,3,"I have a doubt that i might have cptsd so i want to share a bit of my story just to get your opinions perhaps it will help me ( thank you for taking your time to read it) :

 I understand my parents didn’t grow up in the best environment and they tried to do their best and although i have a good relationship with them now  i can't deny that at times i have bouts of childhood flashbacks and i would start crying  ... they both had anger issues especially dad .i always felt uneasy with him . one moment he was a way and then he suddenly would shift . his anger was terrifying he would throw fits like a child at times . but then suddenly he will act like the most loving parent everything was somehow  always about him . If something affected his mood it had to go . if i was punished for something (beaten) and i would cry somewhere in the house  he would threaten me to  stop crying because it was annoying to him .i remember dad slapping  me at least three times in separate occasions  when I did absolutely nothing wrong but talk to him or be in his way when he was mad . and yes no apology . YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE TALKED TO ME KNOWING I AM MAD he would say . One time i came in really excited about something i wanted to watch on tv but apparently i didn't greet him the way  he prefers , so he yelled at me or hit me (i don't remember well) and i left the room in chock that i suddenly started yelling and screaming  in the bathroom ( my memory is fuzzy about this ) i remember my mom  terrified at me and telling dad that he is causing me to go insane or something ( english is not my native language it's just a translation) and then a scene where my dad is sitting with me in my bedroom explaining to me that he acted that way because i was not greeting him properly and that he was justified and he asked me to never act like that again . i couldn't even look him in the face i remember nodding and saying yes . i remember feeling so much hatred towards him  because of how his horrible side would turn a complete 180 and  demand of us to be close to him and greet him always with affection , it always felt  artificial and forced .  as a kid  i wouldn't ever talk to my parents about my issues at school or anything .They praised me for not wanting or demanding things , in reality ,I just suppressed my desires to avoid conflict and anticipated humiliation  . My brother was not like me . if he wanted something he would just say it he is a lot more assertive than me  . Now as an adult I have an insatiable hunger for safety . emotional safety . I don’t talk to anyone about my feelings . there were rare moments with a couple of people where I confined in them some things but as i get older (im23) i feel more and more distant . sometimes I find myself undermining my own self and acting as though my feelings are silly and not ""a big deal"" .I don’t know how to regulate my negative emotions or sometimes even  recognize what I am feeling .  I never cry in front of anyone . I feel friendless , unable to connect with others  , avoidant , depressed, anxious and like an imposter whatever i go ,  I am so scared of conflict or to disappoint people . I have mood swings and low self esteem . But i show a very confident facade .the only way i was validated was through academic achievements that i don't even feel any pride for but that remains  the thing i continue to do to this day .i used to have panic attacks but now its less common . I still get triggered here and there and i would  just feel fear and i would start crying . I don't know if this can indicate  cptsd or just depression or something else 

. i want to clarify that  i don't do drugs or alcohol but i did have a period where i started to  restrict my eating since it gave a sense of control . i feel nauseous a lot and have trouble sleeping ( i always thought it's just anxiety) .i am going through another depressive episode and honestly  i am really tired of this way of living 

i apologise for this being very long . i hope i get some insights from you so i might get to the source of it all . 

thank you in advance ."
Anyone been in in-patient and was it healing or not?,4,mkzatl,8,"I just did an out-patient Hospitalization program at a well known hospital in my metro area and it was absolutely UNHELPFUL. Not trauma-based, saw The awful psychiatrist for maybe 15 minutes tops a day and just a lot of group therapy that was really not geared to any of my problems. The daily 30 minute therapist was nice though. Is in-patient any better or is it just more drudgery that does not get you any closer to finding peace and healing? My insurance is going to pay for everything so I’m considering it"
Can flashbacks be added to?,3,mkyzzi,3,"From what I understand, the parts of consciousness that hold a flashback don't really develop beyond the scope they were created with.

If this were true then is it possible for a secondary sequential part to me formed that holds later trauma related to the initial trauma?

I ask because I once had a part containing an emotional flashback with the mantra (if you will) of ""I'm going to die alone"". After a second secondary trauma, a second mantra was added to it, ""don't lie to me"". I can't figure out what's going on here. I figure if I can grasp the mechanics of this I would have an easier time resolving it.

Does anyone else have an experience like this? Do you know how this works?

Thanks!"
CPTSD and cat ESAs,6,mkyae0,14,"Hey friends

My therapist just approved an ESA letter so I can register a cat as a support animal! I'm so excited!

I'm allergic to dogs, so I'm hoping to train a kitten. Does anyone have any experience doing so? I have experience training rescue cats with behavioral issues, and I *know* cats can be trained and supported with their anxieties, but I don't know how to train them to support *me*

I'm hoping to condition her to approach me when I'm having a flashback, dissociation episode, or panic attack, and accompany me outside in some situations (on airplanes and to doctor's appointments.)

Any advice or personal stories would be appreciated!"
This is life right now. Why I'm stressed. Over reacting? Trivial?,1,mkyt86,1,"My mother taking everything I say as if it was the Bible, going to me for life counseling, all the while if I bring up my issues she tell me I'm literally insane, I don't have any mental health issues, shouldn't talk to anyone or they'll lock me up in a mental hospital, I think at one point she said strapped to the bed, and be forced medication. How I'll destroy everyone's life. How I will destroy this family and everyone's life if I leave the ""safety, love and care"" of this family. 

My sister constantly tells me to shut up, I don't know what I'm talking about and how stupid and retarded I am. 

My dad saying how great our loving family is and our support system yet greatly discourages and talks down on anything small risk I bring up. 25, only last year was the first time allowed to ride my bike on main streets without getting in trouble. Even if I had the money. Get a car? Nope got to save for retirement. Move out? Nope got to save and only when I get married. Asked to not pray 5 times a day with them ( Lutheran religion) and my dad burst into tears and my mother going into her lecture of who's life and how I'll destroy it.

This last weekend, Easter. Hiding 7 full seizures, family doesn't know. Trying to make a EEG apartment without them finding out and how to carefully plan how to turn off my phone so they can't track me while my location shows I'm at work or on a bike ride. Getting into more minor car accidents because I'm unable to focus/ blacking out yet still need to be able to drive.

Not to mention. Now my parents won't allow us as a family to watch pg-13 movies because they're too adult, graphic and profanity yet still want movie nights."
Venting About a Memory (Support?),3,mkyqss,5,"TW: Child trafficking, injury and death (pretty into detail tbh), and car accident, sex trafficking mention and fighting ringss

So at the place where I was child trafficked, one of the things they liked doing other than sell us for sex and put us against each other in fighting rings was do ""challenges"". They somehow thought they were fun, but it was really just them being really sadistic. What they did was ask me to do something. I don't really remember what they wanted me to do, but I do know it was something I didn't know how to do. And they had another girl chained up, and they said something bad would happen to her if I didn't do it. And I freaked out because I didn't know what to do. I ended up not being able to do it, and what they did was run her over with a car. (This is where I start going into detail about what happened to her) I just can't really get it out of my head, how terrified she looked when she saw the car, watching it split her in half and then having it get all over me.. It's not really something an 11 year old should've seen, nothing \*anyone\* should have seen really. I just honestly still kinda feel like it was my fault, even though it never would've happened if they hadn't chosen to do that. But still. If I had known how to do it, then she would've been okay. Probably. They usually didn't kill anyone if the ""challenge"" had been beaten, but sometimes they did. I don't really know. Thx for reading if you did tho

I can't stand it it when the popular guys do this!!!,4,mkyq0x,3,I'm in High school but almost every day I'm always messed with by most of the popular guys because I'm all ways flinching even at the littlest things but I can't help that because my PTSD(a part of it was growing up getting beat by my siblings) but one day I was in my woodworking class and someone come up and slapped me on the butt with a board and I snapped and starting hitting him with a board and I hated it because last time I snapped like that was when my lil sister came to live with me and my dad and I could not take the abuse drone her anymore and I snapped and told her how I felt I'm sorry this too much ain't if you've got to this point.
Finally managing to breakout of my depressive episode,1,mkyomh,2,My aunt just passed away a couple days ago. And I never handled death well. It just reminds me of losing my mother when I was younger. But today I broke out of my depressing ass bubble and finally exercised for the first time all year and played basketball with a few friends. Not a huge improvement but I at least feel better at the moment
I wish there were resources for people in the same stage as me.,3,mkynw9,3,"Right now things have been really bad for me. My symptoms have been worsening for a while now and the past couple of weeks have been particularly bad.  I've never been hospitalized and am not currently on medication (although I'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow), and I've been able to maintain a job (although my work performance has been slipping), so beyond my weekly therapy appointment there's no record that there's anything deeply ""wrong"" with me.

The reality is that I'm barely functioning and keeping it together. Things have gotten so, so bad for me, but there's nothing I can do. I can't afford to work part time and really like my job and would like to keep it, but there's not accommodations I could ask for that would make my job easier for me. I don't qualify for disability. I can't afford to lose my job and don't have the savings to fall back on if something were to happen. All I can do is keep going to therapy, hope medication might work for me, and do the best I can at work. Which sucks. I just wish at least part of my income could be subsidized so I could drop down to working part time and still pay my bills. But there's no resources out there for me and people in similar situations, and I hate that. I need more help than I'm getting right now but the help I need just isn't available."
Do you ever just suddenly dissociate and fall apart from sensory overload or feeling overwhelmed?,4,mkynj4,2,"There's this thing that's happened to me throughout my life, though it happens less now than when I was younger, that I think is just one of the worst, most unpleasant things I've ever experienced. It's this intense feeling of just... bad unpleasant-ness, where it's like my brain and/or the world are falling apart and I can't ground myself. It doesn't consistently happen, especially not as much as it did when I was a kid. But sometimes it just takes such ridiculously seemingly tiny things.

When I'm in public and suddenly get this feeling, thoughts, and basically certainty that I look stupid or awkward or other people are seeing me negatively... it's like I feel my consciousness flies up away from earth and I detach and suddenly I'm pulled into my mind and my fears, seeing the world from miles away. It's like my mind's out in space, or lost in the ocean about to drown and I can't get grounded in any way.

Or sometimes just on a day when I'm feeling extra sensitive and all my senses are too heightened, and then I hear a siren. It pierces my ears, scrambles my brain and it's like I don't want to dissociate over something so dumb but can't stand the physical discomfort and mental discomfort it causes.

Or if I'm feeling sensitive and generally emotionally in pain, not feeling great about myself, and then someone yells at me. I'm struggling to pay attention to what they're saying and what's going on in front of me, pull up the sinking feeling I have to fight the growing pain and self-hate and keep myself from totally sinking, racing thoughts in my brain the whole time. It's all too much, and I end up leaving feeling terrible over such a small event.

Or during a social situation, where I'm having trouble staying grounded and just freeze up, fighting with my brain and feeling negatively about myself. My mind is racing faster than seems possible, analyzing things and trying to work through my thoughts in ways that don't really make sense, trying to either figure out if I'm wrong and it's just my anxiety/mental illness, or see ""proof"" that things really are terrible and people really do hate me.


It just seems like very little things happen and, in the moment, it feels like they tear my whole world apart. Sometimes it's not as bad, but other times, in just a minute it suddenly feels like nothing is ok and nothing will ever be ok again. I lost sight of anything good and the world looks terrifying or hopeless or whatever. 

I can't tell if it's a sensory overload thing sometimes, or emotional and mental, or what. 

Does anyone else relate?"
Talking about the trauma in therapy?,1,mkyn94,2,"I'm supposed to start talking about trauma tomorrow. I'm bipolar and finally reasonably stable. My therapist feels it's time to start talking about it.

My question is... why talk about it? I know it'll make me upset and depressed and suicidal. I don't really remember it. It happened when I was a kid and teenager and I'm 28 now. It stopped 10 years ago. It won't happen again.

Why talk about it? What's the point? 

Can I be ok without talking about it or do I need to talk about it in therapy? 

I don't have the will to move past feeling bad.

The advise was verbal and emotional with emotional neglect."

I've been having really bad sleeping problems lately -- again,5,mky812,5,"Just want to vent.

I can't sleep again. It's almost 2 am and I have work in the morning... I don't feel sleepy. I do feel tired. 

I took some herb pill half an hour ago, but I doubt it will work magic. I don't like prescription sedatives because they make me feel groggy the next day and often don't even work like they should.

I don't even know why I can't sleep. I feel uneasy, as usual.

When I have been able to sleep lately, I've had nightmares often. Some concerning my past."
I do better when I am busy?,2,mky7zf,1,"For example, before the pandemic i had finally found my groove, I was going to the gym regularly, going to all my classes, completing my work on time and working part time at a job i enjoyed. Most importantly though I was doing good in uni. I was pushing deadlines but I got all of my work done!

Now, I only have to focus on school and just deciding what to eat for dinner. I have so much time but I cannot bring myself do my work and haven't been able to really for the entirety of the pandemic. It is hurting me now and I feel so stuck. 

I think this has to do something with the fact that during high school I was extremely busy all the time and I was living at home. And once you have a routine it's easier to keep with it.

 I was the eldest daughter so I had many, many things to do. I began the day at 6am for school and walked back home with my siblings by 4pm. The I had chores such as cleaning, cooking, making sure everyone takes a shower and does their homework, laundry, etc. on top of my schoolwork and taking care of myself. No, I did not socialize with other kids outside of school. 

So now I am just paralyzed with looming deadlines and I can't bring myself to do anything without stimulants but I don't as much anymore. I cannot wait for this pandemic to be over :("

I'm terrified and repulsed by masculine lesbians. Like, they scare the absolute shit out of me, which I know isn't fair on them but I can't help it.

If a female starts getting close to me I feel like she's a lesbian and I get scared, and therefore i don't have many friends. I prefer the company of men because at least I know what they want.

I have a hard time orgasming during sex, but I can easily reach climax 2 or 3 times alone.

I like sex with men I will never see again, hidden and secretive. I have had many one-nighters, both before and during my marriage. My husband knows, it was in the past, but I still wish I could do that again. I'm too fat and ugly now for anyone to be attracted to me.

I was molested as a little girl (I cannot go into detail but it wasn't a man--one episode for certain and another in which I am not sure if they were boys or girls. I can't say more because my story is weird and unusual and recognizable).

I find men attractive and sexy. I can admire a pretty woman but I do not think women are sexy and I am not attracted to them sexually.  


During sex I cannot ""be there"" mentally. I am there, and I can perform, but my head is not there. I'm really good at sex and good at making men feel good, but I'm just thinking of the mechanics of it, and trying to figure out ways to make it end faster.  


I grew up with two narcissist parents--dad was overt and loud and mean and violent, mom was meek and the martyr and the victim and a big child, and both drank. I had an older sister with serious psychological problems with substance abuse as she got older and she was abusive towards me. I had an older brother who was abusive towards me. 

Without a doubt most of my issues come from being molested but even though I know that, I don't know how to change it. I am always afraid of speaking too much about this to therapists--if they are female my head tells me they might be lesbian and if they are male I'm thinking they have an agenda.   


Does anyone have any advice? Am I doomed to live the rest of my life unable to enjoy sex with anyone but myself? That would be lame. I want to enjoy it with my husband and get over these hang-ups."
My body won't calm down.,2,mkxwy7,6,"My body has been in trigger mode for two straight days now. Pounding heart, feels like I have a gaping hole in my chest, physically exhausted but can't settle or sleep. I've journaled, I've taken GABA, I've done breathing exercises, I've gone for walks, it's still there.

My birthday is coming up and it's the anniversary of a sexual assault, so I feel like that's probably part of it... But my inner child part is also really activated right now. I just want to be cuddled in a totally platonic and supportive way-- that seems like it would help with the gaping hole in my chest.

Anyway. This really sucks. 

That's all."
DAE prefer being emotionally dissociated?,7,mkxuxt,4,"For me personally, I don't mean that the emotions are too big for me to handle. I mean that I just prefer to make decisions intellectually. I've been doing it my whole life. I was born doing it. My mother does it. My grandmother does it. My whole extended family does it. We all make decisions intellectually. Emotion-based decision-making, in our family, is...uh...viewed very unfavourably. I don't mean that we dislike people who do it; but there is an underlying assumption that the only reason one would make a decision because of an emotion, is that one is intellectually incapable of doing so because of a *reason.*

Now I'm less emotionally dissociated and I have all these emotions coming up, telling me what to do. And I hate it. It goes against generations of programming. It goes against a quarter century of learning how to make decisions well. My brain no longer matches my gut. It feels horrible and it feels like I've been railroaded!

The angst train has reached its destination, thanks. Can't seem to put the cat back in the bag.

Sorry if I've said anything insensitive in this post. Despite being highly intellectual, I've always been very sensitive to others' feelings. With all these emotions coming up, all my radars, filters, and boundaries are basically fucked. I have no idea what's appropriate or not anymore!"
Everything is making me cry today,4,mkxp2i,1,"Just absolutely everything. Some celeb gossip? Waterworks. Wrote an essay? Waterworks. My partner made a (albeit stressful) phonecall? Waterworks. I finally took my rescue meds because everything is making me cry. I hate it. I'm trying desperately to self regulate but I currently don't have a therapist for bullshit reasons and everything is just so hard. I cried yesterday too because my extended family is trying to help us and I don't know why. As far as I can tell they hate me for outing what my m*m did to me so I don't know why now. 

I know its just a bad day. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to. But everything is just so wildly upsetting. I just want to skip the rest of today."
I’m exhausted by this never ending shame.,0,mkxhh6,1,"My adult daughter, a carbon copy of her narcissistic father, effectively ejected me from her life after her baby was born and told me I cannot see the baby anymore. Her way of punishing me with the one thing that would hurt me the most. I wasn’t invited to her christening but my whole family, four sisters their spouses and kids, aunts uncles, cousins, my ex husband (an ex con, recovering heroin addict with numerous breaks in sobriety and a second ex wife, who cheated on me with underage girls, and physically and sexually abused me) all were invited. At holidays it was either I could go or she could go to the party so of course, I was the one left out, everyone loves her and her baby, and all her success, and of course I got phased out of the family. Even my other daughter stopped talking to me. My mom passed away in March 2020. After that I had no contact with anyone at all. It has been three solid years since my daughter did this. We moved 2000 miles away last year to try and quell the throbbing pain and shame. The shame is devastating. I’m not sure how I’m living through this. I feel otherworldly, like nothing could hurt me at all, I’ve felt the ultimate pain so many times I’m out of pain receptors. I do not self harm anymore, I haven’t for 3 years. I think I concentrate so much on staying alive and getting through each day, for my darling husband, my poor husband who has to live with a shell of a person.

I was diagnosed with CPTSD six years ago. I suffered a horribly traumatic childhood and adolescence, and married at 19 to an abusive addict who caused another layer of CPTSD. I’ve gone to a six week treatment center which helped immensely as I’m no longer self harming and I’m still alive. I just don’t feel alive. Covid is making it nearly impossible to make any friends in my new state."

When will I finally feel like I deserve to be happy?,26,mkxbpa,5,"It's like imposter syndrome meets survivor's guilt. I am healthy, I am happy, I am in love, I am financially stable, and so many other things that have gone wrong in my life are finally going right. 

So why do I feel like it's wasted on me?

It's not a conscious thought, but every time I do something like buy myself a new pair of shoes, I feel horribly guilty, wasteful, and like there are better ways to spend my money--there are people out there really struggling to make ends meet, and here I am, enjoying myself.

It's the strangest feeling when I pass by a homeless person now. I used to stop, get out of my car, and ask if there was anything I could do to help (and even then, there was a lot of the time I couldn't do much anyway). It made my heart hurt. Now I realize that while it is unfortunate, it is not my personal responsibility to take care of each individual person I meet. If I have something to give, I give it, if not, I walk on by, and continue with my day.

It feels selfish to me, but a big part of my CPTSD has always involved fawning, changing a core part of who I was to accomodate anyone else involved wirh me. Especially people in need, even to my own derriment. It fills my brain with static because I know it is the 'healthy' thing to do, to have boundaries, to put one's own health ahead of all others, but it still feels wrong at times, that I should be happy while other people suffer."
Working a job with this,3,mkwyoe,1,Looking for advice from people who have a job and cptsd. I need tips for how to make the application process easier. I'm having trouble finding a place to apply to and being nervous about job interviews.
This is why the “common denominator” theory is so dangerous,66,mkw96a,8,"“The victims of physical violence may also remain victims. Martin Seligman has done extensive studies on what is called ‘learned helplessness.’  In essence, arbitrary, random, and unpredictable beatings create a state of passivity in which the victim no longer feels that there is anything that she can do. A negative belief system is adhered to. The person no longer believes she has a choice. 

A simpler explanation for the bonding to violence is the fact that as one is beaten more and more, one is shamed more and more. The more internalized the shame, the greater the belief in oneself as defective and flawed. The more one believes one is defective and flawed, the more one’s choices are diminished. Internalized shame destroys one’s boundaries. Without boundaries one has no protection.”

Should I move in?,3,mkw448,3,"I had a psychological seizure and an injury to my finger (severed tendon) after breaking up my abusive relationship in December 2019. Helped my Mom in a rural area and spent quite a bit of money to help her, but she’s very mentally ill. 

I got back on the dating scene around January/February of 2020. I met a 30 year old young man whom I fell in love with, but he was unfortunately furloughed from his job and moved in with me very very quickly after dating for 3 months. I also took care of him after/during his psychological seizure. 

My sister was having a mental breakdown and was socially isolating herself during COVID, so I was hanging out with him quite a bit. Tried to kill herself in the city where I live (it’s all pretty compact), and stole $11K from me (am looking into recovering funds with help of Bank’s Financial Crimes). 

I emotionally and financially supported him until he found a well-paying job 3 weeks into living with me. Things were going well. 

New Year’s 2020 his parents decide they don’t like me. January 2021 he comes back from the gym after talking to an acquaintance and says he isn’t sure that he loves me. I am (understandably) upset as I have flashbacks and am struggling to find good employment. I tell him - my heart broken - to move out. 

He moves out. 

I struggle through a job where I am treated poorly, but it’s a good “foot in the door” opportunity. I quit over sexual harassment and the low pay. 

After I quit, I was struggling mentally very much. Before committing myself, I ask him for help. I’ve been staying at his place for about 3 weeks now, away from the city where I went through further trauma, and am healing up well. 

His uncle’s estate is divided up, and now he’s completely financially stable. He says now that he realizes the joy I bring to his life, and that I should move in. He has apologized and we have talked over things more extensively over the last 2 weeks. 

I want to make sure this isn’t a trauma bond situation. He’s helped me get a very promising lead on a job; I expect good news tomorrow. 

My apartment is fairly isolating, and it does help to live with somebody, but I want to move in for the right reasons and not just because I can’t live on my own (which I have before in my life)...am new to the city and no friends/support because of COVID. 

How do I tell if this is a trauma bond or what? 

I don’t want to go back to my isolating apartment in a city with traumatic reminders, have always been the steady partner, and am healing amazingly here regardless of how you’d characterize our bond. 

I’m trying to do the right thing; he’s been clear on his feelings toward me (romantic, he says he definitely loves me), I’ve been journaling and integrating active coping methods into my life to curb my depression. 

I want to do what’s best for the relationship and also to establish clear boundaries. 

We improve together. I want to move out without the move being traumatic itself (I have moved about 3-4 times in the last year), so if I moved in it would be gradual."
DAE not willing to try?,1,mkvtei,3,"I'm a mess & I won't go into details about how messed up i am in every aspect of my life.

The worst part is I'm not willing to try, I don't feel like trying to ""heal"" or ""overcome my depression/anxiety"" and all the crap out there (no offense, this is just me). 

Before I used to read articles and try to apply what's on there, but lately I have completely given up and I won't even try to read or watch a how to video on youtube. 

I hate everything, music? I hate. Youtube videos? I hate them. Reddit? I hate it.

Why? because I feel I'm being manipulated to use the services, there's always this cool thing that you must watch/read. And yes here I am using reddit, But this is probably the only way to interact with people I can relate to."
i dont want it to turn out that they genuinely love me,9,mkucro,8,"because then it means that my own parents love wasnt enough for me. i dont know how to live with myself knowing i got everything i fucking wanted but it wasnt enough. theres just this giant yawning void in my chest all the time and it aches every time they say anything along the lines that they love and care about me. it always feels like manipulation, like theyre trying to convince themselves. as much as not being genuinely loved by a single person on planet earth hurts like a bitch right now, i dont know if ill be able to handle it if my very own parents love just wasnt enough for me.not being loved is simple. its easy. its an obvious hurt. i could tell someone my parents dont love me and they would immediately understand why i am the way i am. if they do love me, what the fuck do i do then? do i get to be this unendingly miserable and scared?"
Stuck in limbo. Why can’t I just do what needs to be done?,2,mkurwc,1,"I feel stuck in limbo. My home situation deteriorated right before the pandemic and I have been trapped in the same house as my abusive parent. I’m trying to get myself out but it’s messy and drawn out because there are lawyers involved and I don’t have a job. 

Here is part of my problem. The lack of a job. I am on disability support so I do have some money coming in, but it’s not enough to pay my expenses once I move out on my own. I am acutely aware of this and yet... I don’t feel like I have the mental reserves to go through the motions of applying for jobs and attending interviews. So I sit at home and waste my time playing silly video games to distract myself from my reality until I can finally escape. 

I berate myself on my laziness and stupidity. I hear about stories of people who apply themselves, get a job and work hard to escape their toxic situations. Why can’t I do that? What is wrong with me? Does it mean I don’t want out badly enough? I feel like a failure. Like it is proof that I am the useless, selfish, disgusting person my parent tells me I am.

It feels worse this time because  I have always considered myself to be a proactive person. I do what needs to be done, regardless of how I feel. “Because that’s just what you do”. You suck it up and keep going, right? ...

I had to withdraw from studying this semester as well because I pushed my body too far last year trying to finish my first degree, and made my chronic pain issues significantly worse. I use what little energy I have trying to keep my other mental health diagnoses under control and rehabbing my body. My studies were the one area I thought I was making progress in. I had been clinging to that thread of hope for so long and now it feels like that thread has been cut and I am in freefall. I have nothing to show for my 30 years on earth. 

There is just too much to do. While I sit here in limbo, feeling powerless, invisible and and worthless.

Can anyone relate?"
I’m SO SO SO frustrated with my memory problems,3,mkvg0u,4,"I feel like no one understands the depth of my memory issues. I feel so isolated in this problem and feel so stupid!!

When I tell my family I can’t remember things I said or did in the past, they tell me I’m lying or saying that as an excuse.

My friends and family say “just write it down,” but my notebooks are FULL of things jotted down. I’ll either forget I wrote it or not understand what I was trying to write so I get confused. 

I started a brand new job and I’m scared I’ll get in trouble because I’m forgetting to do small things. I work in customer service and there are so many little steps and rules we have to follow for each phone call and I always write down what I need to do, and try to concentrate as hard as I can to remember, then as soon as I get off the call I’ll be like DAMN I forgot to do everything!!! Every call’s the same: I say I’ll remember, write all the steps down, get mad and say I’ll remember next time, rinse and repeat. 

I’ll have errands or bills I need to pay that are time sensitive and when husband asks did you do it? I say fuck I forgot. Even though I wrote it down in a million places. 

Anyone else?? I just feel so stupid like it should be this difficult! It’s like my brain is completely empty. So so frustrating. My therapist even said to do more meditation but I forget to do that too. Ugh. So frustrating"
A Success Story: Some Tools That Are Working For Me,10,mkv9n9,3,"A bit of background about me. I was a couch-bound agoraphobic freeze type and now I'm a somewhat functional member of society. I think the most important thing to note is I went from being in a constant state of flashback to now experiencing 1-4 very minor flashbacks per month. 

I am by no means completely cured, but I know have a pretty long streak of feeling happiness and accomplishment (which was something that seemed impossible just two years ago).

I'd like to mention a few Body-Based tools that have helped me with the hopes it might help a few others, but like all cptsd advice, YMMV.

&#x200B;

**1. A Progressive Exercise Routine**

I knew that exercise could lower stress, improve sleep yada yada yada....but when I was stuck, I honestly didn't care about all that. It seemed futile at worst, too difficult at best, and also perhaps deep down I didn't feel like I deserved to be healthy. Let's also not forget how embarrassing and shameful it feels to be so out of shape. 

What helped me get out of this pattern was to make a deal with myself; I would do a 30-minute workout each day. That's it. I didn't have to try hard. I didn't have to sweat. I didn't even necessarily have to finish it. I just had to try it out.

I started the workout P90 at home (not p90x, just p90. The one for older folks and people that have never worked out before) and I used the lightest weights I could find. I half-assed each workout big time. I did it with normal clothes and usually in a dissociated fog. When they asked for 15-pushups I did 6 low-effort pushups on my knees. If they did a movement I didn't want to do, I didn't do it. 

I made a deal with myself that I would try a little harder next time and I made it clear to myself just how unskilled and out of shape I had gotten over the years (not to shame myself but to let myself understand why it was so difficult and to cut myself some slack). 

Over time, the workouts became easier and easier. My movement in daily life became less labored, my sense of self increased slightly, and I felt much more ""in my body"". Most importantly I trusted myself a bit more. Looking different and having more pride in my appearance also was a nice plus.

After about 60 days or so I started going to a local gym and repeated the process over. At first I just sat on a bike there and pedaled for 15 minutes while trying not to run out of the gym. Over time this grew to 90-minute workouts at the gym most days. 

I recommend [beachbodyondemand.com](https://beachbodyondemand.com) to start, but if you don't want to spend money, [https://www.gymra.com/](https://www.gymra.com/) is free and also has a free tv app.

**2. EFT-Tapping**

I always assumed EFT tapping was B.S. but I listened to a trauma psychologist talk about its efficacy for restoring motivation.

I usually start my day out tapping about how I don't want to get out of bed. It allows me to tap into the reasons I don't want to do anything and it gets all my worries and negative thoughts out in front of me so I can see them. I don't know exactly why It works but it definitely increases my motivation and sometimes results in an emotional release. 

These are the resources I use:

&#x200B;

**3. Yoga** 

A lot has already been said about yoga and its application for cptsd but I want to anecdotally say that after doing it for a while I feel much more grounded in not just my body but reality itself.  I also want to point out that if you have cptsd or ptsd, moving in silence and doing something for yourself is going to suck at first, but keep in mind the benefits far outweigh these discomforts.

&#x200B;

**4. Body Scan Meditation**

It's my opinion that everyone with cptsd should be doing this daily for as long as possible. I try to do 30 minutes per day of Body Scan Meditation. You should expect to feel more in your body and relaxed after this. It's truly one of the best ways to regain your body.

Let me know if there's any interest for other free tools that I use (I posted 4 of about 20 that I use)

and if you have any tools that you use that I might find useful let me know!"
Food trauma?,7,mkv7az,4,"Are there any resources (subreddits, books, etc) about food related trauma? There were years when I was a child that I was sent to school with no breakfast, no packed lunch, and no momey to buy lunch. I knew if I complained, I would get yelled at and punished.

As an adult, I can get horrible panic attacks about food. I will have to repeatedly check my fridge and pantry to make sure food is still there."
DAE revert to past versions of themself or similar when triggered?,9,mkuvha,4,"I have emotional flashbacks and sometimes I end up losing my current sense of self. The further back in time I go, the most disconnected from my present I am. I get confused about what year it is, can't believe that it's 2021, and everything around me feels foreign. I refer to myself using the names & pronouns I used at that time in my life. It's a pattern of the same few states of self, too. Each one has their own emotions they experience, ways they respond to whatever's happening, an appearance in my head...

I get triggered via reminders of specific events, but each self-state is... it's own thing. Experiencing isn't exclusive to the memory that triggered me. I begin to navigate the world as that self until I'm no longer triggered. The ones from a few years ago, I can act fairly normal since they're very similar to me now. But the youngest one, from around 5-8 years old, I'm nonverbal when I'm her. And unlike the other ones where I lose awareness of the present, when I'm her,... Present me is still there, and I talk to her and calm her down.

I've been previously diagnosed with OSDD. But that was also related to my psychosis so I thought it was a misdiagnosis. Once I went into remission for psychosis, I thought that was the end of the self-state changes. But I've realized that... it isn't. And I guess now I'm wondering where the line is between an emotional flashback and a fragmented alter. I don't have amnesia during these events, but my memory does get fuzzy and I won't remember all of what happened. I really don't know when this started, honestly. But I've become more aware of it.

I just feel alone and confused. If anyone else has experienced something similar, whether you have alters/fragments or not, it'd be helpful and comforting to hear your experience, if you want to share. And for reference, I don't want to consider myself a system because when I was psychotic I did and it was super detrimental to me."
I am tired of having so called “issues”,143,mkult8,20,"Everything my body is doing and feeling is normal; some crazy shit happened to me and the world keeps turning like nothing happened.  Of course I’m not going to be feeling well.  Of course I am going to be suspicious; the people who betrayed me were the ones who were supposed to support me the most.  So it’s not “trust issues” if it’s a perfectly functioning mechanism that has served me and protected me time and time again.

The REAL issue is my abuser, and other abusers.  I cannot be the one with the issue if, statistically, someone is being sexually assaulted every 5 minutes.  

And yet it is my work performance that is being affected, my bank account that receives the medical bills, my friends who have to carry my anger, my children who have to bear the intergenerational trauma, my capacity being tested to support other survivors, ... And the people who are part of the problem continue to oppress and keep it that way.  They continue to convince me that it must have been my fault.

F this shit man."
I think I got triggered by something my therapist did and I have to bring it up to them. Any advice?,5,mkughk,5,"I think my therapist unknowingly triggered me during my last session. I know I need to bring this up with them. I literally haven't left my bed in two days. I feel like someone beat me up. 

I am pretty scared tbh. My legit solution was to just quit therapy. 

If my therapist so much as gives a whiff of defensiveness I'll fucking lose my shit. 

Any advice for bringing up how a therapist hurt you?"
Establishing boundaries went ehm.. oof,4,mku577,2,"I am trying to assert my boundaries more and sometimes that works out and sometimes my partner get triggered and feels rejected. That in turn triggers in me feelings of not being worthy of that kind of selfishness or thoughts that no one loves the ""real"" me, but only stay with me to the extent I can self sacrifice, that I should not trust anyone etc. I am writing this dissociating (so forgive me for poor syntax) and having a hard time contradicting these thoughts. It was such a stupid thing too. My partner wants to exercise with me multiple times a week and I said I wanted to still be able to practice flamenco 3 times a week instead of 2 because it does wonders to my mental health. He said ok but was clearly disappointed, withheld affection, and then later said something about me wanting to leave him, rebelling against him for no reason, him not being good enough, not making enough money etc.

So it seems we are playing ping pong with our insecurities and it is so hard to interrupt this when we are both triggered. 

Any ideas to stop this mechanism when it happens?"
Does anyone else have to fight themselves so hard during flashbacks?,2,mktyul,6," ⚠️ Trigger warning ⚠️: drowning, flashback, self harm

I really want to avoid triggering anyone. I found out that CPTSD is what i have been experiencing for the last 3 years since i first left my abusers. I thought I've only had a couple flashbacks but I've been reading ""Surviving to Thriving"" and realized i had been having flashbacks everytime i got upset

When i go into a flashback, i age regress and it's like 80% of me wants it continue. Just the strongest urge to just stand there and make myself suffer. I don't want it to end. I deserve it. Big urges to self harm like getting hit by a car, sleeping out in the snow, starving myself etc. Only thing that stops me is knowing my boyfriend would get mad and yell at me.

I describe it sort of like drowning. A small part of me (20%) is trying to swim up to the surface. i want it to end. I wanna stop shaking and sobbing. I wanna feel safe again

However that 80% is pulling me down. Everytime I'm almost there, it grabs me by the foot and pulls me down. 

I've recently learned grounding is very useful and started carrying a rough textured rock and/or a face brush with me to rub when I'm really anxious. They have saved me a couple times. I also use a lotion called Stargazing mediation that has essential oils in it. It's only used during flashbacks. Some of these flashbacks start because i ruminate and can't stop

I just wanted to know if other people experienced emotional flashbacks like this. If not, how do you experience them? and if there are any other tips you use to get out of a flashback.

Also i love everyone on this Reddit ❤️ you guys are so amazing & strong. If you need a friend, please dm me 💜"
I hate how paranoid/hypervigilant I am when outside just trying to enjoy the fresh air,723,mktdk2,56,"I was out for a walk with my mom and these two guys came up behind and were talking, and I completely was unable to pay attention to what my mom was saying and started involuntarily trying to hear what they were saying in case they were making fun of us. My heart raced and I felt agitated and really anxious and shaking. This is just a normal thing that casually hits me every time I go out and there's people around. I hate this disorder. Wish I could relax like other people.

&#x200B;

Edit: I feel the need to add we were not in a crowded area and had masks. I feel bad if I don't mention that detail. "
Journal apps?,2,mkt6kk,3,"I'm looking for an app that has daily guided mental health journalling questions or prompts. It would be great if I could also incorporate a mood tracker or other bullet journal stuff. Does anyone know of any good apps? I've already tried quite a few but none really have just what I'm looking for, which i clearly can't even out into words! Any suggestions are greatly appreciated"
[possible relationship trigger warning] Proud of how I managed a super intense flashback,4,mkssj5,1,"Just had a major flashback that was triggered by something I don't have a history of.

I was listening to music, feeling good, when a song about infidelity came on. It put me in full-on 4F panic, and incapacitated me for an hour. Pounding heart, uncontrolled catastrophizing about being cheated on, franticly searching for a quick fix to feel better. Instead, I worked through Walkers' steps for flashback management, wrote about it in my journal, and gave myself a little space to feel safe before going back to work. It worked, and I'm okay! This afternoon when I catch a break in my work, I'm going to take an hour off to continue to process instead of ignoring it.

I've never experienced infidelity, so my response was confusing. As I work on healing and recovery from trauma, my relationship is also improving, although improving intimacy is slow-going. I think the song triggered my fear of abandonment, but it was so unexpected it caught me completely flat-footed. I still feel sad, like lingering emotions form an event that only happened in my mind, but it feels manageable and transient instead of overwhelming and permanent.

Getting a PTSD diagnosis and finding the CPTSD community has really changed my life. Having the *language* for what I'm feeling has allowed me to take an event that would have ruined my whole week and probably caused a fight in my relationship and allowed me to process it in a healthy way and avoid paralysis. 

I'm greatful for the progress I've made so far. Just wanted to share that with a community who understands the significance."
My struggles with the glorification of trauma and mental illness,49,mksd62,16,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how difficult it is to get people to believe my story when I tell it, and believe that when I use the words ‘trauma’ and ‘abuse’, that I am not exaggerating or using the words to mean something that they’re not. And I find that in situations where I need to seek support, I now have to divulge way more information about my trauma than I am comfortable with in order to get people to take me seriously. And I firmly believe this is because of people who use the words ‘abuse’ and ‘trauma’ to describe situations that aren’t actually abuse or trauma. And it does not have to be trauma for it to be painful! Something can be intensely painful without being traumatic. One isn’t worse than the other, but they are intensely different. People have got to stop describing difficult and uncomfortable experiences as ‘traumatic’, because every time someone calls something difficult they went through a ‘trauma’, it takes a little bit of that word’s meaning away. Because of the glorification of trauma and mental illness perpetuated by hollywood especially, I find that people want to speak for us and our community and try and insert themselves into it when frankly, they have no clue what they’re talking about. If for one second these people who claim to be advocating for trauma survivors while also making our lives harder by misusing the words knew what it was like to live this life, they would stop what they’re doing and let us speak for ourselves. I’m certain of it. We are a resilient bunch, but because we’ve largely been labelled as helpless victims, we aren’t being allowed to speak for ourselves. I’m exhausted because I find myself having to prove that my experiences are real and my stories have validity because of those who use the word ‘trauma’ to describe something hard that they went through. Because of this, now we no longer have the option of saying ‘I have lived through multiple traumatic experiences’ without having to follow it up with more information in order to have the scope of our challenges realised. I don’t need validation from anyone, but I need people to understand what happens when they overuse these words. I’m exhausted."
Would anyone be interested in Cptsd dance classes?,44,mksci9,21,"Hey! I’m a dance teacher (now on a break), and am currently in therapy for cptsd. I have a really good bond with my therapist and I had mentioned to her how I saw a link on here for cptsd yoga, and how i was really excited to see this existed. She told me she’d been thinking about that already and how she had thought I could give cptsd or trauma dance classes later in life, if i wanted to. And I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately. It actually has given me something to look forward to later in life, which is pretty rare for me. I guess I’m just wondering if there are any other (ex)dancers or enthousiasts that would be interested in this?

edit: spelling

edit2: It’s so great to see how many people would be interested in this!! I’d have to do some research and thinking about the format and such, but I think this could be really great. 

I’ve also had a lot of experience teaching pre-teens, and after a lot of reflection on myself I noticed that they’ve learned me a lot about body awareness. 12-14 is usually the ages where a lot of kids get growth spurt and thus lose that ‘comfortableness’ in their bodies. Over the years I developed a lot of exercises for this, coming back into your own body in a safe and very personal way. In these exercises I focus a lot on moving with what you’re  feeling in your body instead of fixed movements, where a lot of perfectionism can come in to play. Feeling what your body needs, can be very triggering, but, for me at least, when I’m dancing it takes away that heavy burden of existing. It feels as if I’m in another world, floating, but at the same time caring for my body and what it wants to do. 

Needless to say, these exercises helped me too and I think they can help a lot others as well."
Is there anyway I can share trauma without it being on my Reddit post history?,5,mks8ov,7,"I want to share a trauma, but don't want it to be publicly viewed as I have had people go through my post history. Is there a chat room that is active from this group?"
"My inner child spent so many years huddled in a dark corner, terrified and self-loathing. Flickering moments now break that darkness, showing her standing with a proud gleam in her eyes as she screams in an fury overwhelming those who failed her, neglected and abused her.",43,mks3b8,11,"It's hard to describe the feeling that swells in my chest when I see my inner child standing up for herself, knowing she is worth so much more than what had been done to her by those who should have protected her. I'm almost brought to tears at the realization of how *fucking brave* she is. A part of me feels hope that I can heal because it knows that my inner child is *a part* of me and her strength makes me worth living. I have to keep fighting and struggling and *loving myself* for her. She deserves it."
I want to move away but I feel so guilty,4,mks0cd,5,"This is going to be a long vent, TLDR at the end

I have always hated the town I grew up in, and I have promised myself since I was a kid that I would move away as soon as I could. Years have gone by and I’ve gotten married, and my husband and I started looking for a house to buy. We saw a lot of great ones, but my gut always told me not to jump on it.

Today I realized that it’s because I don’t want to put down roots here. I almost feel like I would be doing my inner child a disservice by staying in the same small town I was abused in surrounded all the people who turned the other cheek. My abuser moved away a long time ago, but all of those painful memories are still there.

I’ve mentioned to my mom before that I want to move out of state, to somewhere with more sunshine and warmer weather. She always guilt trips me for leaving her, tells me that I’m going to get in over my head and that it would be a huge mistake, and I’ve let that stop me for a long time. She parentified me a lot as a kid and I still struggle with feeling responsible for her and her emotional wellbeing. At the same time, she’s always made me feel like I am incapable of doing anything/ being independent from her. She cried and threw a fit when I moved to an apartment 15 minutes away from her with my husband. We have a very codependent relationship with each other but in a lot of ways are each other’s best friends even though it’s really dysfunctional.

It scares the hell out of me. My husband and I would both be leaving very cushy jobs where we are paid very well with super low stress, plans for both of us to advance our roles, and low cost of living. I’d feel guilty missing get-togethers with my mom’s side of the family, and I’d feel guilty that any future children I might decide to have won’t have a close relationship with their grandparents. But at the same time, I am so unhappy living here. I feel so trapped by my history in this place and I want to get out so badly. I don’t think I will ever reach my full potential of healing if I can’t live somewhere that makes me feel... alive

This is the perfect time to do it. I graduated last year, my husband’s classes have all converted to online because of the pandemic and he will be done in 9 months. His sister moved to Texas 3 years ago and our brother-in-law works for a tech company down there that would give my husband some really good connections to quickly find a job. I don’t know that I could find something as easily, but we could live pretty comfortably off of just my husband’s salary and our savings if necessary for a while if we had to. The area we’d be looking at is in the early stages of a tech-boom and that is very exciting to my software engineer husband, plus the fact that he would like to live close to his sister and our nieces/ nephews.

My heart tells me to just take the plunge and do it, but my head fixates on the what-ifs, the potential negatives, and the guilt I’d feel for leaving my mom. I wish it was as easy as just deciding not to care, but I have spent my whole life caring for her and living my life in service of her and it’s so hard to just let that go. 

Logically, it doesn’t make sense. Our disposable income might go way down, we might have more financial stress until/ if I find a job, we have so much stability and room for growth in our current jobs, a lot of my husband’s family is here, i’d be leaving my mom etc. But at the same time, I might gain so much freedom finally being able to be away from the place that I spent so many years being miserable. I spend hours researching neighborhoods, rentals, job openings, etc and in the end I never do anything. I feel trapped by my indecision and guilt.

TLDR I want to move away from my home town where I suffered years of abuse but my mom’s guilt trips and my own self-doubts are keeping me trapped here."
Wanting love desperately but refusing to let anyone close :(,14,mkruzw,6,"Recently, I've fallen back into my old embarrassing habits of looking up a million couple videos on Tiktok and Youtube because I keep thinking about relationships and wanting my very own someone. 

The thing is, even though I swear up and down that I want a relationship and that these videos are making me uber jealous, I refuse to allow people to get close to me. I keep the RBF on at all times. I don't talk to new people. I am withdrawn. I spend all of my time in my room when I am not at work or chatting with my two closest friends.

I cannot mentally or physically handle interacting with others. I bounce between having no emotions and being emotionally volatile. I've spent these past few weeks just floating through life and having breakdowns nearly every day.

I want affection so much but I can't stomach the idea of letting someone that close--physically or mentally. Like I have had only a few instances of sexual harassment throughout my life and they've all been at parties so they don't really affect me like my childhood trauma does; however, I still don't like other people touching me if I don't know them or want to accept their touch. It literally disgusts me.

Whyyyyy am I like this. Wanting love but refusing to let myself have it?? I mean there's also the matter of me not even operating on the same wavelength as everyone else so?? (thought I had autism but the counselor says I just likely have ADHD...might get a second opinion where they're not basing it on archaic understandings of the condition)"
I hate being like this.,2,mkrjo0,5,"I'm sitting here sobbing for no reason and hiding from my family. Whatever small scraps of my life that I'm not dissociating from are filled with pain--for no fucking reason. I'm so sick of it. My psychiatrist keeps telling me to go to therapy, but it doesn't work. At *best*, it doesn't work. At worst, it makes me feel physically sick. I'm so fucking tired of different therapists selling themselves to me at the initial meeting, telling me they can help me and there's so much hope when they can't and there isn't. Honestly, I don't know how therapy would actually help anyone. All they really tell you to do is get some friends and a hobby and then maybe go outside. Like, that's what you get for $120. Just some lady telling you that you should really get a life, and then you have to go back and do it again the next week. Or they'll suggest EMDR, which also doesn't fucking work. It's not even about wasting money; it's more just them giving me hope that I'm not going to feel like absolute shit anymore, and then I slowly have to realize that it isn't working. It kind of makes me hate them, I guess.

Ugh... this is awful..."
How do I stop feeling like a bad person after a minor mishap?,1,mkrfa4,1,"This was posted in like two others places but its kinda still really bothering me and maybe getting worse? Altho this post in particular contains extra info I feel is relevant but am too scared to post in other places because hnnn yea even tho thats stupid because people can check my profile on this shit? I just feel... really dumb and close to crying rn.  I've been having a really  fucking hard time with making progress lately and have been dissociated a lot but still trying to work thru my shit  regardless to see if that helps? Anyways last night I posted an intro in a place I thought my be good for me. I forgot some of the rules because I've been so out of it it's not even funny anymore not only that I feel like I have to justify my entire life all the fucking time which really messes with my ability to just simply stfu and follow rules. The mods contacted me and said ""yo gotta go change your intro my guy, heres some rules to remember, edit this and then get back to us so we can take it off pause :)"". I put down that theres stuff on my link that people might take the wrong way, well because I age regress really badly sometimes and fucking kinksters make the shit i use to help cope into something worse then it is and that makes me upset, anyways that means its gotta be nsfw and against the rules right? so took that out and i just feel like a really bad person who doesnt listen and like i should just stop attempting an just leave that place alone because maybe im not a good place actually? i feel like panicky and sick to my stomach like i really badly fucked up even tho its prolly fine and im NOT having a good time and how the fuck to i combat the feeling of just... all this shit. sorry if that doesnt make sense im just... hhhhh"
Transference at work with my boss,2,mkrd7a,3,"I think I might be in a bit of an emotional flashback right now, so I'm not at my most clearheaded and may edit later for greater clarity. My dad was abusive and we're estranged. I'm currently working at a small independent pharmacy as a technician and have been for several months. I'm having trouble with what I'm pretty sure is transference re: my dad and my boss. My boss is very nice, almost a pushover, but that doesn't help because for the first time in years I'm working in close quarters with a male authority figure (I have literally always had trouble with those). I'm trying to put what's happening into words and the best that I can do is that I view/interpret everything he says and does through the lens of what I would think if my dad said or did it, and I'm hyperaware of his moods and always second-guessing what he thinks of me. It doesn't help that, being so nice, he doesn't say what he thinks the way I've gotten used to in more assertive cultures.

Also, I've been taking too make sick days, like one every 2-3 weeks. It's because of my depression and CPTSD tbh, which really frustrates me because I feel like I should be able to just function like a normal person, but apparently I can't. I called out sick today and for hours I've been analyzing my boss's (admittedly somewhat weird) reaction, and I'm afraid of getting fired. I'm afraid that he's been picking up on hostility from me and thinks it's weird.

I've known this transference thing was going to be a problem for weeks now. I tried to ignore it, I didn't want to acknowledge it because I didn't want it to be true and I genuinely did not have time. But predictably it's built up to calling out sick and EFs. I really wish I could talk to my old therapist, but it's been a couple of years and my insurance doesn't cover her anymore."
Does anyone have parents that had drastically different terrible parenting styles?,12,mkr4m2,2,My mom and dad were never really together. I was a type of one night stand kid I think. But I would be shifted back and forth from spending time with my dad while living with my mom. Mom was neglectful and could be a bit of a loose canon when she was (frequently) drunk. She would try to connect with me emotionally though to the best of her ability when she was sober. My dad on the other hand didn't seem to be able to connect with me emotionally and was an incredible helicopter type. So I almost felt like I was being torn apart by their radically different approaches.
Want to leave my ex but don’t want to upset him,3,mkqzg3,5,"Hi. So I have been seeing my ex again. He has hurt me in the past before emotionally. But I have tried to forgive him, seems like everytime I see him I get a heavy depressed feeling in my chest of heartbreak. So I feel it would be best if we went our separate ways. I feel uncomfortable about how to part ways with him.... any help? Not sure if I am avoiding confrontation. But I find sometimes when I push someone away I end up wanting to come back to them. So I don’t want to loose him and regret it. But I also don’t want to keep feeling like he is going to hurt me and crap everytime I see him or spend time around him."
DAE go long periods of time unable to talk to anyone except their family where the abuse originated?,2,mkr34n,1,"I often struggle with not being able to keep in contact with friends except for my boyfriend, mother who was neglectful and continues to use me as an emotional dumping ground, sister and brother. I continue to stay in contact because I have guilt/pity for their struggles and still feel like I can help them somehow.  My sister is also going through a traumatic time and it's affecting everybody.

But I feel like I have no life of my own. I recently suspect that I have Asperger's and feel like I have no support except for my boyfriend, and I feel so alone in this. Am I a bad person for distancing myself from my family's sruggles? How could I call myself a good sister or daughter in that case? Is getting the support I never had from a family just a dream?   I would really appreciate anybody else's experience. Thanks."
DAE get triggered by being physically ill?,10,mkqs66,4,I have a cold and my hyper vigilance has ramped up to 100! My scared inner child thinks I am dying...
I fear I will return to using drugs,1,mkqhbr,6,"I am a chronic avoider of feelings and internal experience. Recently I’ve been forced to confront my feelings and inner world in a way that has me feeling extremely overwhelmed and out of control most of the time. I desperately want to go back to avoiding all this. Sometimes I do, by going to sleep. I’ve been taking a lot of naps when I get so overwhelmed that I cant handle being conscious any longer. I cannot stop self harming in the moment as a means of emotionally regulating even when I’ve sworn it off multiple times, signed safety agreements, promised myself I won’t, etc. 

And now I can’t stop thinking about going back to using drugs and alcohol as a way of coping. I have been sober for 3 months, but I spent 2 of those months inpatient. I know it is bad for me to use drugs/alcohol to avoid and won’t help long term, but I keep wanting to do it anyways and think about the relief it would give me. I am really scared I will give in to the desire even once and quickly return to active addiction. I don’t know how to cope with this and stop myself from doing it other than just “white knuckling” through this every hour of every day. I desperately need treatment for my psychological issues but I’m not getting it quickly or consistently enough in an outpatient setting. 

Can anyone relate? Has anyone been through this? Is there any other way to cope other than just white knuckling? Do I need to return to inpatient if I can’t stop myself from self harming and using drugs?"
Did anyone have a parent who didn’t know how to be an adult capable of having children?,30,mkqgj3,6,"My mum told me that because my dad lived at home for so long he never felt like a grown man. He said he didn’t know what it meant to be a father and husband and as a result my mum was the adult for all of us. 

I grew up wondering why my mum was so careful, sensible, mature and my dad was so clueless, helpless and lost. It was like mum was both the parents. 

As a result I became the helper daughter, the one who tried to fix them. I picked up on all the tension and tried to make them happier. I was always sensing the moods and adjusting accordingly. 

It was like my dad had kids but didn’t know why he has kids or why he was a parent. Just this prevailing sense of doubt and unease. 

The thing about having a parent who was so out of their depth is the lasting effect it has on me. I was mums little helper. I was mums psychologist. I was mums biggest support and filled in the gaps he didn’t. It meant that I didn’t feel close to my dad and only needed my mum. It meant that I was a mini adult when I was 16. 

I have so many memories of my mum being super stressed and upset and dad not knowing what to do, not being much help and mum needing to spell out what she needs because he would be clueless. I remember feeling like the mediator and have to jump into help dad when he was lost in order to calm the situation and make it more bare able for me. 

It’s this lifelong ball and chain of filling in the gaps to make their self esteem, relationship and parenting easier so that I could have some semblance of a happy home. Because if I didn’t step in, I’d be stuck in chaos. 

I wish I could wipe this part of my life and have parents who weren’t constantly struggling to be parents."
Starting a book club for How to do the work by Nicole LePera,0,mkpyv4,4,"\[ I am not sure if this is allowed mods, please let me know?\]

Hello everybody! My name is Nikki, I go by ""Ratagamic"" online. I recently purchased How to do the work by Nicole Lepera who also goes by ""The.holistic.psychologist"" on Instagram! Her posts encouraged me to enter my healing process and I am very excited to start reading her book. I would love however to be able to share my insights with other healers and hear their perspectives chapter by chapter!

If you are interested please send me a DM, with your name, if you have a copy of the book, and what days you might be available to hop on a discord call for two hours + maybe a spare 30mins  (with your respective time zone).

I am planning to keep this a small group with around 5-6 people at most!"
I feel like I may be experiencing an emotional flashback but I am unsure (TW: brief mention of passive suicial ideation),2,mkpl68,1,"I am struggling hardcore. A few weeks ago I had a dream where I was a kid living in my parents' house again, and since then, it has unclocked a whole entire wave of memories and emotions, and I have essentially been rendered useless. I can't go to work, I can't do my coursework, and I am failing at everything. I am having terrible sleep disturbances and am feeling both extremely anxious and so depressed at the same time. I am diagnosed with bipolar I in addition to C-PTSD but this is different than my typical bipolar symptoms (although those don't help). I just don't know what to do right now. I'm feeling as though I've backed mysef into the edge of a cliff and that I'm so far gone that the only logical solution would be to jump because it feels like there's no solution to the current situation. I think everyone is tired from my bullshit, i.e., late assignments and calling out of work. I feel as though the forgiveness has run out and I've disappointed everyone for the last time. Not even sure what kind of advice I'm looking for, maybe just for support and a possible step in the right direction?"
I don't want to be defensive anymore,5,mkpgh8,2,"TL;DR: Can't have a couple's discussion without feeling attacked, want to take responsibility for my actions and make amends genuinely.

I feel like I jsut need to hear some succes stories on this topic, listen to experiences of people who improved and get this out of my chest somehow. I'm 27 years old, I have always been alone and a loner. I used to live with my mom until I was 18 years old, then I moved out, lived alone for some more years, got back to live with her for 3 more years and then finally left for good at 24.

I have been analyzing my relationship with her and how things have turned out in my life. How I'd always feel inadequate and like I didn't belong anywhere. How she'd beat me up for getting bad grades and misbehave a little. How she'd never keep a secret I told her and how I couldn't trust her because of that. How she had her own plans for me and I never felt like I could be me. I still have a lot of trouble socializing and trsuting people and I guess it all goes back to that. Also, she'd always be paranoid about the most menial things, like she'd always tell me to beware the girls in the stationery shop we had because I was ""the boss's son"" so they would try to get pregnant just to get cash. And many other things. In a way, I think up until the time I left her house for good in 2018, I still felt like just and extension of her life and beliefs. I don't ever remember her saying sorry for anything, and honestly, mye motions towards her vaccilate between apathy and anger.

All this had been buried for a long time since I didn't interact with people. I seriously used to hate myself a lot. Nowadays what I feel is more inched towards disgust. I feel helpless and inexperienced, and I feel like most people around me are better than me at the things I'm not. All my life I've wanted to get a girlfriend, a life partner, and I finally did so last year. Yet, when it comes to conflict solving with her, I am as stupid as a door. I can never view her perspective, and even when I do, it feels like I just feel this urgent need to prove to her that I didn't mean to do the things I did. And it's true, I hurt her by mistake, but that doesn't mean that I should ignore her feelings and try to prove it instead. From what I've read, good conflict solving is actually the opposite. I just don't want to feel so vulnerable and afraid whenever she just needs my validation. It makes her feel alone in the relationship, and it makes me feel the stupidest person on earth.

I also have problems telling her my emotions. Sometimes I jsut get stuck feeling numb and when she asks me what I'm feeling, I can't answer her. I also cry like a baby when we fight, I guess I'm terrfied of her leaving and being alone all over again. I've been so alone for so long that I don't want to feel it ever again. I also legitimately love this girl. We are awesome together, we have great fun, I make her laugh, I help her evolve, she incentivizes me to be bettar, and we have amazing and fulfiling sex, despite both of us not being so experienced with that. I don't want this to end just because of my problems.

What I've done so far is I've been reading Pete Walker's book, I've been going to therapy, and I'm also reading Paul Ekman and the Dalai Lama's ""Emotional Awareness"". I don't want to feel like this anymore, I just want to be better. Any help is appreciated.  


Edit: I think I just did it again. For me it's unfair for the other party not to believe that I made a mistake and not that I was intentionally hurting them. Is this really how it should be?"
I suspect that one of my parents is a psycho/sociopath,8,mkpf0h,4,"I have been considering this possibility for a few years already, in the back of my mind. I just decided to read up on sociopath behavior in depth, especially how sociopaths act as parents. While psycho and sociopath may seem like strong words, it's almost scary how accurately the descriptions and examples fit one of my parents from personal experiences. At the same time, I'm not a psychologist, so I can't be sure.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar, what were your experiences? Any thoughts on how to deal with this?"
I haven’t posted in a while. Help. I don’t even know what I’m asking for.,16,mkpdnk,7,"I don’t know.

Birthday was Saturday. Childhood dog put down on Sunday.

"Just got off a call with my doctor prodding me about my trauma, and I am flooded with all of the bad feelings again",3,mkp7b0,2,"I have seen a neurologist for chronic pain following neurosurgery over the last few years, and have tried more medications and treatments to ease the pain than I can name off the top of my head. In the past this neurologist asked if I experience any psychological stress (because stress can contribute to chronic pain), and I mentioned that I experienced trauma (and said nothing more than that). 

I thought that would be the last time he would bring the topic up, but boy was I wrong. Today he asked me the same question again, then asked me about the type of abuse, when it happened, my abuser, and my symptoms. I had to cut the conversation short when he asked about my abuser, and made it through the rest of the call trying my hardest not to break down. 

It has been almost an hour since the appointment and I have been a complete sobbing mess. It is confusing how I can talk about the things that happened to me with my therapist and make it through our sessions without crying, but then I am asked by someone else about the trauma and the skills I learn from therapy fly out the fucking window. I have been in therapy for years. C'est la vie"
My life before the age of 12 is a complete black hole. I don’t remember a single thing. And the memories I have after that age are scant. I feel like I’m missing a large part of who I am.,151,mkoxpo,17,"In my 30s, was hanging out with friends the other night who were recalling memories of when their parents came home with their younger siblings, or trips they took, etc — memories of them as early as 6 years old or so. But I don’t have those memories. I have almost no memories. From the age of 0 to 12 it feels as if I was in a coma. Pictures I see of myself at that age feel completely foreign, like someone photoshopped me into them. After 12, I have some memories, but they’re few and far between and almost invariably negative ones that involve abuse and trauma.

It makes me feel empty."
Is anyone else very very very into psychological horror?,57,mkon5g,44,"I found that normal ghost or the usual gory horror movies never interested me, stuff like IT or chucky or stuff like that. I get extremely engrossed in any game, music, or other types of media that is designed to fuck with my head, give me a prolonged sense of dread or hide behind facades.

Like, the more it fucks me up mentally and emotionally and the longer it makes me lie in bed thinking about it the better. I also love sharing them with my friends and absolutely love seeing their reactions to how messed up they are. Is this in any way connected to my abuse trauma, maybe trying to seek out something again somehow? or is this completely unrelated"

On to the story

Today my younger sibling came over after work. I was out walking my dog (I would Pay the dog tax but I'm paranoid someone might recognise him) at the time. I thought I would have enough time to do the length of the walk and be back inside safely before my 'father' (I put it like that as I starting to believe he doesn't deserve that title) arrived.

This was not just for my sake but the dogs, he basically said he wanted nothing to do with this dog when the dog turned 9. I didn't want to face this man or let my dog see him and get confused.

I was nearly back maybe 100m from my door as the crow flies (I was delayed by an aggressive dog who I had to back up to avoid) when he is driving towards me. He pulls over and tries to talk to me, I ignore him and keep walking not acknowledging him, as he keeps calling my name.

My heart was racing so much I felt like it would beat out of my chest. I was scared he would turn the car around and come after me. He has a temper and gets physical, I thought he would come after me and catch hold of me again.

Now I'm worried I am being too harsh, I haven't spoken to this man since august of last year. Also it's my mothers birthday and I'm scared I may have caused something that will ruin her day if he tries to turn my siblings into fling monkeys.

I need help to know if I did the right thing, or if I should have 'manned up' for lack of a better phrase and been polite or something"
I still don’t know if it’s me or them,3,mko6wf,5,"I live far away from my family. I moved away after school because of how toxic my childhood was. My mom always emotional took it out on me and played favorites with some of my siblings.

I know they were all together yesterday celebrating.

She called me, I didn’t answer because I was alone and sad. She left a message. “Happy Easter! Miss you so much. Wish you were with us here!”

And I still don’t know.

Is she calling me to rub it in my face that they are all having fun together?

If they can all get along, is it me? Am I that bad one?

It makes me hate myself."
I'm Done!!!,48,mko5cq,5,"So, for the last about 2 years, I've been in trauma-specific therapy trying to finally work through all of my story and start to understand some things. Finding this community has been a great help as the last few months of the process have come to a close. As of today, I am discharged! I'm happy I'm done with it, but we also took my story and shredded it, deleted the computer copy, etc. and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I'm kind of done with my story but I also went through all the sweat and tears to get that all down with my therapist and now all of its nearly 10 pages is just gone...

Anyway, I'm happy... I'm pretty sure these are happy tears."
my dad died,33,mknybz,6,"he died a couple of weeks ago in his house in the middle of the desert. we had to call the sheriff to do a wellness check. it was too late. im not sure how long his body was there in the house, dead, before they found him.

he was a very complicated person. i loved him very, very much. he had been homeless for a long long time. when my grandma died, she left him enough money to buy that house. it was the only home he ever rly had. he definitely had cptsd, was also diagnosed with a lot of other stuff. he wasnt very responsible or masculine. but he was a wonderful, sweet, sensitive, loving person. i loved him so much. my mom and stepdad are both shit, abusive af. he was my only semi good parent.

i have to go to his house which is several states away this week, to clean it out. im not sure exactly how he died. his health had been bad for a couple months before he passed and he couldnt rly walk. but he didnt trust doctors or hospitals and my sister and i couldnt get him to go to one.

im so scared to clean out the house. im no contact with my mom and stepdad, but they are my sisters main form of emotional support. they have said literally nothing to me. they're dead to me at this point. the coldness/cruelty is rly unparalled at this point. i just want an adult or someone to lean on but no one is ever there.

ive gone thru a lot of death/loss in the last couple years and what i hate the most is i never get to say goodbye. my dad and i only talked on the phone since i was 18 (im now 27) and i didnt talk to him for a month before he died. i never, ever get to say goodbye. people just disappear.

i dont want to clean out his house. i dont want to smell the death smell i know will be in there. i dont want him to be gone. i dont want any of this but there isnt any other way. im so scared. i feel so alone 😭"
Being a disabled person and society,11,mknfxm,1,"The government implemented this ""clinical frailty scale"" for their triage guidelines that will decide for doctors who gets to stay on their vent in the ICU and who doesn't, if our hospitals get to that point, which seems inevitable at this time. Disability groups have been repeatedly trying to get this news made public and are being ignored at best, or told that it's ""tough luck"" at every turn, or that it is justified.  I've written into multiple news outlets, to crickets. They have no issue covering all the other discrimination in the world today, but they simply do not give a rats ass about this type.  

Trying desperately to get the general public to know what is going on, I have been having debates on Reddit with people who think discriminating against disabled people in the triage protocol is justified. I will carefully explain to them why the triage guidelines implemented are discriminatory and they will simply say, condescendingly, that ""oh well, tough choices have to be made"" as if we are not aware tough choices have to be made. Or even better ""tough shit"". 

The government knows this scale is discriminatory yet they ignore it, and are allowed to keep ignoring it, for over a year now. This panel of bioethisists sit there and justify it. You want to know what the issues are? They're using criteria such as: can the patient normally walk, can the patient normally sit up on their own, can the patient complete errands and household chores normally, etc as some of the criteria for deciding who gets life saving treatment or not. What do any of those things have to do with surviving covid? Absolutely nothing. Pure ableism. 

And it's been ruled discriminatory but it's still in there, the whole issue is just being swept under the rug by everyone in a position of any power, condoned by society. Doctors and ethicists, who are supposed to be saving your life and being fair, working against you justifying your death for arbitrary reasons.

And then I see normally ""woke"" people online sitting there arguing with me that it's ok these are included. I've had people ask ""can't we just ignore the Charter of Rights and freedoms in this situation?"" in order to stop a disabled guy from suing the government so he can access the vaccination, as he is house-bound and cannot get to a centre. Imagine that, being denied access to the vaccine, knowing that if you end up in hospital you will be more likely to be refused the care able-bodied people will get - you will be deemed not worth saving - and knowing that society at large is literally asking for your human rights to be stripped away in order for you to not get the vaccine which might prevent that situation from happening. Lol! Such a wonderful feeling.

Disabled people are seen as garbage to be blunt, and society and all the institutions will explicitly organize around this, feel justified in doing so. And nobody will help us in this fight, instead they sit there arguing that this discrimination is justified. Or they just ignore it. So easy to quietly to ignore. Or they'll virtue signal about using PC language when it comes to disability. You think we give a single fuck what language you use? My god. My post on this triage issue in my province's subreddit attracted nothing but downvotes and bile. Just trying to get the word out and find some help and people are arguing that your death is justified and simply a tough a choice that has to be made. 

 I am haunted by the job struggles I had two years ago at my job where I was being underpaid by about 30% because of audism. I was constantly excluded from the group which was a small office and then I was told I didn't have the personality they were looking for, that I needed to contribute more to studio life. How could I do that when I couldn't hear the chitchat going on?  I was very competent at my work and was able to answer colleague questions when asked. That didn't count because I couldn't socialize in the same way?  I'm extremely lucky to even have a job, deaf people are already chronically unemployed as people see them as incapable of doing work. So they're trapped in poverty. I thought going into a visual field would be a safe bet but it seems I just cannot escape this shit. And trying to explain it is futile, nobody believed me or got what I was saying. And people will argue with you that you don't deserve accommodation, they will side with Uber over not giving rides to a blind woman, my good friend thought it was ok that Starbucks was denying service to deaf people a few years back. People feel 100% justified being bigoted against disabled people. I suppose it's instinct. Can't blame them I guess.

I am quite stressed about work now after that last experience. I don't know how to act at work anymore because, even though it's a new job, and seems to be much better, I know not being able to hear the same as everyone makes me look stupid and incompetent and I don't know how asking for accommodation will be received, will I just be laid off because I'm seen as a pain in the ass? People doubt your fitness for the job. They exclude you. I wish there was a robot to talk to and decide this stuff, it would not be biased it would just set me up with what I need.  I'm lucky as hell I can hear as well as I can, a lot of Deaf people can't hide it. I'm extremely lucky to have a job. I'm lucky that I personally would not be a target in triage (although I do wonder what would happen if my hearing aid batteries die and I can no longer hear any of the doctors or nurses). 

But it's so incredibly lonely being in this position.  I guess the only time there's outrage is when cops put 5 bullets in a Deaf man who could not hear their commands. Try to do anything to prevent other disabled deaths instead of outrage after the fact? Fuck you I guess.

Rant over."
Book,3,mkm9t0,2,"Has anyone read the body keeps the score ? It’s a great book , it’s just A lot of sad stories to take in , it’s taken me forever to read it . I know he recommends body work like yoga and emdr has anyone tried them and noticed a difference ?"
"Apparently, All of My Problems Are Trauma Related? TW - sui, hallucinations",2,mkn98y,1,"I have auditory and visual hallucinations constantly, I cannot speak because my brain is confused and racing, I cannot live like this anymore. 

I thought I had a psychotic disorder but my therapist and psychiatrist say it's all trauma-related but I don't know. I have a ""normal"" amount of trauma response otherwise. It's just confusing to have so many symptoms and for none of them to be fully addressed. No one addresses my hallucinations or thought confusion head-on."
DAE with CPTSD get tired really easily?,124,mkn8wy,17,"Both my brother and I have noticed that we get tired really easily, more than the people around us. I have a formal diagnosis of CPTSD, and he grew up in the same household that I did.

I was wondering if anyone else had noticed them? I'm wondering if it might be a CPTSD thing. It's really annoying to get so tired all the time!"
I'm looking to educate myself on trauma and the effects of childhood upbringing on adult behavior. What sources do you recommend?,6,mkmn3v,5,"It need not be CPTSD specifically. I asked here because of the population of the sub and the subject matter.

haha I had a trauma dream and woke up early in the morning in a panic and couldn’t fall back asleep,3,mkmjhr,2,
I had an MRI today and stayed still for over half an hour!!!!,28,mkmgp2,10,"Just wanna start by saying that I don't have medical trauma, but my trauma basically led me to neglect my health badly. This past year I have really tried hard to address my medical problems and look after my body. Today I had to go for an MRI and I was so damn terrified. Being there, trapped and still for half an hour was an unimaginable torture. All I wanted to do was jump up and press the panic button over and over again, but I did my breathing excersizes and got myself through the whole half an hour without freaking out too hard.


I'm so damn proud of myself, its crazy"
Feeling kinda devastated and I don’t understand it,3,mkm7eg,2,"My therapist of a year and a half recently told me she has to change services and she’ll no longer be able to treat me once the month is over. I feel so confused internally, ever since she told me I’ve noticed I’ve been switching between sobbing, anger, anxiety and numbness. I’m not even that much of a crier but idk I just feel really hurt, I’m not sure if I should express myself to her about her leaving idk I want things to be easier for her. Why is this affecting me so much?"
It's OK to be scared - Monday morning motivation,19,mkm2tp,3,"Today is an opportunity for you to live on your terms. You are the person in control of your life. No one but you is going to be the HERO of your story. It's OK to be scared. IT'S NOT OK TO QUIT ON YOURSELF. 

Think about all the times in your life that you have been terrified of something you knew would make your life better. Why is that? Why do we get so scared of the idea that we can live on our terms, be the hero, and do things we want to do because WE WANT TO DO THEM? For many of us, it's the software embedded in us in youth. We are told to be seen, not heard, to think small because our dreams will never happen, and not even bother because we probably won't succeed anyway. 

The part that I get stuck on is that these limiting beliefs that we carry from our childhood often have nothing to do with trauma or traumatic experiences. Many of these beliefs and mindsets come from our society in general. When we were born, we were told only to accept the bare minimum of what our potential power is. I don't know about you, but I am so tired of the bare minimum, and I don't believe that people like us exist for the ""good enough"" mentality. To be honest, if good enough was good enough, I don't think you would be reading this right now.

Deep inside of each of us is an incredible power to step into something great, but we often quit before starting the line. We often find ourselves asking permission from our friends and family but sadly they have the same societal thought process. And then we find ourselves seeking permission to exist. 

Let me tell you something- YOU DON'T NEED ANYONE'S PERMISSION TO BE GREAT except your own. 

**Ask yourself an essential question today:** What do I have to do to have the life I want to have?

You DO NOT HAVE TO QUALIFY your life to anyone. THIS IS YOUR LIFE! 

If you are ready to take control and be the hero of your story, then let's get these stupid limiting beliefs out of our way!

"Crying during yoga, meditation, and tai chi",36,mkl82y,10,"I've noticed that I cry a lot during any kind of breath work, which in my own hobbies and activities includes yoga, meditation, and tai chi. I'm not thinking about anything in particular. It just happens.

I've mentioned my crying to friends who also meditate and do yoga, but they haven't felt this same  urge. The reason I am thinking about this is due to the fact that I'm reading The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk, and am learning about how trauma is stored in the body. 

Could the crying during breathwork be a way to release/relieve trauma? Do others here cry during breathwork? Apologies if this is a silly question - I'm still quite new to the topic."
Did anyone else feel happier before they started to address their trauma?,241,mkl1k0,56,"Howdy, friends. 

Did anyone else feel “happier” before they started addressing their trauma? 

I’ve been at this for just about a year now and I am *exhausted.* 

I’m tired, my moods aren’t stable like they used to be, I’ll have weeks where I feel incredible and then it gets ripped away by a flashback, I cry, I dissociate, my inner Critic gets out of hand, I have little energy to exercise which is usually something I love, I have bouts with anxiety and depression, and I question if this is worth it because since digging into this I definitely feel worse. 

For those of you who have made it to the other side, what tipped the scale?  Any words of encouragement?  

I’m not giving up.  I’ve made it too far to repress all of this again.  But, my god, I’m ready for some peace and quiet."
medication decision,2,mkkv4a,2,"Between CPTSD and Overtraining syndrome I’m 3 years of not healing. Considering SSRI.

1. Insomnia - fall asleep can’t stay asleep but feel sick or nauseous/dizzy not well rested 
2. Tinnitus 
3. Fatigue - incapable of working out without sympathetic system going on fire
4. Despair/Hopeless/Anxiety
5. GI - constipation or urge to go to the bathroom when driving or leaving home and causing anxiety

1. Loss of erections
2. Worsened insomnia

The punishment for misery is further misery,28,mkktt3,9,"I'm starting to really despair. I see that I put a lot, literally exhausting effort everyday to not just put my car in the wall and end it all. I want to be loved. I want to feel I have a purpose. I want to find a place I belong. But I just don't find love, I feel meaningless and purposeless almost all the time, and I don't belong at all where I live.  
I'm exhausted of life. Seems my crime, ie not being loved when I grew up by anyone in my close family, is punished by a life sentence of alienation. Maybe love is like money. To be rich, you need to be born rich. To be loved, you need to be born loved? 

Maybe my fate was already sealed the very day I came to existence."
Therapists will really take hundreds of £ from you then suddenly decide they're done with you,42,mkkm3x,28,"I have so many people in my life I'd like to recommend therapy to but idk how to do that with a clear conscience when they're running the risk of paying half a grand just to have their therapist quit the zoom call and stop speaking to you the second you express any anger.

Happened to me today. Was talking about a mental block I get when I'm trying to work (therapist looked bored the entire time), I got angry at myself and hit my desk and my therapist yelled at me, quit the meeting, and has basically just fucked off. Over £500 that I can't afford down the fucking drain because these people will take your money to tell you ""You're loved and wanted and people won't abandon you"", just to fucking leave the second they feel like it. (Literally the last session we did was about my abandonment issues.) I know there are good therapists out there, but it's the blood-sucking ghouls like these that turn recovery from incredibly difficult to monumentally fucking challenging. For FUCK'S sake."
DAE feel significantly YOUNGER than their age?,49,mkk8om,21,"I’ve seen a lot of people with CPTSD/trauma talk openly about feeling older than their age, but what about the other way? Is that okay too? I feel like an absolute weirdo sometimes. Most days, I feel stuck in my preteen years. When neighbors look in my window, I’m afraid they’ll see my toys and judge me for acting like a child when I’m a whole ass adult. I used to think I was an age-regressor, but the feeling never went away. I never intentionally made myself feel younger, I just always do. 

I clam up when I’m upset, and eventually burst if I’m prodded too much. I distract myself from big feelings by playing video games made for middle-schoolers and watching carefree YouTube. When I’m happy, I skip around and sing and have bounds of energy. And when I’m insecure, I try to stay as close as I can to the people I trust. 

It’s hard to explain, but I generally just feel an air of “younger than 23” constantly. I can’t think of any time I’ve felt like an adult, even while signing legal forms, getting married (and divorced), moving houses, working. Nothing makes me feel my age. And it feels like nobody can relate. I hope I’m not alone."
DAE get triggered by younger people who are comfortable opening up about their sexuality and promiscuity?,20,mkk7nu,8,"**Trigger Warning**: sexuality, promiscuity

fuck fuck fuck fuck. trigger alarm trigger alarm trigger alarm. Weeks have passed and I'm still triggered when I remember it.

What's with that enormous display of confidence in themselves? I'm envious of them. My sexuality and feelings are so repressed. Lately I'm opening up more and becoming more vulnerable, but I still live deep inside my shell. This kind of triggering events remind me that even though I've gained confidence lately, I still can gain **a lot more**.

It's also triggering when I see people mindlessly making out or intimating freely with whoever wherever. When I imagine myself freely pursuing my sexual desires I get scared.

I guess I've been shamed a lot for my body and my way of being, *sigh*."
Help Please,3,mkk53n,1,"TW: Suicide/Family Trauma



I have trauma associated with a person in my life taking his own life by suicide. I’m worried that my aunt who is not doing well financially plans to take herself into the Smokey Mountains and do something similar. There is really nothing I can do to stop it.

I personally believe it is someone’s choice to do that and I can do what I can to let them know I want them to stay around but at this point it might be too little too late. 

I don’t have a strong relationship with her but I care about her deeply and my heart is still very tender from the last loss I experienced. It is going to difficult to function over the next few days/weeks. Any suggestions on self-care or getting through work and getting other adulting done.

"When I disassociate, it feels like I'm failing a ""trust fall"" with reality.",17,mkk51y,4,"Instead of being caressed by a sturdy woven net, I fall through like a wall of tissue paper.

 I see myself talking/acting with a lag of conscious thought to action. Feels like stuttering but with reality. Like I know what my intentions were but there is a lag with the feedback that my intended actions were actually carried out. And then to top it off, while disassociating I feel a clear disconnect where my next words/actions don't feel like my conscious choices. Like my ""auto-pilot"" takes over. That scares me so I jolt myself to get back in control. I guess my main worry right now is that when this happens I do feel like another part of me is taking over. I don't want to cry wolf and say I have some kind of DID, but I feel like I have definitely coped by organizing myself into separate timelines in order not to feel the full weight of my entire life. And I think that right now I'm worried that my ""true self"" is going to lose more control if I don't have better ways to ground myself when disassociation occurs. 

I'll go over this in therapy but until then, any advice on smoother grounding techniques? I am usually pretty mindful of recognizing my triggers and priming myself to calm down. But when I actually disassociate, it's such a hard transition and I just freak out and try to brute force my way back to control."
Embarrassed about abuse,2,mkdats,1,I got sexually abused by my sister when i was very young Ive never told anyone and dont ever want to i keep imagining that if i did my brother would make fun of me and laugh and ask me to tell him what she did.

"Small realization, practicing healthier coping mechanisms",3,mkdsxg,1,"Tw: mentions of arguments related to family/spouse, self destructive habits 

The other day I was spending time with my spouse when our conversation turned a bit sour but in retrospect, I didn’t help the cause. It started with my spouse stating I was interrupting him because I got overexcited and wanted to talk. Except I took it much more personally than Id like to admit. 

Im happy I now know what it is that Im experiencing, that him critiquing me talking made me feel like my family was yelling at me that I talk too much, that I ask silly questions or the feeling of them talking over me. I realize I was talking over my partner - but I was doing it aggressively because I often feel like I need to talk over someone just for me to be acknowledged.

After he confronted me, I immediately shut down. I felt like the world was against me, that I was alone and no one understood. Im thankful my partner noticed and talked to me, that he wasn’t mad at me and he knows what Ive been through. He reassured me that Im okay, and that its just something we have to work on together. 

It took me so long to finally be able to see it, that my destructive outbursts had a source. But most importantly, I am so unbelievably thankful to have someone in my life that actually understood and didn’t make me feel worse."

My EXTREME College Bully getting Masters in Counseling...WTH?!?!?,10,mkgkr4,2,"College was rough for me, really rough. I went to a very small liberal arts college and I came from a very wacko conservative family and I felt a lot of pressure to be the daughter my parents wanted me to be. I went to college in Seattle and my parents controlled me financially and emotionally, I didn’t even smoke pot in college until my junior year. My alma-mater is known for turning out Harvard MD-PhD grads, so imagine being untreated ADHD, depressive, cutting, bulimia, boyfriend dumped and spread rumors about you at a college of &lt;3,000 student young gal in the 2010 when body imagine was still size 00 and $$$.

I didn’t drink or smoke my first 2 years, and to cope with my skin crawling, wanting-to-die-every-night anxiety I binged like no tomorrow and cut almost daily.  With access to a “buffet” daily, I would binge macaroni and carbs and whatever else, and then head to the “accessible” single-restroom in my dorm or pop the wide shower drain and purge silently. 

My sophomore year my parents bought an investment house and forced me to landlord my peers at 18 years old. It was obviously disaster, and to cope I purged more. My parents screamed at me from states away when they thought anything was wrong (Aka booze or pot or anything fucking normal or fun in a regular college formative years) and I was to be the fucking landlord, repair lady, and RA (as my housemates treated me) at 18. Bc the house was “mine”, no one cleaned but me, I did all the yard work, and maintained a 2,000sqft house myself while trying into to GO TO COLLEGE?!? I lived with a few girls I didn’t click with because they would band together against me about dumb things that 19 year olds do, but I was drowning as it was, almost peeing in waterbottles in my room I couldn’t leave except for class. I failed O-Chem, had several nervous breakdowns, and don’t remember of lot of that year. 

Nearing finals of sophomore year, one of my roommates had her mom send a letter to MY FUCKING SCHOOL saying I was doing hard drugs because I was in the bathroom forever and they could hear me puking and my arms were covered. She fucking knew I was cutting and bulimic and tried to HAVE ME KICKED OUT OF MY COLLEGE?!?!  

I just stalked her for the first time in years and saw she is getting a masters in counseling. The same girl that went into the basement and stood on a table and SCREAMED BODY SHAMING THINGS AT ME THROUGH MY FLOOR VENTS. I can’t. Cheers! Thanks for the rant. 

I am so glad this generation can talk about these things. I’m 31 and I was shamed for being bulimic and cutting. Wow. And I still don’t even realize how bad that hurt me over the actual acts themselves."
Help with Freeze Response,5,mkk08i,12,"Hi,

I've been in a flashback for around 5 weeks. The intensity varies, it's been bad the last four days. This morning I woke up and was unable to move my legs. The last time I remember it being like that was when I was 7 when some abuse was happening

I managed to crawl out of bed, get up against the wall and then slowly started doing so pulsing, shaking and some very basic qi gong. That has helped a bit but I still can hardly feel my legs

I have no one around to support which is making the flashback worse, as this triggers feelings of abandonment and neglect but that's just how it is for now

Does anyone have any experience of working through freeze bordering tonic immobility on their own? If so, would you mind sharing what worked for you?"
"My boyfriend triggers me, how would you deal?",3,mkjw6h,2,"Okay, so before anyone says that I should remove myself from the trigger I'll explain a bit of background.

My bf doesn't consider himself to suffer from CPTSD, but he had a really rough time growing up and is the first person I felt saw me for what I was. He saw I was hurt rather than just a nightmare, you know? My bf has a problem with his collarbone which started when he was 11ish, he's had multiple operations and has caused him extreme pain since. His dad didn't get him help for it for a long time and kind of made him feel like a problem. Its much better now than it was and it comes from time to time rather than being constant. 

My issue is that his shoulder has been hurting for a couple of months now and the way it makes him behave is a massive trigger for me. For a while he said it was me causing him to be distant bit then about 2 weeks ago he said it was his shoulder. I've been trying to help where I can but his pain makes him short with me sometimes, and it's selfish but I just want him to give me a big hug sometimes and it's hard bc he's in pain. Sometimes I just need someone to laugh at the bad joke I made bc it look me 5 mins to be able to say anything. I need to be able to cry but he doesn't seem to accept it , he needs positivity bc of the pain but I also have stuff going on. 

We're arguing all the time and I know we're both hurt neglected kids who years later don't know how to cope with things. I also know this will pass as it has before. It's just so hard with lockdown and everything to protect my head when this happens. I feel constantly triggered and literally embarrassed of the amount of times I tell him I'm triggered but I just don't know what to do for the best.

I feel like I was just starting to get better and now I have nothing left at all. My home doesn't feel like somewhere I can relax and it's so tiring bc I lived like this and then without a home staying on sofas for a long time. On the other hand my bf is the only person who stayed around, he has never abandoned me even at my worst. 

Sorry if this is written badly, disassociation makes me selfish and stuff idk. If anyone could advise me I would really appreciate it. I don't have many people around me atm."

Either way, I'm a 27 year old man, I've dated a few women before and for as long as I can remember, I've been attracted to women. Or at least I thought I was. Recently I met a man who made me question everything about myself, starting with my sexuality and ending with my sanity. I thought I figured out what happened to me as a kid and that I never let it affect me, but I'm not entirely sure anymore. For the first time I feel like I'm truly and properly attracted to someone. This is nothing like my previous interests in women. That's why I'm wondering if this could be symptoms of my unfortunate childhood events."
I don’t know why I still think my parents are capable of helping me?,20,mkhr6r,6,"The child in me wants to have parents who can give me guidance. But my adult self sees all their shortcomings, their age, their overreactions and how they over complicate everything. But I still come back to wanting to have their reassurance and wise knowledge. 

I’ve become so used to doing everything myself that I don’t let them help me. They usually disappoint. I think they are hurt because I’m showing them I don’t need them when deep down I want to have their reassurance.  

I’ve become very good at making a point of being super independent."
What was this? Not a flashback as I wasn’t there.,3,mkha35,5,"For a couple weeks now I’ve been going through the works learning about cptsd and childhood trauma. Only in the past couple of weeks have I accepted that my 28 years on earth have been difficult because of my very early years and emotional neglect. My 30 year old brother too. Last night after having a couple of drinks, joints and an edible with my best friends, I was thrown into what felt like a visual flashback or something? I got this impending sense of doom and the strongest feeling in my stomach and it took my breath away. I could see my older brother as a very young baby crying out knowing no one was going to come for him. It absolutely destroyed me. Even now sober I’m crying as I type. I have never felt empathy that deeply before and it really scared me tbh. Has anyone else had anything similar? Is this part of healing?"
I just really need to be held right now.,7,mkh6tl,5,"I feel it in such an overwhelming way I couldn't focus on anything lately. I just want someone to hold me. Not just a casual hug - a really long, intense cuddle.

But there's no one, and nothing.

What the hell do I do?"
DAE have suicidal thoughts at one moment and forget about it completely a moment after?,46,mkgwil,7,"An hour ago I sat with my family, everyone was having fun and and my only thought was, that I want to die right now. Now I'm instructing my little sister playing piano, eating some sweets and nearly forgot about my dying wish. It's not that suddenly I found hope or a reason to live, but the feeling of wanting to be dead is gone and replaced with something else, but I can't figure out with what exactly.
I like my sister, I want her to be happy, so is it because there is no room to think about myself when  being there for somebody? Well, I would help the whole world then, if only I wouldn't have to feel like a worthless shit anymore. Is that the reason why people do that? But that wouldn't be a selfless act then. I don't want approval, i don't want glory, i don't want admiration. I just want to be authentic and free of fear of people and fear of judgement. I want to just not care what others think. I want to love. I want to help. I want to create. I want to die. Not again, ughh...How do I stop that?

Can anybody relate?"
I have been patiently awaiting my peace for 13 years.,9,mkgl5n,2,"I don't think it will ever come. I've dreamt of having a normal life since I was 9, and despite doing everything correct and in my power I'll never get the chance. I don't think you can come back from childhood neglect & abuse, getting raped, be in an abusive relationship for 2 years, have a traumatizing heart surgery & developing a lifelong disabling chronic illness. There's no fucking way, and there's no hope with no support system. People run from me because of how damaged I am. There is no future to look forward to, and it's never been worth it.
I long for peace and stability, but some people just don't get a good hand."
My best friend drunkenly told my sister possibly the most important secret of my life and I don't even have it in me to be angry.,66,mkgisl,35,"My best friend drunkenly told my sister I am pretty certain it is my dad who sexually abused me as a child. This is something I had been keeping very private because I don't want to accuse anyone until I have done therapy and have given it some serious time. The memories only started appearing in January and I've barely had time to figure out what's going on.

Now my sister is drinking, her bulimia is back full force and she doesn't want to speak to me.

I just feel so sad. This was such an important secret to me but I feel more stupid for trusting anyone with it. I should have kept it to myself. I don't even feel angry, just utterly defeated.

How do you know you were abused if you don't remember it?,11,mket6k,12,"If can't recall any specific events, or just a few minor ones, how can you know you were abused?"
You can’t properly heal your trauma while you’re still being actively traumatized.,1249,mkefrj,107,"I had this epiphany today while I was thinking about my trauma.

EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect to get so many responses! Thanks everyone for sharing your own thoughts and experiences. 

Here’s a little backstory of how I came to this conclusion. I’ve been in counseling for three years, I haven’t lived at home with my parents for several years, and I’m married to a loving, supportive husband. And yet, I’m still struggling with my trauma far more than I would like after three years of therapy. I’ve been feeling incredibly discouraged and like there is something wrong with me. And while I have been NC with my narcissistic mother for months, I have a close relationship with my dad and it’s very difficult to navigate since he’s still married to my abusive mother. 

I realized yesterday after talking to a friend that my on-and-off relationship with my mother over the past three years, combined with hearing about her abusive behavior towards my dad from him (I know I need to set firmer boundaries with him about this, I’m working on it) have really stunted my progress in therapy and healing. Even though I’m not physically in that environment anymore, continually hearing about the abuse is triggering and prevents me from feeling completely safe, even though I am living in a safe environment. I need to reevaluate my boundaries and do what I can to further distance myself from this situation so I can actually begin to move on from it. 

My heart goes out to all of you that are still struggling with trauma too. Sometimes it feels like an uphill battle, but no matter how bad things are, there’s always hope. I wish you all the very best!"
I lost 7 years of my life to abuse and trauma,19,mkedjl,11,I was totally incapable of moving forward in those years except to think about and process/reprocess/experience/re-experience abuse and trauma. Am I allowed to mentally subtract 7 off my age so I can feel less pathetic about my current place in life? I certainly feel like 7 years hasn't passed. It's like I was mentally trapped in a time capsule and I couldn't grow until I moved that pile of baggage off of me. I'm doing a lot better now but I also feel so stupid and behind compared to my peers. I'm experienced in things healthy people rarely need or deal with. I'm inexperienced in all the typical daily things normal people need to integrate in society. I feel so so pathetic and behind.

DAE have an eating disorder that has become a coping mechanism?,13,mkdapp,3,"It all started off with just feeling blah about my body. 
Bulimia followed me all these years. 

Ah, I see. Anorexia has entered the chat. 

Oh dear.

I only care how I look because it means my suffering has a benefit. If I restrict, I’m safe. I don’t lose control. I’m a size that means I can escape if I need to. People treat me better. 

If I gain it back, then I’m abusable again. 

I can’t look at a number on the scale because it will *throw* me through a loop. Even if it’s one that would make me.... “happy”?  I would feel like the scale is broken. Lying. If I’m that number, why is my life not nice? Why isn’t the world spinning the way I want it to? 

Where’s the control if I’m not working towards something? 

I know this doesn’t end well. I am trying hard to work against it but I haven’t found many resources for CPTSD and eating disorders. Mine are intensely linked and im scared that even though the disorder hasn’t outright ruined me yet, it will. I know it will. The highs always end, even with starvation and the fleeting control

And then I hate people looking at me lol

Can you guess why 

Fuck my life"
I know this is gonna disappear anyways so it doesn’t matter,17,mkcbsp,11,"All I can think about is either relapsing or planning a final exit.

Things have been too hard. Sobriety isn’t worth this. I want out of my brain/body.

When is shit going to get better. I work so hard for nothing."
Can I even say I have cptsd?,8,mkcbeh,7,"Diagnosed with OCD and anxiety. When I brought up to my psychiatrist that I think I may actually have ptsd she just said that you get ptsd from things that happened recently (which I think is simply incorrect?) and then suggested to work things out in therapy. (I already am on lexapro, so I suppose it’s not like she could do much). 

My therapist for some reason never uses the word “trauma”. I started going to her for OCD and later she suggested than my issues my actually be more from childhood and that’s what causing worsening anxiety and stuff and that we need to focus on that. (Which I agree). 

I had absolutely shitty childhood and experience all the symptoms from what I have read about cptsd. I even bought some book about recovering from cptsd and I feel extremely validated in my experience.

But then I start self doubting and thinking that I’m just making it all up and I have no trauma or anything. I feel so ducking shitty."
DAE avoid things you enjoyed as a kid?,4,mkcazl,6,I get nervous just thinking about watching a show I used to watch back then or a movie. Sometimes even music. It feels like anxiety and extreme embarrassment sometimes
DAE feel like they are ruined?,48,mkc5ss,7,"The emotional and verbal abuse inflicted upon me during childhood and beyond by my dad is something I've struggled for nearly 40 years to deal with.

I remember as a young child feeling inadequate around other kids, never skinny enough, smart enough, ambitious enough. I compared myself to others very early on and was very much hypervigilant of how others perceived me. 

I have major feelings of unworthiness hopelessness and quite honestly an existential depression that never seems to entirely leave me. I struggle to accomplish anything because I have this internal battle (me vs dad's voice) about the point of achieving said thing. I swear I even wonder why bother doing the dishes and pulling the weeds etc when we're all just going to die. 

It's sad because art used to be an escape for me and early on nobody gave a shit about it because it wasn't what they thought was a valuable hobby. Now, I don't enjoy art anymore. Drawing for the fun of it is an ability I have lost. Now when I try to draw I am plagued by my dad's internalised voice. I have this whole internal battle about the meaning and the point of any of it. It's such a massively shitty way to live.

I also feel like a burden to my boyfriend who is a sweetheart, and such a happy-go-lucky positive guy with lots of interesting hobbies and passions. I often tell him how jealous I am of his passions because I wish I felt that way about something.

I know my life is up to me now but I feel like I simply don't have the tools to live ""nornaly"". I spend much of my time faking like all is fine.

I also have an autoimmune disease and apparently autoimmune diseases are linked to adverse childhoods. It's so sad. Apparently those of us who experienced adverse childhoods had stress levels so high for so long and now as adults we tend to be high strung and stress so easily over simple things so at some point your immune system is triggered all the time and goes into overdrive.

I used to love working out and weight training and lost over 100lbs but after I stopped taking my largely ineffectual thyroid meds I have gained it all back and then some, which is massively exacerbating the plantar fasciitis I've had for 8 years now. Working out used to help me feel normal. I'd get that natural endorphin high and it would boost me. Now I can barely walk. I tried to get back into working out (just short 20 minute ones) and the amount of foot pain I'd feel for days after was absolutely crippling. I feel so trapped.

I'm just feeling very overwhelmed and sorry for myself right now. The thought that someone here understands makes me feel comforted and also sad."
Constantly struggling to fall asleep 😫,7,mkc51l,5,"One of my main symptoms from my CPTSD is insomnia and it's been steadily getting worse the past few weeks. I've been approved to use medicinal marijuana, and have been using on nights I can't fall asleep, but still struggle with sleep. I've also tried guided sleep meditations with little success. It's at a point where I'm getting very little sleep and am often not falling asleep until around 1 or 2am at the earliest when I have to wake up at 6 for work. In other words, I'm exhausted all the time. 
I was wondering if any of you may have some advice on what else I could do to help ease my racing thoughts so I can alleviate my insomnia and get some very much needed rest."
What 3 months of diving into my own mental Hell revealed to me,5,mkbx7u,4,"For the last few months, I weaponized my tendency to fixate on things, and made that ""thing"" my recovery. I called upon every ounce of willpower that I could muster and started exerting it on this recovery fixation. 

In my mind, I had years of catching up to do, and I didn't want to lose any more time, friendships, or relationships to my trauma. So I told myself I could do this and completely re-wire my brain through neuroplasticity and sheer willpower and condense 3 years of therapy into 1. (you can probably tell where this is going.) I told myself that it'll at least get me functional enough to not fuck up any more friendships or potential relationships. 

Especially one friendship/semi-romance in particular that had gotten complicated fast. It got unhealthy and painful, and I won't speak for her side of things but I'll say that on my side of things, my trauma started to come out and I started drifting back and forth between narcissistic and codependent defenses in terms of behavior (as I had come to realize, I had been doing for years.) Regardless, I saw where things were heading and all I knew was for once in my life I would do things differently, and walk away before things got abusive/more dysfunctional for either of us, and that maybe that'll open a door in the future for a healthier re-connection.

I started going to therapy 3 times a week between two therapists (and I still am, but I'm about to drop to one therapist 2 times, maybe even 1 time a week but more on that later.)

I removed myself from a romantic situation (the one mentioned above) that was too triggering for me, because it had become unhealthy, too painful and in my mind, if there was any hope for it to work out in the future, I had to get my head right, and get out of her way and give her the time and space to do the same (she also suffers from C-PTSD and if it wasn't for her I'd still be flailing in the dark with no idea as to why I was suffering.) 

I listened to 6 different really eye opening audiobooks, some of which I listened to multiple times just to really soak in the knowledge.

I started finally recognizing and wrapping my head around the extent of my traumatic experiences, and to my surprise, how much of it came from childhood, starting from age 8 to 16.

I started remembering things that happened that I had blocked out, and how not normal those experiences were; how they were traumatic things for a child and young teenager to experience.

I started making the connections as to how those experiences shaped my perceptions and my thought patterns and behaviors.

I started recalling and recognizing times those thought patterns and behaviors cost me friendships, relationships.

I started making amends with whoever I could, and even helped a few people start their own recovery journeys because I recognized the symptoms much like someone recognized them in me and helped me see the truth.

More importantly, I started getting better at recognizing my unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors and interrupting them. I started feeling like I was actually starting to get a handle on things and I noticed myself being a lot less reactive, and I even started ""moving into my feelings"" and allowing myself to feel my feelings instead of just thinking about/intellectualizing them.

Eventually for a few weeks it really started feeling like things were getting better and I started feeling good. 


But nothing could have prepared me for the consequences of the one thing I had dared to challenge...

Time.

You see, I learned something important about how my brain worked. Because I had really started battling my brain by going against my own programming, which is to try to anticipate, predict, assess and manipulate, all because I was traumatized to rely on those things to create a sense of safety and conditioned to believe that to survive, I had to exercise *perfect* and sound judgement or I would be hurt or punished... Thanks mainly to my father, as well as elementary school and middle school experiences. 

Growing up, I was never given a margin of error, a mistake was never just a mistake, there were no explanations, or at best they were fear based explanations if I got one at all. Most of the time it was straight to punishment... And the punishment ranged from humiliation and bullying, to verbal and physical abuse. 

So when I started going against my programming, I only felt okay about it at first because I hadn't factored in time.

I didn't anticipate that the longer I went against my protective instincts, dysfunctional as they may be, that my brain would inevitably start fighting back, hard, because the danger signals would get louder and louder, because as far as my brain was concerned, I had completely disarmed myself and that was a big no-no. 

So now I'm three months in, two months specifically since I removed myself from the situation I mentioned in the beginning, arguably the very thing that started this whole journey for me...

And let me tell you. It's been really, really hard. Because I've been fighting so hard to ignore all these conditioned responses and impulses, feeling like my brain is on fire, hoping that soon enough the new neural pathways will form and bake into my brain and I'll start to feel okay with not knowing what's going to happen next, if I made the right decision by walking away from that situation, what she's gonna do, if I misjudged her or not... Because my brain is desperately screaming at me to slap a label on her, to make a judgement, to decide if she's safe or dangerous, so I can either continue to hope we'll reconnect one day, or block her and actively try to move on. God knows I've fought the urge to reach out just as often as the urge to block/burn the bridge.

But I've done neither of those things. And for me, that's real progress. The truth is, I really did learn a lot and make a lot of progress in just a short amount of time. 

But I also made things a lot harder for myself, and I'm absolutely exhausted. By stripping my brain of my trauma based defenses in such a short amount of time, and not giving myself time to figure out and integrate the healthy defenses, I created a much harder environment for myself that has been tormenting and heavy, where the best I can do in place of the unhealthy things is ""nothing"" and that in itself provokes a fear response because I still feel unprotected. It got so bad, I started losing my will to live because I started feeling pure agony. Using up every ounce of my willpower to keep myself from imploding or acting out one way or another. 

I didn't have to do this to myself. 

I stopped listening to audiobooks on trauma and self-help, and I'm about to reduce my therapy sessions to 1-2 times a week. 

I was humbled and forced to accept that this whole thing was just another way my trauma had manifested, just a clever way for me to try to feel a sense of control over a situation that frankly, had broken my heart. 

There are no shortcuts. There are no tricks. You can't outsmart your symptoms, you can't ignore the power of time.

 It turns out the best thing you can do for your recovery is to be kind and patient with yourself. Self-compassion really is a key. 

I know there's no profound moral here. I'm sorry if you read this far and this was a waste of time for you, if you already knew all this and if in your mind all I did was make a fool of myself.

But if you're anything like me, if you've ever been hard on yourself, if you've ever been frustrated because you felt you weren't making progress fast enough, that if only you were focused enough, if only you had more resources, that things would be better... If you've ever wondered about any of that... Then take it from me, after finding myself in a rare position to answer those questions from experience and not just hypothetically...

It's okay to take it slow. It's okay to have setbacks. You'll get there when you get there. Just be kind to yourself on the way. Because the people who you think are healing faster than you, the people who seem more focused, more determined? They're not getting there any faster by foregoing kindness and patience for themselves.

Thank you for reading about my journey so far. I hope this helps someone."

Feeling depressed and mistakenly expressed this with my family,2,mkbazs,2,"Potential TW:

I've been having a really hard time this past year - broke off an engagement with my ex-fiance, got kicked out of our house and had to move to an apartment in the middle of COVID, been completely inundated with work to the point where I've developed anxiety and my resting pulse has become higher and higher. Throughout all of this, I've had my waves of depression and feelings of hopelessness and lately feeling like I just don't belong anywhere. I'm floating around in space with no purpose and nothing really to look forward to in the future.

Long story short - growing up was ""ok"" with the exception of being emotionally and sometimes physically abused by mom and aunt for pretty stupid stuff. It's weighed on me a lot in adulthood and it's definitely affected the way I deal with relationships, social situations, and just...well myself. I've been seeking therapy for the last 6-7 years so I'm leaps and bounds better than where I was at the beginning but I have my moments of struggle...

I spent this afternoon with my parents for dinner - and everything was going well until around dinner when I just got the feelings of depression and anxiety pretty bad and I just blurted that I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. The response I got from my mom and aunt (my dad is in the picture, aunt lives with them) was negative - I got called a nut/psycho, ungrateful because I was ""raised well and didn't grow up poor"", weird, etc. I also supposedly ruined their night because I hit them with a ton of bricks with that statement and I've essentially turned my back on the family... 

My birthday is next week and I already spent last year's pretty much alone (my first night alone in my apartment) and I definitely didn't want to spend it the same way now. Well now because of my ""weird attitude"", I've been told that I'm not welcome to celebrate my birthday with my parents until I start acting normal again - I've apparently ruined that day for them. And then I'm being asked why don't I ever tell them how I feel and I told my mom ""this is the exact reason why I don't"" and then I'm being told to keep it to myself...

I've been lucky enough to brush off these moments in the recent past but I'm struggling bad in dealing with it - I made the mistake of opening up and now it just hurts.... reinforces everything I've been working through in therapy about them. I don't know, I just needed to let this out somewhere because I feel like there's no one else out there to share with anymore..."

"Guy supposedly loved me and made me feel safe after serious trauma, just to use and abandon me",7,mkav8f,8,"TW: mention of suicide

This is long as FUCK and I don’t expect anybody to read it, which is okay. Just getting my thoughts out kinda helps. 

I’ve been crying for days. I first met this guy in 2014.. we met at a concert and both made out and fought pretty much right after meeting the same night. I wasn’t expecting to see or talk to him ever again, although we did have a strong connection. My long term relationship I absolutely hated ended violently in January, so I’m quite vulnerable. 

We didn’t see each other again until the end of 2016, where I became his first love basically. He was my rebound, to be blunt.. I was staying with him a lot.. then I got back with my ex but continued to have a fling with him. Then he got hit by a train and not really expected to live and I was the only person to stay by his side at the hospital.. he could no longer be intimate, at least at the time and that was kind of the basis of our friendship so we agreed to go our separate ways. We had an ugly falling out.. before I attempted suicide the first time, I reached out to him because I wanted to make amends with him before I made the decision to attempt suicide. It didn’t go over well.

Fast forward to 2021.. a week ago he “found me” online after searching for me for a long time apparently, and I went to his place the next day to reunite. Well he decides he “loves me”, is “in love with me” and I’m “the one”. (I wanna add he first mentioned loving me before I even came over). He was so affectionate and loving and acted like no guy has ever acted towards me before. He passed me off as his girlfriend to all his close friends and family. He made me feel safe and like able to enjoy sex again and rediscover myself in that way without any pressure or safety concerns.. I felt like I was living in a prison being so afraid of sex prior to being with him again. I feel like I can live life again in a way.

This guy is a huge drug addict who basically lives in a drug house but I more or less looked past it and stayed there (kinda like in 2016 but it’s worse now).. I got pissed at him and walked out without saying bye which caused bad feelings. I wanted to try continue our friends with benefits situation (he wants a relationship, I don’t) and now he has excuses for not putting any effort in or talking to me (such as his main dealer went to jail and he was worried he was going to jail too) and like busy with that but it’s complete bullshit that he’s too busy to talk or see me cause of that. 

I just feel totally used, manipulated, lied to and a million other things. Yet I STILL care about this guy and feel like I love him as well.. although I refused to say it back cause I didn’t want a relationship or monogamy and I was worried it would mess with him. I feel like I’m 18 again when we first met (we’re 25 now) and feel like I’m hooked on getting relive the times that were a little more innocent again. I’m still crying over him and i hate it. He’ll probably come around again and just rinse repeat cycle. I don’t think he even knows what’s going on cause of all his drug use.

I KNOW what everyone’s gonna say, I already know.. I know I shouldn’t be involved with a drug addict who basically totally fooled me and lied about loving me. My aunt who I’m very close to is being judgmental as fuck and like guilt tripping me. I literally canceled plans with my best friend for an occasion I was really excited about last night cause of my misery. I stopped eating and just not in a good place.. I started to think some very dark thoughts yesterday and today’s been hard but my headspace isn’t quite as bad. I’m going to attempt to shower sometime tonight which I haven’t done in a while. :/

TL;DR former friend/lover from the past re-entered my life, helped me recover from my fear of intimacy.. told me he loved me and I was the one repeatedly.. now he basically stopped trying or giving a fuck and making excuses after I stayed with him a few days. I’m miserable over it and keep crying. 

Just needed to vent.. thank you so much to anybody who read this."

I've been holding in anger my whole life because anytime I DID show even the slightest bit of it, I'd get called a ""dumb bitch"" or get lectured about how I need to learn how to control myself, even though I was like fucking 10 years old. I was never simply asked ""what's wrong?"" Even to this day, I get passive aggressive texts from my family members everytime I hit something (like my bed) to release anger. It's gotten to the point where I just keep it all in until it eventually makes me implode on myself and I start crying (not in a good, releasing, kind of way, but in a ""this is my last option"" and it doesn't feel good at all way). I'm terrified of showing anger, but it really want to.

Obviously, we should NOT be destroying property, hitting people, or insulting people, at least those who don't deserve it, but I think that if you're really being pushed over the edge and being treated unfairly, ESPECIALLY if you're mad about your WHOLE LIFE, it is perfectly justifiable to bang your fist on a table and yell ""FUCK,"" without feeling the need to explain yourself. The fact that I physically cannot eject negative energy out into space without feeling like a crazy person is UNHEALTHY. I feel this same way about crying in front of people. It makes me feel like I'm being manipulative, even though when I see other people crying or angry, I take their emotions seriously.

This is why the generic anger management advice of taking ""deep breaths"" counting to ten, or thinking of something happy just doesn't work. These tips are for BEFORE you really get angry, and are more for trivial, everyday problems. But when I'm REALLY pissed and have just about fuckin had it, trying these management strategies just feels like I'm repressing anger that needs to come out, because it DOES need to come out. So hearing advice like this is extremely triggering and gaslighting for me. This is why searching for a good therapist is stressful. I REALLY don't want to hear this kind of advice come out of another person's mouth ever again.

I know that r/CPTSDfightmode is a thing, and it's a wonderful subreddit, but I don't quite resonate with most of the posts there. This is more of a long-term repressed kind of anger, it's not anger that I use to defend myself from traumatic situations (I'm a freezer, not a fighter)."
Shows/movies with loving families and positive stories from friends about their families are so hard for me to be around.,22,mkalbu,5,"Makes me seem just like an unpleasant bitch, especially to my boyfriend. 

I hardly want to watch anything positive ESPECIALLLLY if it involves a loving family. 

Just a reminder of how life wasn’t for me and it’s hard to explain but it just makes me feel like shit most of the time. Sometimes I make fun of the movie and/or say “ew” or “cringe” at normal things too. Horror movies and documentaries have become my “safe movies”. 

Then when anyone says happy stories about their family, or literally like, any story that isn’t fucked up sad, it makes me so uncomfortable. 

I get anxious and shut down. My facial expression gets immediately plain and straight and sad. People just think I’m bored with what they’re saying or rude. My bf thinks I hate him. 

wack stuff man jus trying 2 live my life and get triggered so easy"
My husband doesn’t have the energy anymore,8,mka131,17,"I’ve come to the realization that I do suffer from cptsd almost at the same time that my husband told me he is considering divorce and wants a second opinion (marriage counselor).
We’ve both put each other through a lot and even though I’ve seen a couple of therapists I stopped on January because of economic reasons and because it wasn’t really helping.

Now I am trying to give him space, understanding that I do stress him out and I’m reading about cptsd, working one work book, Woebot, I also wrote to a few therapists for both individual and couple therapy (I haven’t gotten any response yet) but he just told me he does not have the energy to climb that mountain, with tears running down his face. I didn’t cry, I calmly said that I really don’t expect him to do nothing, just to let me work on myself, and with time and space maybe things will get better, besides therapy and that I see now how necessary it is for me to get help and that I am regretful for not doing it early.

I am hopeful, maybe I’m in denial, that this breakthrough moment that I’ve been going for the past week will be the definite and that I will learn to love myself, whoever I find myself to be, to understand that he is not abandoning me whenever he has to go somewhere without me, that I can validate myself and work on my self esteem but I really don’t want to lose him. The thought of having separate lives, the thought of separating from my daughter, it breaks my heart deeply.

Has anybody... gone through this and saved their marriage? 

I wish I knew what to do."
Theres nothing special about me.,4,mk98gs,5,"Part of how I survived, was by making myself believe my struggles made me stronger and that it made me special in some way. 

It hurts realizing that I’m.... not special. I’m like everyone else only its just harder for me to function day to day. 

And the thought that I was special in any way was all just a lie I told myself."
Cptsd disability,10,mk9dyf,13,Has anyone here ever get disability payments for complex ptsd ? I feel so exhausted by all the trauma and feel like I’m unable to work .
I often get tired of self-parenting and just want someone to hold me.,558,mk9c6s,44,"(no advice wanted, just support)

I know that parenting myself and being present with myself is the only way to fight this thing, but goddamnit, sometimes I just want a guy to hold me. 

It's so much emotional labor that normal parents are usually supposed to do for you (because it's their job), and so taking it on is exhausting. 

I still live at home with my family and I cannot feel present with myself when I'm here, so I get very lonely and sometimes just wanna be held like a little kid. I read somewhere that loneliness is not just about not having people in your life, but it's also about not being able to enjoy your own company, so maybe that's why I crave the company of others when I can't physically enjoy my own because of the environment that I'm in.

Maybe it'll get easier when I move out and have more physical/mental space so that I can finally breathe."
Today I’ve Been Pretending to Be Okay Around Others,5,mk8ecn,1,"It’s been an unusual day. I woke up feeling okay. I took a shower out of wanting to do so and not out of frustrated necessity. Some days are like this. Others aren’t.

I went to the park with a friend for a walk. I asked him if he’d like to go because we usually go on Sunday’s. It can be nice to get out of the house. It didn’t turn out as good as I was hoping.

I had a lot of anxiety being there. Usually I’m anxious in public, but it was worse today. I couldn’t think straight. So my responses while talking were boiling down to simple responses, chuckling or laughing to hide the fear, or responding too quick because of fear. If I’m relaxed, I will laugh too if something’s funny to me. Except I’m sure it comes through differently.

There are a number of reasons why this happens. For years as a young adult, teenager, and kid I was disassociated from reality. That’s part of a much larger story related to my trauma. A lot happened to me as a kid and it’d be too much to go into with this post.

When I was 19, I was recording replays of me playing video games with my friend I mentioned earlier. I put those together into highlight videos on YouTube.

When watching those videos, it’s staggering how different I sounded. My responses were extremely short. Like acknowledging what was happening. Or answering a question. Or again a chuckle. I was so disconnected. I sounded drunk all the time. I slurred my words. It’s astounding, and I had no clue until I began coming out of this disassociated stupor.

It seems I can still struggle to focus like this. I shouldn’t be hard on myself about it, because it doesn’t help me. But I do remember my friend would get frustrated over us playing together and me being the way I was for so long. When it was changing, he noticed it quickly. I would say playing together has gotten better because I’m not always so distant anymore. But there are still days like today where I may look like I’m somewhere else. It puts a lot of pressure onto me to try and not be like how I was.

Usually texting and writing is a good avenue for me to express because I have a lot more time and way less pressure to say what I want to say. While I’m not as deep in the disassociation like I used to be, I have a ways to go it seems.

There’s some other stuff that happened today that has been bothering me immensely. I’ve spent most of the day after the walk just in bed. My head is feeling like it’s tearing itself apart sometimes when thinking of things that bother me greatly. I will flip flop between trying to calm myself down and the fear and stress overwhelming me. The trauma’s and memories are causing a war inside my head. I can feel some sort of phantom pain coming from head.

I’ve been through a lot. I seriously hope one day my brain can stop running and running and just… relax. I don’t know how many years of my life have been shaved off from the constant and obsessive thinking I’ve dealt with for most of my life."
How do I know when I’m overreacting?,11,mk81rz,5,"Would like advice, if anyone has it—wasn’t sure what flair to put here, but I have obsessive thoughts, which is why the anxiety applies.  
  
My whole life (~30 years), one parent frequently punished and shamed me for “overreacting”. I’m in therapy now, and I’ve been able to recognize that I was actually trying to stand up for myself, just not in a way that was comprehensible because I was literally flooded with feelings (emotional literacy is not my strong suit).  
  
I still haven’t found a great way to gauge whether my emotional reactions are valid or not—I’m working on this in therapy—but I’m realizing that sometimes it’s because I’m simultaneously learning what it means to let something go while learning what it means to stand up for myself *and* for others.  
  
I do a lot of amateur work in a field that tends to marginalize folks who are not white, not cisgender, not heterosexual (and more, but I don’t want to ID myself here). I am a queer white person—and it often feels like I have one foot in each pool. Important detail, maybe?: I am in a position of leadership, but we’re small enough that I work alongside everyone most of the time.  
  
Things come up: we are small, we’re underfunded, and things don’t always go our way—ergo, conflict. Some of my colleagues (usually the cishet white ones) will tell me I need to let things go; but when I listen to other colleagues (usually the non-cishet, non-white ones), I hear them saying that the privileged folks aren’t standing up for them.  
  
There’s a lot of nuance here, of course, as these situations are numerous and differing—but I don’t want to be someone who’s making a big deal out of something when it isn’t worth it. The thing is, I’m not only considering if it’s worth it for me; as a leader, I must also considering going to bat for my marginalized colleagues.   
  
Does anybody here have a tool or a series of steps they take to help them decide when to let something go versus when to advocate for or speak up about it? Sometimes “my gut tells me this isn’t right” is all I have to go by, and I just don’t know how to explore further. And many responses can be time-sensitive; so I can’t puzzle it out over a week.  
  
(I’m also taking this to therapy next time I go. I’ve tried to explain it to my therapist in the past, but this is the best I’ve ever worded it in the many months that I’ve been able to identify the dissonance.)"
i don’t know what to do,3,mk7t3s,2,"tw: suicidal thoughts and self harm

i’m in the worst mental state of my life. i have never been as depressed as i am right now. my life has been going downhill since december, and i don’t know what to do to make myself feel okay. i just want to be okay. i can’t escape my past. i can’t escape my life. i want to end my life more and more every day. i’m scared of myself and i’m scared of what i might do to myself. i started cutting again. a lot. i’m fucking terrified. i didn’t ask for this, i didn’t ask for the trauma, i didn’t ask for these mental disorders. i don’t want to live like this and i can’t find a way out. i’m losing control. i just want someone to talk to, someone to hug and someone to tell me that i’m loved and safe. but right now i don’t have anyone. i feel so alone. it’s pathetic, i’m pathetic. i know i should just get over myself but it’s so hard, i just don’t know how."
Any fawns here have a hard time recognizing when people are mistreating you?,508,mk7pvq,72,"Like sometimes I’ll be telling a story to someone about an encounter I had with a person or someone will overhear someone speaking to me and they will be like “wow they were really disrespectful/mean/rude/aggressive/hurtful” and ask why I didn’t stick up for myself and I’m like what???? it was??? like maybe cause of my childhood I’m used to certain type of behaviors so things don’t really register as abusive behavior until someone tells me. Fighting back or being mean to people doesn’t even seem like an option a majority of the time, unless it’s like really serious or something and even then, I have a hard time. It makes me super susceptible to being taken advantage of and I end up in abusive relationships a lot because a lot of red flags or warning signs don’t even register to me. 

Like even when people do hurt my feelings I don’t always register it as a red flag because I was always told I was overly sensitive so if I got hurt by someone, I would just suck it up and tell myself I shouldn’t feel that way and eventually the feeling would go away if I ignored it long enough. I don’t get angry really either and I’ve heard anger is an emotion meant as a response to injustice so maybe bc I don’t feel that I don’t recognize injustice in my life. 

I have really horrible anxiety and I think it may be related to this issue. I’m used to taking hits but I never am able to express the pain that I’m supposed to feel from them."
Keep getting blamed for failing to communicate,15,mk7mne,4,"Since I was a kid I've tried reaching our to my mum to tell her how I feel. She'd always dismiss me or laugh in my face. I'm now 27, and still when I try to talk to her she shrugs her shoulders and says how it's she meant to know when I don't communicate. It only recently dawned on me that the reason I feel completely insane when I try to talk to her is because she doesn't listen and just excuses anything I say as mental illness. Sorry if it doesn't make much sense  just so hurt and angry that my own mother does this to me."
i cant move on,3,mk70x1,4,i don’t get how i’m ever meant to move on from what happened. today i found out my sister was abused by the same man that abused me. justice will never be served. he lives in peace rn for the awful things he did to both of us meanwhile both of our lives are in pieces
Recovery,29,mk709f,10,"I used to come to this sub years ago and trauma ruled my life, 24/7/365. I'd go to therapy sessions and it would blow me out of the water for a week at a time. I would see other posters here with other interests, commenting on other subs about TV or whatever, and think that they were so much more recovered than I was, since they could even have other interests. I am there now, and it's true that trauma doesn't have to stagnate. Especially not with the great treatments available today."
"Are there others out there who can’t feel sexual pleasure, a result of CPTSD?",13,mk6xlf,6,"I am a 23 year old woman and mother of one beautiful toddler. As a kid, a teenager, and young adult, I have never experienced an orgasm. Every time I have tried masturbation, it completely turns me off and I feel absolutely nothing. This goes for my partner as well when he tries to please me. Sex does nothing for me and my sex drive is as low as ever because of it. I’ve been to numerous doctors and neurologist and nothing is physically wrong with me. So it has to be mental right?

My childhood was bad. I grew up with a narcissist and emotionally/physically/verbally abusive mother and sister. I was never molested or anything of that nature. My mother never told me she loved me, never called me beautiful. She made sex and masturbation out to be something that was wrong or nasty. She CONSTANTLY slut shamed me while I was still a virgin. Always basically accusing me of being a hoe all while I was virgin in every way possible. She did very intrusive mean things. For example:

When I first hit puberty as an 11 year old, I asked her if I could start shaving my private parts as the excess hair made me itchy down there. She freaked out assuming I was doing it for more promiscuous reasons. One time I got out the shower, she demanded me to remove my towel and stand naked in front of her so she could see if I shaved or not. You can imagine that moment was very uncomfortable and traumatic for me. I told her I was uncomfortable being naked in front of her and she dismissed my feelings completely. This incident happened a couple times. 

Anytime I displayed a sign of confidence in myself, she would immediately shut it down and say I was being “vain” or “full of myself.” She would constantly keep in the house and I never really got have a childhood. My first memory of her as a kid was her holding me up my throat and squeezing while screaming at me. I came home from school one time dressed for “wacky tacky day” and she said I looked like a hoe. Mind you I was only 13 at the time. At 17 she desperately wanted to kick me out and had my dad not been there, she would have succeeded. I could go into more detail but you get the point. I felt a lot of shame growing up but I’ve overcame at the age of 22/23. I no longer feel guilty for loving myself or wanting sex. 

Could my childhood be the reason why after all these years I still can’t experience pleasure? People say sex isn’t everything, but they’ve never had to live without it. It feels like a black hole of sadness in my chest. Everywhere I go I’m reminded about sex. Movies, music etc. 

I try to focus on things I do enjoy in my life, dancing, being outside etc. but no matter what I still have this empty feeling. 

What could it be and how can I solve it? I can’t afford therapy at the moment."
Does anyone else’s parents say “look what you’re doing to her/him/them” when a sibling yells and you panic?,9,mk6n0z,2,"My parents were telling my brother the chores he had to do, he starts yelling at her, I start panicking, and she points it out and honestly makes it worse. How do you deal with it?"
Emergency allerts on phones,6,mk6lo2,6,"So I was on my phone listening to calming sounds and out of absolutely nowhere the amber alert went off on my phone (I thought I had turned alerts off on my phone for this very reason). I had the biggest panic attack I've had in a long time. I screamed so loud and threw my phone and physically collapsed (I couldn't hold my body up at all). It sounds dramatic but it was SO loud (I had earbuds in) and the phone was vibrating like crazy too all while I was in such a calm and vulnerable state. 

Does anyone else have reactions like this to extreme external stimuli? Like alarm systems or loud random noises? I'm always so hypervigilant but I was actually calmer than usual when this happened (depressed but calm) so it just really freaked me out... just wanted to write this out and talk to others about this because I feel kinda crazy atm. Like that shouldn't have had such a massive effect on me. I understand having C-PTSD makes your nervous system extra sensitive (I also have ASD so that doesn't help) but wow that was a lot even more me. 

💚 

Side note: I tired to change the titled but idk how to lol I spelt ""alerts"" wrong 🤦‍♀️ oh well lol"
Sometimes i imagine my life without trauma,23,mk6dtp,5,
Gender and CPTSD,5,mk6bh0,6,"I’m seeking advice on the relationship between gender expression and CSA specifically and wanted to know if anyone experienced the same thing? Also, I’m sorry if I offend anyone or use the wrong language just let me know and I can make edits or delete

So I was born female and was SA by a family member from 6-13 years old and during most of this time I heavily expressed myself as a guy to (I think) avoid my abusers attacks against me. He was very outwardly homophobic but regardless of what I wore it never mattered to him. I came up with a male name for myself and wore my brother’s clothes and if anyone didn’t already know me and asked me I would say I was a boy. I got bullied pretty heavily for this and by 8th grade I started trying to present more as a girl. It was pretty uncomfortable but now as a 22 year old I present as a girl for the most part but I’m still really uncomfortable wearing really “feminine” things like dresses, makeup or purses etc. I get defensive if people suggest I do more feminine things but I do feel more comfortable with people referring to me as a girl. 

Now with me learning about trans people over the past few years I’m not sure what I am or if it really matters. Being called a guy now triggers me and just reminds me of my abuse and the terrible bullying. However, I’m still not completely comfortable in my femininity and often feel very ugly and out of place around feminine women. I want to bring this up to my therapist but I just feel so ashamed and confused and I’m not even sure they’d understand. I also don’t want to explore too much and end up tacking on a gender dysphoria diagnosis to the growing list on my chart. Would this even be gender dysphoria?"

I rarely see anything about other traumas,7,mk5v2f,6,"I always see things about family trauma and childhood trauma everywhere. I have some childhood trauma and one horrible thing that happened to me when I was 6 and my family is wonderful (not so much when I was little). My most traumatizing years were between the ages of 12-20. I know that plenty of people are in the same boat as me but I have never really found anyone who can relate to me on that level and I can never find anything about this online either. I just feel a little left out and alone in this. I know I'm not alone but it kinda feels that way.

P.S. I'm not trying to offend or shame anybody and I'm very sorry if I hurt anyone, I just want to find someone who relates and maybe answer why that's majority of what I see."
The way I was abused has made therapy an impossible mode of recovery.,158,mk5oj7,36,"My father used his skills acquired managing and studying people to twist my mind into believing all sorts of things about myself, him, and my childhood neglect that simply weren't true. 

Some of the methods he used in breaking my barriers and planting false ideas in my head are the same ones therapists use. I once had a meltdown in a therapist's office not because she uncovered something I didn't want to deal with, but because she was using some of the methods he did, and I didn't know how to react. I couldn't speak for days after that appointment. 

Being neurodiverse and being abused makes articulating what's wrong with you when you're upset a difficult task. It's even harder when the person who is supposed to be helping you has to use what hurt you in the first place to help you."
My childhood pictures are only further proving my trauma,25,mk5mal,8,"tw: religious & physical abuse 

I lived in my home country for the first 5 years of my life, away from my father, who was abroad at the time. Those were probably the most blissful times of my life, the last few years before I'd be awoken with severe beatings to finish up my school work or thrown around because I wasnt 'covering up' well at school or have my hair pulled or screamed so loudly almost every single day if I dare talked back at my father. In every one of these pictures, I'm smiling so wide with all my teeth showing. I was genuinely so happy. 

And then theres the photo albums with pictures after we had moved abroad with my father from ages  6 to 11 - I'd have a straight face, no emotions.  I look so distracted, sometimes even sad. This makes me heartbroken bc I know it was around this time I'd started maladaptive daydreaming to cope with the abuse. I had started completely numbing and dissociating myself from reality and these pictures are proof of all the trauma I'd gone through 

It's like I cant make eye contact with the little girl in either of these pictures. I'm mourning for the happy little child, who couldnt see any of the abuse coming and the emotionless kid who's still got a lot more abuse to endure. It hurts so much."
A Paper on Violence in Childhood and Its Effects,1,mk5k8i,1,
I don't know what proud or accomplished is supposed to feel like,17,mk5byf,2,"For the past few years I've been killing it with academic achievements, growing in leaps and bounds, and even got one of the top work placement opportunities that involves a detailed background check.

I feel paralyzed, overwhelmed, like I've said the wrong thing the right way to have 'tricked' my interviewers into thinking better of me than I am. This is the most accomplished I've ever been, except it doesn't /feel/ like anything positive- it sort of feels like danger. Like they're going to find something in my background that disqualifies me (they shouldn't, but that doesn't mean I'm not afraid of that). 

Or that something even bigger and badder will happen to me to punish me for getting a reward/opportunity that I don't really deserve, as a karmic balancing function of the universe.

I would like to over ride this internal constant drive that's telling me ""you've effed up, you can't do this, it's just a matter of time before you drop the ball, they're going to see right through you, everyone hates you, everyone is angry at you, danger is coming"" with whatever proud or accomplished is supposed to feel like, but I don't know what that is. Because I can't do that, I'm stuck and doing a lot of procrastination that's making the negative drive into a self fulfilling prophecy. :("
DAE not like playing games?,2,mk5brr,2,
Anyone else here have BPD comorbidity? I seem to fit a lot of the criteria,3,mk571h,7,"Wondering if others here has both CPTSD and BPD. I have been diagnosed C-PTSD but I seem to fit a lot of the criteria of BPD, specifically fear of abandonment.

My first question is - can fear of abandonment a symptom of CPTSD as well? I did have abandonment trauma as my dad was on drugs when I was a kid and mostly absent in my life and my mom was an emotionally absent narcissist. 

I notice the (possible) BPD symptoms are most prevalent in my relationship...I feel highly hyper vigilant and even paranoid. If he starts using his phone a lot I start to feel like he’s cheating or that I don’t trust him. I constantly have really dark intrusive thoughts about him being unfaithful or just feeling generally highly untrusting if I am triggered.

Would like any insight from people who have BPD as well! I don’t want to further stigmatize those with BPD, but thinking about having they makes me feel so much shame. I’m not sure if my symptoms are CPTSD related or not. 

I will absolutely bring this up to my therapist as well."
Middle School messed me up and I lost my highschool years to it.,8,mk54bi,4,"Hi.

Didn't think I fit into the C-PTSD category since I don't have any flashbacks based on all of the senses(touch, smell, hear ,taste, vision), but I read one of the sidebars and I fit the description of too many of the suggested traits. 


So, with that, I'll feel like I can safely post this here. Please forgive me if some of the things I say are silly, but this stuff happened and I can't keep ignoring the fact that it negatively affected me.


I am a teen girl with high functioning autism. I also have adhd. The thing is, nobody knew until 2 summers ago. AFTER middle school. The worst years of my life. I've always loved school. I enjoy talking with everyone and just the general structure. I am a very outgoing person and I'm creative and very imaginative. I'm also accepting and loving. And I still am. But that shit doesn't fly in middle school.


Please don't invalidate my pain by saying *oh it was just middle school, kids are so ~awkward~ at that time*. SHUT UP!!! Please just listen. I need someone, anyone to listen to me so I don't have to feel so alone with my thoughts and memories.

I'm going to tell you everything I can remember so sit back.


I went into middle school and I was so happy to see everyone and to have the opportunity to make friends, express myself, and have a feeling of responsibility. *I had none of those things*. I hugged people. Mistake. Biggest mistake of my fucking life. Middle schoolers are dumb and think hugging=affection=love=relationship=sex. They hated me. They were scared of me. 


*Everytime I stood near someone, they would physical step back*


*Don't touch me*


*Get away from me*


*You're sexually harassing me*


It made me cry. I didn't want to hurt them. I didn't want to sexual harass them(shit, I'm asexual!). I just wanted to show my appreciation. Nope. That's not how any of this works. I know that now. I knew that then. Every time I hear someone say those words I can feel my body phantomly falling down to the ground to cry in a fetal position. That's just what I want to do all the time, I'm so sad and lonely often. To see people running from me or walking away, even if they aren't bothered by me, makes me feel self deprecating and abandoned. I just want to spend time with people, but it always feels like they don't want to be apart of my life.


An awful trigger for me that just makes me want to scream and cry is when people reinforce my hugging behavior. They like to ""throw their friend into harms way"". They laugh to see their friends so uncomfortable with me hugging them. I want to hug but the person I'm hugging isn't happy, and then they hate me. This happens still in my everyday life. I hate it. I just want to explain to people that I have bad trauma from non-consensual hugging, but they won't take me seriously. It hurts so much.


One memory from 6th grade was I was sitting in my language class while the teacher was out of the room when I got too close(wasn't even touching them) to someone. They yelled for someone to grab a ""safe card""(anti bullying and harassment report slip). I ran over and grabbed the slips and threw them in the recycling bin and guarded them with my life, trying to defend myself by explaining I wasn't even hugging or touching anyone. The teacher came back in and made me put the cards back and didn't even address the situation. 


One time a teacher ripped a page out of my hands and threw it in the trash. I was writing my name a bunch of times to try to fill up the page with it. She scolded me for ""wasting paper"". Sorry for engaging in repetitive behavior, I can't fucking stop myself it's so comforting. 


A friend I had(who I will call CM) was a male and I had him in two classes. I also shared lunch with him half of the time. Issue is at this point(a month or two into 6th grade) I was already a social outcast with a terrible urge to hug everyone, and this made people ignore me or be scared/repulsed. I had little friends. So whatever friends I did have I only wanted to be around them and make them gifts and give them hugs. I became clingy. I don't want to be clingy, but I'm insecure. I don't get jealous, I just take any love I receive and hold it close. CM was one of the only friends I had. But there was one issue: his family were car dealers. Seems simple enough, right? This was CM's excuse, he was gone 2-3 days a week. This fucked me up and reinforced my developing abandonment issues. He never told me he would be gone, and would just show up without acknowledging his absence. My lunch was spilt. Because of my schedule, I ate lunch with 6th graders one day and 7th graders the other. CM didn't like me eating lunch with him and his buddies. He said I should sit with my other friends. *Who?* Then, February came. CM tells me not to freak out, but that he'll be gone for a few weeks. Okay. I'll just sit with someone else, I'm sure I can find someone. 


*2 months passed*


2 entire godamn months passed and I hadn't heard a word from him. Finally, he comes back for a few weeks in april. Then he fucking leaves again, doesn't even warn me this time. He doesn't come back until the end of may. We hangout in class and lunch and it's all chill. 


Then the summer comes. Isolation. I didn't have social media. I stopped existing for three months. This is a cycle for every summer. People stop contacting me in the summer. Of course I have social media later on, but I still get ignored then and to this day. If I'm not in front of someone then I don't exist. CM stops talking to me and I figure I just won't bother with him anymore. 

7th grade comes along and the impliment the shittiest system ever: Advisory. Hearing that word sends me spiralling into feelings of inadequacy. Three aspects of advisory bothered me. The basics of advisory is it is a 30 minute class period deticated to lessons about being self motivated, kind to others, making friends, and other bullshit perpetuated as healthy teen interaction, along with fixing missing assignments and goal setting.

*Goal setting*

God how much I hate goal setting. Yes, I am aware of short/long term goals in my own life. But they are simple things like ""make a blanket"" or ""become a tattoo artist"" but *no. You can do better.* Fuck. You. I am trying my godamn best and I don't need to level to your standards. Oh wait, did I tell you this class is GRADED? Oh and these goals, these *SMART goals* had to be acidemic. Holy shit, can I just pass? I want to pass, can I just pass? *No, what do you do to pass? Let's get those c's up to b's* NO!!!!! Leave me alone!!!! I'M TRYING MY GODAMN BEST!!!! I don't want to do missing work, I can't keep up with the workload. It's too much. That's an excuse, though. I can't. I can't do this. It's just a rambling mess when I talk about goals. 


During the summer, I aqquired a little lion plush I called 'Danny'. I consider him my son. One week, I lost him. I couldn't find him anywhere at home. I knew he was in school, so I put up missing posters. Useless. Fucking useless I'm useless-

Sorry got off track. I'm not being edgy, that just came out. I'm feeling a bit emotional right now. Anyway, I put up these posters and kids rip them down and throw them away. To get at me. One kid says that if he find Danny, he'll rip him to shreds. Others say they'll throw him away. Kids laugh at this notion. They don't understand that Danny is all I had. He was my son, *my child*. You don't want strangers or anyone to hurt your child, let alone mutilate them. I remember after someone threw a poster away I wrote on my locker in sharpie,""please find my son Danny, he is missing."" The kid stood in shock that 1) I just wrote on my locker, 2) I was this desperate over a toy. After two weeks, I finally found my baby boy again. He was in a basket in my science room with some fidget toys. I cried in happiness, quietly saying ""I found him"". One kid asked, ""what's going on?"" To which the teacher just told them to not worry about it. Hey, fuck you! This little toy is important to me, not like you would understand attaching to an object when you get ruthlessly teased, mocked, and ignored by everyone.

An event in 7th grade was one day, in the gym, I find this pencil. But oh, it's not a pencil, it's one of those *beefy mechanical pencils*. Girl notices the pencil and says she knows it's not mine, which naturally I say ""finders keepers, shouldn't've left it in the gym."" 

Next day, the girl the pencil belongs to confronts me. Here's the thing: that day, I was doing a character. And when talking with peers, I would be in character because it was fun to act that way (the way I was acting was actually just me being myself [didn't know at the time I was autistic], although one would describe it as ""retardation""). She keeps asking for the pencil. I say,""I don't have it, Harlee has it."" Of course I had the pencil, it was in the front most pocket of my back pack. But no, I wasn't about to give this girl her pencil back because it's a pencil, and I see everyone with this pencil so they're readily available. But this girl, this fucking girl is persistent. 

At lunch, she is joined by the girl from earlier and an additional friend. They keep trying to get the pencil from me, and I keep telling them I don't have it. At some point they literally circle around me. These girls were going to gang up on me *for a fucking pencil*. They say shit like,"" you better bring the pencil back next week or bad things are going to happen to you."" ????????????? What the fuck?!?! What are you going to do to me?? Some girl notices these girls being vultures and distracts them. I sat at the back of the black top until it was time to go inside. So I head back inside. 

The girls are now talking with the gym teacher. I just shake my head because this is such bullshit. I walk on, but these girl come up after me. They're all like,""we're going to tell more teachers-"" I snapped. I threw my shit down, smacked one three times, and grabbed another by her hair and threw her down. I don't know where the other one went, but I just picked up my stuff and ran to the phone. I was officially out of character. I am given ISS for the rest of the day and the next. Yes, I did indeed give the pencil back. That girl didn't bother me ever again.


And then 8th grade.

Dear God, 8th fucking grade. 

At this point, my memory is fried. Everything people say to me just blends together. I can't tell adults that kids are harassing me because I can't distinguish what is new, what is real, or what even happened. I'm being bullied. And the school likes to act like they're so *anti-bully*. They're fucking not. I was mocked, ridiculed, teased, and used by my peers for their own entertainment. 

I just- ""I wasn't being beaten up so why bother?"" Is what I always thought. The stupid stereotype that bullies are bigger, popular, male, and beat you up or make fun of your appearance is fucking appalling. It's a lie!!!!!!!! It's the biggest lie of my childhood. I didn't think there was anything wrong with people laughing at things I said. But there was this detachment. People didn't like me, and didn't want to work with me. In group projects, I didn't fucking exist. I hate group work because I felt inadequate. And people didn't hear my ideas, or take me seriously. My science class was the worst of it. They tormented me. But I was desperate for any positive reinforcement. So I went along with it. Teacher was fucking incompetent, swear he just did weird shit in the back room while leaving the class to handle itself. 

God I just want to cry, I feel- some sort of negative emotion. I can't remember half the shit they did to me. I can remember some, let's go with that.

One day this kid says I can't rap. I challenge this notion by writing a rap song and singing it at lunch. Kids ear this shit up like gold. They want more. Finally, I have a found a way to be accepted: friendly rapping about stupid shit. So my science class gets the idea that they're going to be my managers. So I'm like cool, I'll have back up dancers and we'll do shows and maybe I'll post the raps online (I did, they're under Lowlywoes by dannyandfriendsco on youtube). And I set up a concert date and concessions. No one shows up. These fucking people are so hype about me but they won't go to a concert? Fine, let's try this again. Next weekend only one person shows up. That's something, but God it was embarrassing putting so much effort in only for own person to show up. I went back to school and told my class they weren't my managers anymore and that I would be doing things on my own now since they don't respect me. That ended my career. I tired to work on another album but when I performed a single, someoen threw a snowball at me, so I figured that was the end of that. Frustrating thing was that people are still trying to get me to rap again, but I don't think people understand how tiring it is to put effort into being accepted only for it to fall flat when I want some leeway.

I showed up to school with a balloon that I wore in my hoodie as a head. Kids in class kept bopping at it. They kept taking the balloon from me to pop it. Teacher has us go outside to do... Idk some shit with liquid nitrogen or an icy explosion. A kid blocks me from going inside while one pulls the balloon from my head and pops it. I know it's silly, but I was just trying to have fun. They were actually pushing me around and trying to pop the balloon *because they knew it would make me upset*. 

I try to show someone a picture on my phone. A kid snacks the phone to the floor, and another stomps on it and slides it to me. WHAT THE FUCK?! And of course, I didn't get mad. Why? I was afraid if I made them pay for the phone (prepaid, $60) that I would be inconveniencing them. Later I did get upset and sent an email to the principal demanding he make the kids pay up. Ignored, not even acknowledged.

Two big events happened in second semester. The first, I had this crush on this kid. And of course, me being the person who trusts others, I tell these kids about it. I felt like I could trust them *because I had no one else in my life who gave me any attention*. They say the guy likes me back. Really? Wow that's gre- a fucking LIE. These kids were egging me on. I try to dance with the kid at passing time. He simply says,""let go of me.""

My entire world came crashing down. These kids, yes they were shitty but... Do they hate me? Yes. They hate me. The first thought in my head was how much of liars they are. Liars, liars, lairs. That's all I could think about. I don't want to be around them. I'm stressed. I just don't want to be in school anymore, but I'm 13. So I figure ""hey, why don't we just *burn the entire school down?*"" In my mind at the time, it made sense. I would be a criminal and they would put me in jail. If I'm in jail, it makes sense why people are mean. And why people hate me. It would all just makes sense. So I packed a lighter and some yarn and went to school the next day. 

I left in the middle of class and went upstairs. My science class wasn't for another two hours, but I didn't want to do gym on my last day. So I just tied yarn between two lockers on either side of the door and pulled out the lighter. Now, I can't use a lighter, I was inexperienced at the time. So I about rub my fingers raw trying to get a spark. And when I finally do, I hold it to the yarn. Looking back, my mind was so fucked. Around the yarn was all solid material. The yarn would not reach the door in any way. I could've went about it a million different ways, but the way I went failed (thankfully). The yarn caught the flame.... and it brown apart. That was it. The yarn was burned at the ends but nothing else. That was good enough for me.

I ran out. As I ran, I actually threw up. Probably from guilt. I walked for a while. I felt free. What I really needed was fresh air. I calmed down and turns around. Boy was I a happy camper when the fire alarm wasn't going off. I came back inside, my teacher worried about where I went. She sent me to the counselor (big mistake, CONSOLERS ARE FUCKING INCOMPETENT). I told him what I did and he didn't bat an eye. I told the principal/ ass. Principal what happened. They didn't care. WHAT THE FUCK? DUDE! I literally tried to commit an act of violence and property damage. People get truancy for etching dicks into a computer, but NOTHING happens when I try to BURN DOWN A FUCKING SCHOOL?! I isolated myself for the rest of the day and went home. 

Now, you would expect my parents to be pissed off, right? No, and here's why: *the fuckass school did not call my parents at all*. That's right, I was not punished for my actions. Maybe I should just be happy to not have anything happen to me, but I feel upset. These are the people who want to say middle school is so great when I felt like shit the entire time. I return to class the next day, letting everyone know what I did. They just say that's so metal and move on. Great, what did I fucking expect.

Oh, but my parents did find out. It was a month later, I can't forget the day. February 21. Monday. The memory is foggy.

It hurts to think about.

I just want to cry.

But I need to say it so someone can comfort me for once.

I was in science class, we were all up and about. I can't remember what we were doing, but I think I was trying to socialize but was either getting ignored or picked on. Teacher tells us to sit down. As I do, this kid whispers something at me. I snap. But this time, instead of violence, I use my voice. I stand up. I can't remember what I said. Something along the lines of, ""you guys are so disrespectful to me, you lead me on, you only like me because I'm funny, you popped my balloon, you stepped on my phone, you treat me like shit-"" and this part I remember clearly:

""I hate your fucking guts.""


...



*and they laughed*

One girl started laughing, and the others joined in. Everything hurt and at that moment I died inside. Everything hurt so badly. I finally let everyone know how I feel and it's a joke to them. *I'm just a joke to them*. I ran out of the room and sat in an open locker and contemplated suicide. Idk, guess I'll drink mouthwash and throw myself from the top of the school, that's gotta kill me. So for the rest of the day, I don't care. My mom picks me up, and she's upset with me. Says I'm being moody. Don't care. Wants me to clean my room. K. Wants me to give her my phone. Shit. The messages I sent to my cousin are on there. I had told my cousin(a cousin who sexually/physically/emotionally abused me and then manipulated me by telling people I raped her) prior that I was going to burn the school down, and she said I should bring a knife and rape my family (both things I didn't agree with, I know I was sick but I have standards). My mom sees these messages, and gets pissed. She writes an email to the principal, very angry. She asks,"" are you suicidal too, should I put in there that you're suicidal?!"" No. Not anymore. I snapped out of it the second she mentioned it. 

School year goes on. God I'm so tired right now. There's a few more things but I've been writing this for 7 hours. Just... Whatever man. Say whatever, I just had to get it out. I just want someone to see me."

DAE struggle preparing for job interviews?,8,mk47qu,10,"Long time lurker here, trying to get into posting because I know there's no one else like this community that will understand what I feel. This bloody disorder sucks. 

So I have an internal interview next week for a job that I'm already doing. My position has been temporary for a while and this interview is basically to make it permanent. There's quite a few temporary staff also doing the same job as me but apparently there's also quite a few permanent roles too. The interview is just 30 mins. All sounds easy enough right? Should be okay for me to get that permanent job, yeah? 

WELL, god knows, cause preparing for this interview is agony.  Today I have compiled lists of questions they might ask me and following that I just broke into a crying fit. I have no auto biographical memory whatsover, so how am I supposed to answer any of the competenecy / 'describe a time when you....' type questions? I keep doubting my identity due to the abuse, so how am I supposed to answer things like 'where do you see yourself in 5 years' and bla bla bla. My inner critic/ my mother's voice is the strongest when it comes to my work/school achievements, so how am I supposed to sell myself to them and tell them 'im good at x,y,z' when I don't believe that most of the time?  It just SUCKS. I know I can do the job, i've being doing it! And i've had nothing but good feedback from all my management/colleagues. BUT NO, my brain has to doubt every single bit of myself. My brain has no useful examples to offer to the contrary because for some reason (which im sure is also trauma related) , I don't remember anything properly anymore!  My brain has to panic just at the notion of the question 'tell us a bit about yourself', because well, I don't know who I am really?!! 

I'm just so tired of having to work around this stupid disorder. It is so bloody frustrating dealing with this. I feel like I keep trying and making progress but then some new obstacle appears that just makes me feel like s\*\*t. It's really really unfair. I'm so tired of working so much harder than neurotypical people for the most basic/simple things.  It sucks and its such a lonely place to be in, because who would understand this really? Neurotypical people have no idea. I'm tired of my whole life just involving fighting against this seemingly undefeatable beast that is C-PTSD, when others just get to actually enjoy their life, lucky them. UGHHHH.

Psychological chills? Physical chills? Body shakes/shudders? What is happening to me?,6,mk3kn3,5,"You know when someone says something that deeply resonates and it gives us goosebumps? And sometimes when one listens to a story we shudder physically? I really don’t have the words to explain my experience, but I feel a sensation in my chest that makes the centre of my chest shiver almost as if there is some stuck energy trying to get out and maybe this is a placebo but I feel like when I feel that weird shaky feeling I can feel myself de-numb, and if I force myself to feel that sensation, then I feel present but if I avoid it I feel frozen again. It feels so weird because sometimes my body will move a little in person, like in a way when someone tells you a scary or even extremely wholesome story and you shudder & get goosebumps? Like I am supposed to be shivering but don’t feel cold at all? I am so confused, this is not a chest issue because just last month I got my chest xrays done, so I don’t think it’s anything medical, and going to the doctor again I’d feel embarrassed because how would I even explain my symptoms? 
Just wanted to ask has anyone experienced this? And does this sound normal or should I immediately consult a physician?
Thanks!"
"DAE remember things that happened, only to forget them again?",34,mk3gjx,6,"I’ve noticed this issue coming up. Sometimes when I’m having a conversation, or reading something, or maybe waking up from a dream, I will remember something very clearly from my childhood that is upsetting. It can be an event or possibly a dynamic between me and someone else.

For example, my mom has mellowed out over the years and I have a hard time thinking of her in a negative way, tend to find excuses for her or blame myself for things. Like, I *know* on some level she did some messed up stuff, but because of how she is now I will give her the benefit of the doubt and think, well, maybe I was just really difficult to handle and she tried her best. A few weeks ago I woke up from a dream that reminded me how things *actually* were back then, and how they were definitely not okay, very abusive, etc. But now, I can’t remember what I remembered. I know what I remembered was legitimate, but it’s totally gone now. 

This has happened quite a few times now with different things and I’m wondering if it’s something anyone else has dealt with."
Is C-PTSD real?,2,mk3flq,11,"So I googled and the DSM doesn’t accept CPTSD as a real disorder, i’m not invalidating any of our struggles or pains but a therapist on instagram said that what people with “cptsd” have can be childhood wounding, bad childhood experiences, depression or an accumulation of lots of such things, but when we use the term “ptsd” for our situation we rob those war veterans and others of language to use vocabulary to make sense of their situation. No I am not asking anyone to diagnose me or minimise or question the validity of their own pain. I just wanted to know what are your thoughts about this statement? I feel I have it because when I heard about this, all my other issues made sense. Let me know what you guys think, I don’t want to dismiss my own experience because of what that therapist said, any input would be appreciated.
Ps. If this feels like it goes against community rules I will take this post down. Let me know."

How to value personal time?,4,mk32bx,1,"So I'm in therapy, and I've come a long way. But I struggle with anxious attachment/people pleasing/codependent behaviors. 

Does anyone have some advice for learning to feel like I'm entitled to my own time?

I struggle to self care and have boundaries, and even when I do, I generally am killing time in a way. 

Today my husband is working on a home improvement project. He loves doing them. I told him I need a rest day today, we've had a lot going on and I need to only do basic house things and rest. But when I'm trying to I feel like I'm just waiting for the day to go by. I feel guilty because he wants me to help clean up some of the construction supplies but I'm trying to enforce my own boundary of resting today. 

I guess some of it is I don't know what I want. Knowing what I want is dangerous. I'm just sitting here stressing, which isn't helping me rest. But I know doing what my husband wants me to is going to burn me out more. 

I'm trying to think of my stress reducing actions and I'm just feeling like I don't have the right to do them. Which really isn't healthy but I don't know what to do with that."
Unexplainable sever itchiness when dissociating?,2,mk30rj,4,"Been meaning to ask this for a while. I've got a lot of common symptoms of CPTSD like muscle armoring and tensing up subconsciously throughout the day which causes me chronic pain. But one thing I have yet to see someone mention is extreme, sudden itchiness. It's always in the same spot, my legs, and randomly appears sometimes when I dissociate. It's strong to the point of pain. Itchiness that makes me want to cry and makes my desire to self harm sky rocket because I just want it to go away. I'm proud of mysrlf I never have but I just want to scratch to the point of cutting myself with nails.

If I ignore it and just suffer it eventually fades in a few minutes and it's as if nothing happened. But if I give in and touch it, not even scratch just massage the area, I get a rash. The few times I have scratched it results in a rash that almost looks like a scar and lasts for weeks. Is this somatic pain? It just feels like my body is malfunctioning and over reacting over nothing. Its not my environment like I'm allergic to something because I can go weeks sometimes without it randomly flairing up. And if I just suffer it's gone within minutes. But it's so strong I can barely walk. My entire body just tenses up as I try to fight the urge to touch and just suffer.

I hope I don't sound crazy. I suffered physical abuse as a child and am a CSA victim, can this be a symptom?"
"I’ve been trying to get some answers about why I am the way I am for my whole life. I think I’m starting to figure it out. I wrote this summary, and I’m wondering how many of you it also applies to.",290,mk2ol3,73,"A child is born with Highly Sensitive traits (HSP). Their caregivers do not nurture and cultivate these traits for several possible reasons: (a) they are oblivious and don’t recognize it (child is labeled as “eccentric”); (b) they don’t know how to deal with it so they give up very early on (child is labeled as “difficult”); (c) they notice it but don’t care so they ignore it (child is labeled as “a bother”); they punish it (child is labeled as “bad”). 

As a result of the core traits of the child being ignored or punished, the child develops CPTSD. This results in anxiety, depression, dissociation, mistrust in self and others, and emotional disregulation.

As a result of the development of CPTSD, the child develops ADHD, which includes coping and survival mechanisms such as a keen ability to read other’s emotions and intentions; using logic instead of emotions to make decisions;  being drawn to patterns and routines, which provide safety, comfort and predictability; and avoidance of difficult situations where the outcome is not certain.

As a result of the development of ADHD, the child’s behaviors are seen as “advanced for their age” and the child is labeled as “gifted”. The child is then held to a higher level of expectation, but without the foundation of family support. This leads to early and prolonged  burnout - “after gifted”.

As a result of this pattern, the child spends their life feeling unseen, inadequate, unaccomplished."
!!! Easter Weekend Executive Dysfunction Bonanza!!!,5,mk2ask,1,"It's what passes for a ""nice day"" in this shite part of the world (everything grey and brown and nothing alive or blooming, dust and mud everywhere, but the snow's gone and it's not freezing out). So everyone and their dog, literally, are outside. I can hear all the neighbors and their happy families laughing and talking and I just want to die. The sun coming through my windows hurts my eyes, but I don't want to punish my plants for my trauma-induced depression, so I feel like I can't close the curtains. I have the worst headache but I just started antidepressants (doing nothing so far, too early to expect anything) and although I want all the pain to end, I don't particularly want it to be via brain bleed, so I can't take the bunch of extra-strength Advil which normally would kill the headache eventually. I can think of a list of things I could do to feel less like dying (yoga, a bath, a nap, short guided meditation, some hygenic self-care, make some healthy yummy food and eat it, take a walk where there aren't too many people, watch a movie, read a book), but I literally can't do any of them. Today and most of tonight's going to pass in a haze of dissociating looking at my phone, alternating with monologing aloud (I'm alone) about all the ways in which my existence is horrid/ past trauma, and scream-sobbing.

Paranoia about people breaking in
Rescue cat
Balaclava 


So I ended a friendship and burned that bridge in spectacular fashion by getting my cat back from them without them noticing (I let them look after the cat even after the friendship was strained and then find out the cats being neglected and I suspect abused as she's flinching when I stroke her sometimes). Ever since I've then my occasional paranoia I think it's classed as that to be honest I don't know all I know is normally at night some sounds make me think someone is trying to break in to bring me or my animals harm. Those issues only happened maybe once or twice a month but since getting the cat the paranoia has come back ten fold and  im so paranoid a man is trying to break in and he has a balaclava on and it's happening during the day and so many more sounds are making me jump and then setting me off, several times a day im being triggered and I manage to calm myself down after a few minutes but I'm exhausted. It's not even the ex friends that I think are trying to break in when I'm home but when I have to leave the house I'm then worrying the whole time that my friends will break in to get my cat (although I rationally know they wouldn't).

My brain is getting so over run with irrational thoughts im really struggling to keep myself stable and I even have started getting triggered when my boyfriend is staying over where as before I felt 100% safe when he's with me.

When it's at its worse and I think someone has broken in I either panic and drag my animals to the bathroom and lock us in or I go around every room with a knife and kick the door open so I can surprise the intruder.

I dont even know who I can contact for support. I'm with a mental health team but on a long waiting list for therapy so no help from them for a while.
Im uk based if somehow someone knows any suggestions.

"Writing the memories down? [TW abusive relationship, sexual assault]",2,mk132e,1,"I recently got out of a toxic and abusive relationship and the patterns of behaviour in the relationship dynamic absolutely echo previous traumas. Particularly in terms of my emotionally, verbally and physically abusive father. I'm also dealing with beginning to process a number of sexual assaults I experienced going back many years. 

One of the things my ex told me was that I am unloveable. He retracted this later but it cuts so deep to the core of why I downplay my memories of trauma. I feel like I did deserve everything. Now, I have done a lot of work in group therapy and before this relationship I had gotten to a pretty good place in all areas of my life although was still learning how to manage my ADHD and anxiety and episodes of depression. But this has set me back big time. I'm having constant emotional flashbacks, regular flashbacks and am regressing to all the awful things I believed about myself.

I'm journaling a lot and sifting out reality from beliefs and I think it would be helpful to sit and actually write down my traumatic memories in as much detail as I recall in order to show myself that it was actually real and begin to challenge them. To put distance between then and now. My big concern is that this risks becoming emotionally overwhelmed and retraumatised in a way I can't contain by myself. I am doing lots to take care of myself atm, sleep, meds, meditation, hobbies etc. But I can't afford therapy although I find helplines quite useful when I'm desperate. It's all just swirling around in my head constantly and I want to get it out but I don't want to open Pandora's box and not be able to close it in order to carry on functioning in day to day life!!

Would love literally any advice or tips about how to approach this. I think it would be really therapeutic but I struggle with pacing myself and not getting totally overwhelmed."
DAE have aphantasia (inability to picture things) that seems to really intensify emotional disconnection?,3,mk11re,3,"Hey, I came across this community looking for some book reccomendations and wanted to ask for some advice. I'm a 21 year old trans women with aphantasia - I realised I differed from other men when I was very young, and my dad especially had specific view of expected masculinity. I felt like I couldn't talk to them about anything, internalised the feeling of needing to ""earn love"". I was pretty insecure, depressed and emotionally dissociated a lot of the time growing up - but I've been really fortunate to have been on a positive path for the past couple years. I'm working with a therapist, going through books + workbooks and redefining my relationship with myself through self compassion. I still struggle a lot with feeling safe, but I'm growing a lot more aware and feeling significant progress in understand the ways I reinforce those feels of fear and anxiety.

I think I could picture things as a kid, but I can't now (not sure and it doesn't really matter - if I could it's something that may come back through healing but I'm trying not to get too worried about it, it'll be okay either way). A lot of exercises talking about healing dissociation, reconnecting with feelings use visual imagery in a way I can't really - and it can be quite confusing and worrying but something I am able to navigate healthily. It almost feels as for some mental imagery can act as a sort of pinboard, where if they're distracted for a second they can look back and it's still there ish, but if I get overwhelmed by anxiety for a second or distracted in some other way I almost feel like I've lost where I was (I also have/ am medicated for ADHD)? I'm comfortable in being able to try and keep up healthy practices, but I was just curious if anyone here had experienced anything similar and could share any tips / point me in the way of any useful literature?

"My parents are emotionally abusive, what do I do to not become like them?",10,mk0zmj,3,"TLDR: My parents are emotionally abusive and they’ve been yelling everyday at my brother for the past four months without fail. My trauma gets triggered and I start to yell at my brother because of what my parents do to him. I don’t wanna be like my parents, what do I do? 

———

All my life my parents have been very emotionally abusive. They always shout at me and curse me for every little mistake that I make ever since I was a kid. It got so bad too the point that I thought yelling was a normal family behavior. I don’t have any idea how I put up with all the emotional abuse for 18 years without telling anyone, not even my bestfriends. I was too embarrassed to tell, it felt so lonely. 

When I moved out for college, my relationship with my parents slowly got better because they were nicer to me since we don’t see each other a lot. I started to appreciate them and look past what they did, because as a Filipino, families are very sacred. It was toxic for sure, but at the time I was just really glad that I got my freedom. My parents aren’t only emotionally abusive, but they’re also very strict. I basically didn’t get to enjoy anything when I was kid. 

But then, COVID happened. I had to move back home and it was a nightmare. I wish I can live in a dorm again, but because of health issues and the fact that I don’t have my own money. I had to suck it up. I thought that after a year, everything will be back to normal, but I was fucking wrong. I’m still stuck with my parents and I hear them yelling every single day. It’s a nightmare. I have my own room, but it still doesn’t feel like a physical safe space. Because everytime there’s an argument that doesn’t include me, my mom and dad will surely find a way to shift the blame of whatever the fuck they’re fighting about to me. It’s tiring. I hear them yelling at my brother or to each other every morning and every night. 

On the first few months of lockdown last year, I snapped because they were yet again violating my privacy and confiscating my gadgets at 19 years old just because I pissed my dad off. Their reason for doing so is because I live in their house and I should abide by their rules. I told them that they caused me so much emotional trauma from all the verbal abuse and that I’m scarred for life. They got so irrational and started to gaslight me, because they think that being a good parent is just about providing. 

I tried to rationalize everything and my brother cried as well, telling us that he felt the same thing. We were all crying at this point and I told them that we needed therapy. Unfortunately, we can’t afford it, but my mom told me that she’s gonna make an effort to yell less. I thought everything’s going to be better at that point, but who am I kidding? 

Fast forward to today, my brother is slacking off in online school and I’m pretty sure he’ll get kicked out soon. Remote learning is so fucking hard and I understand where he’s coming from. Because of this, my mom and dad with no fail, have started shouting at him every single day from morning ‘til evening about not doing well with school for four months now. I repeat, four months.  It triggered my childhood trauma that I’m still experiencing to this day. 

My parents have also blamed me for my brother failing although it’s not my fault. I hate being responsible for other people when I can’t even do it myself. The emotional abuse has also gave me a hard time focusing with my requirements and with sleeping. It made online classes harder. Because of this, I started to unknowingly blame my brother for all the yelling and for all the stress that it’s causing me even though it’s not my fault. Every time I get annoyed, I can’t stop myself from yelling and cursing at him too. I know by now that he’s going to hate me forever. 

I don’t want to be like my parents. I don’t want to traumatize other people. What do I do? 

Ps: My fucking situation wouldn’t be this bad if it wasn’t for the failed pandemic response of the fascist Philippine government."
Is this a form of dissociation triggered by being emotional?,9,mk07hq,4,"TW: mentions of self harm / dissociation? 
.
.
.
.
.

Often when I get upset, I go from zero to 100 in the sense that I dont “just get sad” - I am ugly crying for hours, I see red or black and white. My partner could mention they forgot to buy milk and I can feel like the world is falling apart or that Im being attacked. I know it doesn’t help that growing up, every time I showed any signs of sadness - I was interrogated or made to feel bad about being sad. I am a very emotional person but id have to hide in the shower just to cry, or at its worse I just had to stop feeling on some level. 

most of the time the only thing that calms me down immediately is self harming or forcing myself to sleep it off which that alone can take a long time. However, i noticed after I take a nap, self harm or just in general after im upset - i get a huge headache sometimes and then I go blank. As if I dont remember why I was upset or why my partner not buying milk bothered me so much. I have had full blown arguments with people, and I come back oblivious that we were ever fighting. I rarely hold grudges because its like i emotionally forget all the pain I was just feeling. And the times that I do remember the argument, I immediately want to fawn over the person and make amends because the weight of the argument/what happened is too much compared to silence. 

Is this a form of dissociation? I always considered myself just someone who doesn’t hold a grudge, but I feel like its more than that. I watch other people get into arguments but the aftermath is not like mine.

Can anyone else relate?"

People who don't understand what it means to grow up abused and marginalized get my blood boiling sometimes,161,mk0h43,13,"So, I'm trans, gay, the child of a migrant and I grew up with an abusive family. I feel like some people I encounter have got no idea what that meant for me growing up and the consequences of that in my day to day life. Those same people seem to have no consideration for people with mental health struggles or disabilities, either. They treat depression like something that happens to other people and claim to be ""all about positivity"", which I see as toxic positivity, really, and at worst something like eugenics, when they eye you with suspicion if you're taking meds for anything. 

I feel like I shouldn't tell them that they're lucky to have lived the way they did so far, but in truth I feel that way. Good for them they were spared the stuff that happened to me. Good for them they didn't struggle with CPTSD symptoms because of it. Good. For. Them. I just can't not get angry when they act like having trauma symptoms after traumatic things happening to you is this terrible, pathological thing. No. It's a result of actual unfairness and violence. I want them to get that into their head and to stop bothering me with their ideas of a perfect should-be world that never existed for me."

Ace Ventura Pet Detective did NOT age well.,59,mjzy9q,13,"Trigger Warning : vague mention of abuse of trans person

So I am a white cis-het person in America and I recognize the massive privilege that affords me and the massive blind spots it leaves me with.

I saw Disclosure on Netflix this week.  (I freaking love Laverne Cox!)

In the documentary, they showed a scene from Ace Ventura Pet Detective where a female presenting character is outed as biologically male by Jim Carey's character in a manner I can only describe as sexual assault.  The reaction of all the men in the scene to this outing was utter revulsion.

I saw this movie as a little kid and my friends and I quoted things from it and thought Jim Carey's over the top humor was hilarious.  

Revisiting this scene in Disclosure as an adult has left me sick to my stomach.  No human being deserves to be treated that way.  This character was the villian and their crime was theft, using sexual violence as punishment to theft is inexcusable.  Then to package it as entertainment, sending a message to a already vulnerable community that you are disgusting and unlovable?!  To make a person or a category of people feel that way is the real disgusting act.

I know that there are many LGBT members of this sub.  Having the courage to live their authentic selves in this world is often very traumatizing.

I want to help make this world a safe place for everyone to live and love in the way that they desire.

And seriously, fuck that movie!"
I really don’t like SA Awareness Month,62,mjzhws,11,"So, April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. I know this because I’m constantly bombarded with Facebook posts, Instagram stories and infographics and cartoons and Snapchat stories about the fact that it is Sexual Assault Awareness Month.

Perfectionism as a defence against others trying to attach their negative feelings to your behaviour,29,mjz9fd,2,"Recently I started listening to Pete Walker's ""The Tao of Fully Feeling: Harvesting Forgiveness out of Blame"" audio book. As I was listening to the part on perfectionism, it didn't seem to explain my main motivation for perfectionism. 

It seems my mother always had a lot of negative emotions in her mind. Generally these emotions were about her life and her behaviour. But sometimes she tried to make them about things I did. Like, recently it seemed she wanted me to feel bad about not buying butter. She didn't need butter or want me to go back and buy some butter. It seemed she only wanted me to feel bad about not buying butter.

My father wasn't like this generally. But when interaction with my mother made him feel bad, he could act similarly. I remember as a child getting upset about her drunk temper tantrums and him telling me I'm as bad as her.

Perfectionism couldn't stop the emotional storm around me, but if the emotions being expressed weren't about me, that hurt less. It was more like unpleasant and annoying than like something that hurt me down to my core.

Ideally I guess negative emotional expressions which aren't about me could be met by support, but it seems impossible to make my mother feel better that way. 

Experiences with bullying probably also reinforced this, making me want to analyze potential expressions before being willing to express them.

BTW I wonder if this coping mechanism leads towards narcissism?"
Is anyone having trouble finding any emotions towards friendship or relationships,9,mjyxc1,5,And what is happening?
The Bad Dreams and Nightmares Never Stop.,6,mjyhuk,2,"I've been prescribed anti-nightmare medication to deal with the constant bad dreams I get every night, yet although I don't really wake up in a burning sweat from nightmares like I used to, almost every night is entirely of horrible things my parents do to me all packed into a dream, and it's been like this for a really long time. Only now did I get prescribed medication for it. 

I keep constantly having dreams of being screamed or yelled at by my mom, dad, my mom's abusive boyfriend, or my dad's ex-wife who I grew up with, with the rest of their kids around me laughing at me and mocking me. There are dreams I would have where I'd be getting yelled at and I'd spend the entirety of it having a mental breakdown while defending myself and telling them off. 

Then I'd have the really severe ones, like the night before, where I had a dream that my mom's ex boyfriend threatened to break my legs, because I didn't want him around anymore, and I was screaming at him to do it (he constantly made show-off-y threats but never actually owned up to them) and he started attacking me. 

Last night was a dream about my stepmom flipping out at me and calling me an ungrateful bitch because ""she raised me"", while I was upset and planning on leaving her home, because of the mistreatment I kept getting. It was a yelling fest from hell. 

I don't even enjoy sleeping anymore. I always wake up feeling upset or drained from the bad dreams I constantly fight of my parents lashing out or bullying me. I can't tell you how many times I've had the same dream of my dad kidnapping me and yelling at me through an entire car ride while I couldn't escape. It just never stops. 

I wish I could just live like a normal human being and not have to he constantly reminded me of the trauma I dealt with years ago."
Any other Americans feel traumatized by the U.S.?,402,mjycu4,98,"Don't get me wrong, I love a lot about the U.S.--the natural landscapes, a lot of the people, the ideals that we are supposed to represent, etc. But I also find that it's a very hard place to recover from trauma in. There seems to be a culture of violence (I mean the amount of mass shootings is ridiculous and treated like its nothing by half the government) and theres a culture of ""winning"" and hypercapitalism that just discourages empathy or at least encourages apathy. I know no place is perfect, but it feels like living here is uniquely stressful. A lot of what I need in healing from trauma is to feel safe and surrounded by people who are caring, but so much in the U.S. is triggering, and I do feel like it's moreso than other countries. I'm part Belgian, and I've visited family in Belgium three times. Each time I felt much more relaxed there and like the people are a lot more easygoing. I think the fact that they also don't view social programs as ""socialism"" or something evil made me feel a little more like there was a general attitude of caring, and not the toxic ""every man for himself"" mentality. I know they have their problems too, but culturally it's much more relaxed than the U.S. Does anyone else feel this way and how do you deal?"
I finally found words to explain how masks have impacted my ability to interact socially,9,mjxyur,2,"Yes, wearing masks is important to stop the spread of Covid-19 - but that's not what this post is about.

Since mask mandates started going into effect about a year ago, I've noticed that my social anxiety has become even more pronounced and I finally found the words to explain why and felt the need to share. For me, being able to read people's facial expressions is a big part of how I establish my sense of safety when I'm navigating around the world. If someone is displaying an emotion I perceive as threatening I can avoid that person (go down a different aisle in grocery store, for example). There are warning signs in a person's body language before they become violent. If I can see and recognize those signs, I can dodge the punch - so to speak. However, with everyone's faces obscured it is far more difficult for me to get a read on people. So as a coping mechanism, I err on the side of interpreting ALL faces as threatening. 

My PTSD brain is interpreting the world as constantly being full of threats when I'm in public and my method of mitigating that (reading faces) has been taken away because everyone is wearing masks. This has led to me feeling extremely exhausted after outings. Often, I avoid going out altogether by having my necessities delivered. Thanks for letting me share. I'm surely not the only one who has been affected this way by the pandemic."
Huge panic attack and feeling trapped,3,mjxyco,1,"I like a boy but my anxiety is too severe to meet him. I canceled so many times and I feel horrible. I can not meet him. I also missed a grooming appointment because I was too anxious and started dissociation. It's Easter, and my mom's birthday. This is an extremely hard day for me. Usually I would just melt in my bed all day and be depressed so badly that it hurts. But I have my puppy here, someone I need to take care of. She is an attention whore. So everytime I hyper focus on my computer to write my feelings, or everytime I move- she follows me. I feel like this should be comforting. But I see it as, she wants something from me or needs something from me and I feel the pressure to attend to her, entertain her. I never have any time to myself. I feel bad for being annoyed at her but I feel like I need fucking space on this day I am crawling out of my skin. She had off leash at Central Park all morning, playing, running with dogs and people, walking all over. She went to bathroom. She ate an extra yummy breakfast for Easter in a puzzle.

I once stabbed a son of a bitch and it hurts me...but also I don't see any other way I could have handled it,3,mjwu3y,12,"And I say that as a non-violent person. But it was also very liberating that I knew I had that kind of violence in me...don't fuck with me.

I got horribly bullied for all of my existence in the school system. Inside the school, outside their jurisdiction with kids who went to the same school system, my childhood ""best friend"" was a frenemy who fueled it as well, Felony Phil.

I never wanted to be a violent or scary person. BUT, the kids would just incessantly from every angle, fuck with me, and could force any non-violent person to be violent. Toy with me. Torment me. Make fun of me and treat me as underneath them.

Even from the confines of my home, I wasn't safe from these horrid people.

They actually home invaded my house 4x, and vandalized our house, between 30 and 40x, doing $thousands in damage.

I like knowing, that I had that violence in me, I will by any means necessary, fuck you up even if I don't know how to fight. I don't need to know martial arts to use a weapon in that moment.

Because I ran into this problem where if I did other means to stand up for myself, the bully would act horribly indignant and be crueler because I stood up for myself, ""omg this wimp is standing up for himself, let's be even WORSE to him to remind him he's beneath me"".

ANd this one kid, Mike...dude he must have thought I'd just fume being angry and not do shit, and he'd laugh at how angry I was, and that'd be that. I don't want to tell the entire story, but I had these brand new shoes, mom bought me that I loved because of how horribly treated I was at school, it was a bright spot in a dark world, it's still a dark world for that matter. I'd tooth brush clean them, put the laces in a water bottle with detergent, and white the sides, to keep them nice. Brand new. And even though I tried to look nice, bullies would ruin my clothes just to be cruel, I had one dig through my lunch and full force throw my caprisun packet, blowing up all over my clothes.

I may have been autistically ranting a bit too much about my stupid shoes that day, fair enough. Mike dragged his foot across my new shoes. ANd this was my moment...I wanted to lay down a boundary, and enforce it. ""Mike, I'm a funny guy, goofy, not very threatening. I like you even. But DON'T DO THAT AGAIN"". I FIRMLY communicated that to him. This is a boundary and I wanna have a good day, in spite of you dragging your foot across my fucking new shoes. And bell rings...classroom clears out. I'm packing bookbag, and from the sides, Mike walks up and drags his foot again across my brand new shoes.

My eyes filled with pure fire in rage...I'd never been so pissed in that moment...I grabbed a pencil on the fly. And he got defensive, and asked if I was gonna stab him? I stabbed that son of a bitch in the hand with a pencil.

Later on it got infected, he needed surgery.

And btw...I know the school system could have handed these bullies their asses. Because I got suspended a full fucking semester for standing up for myself, I did more to instill fear in bullies in that school, than the adminstrators, and I'm the one who got punished for it.

This isn't games, you severely violate personal boundaries...he knew I didn't know how to fight, but that doesn't mean I can't fuck them up. I could bring a tire thumper in my backpack or mace canister. These aren't games anymore.

If I ever apologize to him, I would apologize to him that I somehow did not more FIRMLY COMMUNICATE my boundary. That's the only thing I'd feel sorry for. Apparently the very important communication didn't get through his thick ass skull of his, this is not a fucking game this time around.

I dunno, it hurts me that I had to be violent, but it was very liberating too...I know I can be violent if necessary to establish I will enforce personal boundaries with violence if needed, these aren't games any longer.

Edit: I notice someone was quick with the downvote. Violence is wrong...I agree, that is a good position to have, and it's because of that shared view we have that I don't feel bad. Because no one is obligated to practice nonviolence with violent people, FULL STOP. That is non-negotiable. And these were violent people right out the gate, so you're gonna be profoundly quicker to downvote them by default and above and beyond all else before you even get close to downvoting me. Violence in response to violence, is not the problem. Because I tried as you would advocate, just sitting there angrily fuming and eating injustice after injustice forever on end, no one was giving them some HARSH consequences, and from my point of view what you advocate for, that wasn't a real option either. I have to ask...if I had more effectively instilled fear in my enemies, would that have made them not want to fuck with me? Because that would have been very welcome result in my childhood."
What is trauma,0,mjwjfi,3,
Should I ask my parents?,1,mjwi9l,1,"I’ve been having a lot of emotional flashbacks lately and nightmares too, and I feel like I’m getting closer to the root cause of everything. Opened up in therapy and what not, found a couple of triggers I have, you name it. But, I cut contact with one side of my family, that I believe are the cause (well my parent, even though their relatives weren’t the best either). But I’m scared to ask my other parent about my childhood. They say they think it was okay, that it was a good childhood, but then, I wouldn’t be like I am right? Something was wrong, but I can’t name it. So I would like to know, if you guys were in my place, would you try to ask your parent about it? Not just general questions, but I have some concrete ones to ask. I’m just afraid."
Why are relationships so hard. [TW: Rant/Vent],4,mjw6og,3,"Romantic. Platonic. Any kind of relationships are impossible to keep up and just be stable. 

Everyone in my life, everyone I have ever confided in or trusted with my inner personal thoughts have betrayed me. My family has betrayed me, my past romantic partners have. I'm so desperate to have a connection with someone and for them to try to understad why I act like this.

I got diagnosed with CPTSD last November. I am 16 and I have no clue what my life has been or what it will be. I dont remember my childhood apart from bad moments, yet that barely is anything. 

I try to be better and be nice and I tried to be a good friend or partner. But i always fail. They always leave me even if I caused it and it was deserved. I can be rude and a downer to be around, I'm so terrified to be replaced when I'm friends with someone, I get upset when they are with someone other then me and I feel so worthless and alone and just not worth anyone's time. And I try to be better, I tried to be better but it never works and I'm so tired of being abandoned.


I get this feeling when I'm at my best, this weird hyper and childish feeling and I feel like I'm fine. Not euphoric or on cloud nine, just fine. This numb steady feeling that makes me live in the moment and feel like life is worth living. That I'll be okay.

But for some stupid stupid reason I get upset over the smallest things. Little things that should be fine and not even sensible to get upset over. A heavy ball forms in my chest and its hard to think and focus on anything and I feel so small and so alone and so unloved by everyone around me because it's stupid to be upset over any small thing.


I always went back to this one person, a off and on relationship of a friend. We knew eachother for 4 years. Even if his past ex when they were together told me I was horrible and threatened me, and he never took my trigger to their name seriously after, I would go back. Even if he sent me videos of songs about how he didnt care for my existence after a arguement. I would go back and let him love me and call me baby.

I finally blocked him permanently 3 days ago, after 4 years. After we started talking again after 3 months, which I had texted him in a flurry of emotions, we made no romantic advances. I was okay with him being more distant, because at least I had someone to talk too. It was going well. I got to have deep conversations with him and told him about my diagnosis in depth.

I had a month treatment at a centre thingy to get my diagnosis after some bad incidents, and read him some of my papers and my experiences. He knew I was insecure and had low self esteem. He knew me for 4 years and knew how i was about being disliked. How I was so scared he was lying to me the whole time about loving me. 

April 1st, he ignored me all day then he texts me ""sorryy. was hanging with a friend who doesnt like you all day, didnt want to be nagged about talking to you."" 

I was calm at first!! I tried to be light and cause I was better, I wanted to be better. I was trying to be better. I wanted a friend. I wanted someone I could talk too and hang out with. I didnt even think I was good enough and that stupid little text made up with 1s and 0s made me feel blank. 

The whole time ive told him our whole relationship that I was rude and toxic and was just scum in general. That I was gross. ""I'll always love you"" was his response. He would say he didnt care and would change the subject. 

I spiraled in self deprecating texts, it wasnt too bad considering how horrible I felt. I just replied that a past ex's mom also hated me, which was true. He said his mom also hated me too. I've talked to his mom, I've texted her when I was worried about him.   

I said no one likes me and he said hes no one? Then I rephrased it and said everyone except him hates me but with some swearing. I felt angry and hurt. I was hurt.

Then I realized he did this to get a reaction out of me. He was GLAD it did 

I tried to tell him that I trusted him and that I told him how I thought I wasnt worth anyone's time or my life wasnt even worth the space. How I thought no one truly loved me or how I thought I have no home or family to go too in need. 

I guess he had enougn of my shit cause he told me to stop throwing a pity party. A fucking pity party cause I sounded like his sister who he hated and loved to fight with. 

He said hes better then me and that i am a cunt. That I ruined it. I thought we were going well, we had set boundaries and being friends. I thought I finally was going to have someone. Even if he never cared.

My last attempts at this being not true I asked if it was the friend and asked for proof. He just sent a picture or himself with a wide happy smile. 

Ive been through this in many different forms [mostly family and abuse] so I had stopped crying and was just kind of. Texting him for some soft of feeling. I asked for him to ""tell me more about myself"", since I ""would take anything by now"".

Blah bahn I'm a monster. I blocked him and his family. 


I got off track. Why are relationships hard. Why am I not good enough. I go to counseling and meditation is being worked out but I'm never good enough. No matter how good I feel or how good I act I'm never enough for anyone's standards. 

That's all. Sorry for this pity party or like victim thing, i overreacted and just needed to ramble."
I grew up with back pain if standing or seating for more than 30 min.,34,mjvz4y,14,"My parents thought I was faking to get attention and imitate adults... I stopped complaining before primary school started even though the maddening pain. 

I now know that my right leg is 1.5 cm longer than the left and I have scoliosis and Lordosis which explains my pain standing very long (without walking). I grew up thinking that I was weak and my pain enhanced by my nitpicking attitude. That everyone felt pain but only the weak couldn’t cope without complaints."
My boyfriend triggered a flashback yesterday,20,mjvwwy,3,"And I'm not happy with him for doing that.

I wanted to sleep and he decided he wanted to lift my shirt up from the back and touch my back. It was triggering and I told him don't do that.

So he stopped. Then waits like 2 minutes and does it again.

I just start crying as I'm fighting off the images in my head.

If I fucking tell you to stop doing something, what part of that means ""go ahead and do it again?!?""

(For the record, he was more likely being an idiot. It wasn't done for the purpose of hurting me. I don't think the fully understands how hard it is for me to be touched.)"
I'm unable to become an adult because of my childhood trauma making me stuck in the past.,35,mjvqzd,11,"Hello,im here to share my life story and im looking forward to hear yours and how you have dealt with this situation,sorry for any grammar mistakes english is not my first language. 

I don't remember my childhood at all,i only ""remember"" things my mother told me that happened and when i look at my old photos.My memories start from the point when my mom overdosed on sleeping pills and i tried to keep her awake while my sister called an ambulance (i was 10 at the time),i had no idea what was happening at the time.I had to grow up so soon i had no childhood at all. One year later i started noticing what was happening at my home,there was police daily because of my father not wanting to buy food,pay for my clothes or give mom money for her medicine she needed so bad (she has bad mental issues aswell) so they always argued and my father has always beaten her up and then she called the police.(My mother is not capable of working because of her physical state so she cannot leave now or when i was a child).My father is strong alcoholic,egoistic sociopathic person with a god complex and my sister is just like him thats why she has no mental problems whatsoever and she literally supports him.After those things happening i started to isolate myself and entire summer break before my 12th birthday i didn't go outside and i was sleeping once in two days.After the summer break is over i developed DOD and i started to faint at the school because of it.They put me in the hospital for 1 month and checked me as the last thing they made me visit the local psychiatrist,i was diagnosed with ptsd and i started to take antidepressants.Half year later i wasnt capable of leaving my home so my mother called they psychiatrist and then she ordered for me to come to the hospital.I was there for one day and at the other they drove me to psychiatric ward for children very far from my home where i stayed for 3 months after ive left they put me to childcentre until my father was done at the rehab.Then i had the choice to choose if i want to return to my old home or i want to live with my mother in a flat.As an child with alot of friends i didnt want to leave them so i chose to return back home.And from there it went downhill,year after  that i had anorexia,then bulimia and binge eating disorder i started to harm myself and my mental health went completely downhill and my father returned to drinking.As now i am 17 and my mental health is still very not stable but thanks to my loving boyfriend that was my personal therapist for past 2 years i improved atleast a little bit.But i have a big problem that i cannot move on,i cannot think besides my trauma and my traumatic experience and i extremely self sabotage myself,i think i will stay like this forever i am chronic catastrophiser and i fear literally everything. I am planning to move to the school hostel after my 18th birthday but my mother is guilttripping me for leaving her with my father,that this entire thing was my fault because i was born,that she wasted her life in this hell to take care of me and this hell has gotten worse because i chose to return home instead to move to that flat.And i dont know what to do,my mind is completely stuck i want to leave to save myself but aswell i feel bad for my mother but i have no way of helping her to get away from this house.I feel like im still only 12,my mind got stuck at the year where the trauma got worse and i cannot function as normal person i cannot sleep well and then i have problem in waking up early,i cannot find an therapist because my mother taught me that asking for help is shameful and having mental problems is shameful and i should never reveal them..im sorry that it is so long but im looking forward to your responses."
don't know if I have CPTSD but it seems a good place to post to,1,mjv1om,1,"and I've been thinking a lot about stuff that happened in my youth. Every time I do that it makes me want to cry. Also that voice in my head saying I'm exaggerating and then trying to think about other's childhood, trying to convince myself mine was different and not normal..  thoughts like ""what did the girls in my highschool did by then? Did they experience the same shit I did? like being in the street all day, hanging out with bad people, even rapists? Is that normal? Having a devastated home?""

And then I think it all boiles down to my need to be acknowledged, that people acknowledge the pain I've been through.. I believe the only remedy though is me recognizing the amount of shit i've been through and being compassionate towards my anger and sadness. It's the only thing that can help as there is no one really that hasn't been through some shit.. I tell myself I need to remember that pain is something we all have in mutual.

But what is the difference between regular stuff, or normative stuff, and abusive, scarring stuff? What portion of the emotions and anxiety I experience is ""normal"" and what stems from past trauma? And how can I get closure? I truly want to remember everything that happened to have this closure. I'm upset I can't remember and I don't know if I should try to write and remember more to face these past events. Is this something people do? Is it worth it? kind responses are much appreciated.

Btw, I'm a 29 yo female, have been in therapy for 3 years now, had Anorexia and have OCD which i'm sure is a cause of a bunch of traumatic events, taking a small amount of medication and smoke herb regularly.

Thank you"
"DAE go back to songs you used to like when you were younger and realize the lyrics hit the nail right on the head for how you felt, but you couldn't recognize it then?",1120,mjuyvl,256,"i was a teenager in the late 2000s/early 2010s and was really into all the emo/post-hardcore/metalcore/pop-punk bands. i've been listening to a bunch of my old favorite songs recently and realized all the lyrics are quite literally how i felt about things but could not express, especially taking back sunday lyrics (i cried uncontrollably when i heard the song ""my blue heaven"" again).

weird how even when we are completely unaware of our cptsd and ongoing trauma (or at least it doesn't register as trauma), our brains still somehow *know*.

edit: wow, did not expect this passing thought to resonate with so many of you. thank you for the awards and song recommendations! I hope you all are having a great day and hanging in there (I know I'm trying)."
"Struggling tonight to get some sleep, could use some advice.",3,mjupht,7,"Currently seeking a therapist after uncovering some distressing memories from childhood (and being reliably told by a witness of distressing/traumatic events that I have dates for but cannot remember at all despite the events being significant). Identifying a lot with cptsd symptoms and patterns but I've been unable to afford a therapist currently.

One of the biggest struggles I'm having currently is excessive ruminating/spiraling, especially at night before bed. I've tried every coping mechanism I can think of from previous therapy but nothing seems to help me settle. 

Can anyone offer any advice/tricks/coping tools that have helped them? My poor sleep patterns (not helped by my very late [3am] work nights) are definitely worsening my mental health and quality of life. 

Thank you in advance~"
"What do you do to process/snap out of those days where you're just completely numb, empty and depressed?",18,mjuejm,10,"I've already wasted sooo much time on just letting those days pass because nothing seems to work to get me out of this emotional state whilst I'm in it.

(I also exercise and I'm on anti-depressants)"
Coming to terms with the true extent of my trauma for the first time. I don't know who I am anymore.,13,mjsnjv,1,"I have always had issues connecting to others and trusting them. Even those I care about, I'm constantly afraid that they'll betray me in the future. I'm always thinking about scenarios in which they try to slander me, hurt me, or tell everyone about my trauma. It's hard for me to be open, and when I am, I immediately regret it. Now this person has something to use against me.

The worst part is that I can't tell anyone about this, either. How would my friends and family feel if they knew I couldn't trust them and was always questioning their intentions? I feel like everyone is trying to hurt me. Everyone. I try to act like I'm fine, but I know me having friends that care about me is too good to be true. And some of these friends, who I've known for years, have seen me at my worst. They've seen me as a cringy, angsty teenager. They've seen me make mistakes, lash out, have mental breakdowns, and attempt suicide. They've seen me back when I was much more reactionary and emotional and I'm terrified that one day that they'll tell everyone what a horrible person I really am. And I'll deserve it, because I am a horrible person. That will be the only version of me people will remember. 

Even admitting feeling this way is hard. I feel like it makes me inherently guilty of something. I think I'm a bad person, and not in a self pitying way. I try asking myself, ""Why would your friends hurt you?"" And the answer is always, ""Because you're a bad, toxic person, you make everyone around you miserable and everyone should know about it."" When I try finding specific instances of me being a toxic person, I think of a few social missteps I made during adolescence, as well as friendships I've ended during mental breakdowns (thinking they're better off without me and ghosting them - and now I'm terrified they're out for revenge), but nothing beyond that. And then I think, ""Youre lying, you're more toxic than that. You're just trying to manipulate everyone into thinking you're innocent."" I start to panic and question whether or not I'm actually manipulative or if it's all in my head.

I can't tell if my perception of myself is distorted by CPTSD or if I really am an awful person. I don't like hurting people and I always try my best to support my friends, because it makes me happy to see others happy. But do I really feel that way, or am I just manipulating myself and others into believing that? I don't know anymore. I feel like I deserve the bad things that happen to me, and that I'm completely unworthy of love, empathy, and forgiveness. How do you admit something like that to someone, unironically? I'm so ashamed and embarrassed. How do you even begin to heal from feeling that way all the time?"
Weird to think this is life now,1,mjtvtp,3,"This is how it’ll be for now. This is what I’m at for survival, and it’s bizarre. 

Each blow stripped me more and more of who I thought I was and I have the bones left. Almost literally, anorexia-bulimia permeate my life intensely as my way of control. 

There’s no return, no going back, no use once it’s gone. Child-like naivety was so nice. 

In a way, this is a gift. I see the ways that humans interact with one another when it comes to love, pain, hurt, curiosity and I can anticipate a lot. This is how I stay safe. 

And without being incredibly tuned into the people around me, I’d lose my mind 

Healthy? Nnnnnnnope

But I mean I didn’t die from any of that, right? I’m still here, even if how much is left could be up for debate

So I don’t know. I’m going to do what I can with my brain, my mind, my world. It’s so lonely but it’s mine."
"An adult screaming “I will not accept unacceptable behavior” at you, isn’t what AA intended",154,mjtpvx,42,"Just in case anyone else needed to hear this today. 

My fam was lead by my recovering alcoholic father, who has been sober but not healthy for my existence. His sobriety was constantly talked about and lauded, as he regularly spun off into violent rages. My mom was a regular at al anon. I think they’re both narcissists? 

Neither seemed to really apply the ideology to themselves, but boy did they sure feel good about using those “healthy” tools to keep us in line. 

Lately it’s all been clicking together - the ways they held themselves up as wonderful, dedicated parents. How “difficult” of a child I was (insert eye roll here). I look back and I see four children sitting around the dinner table, two of them adult sized and terrorizing the smaller ones. 

I love you guys, thanks for all the brave lessons you share on this dark journey - I know myself so much better for seeing the intimate parts of you <3"
DAE just kinda wants to watch everything fall apart and burn?,73,mjtgn5,10,"Not everything is related to my traumatic experiences, at least not directly. But does anyone else just feels so vulnerable and under attack like... Constantly. And it's overwhelming and depressing. Much of my trauma does come from deep social and cultural issues. I guess that's the case of the majority of people here. It wasn't an isolated traumatic experience or two. It runs deep and. That's why I'm posting this here. It has to do with cultural trauma.

I don't want to get into details, but this has to do with a few things. One being politics, and I'm just watching my civil rights under threat, my security, even my privacy. There's really nothing I can do about it besides watching people yell ""fake news"" and worry about irrelevant things.

Another thing is the loss of spaces where I used to feel safe and welcome, but now... They have become so toxic.

Everything seems to evolve into some sort of cult mentality. 

When did so many people became so stupid? When did logic, facts, science became offensive?

When did questioning something started meaning that you're offended because you're a snow flake?

At this point, I find the idea of the entire world simply collapsing in ways humanity has never seen before kinda comforting. The idea of near extinction sounds kinda good, for the sake of everything. 

If really is just what we see and there's no god, or if there's something big out there, humanity failed either way."
Is it too soon in my recovery to watch the tape,8,mjtfsz,6,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with C-PTSD 4 and a half years ago. My story is kind of complicated. I found out I have C-PTSD after I voluntarily commited myself,from having what I now understand were debilitating panic attacks and night terrors. I have sought therapy, but I quit going after two things happened, one my psychiatrist fell asleep during an appointment (pretty sure he was on tranquilizers) and then a few months later I ended up finding out he was going to prison for insurance fraud.The whole thing turned me off to therapy and for the past 3.5 years I've been self medicating with alcohol. I'm on day 12 sober and I am without a doubt an alcoholic. Recently I just so happened to meet a lady in the program I am in and she recognized my name. She worked with a lady who interviewed me when I was 3 years old. My meth addict of a Dad was molesting me and this lady was trying to get me to elaborate further so my Nana could press charges and throw my Dad in prison. Any ways the lady in the program told me I could watch the tape if I asked for my records to be pulled. I know ya'll aren't experts but I need advice do ya'll think its too soon for me to watch these tapes? I know trauma leads to substance abuse and the not remembering  a lot of what happened eats me up inside. I feel like I have a hole inside me and I keep filling it up with all the wrong shit. I know I might not have some epiphany or even get answers,but now that I know there are tapes. I feel like this is the closest thing I can get to closure."
A deadline for healing,12,mjt94o,11,"My (24f) partner (29m), have been together for 7 years, wants to break up with me next year if I havent improve myself by then. 

We have a good relationship in general. We had bad periods and good, like all relations. 
Ever since I know him I have been doing better. I started work, quit the work because I got triggered, recovered for 2 years (so 2 years workless), then got a job again and we moved in together (bye bye abusers!) and then had a breakdown again, lost my job, now jobless for a little over 2 years again. I have no income. My partner pays for everything since two years. I slow him down in his dreams: buying a house, going on holidays.

Since january I had a giant breakdown over covid isolation and trauma that is linked to isolated feelings. I have had several panic attacks from january until february. Ever since february my doctor prescribed tranquilizers. Now I just cry instead of panicking all day and he cannot see me like this anymore. 
In 2-3 weeks I will be hospitilized for CBT treatment. The residential treatment is 12 weeks. The training is around 6-8 months. In total its a little less than a year.

My partner told me today he wants to be able to buy a house before his 35 so he told me if I don't improve after the hospital, he might break up with me. He will still be here for me but we wont be a couple anymore. 

This news devastated me. I understand his feelings though. I have been a very hard person to deal with due to my trauma.
I feel like a bad person now. I really want a future with him together yet I am still lingering in my past and the trauma's of the past are consuming me and demanding all my attention.

I don't know how to let go of the past. Everyone says it, but how do I actually manage to let it go?!
And I feel scared to let go of my trauma because I don't know who I am without it. I fear the future. I fear I wont be able to find myself and become my true self. I fear losing my partner. I fear my physical sensations. I fear my emotions. I fear other people. I fear being alone but I keep isolating myself and ending up alone. fear life itself!  

I fear dead. I fear my heart stopping suddenly or my brain crashing suddenly. Somehow I sometimes dream of being dead. I

I am so scared and lost. I want my abusers around me to feel some kind of ""home"". I know it's wrong, it's dead wrong! But I am so lost. I feel like a little child. I don't know how to adult. I fear being an adult. But I must become an adult in order to live my life. I am scared to be an adult. I want to be a little girl and get all the attention a child needs, no responsibilities, get all the help and support I need.

Am I beyond repair? I feel so broken and like an alien. Is my brain okay? What do I need to do to fix myself? Can it be done? Can I live a normal life?"
Some of the most dehibilitating trauma I've been through was emotional abuse at the hands of an emotionally immature parent.,44,mjt6sy,15,"HUGE **Trigger Warning** for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse.. The list goes on.

I have been fucking r*ped and groomed, drugged and taken advantage of. I have cared for people who in return beat me to within an inch of my life. I've had harsh corporal punishment used against me at the age 3 to 5 by someone who wasn't even a parent, just my mums boyfriend at the time. So many things, blatant abuses and fucked up situations I should of never of found myself in.

It all hurts. It all keeps me up at night. But yano what really messed me up? I mean *really* messed me up.... Having an emotionally immature dad. Growing up with a manipulative, insensitive, fragile ego'd man who would tear down his own children before admitting his own guilt or failures.

Nobody teaches you how to deal with that kinda thing. Nobody was there to tell me that I wasn't a messed up kid, that I wasn't ""emotionally blackmailing"" my dad at 13 years old, by cutting myself. Every horrible lie and fucking manipulated truth, the way it weighed me down like an anchor. I truly believed every word he said. I thought it was my fault. I thought I was ""too emotional"" and even manipulative for seeking his comfort and care. I couldn't speak out against him, or he'd blame it all on me, harass me with horrible messages, over and over again. The confusion and sadness I felt while he bombarded me with messages about how fucked up I was. That was my first experience of being gaslit, to my knowledge. At 13 by my fucking dad.

The people who r*ped me and drugged me, who groomed me and passed me round like a dirty sex doll, I know that they're bad and they're wrong. It is easy for me to categorise them as people who hurt me and would hurt me again. People who are bad and scary. Black and white. No in-between. But the emotions that come along when i think of my Dad are so far from that reality. There's no black and white. No bad and good. Just a huge fucking mess that's left me second guessing myself for my entire life. I will ALWAYS feel like I'm trying to manipulate someone if i ask for help. I will ALWAYS struggle to get the help I need. I will ALWAYS fucking hate myself and blame myself for the fuck ups in our relationship.

And now at 23, I am no contact and have been for years. Still to this day does he say bad things about me and I still can't contact half of my family because of him. How can a bloody man child do this much damage????"
I need help/advice. I have a serious conflict with my neighbors and my ptsd had become wrapped up in it,10,mjs8ro,3,"Short shory: 
My neighbors are antagonizing me so badly im triggered all the time; they pick on me until I snap. My trauma therapist wants to stop doing trauma work with me bc he said he can't do trauma therapy when I'm in a triggering, hostile environment. I'm at a loss and afraid to turn to the landlord or the cops.

Long story: 
Tonight at 2 AM my neighbors lashed out at me, slamming doors, kicking my wall, and yelling. They slammed the door a 2 ft section of plaster came down and kept it up for over a half hour. 

This has been happening for over 6 months, but this is the worst its been.

It all started during lockdown. My  walls are apartment very, very thin. I guess my neighbor's girlfriend herd me masterbaing  - its not like I was being loud, frankly I can hear have sex upstairs and just ignore it. Like insaid paper thin walls.

She flipped out and had her bf and his friends come to my door, pounding, calling me a pervert, a freak, a weirdo, etc. 

You see, when I was a child I was violently abused for masterbaing, and also raped, so this was a huge trigger. I ended up in a ball crying.

Since then ANY noise I make, they accuse me of doing something perverted and try to start a fight with me. I know it sounds crazy, but this is what's happening. Its a nightmare for me.

For the 6 + months since they have been trying to pick a fight with me. Calling me names, insulting me, slamming doors, refusing to lock the door (intentionally leaving it open bc I asked them to lock it) kick and stomping at my exterior apt walls. I tried to leave them a note, and they torn it into pieces. 

I've been trying to ignore it, but a few months ago I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't sleeping, I was triggered 100% of the time by them yelling, stomping, calling me names every other day.
They've continuously escalated their hatred toward me, calling me crazy, saying ""cuckoo, cuckoo!""

I'm not 100% innocent.  I've snapped at them and threatened them, cursed them out and slapped my door back at them. I try not to, but they get me so angry and triggered sometimes I get angry back. I struggle to sleep bc of them. I'm scared to run into them in the halls.

I've been too afraid to tell my landlord becasue I'm scared he'll think I'm crazy and side with the neighbors; he's kind of a slum lord, not very understanding. I'm scared to call the cops becasue they are so violent in my city. 

I'm in trauma therapy rn, via telehealth, but my therapist doesn't want to keep doing treatment becasue he says I'm in too triggering an environment  with the weekly antagonism I face and my apt isn't a safe space for therapy.

Im at such a loss and can't sleep. Idk what to do."
How to talk about or acknowledge when your flashback puts strain on your relationships (trying to make this a win!),2,mjrgt3,1,"So I’ve been working really, really, really hard for a long time in with myself and in my relationships to recognize my flashbacks, find constructive and clear ways to talk about them, and then move forward with trust/reduced inner critic voice. cause I really value the relationships I have now and I want them to stay healthy. 
Buuttttt This summer I went back to my childhood home,  where most of my trauma occurred, for an extended period of time and it’s taken me about six months to un-dissociate, come back to myself and re-recognize a lot of my own patterns. Basically to come out of like a 6 month flashback. I know there were some moments that were really tough on my chosen family and friends and i know my self neglect (physically, emotionally, hygienically- the whole 9 yards) has been pretty out of hand. Does anyone have any tips for acknowledging this in these relationships so they can move forward? I know a lot of that is just me course correcting and taking care of myself, recharging my batteries and reestablishing healthy boundaries. but I also know accountability is an important part of communication and valuing the other persons experience. And an important part of being honest with myself! But also- sometimes actions speak louder than words. Do I even need to talk about it, or just change?  

TL;DR 
I was emotionally triggered super hard for multiple months and it out a strain on my relationships. I want to support, listen to and respect my friends needs, goals, and ambition  more fully than I’ve been able to do in flashback mode. I want to hold myself accountable. Does this require conversations in those relationships, just a behavior change, or a little of both   (Depending on each relationship’s vibe)?"
is there still hope for me?,3,mjrbzt,3,"trigger warning for all types of child abuse, drug use, and poverty

so, i was abused from when i was baby up until i was fourteen. mainly my mom was hopped up on drugs most of the time so my step dad could get away with pretty much anything he wanted- there were few nights where i wasn't bribed into touching him just so i could finally eat something- i can't remember going to sleep without wondering if i would wake up to him on top of me

we didn't have a lot of money and we lived in a shitty little apartment where all of this occurred. he was also a narcissist and every conversation  was dominated by him, i never got to have my own opinion and if i tried to i'd be shut down instantly. i was neglected as well, as i was barely fed and wore the same clothes day after day, even to school. my parents never bothered with affection and never cared for my interests, and even made me sleep on their floor if i ever had a nightmare, rather than in bed with them. the only thing i ever remember getting from my parents that was remotely ""expensive"" was my ds, other than that they always found a way to be cheap with me, even on christmas and my birthday i would always be dissapointed. they made me feel guilty for wanting more from life, whenever i was provided almost no enrichment whatsoever- i had not a single family trip or expirience with these people. we barely got out of the apartment and i was stuck there most of the time. 

i got out of there and my mom didn't believe anything i told her about what he did to me, and she tried to make my blood family shun me for it. she made it seem like i wanted to tear our family apart, whenever i was just desperately trying to get her help.. but now that i'm older i'm starting to realize she probably never really loved me at all, not in the way that a mother should. she gave me less than the bare minimum and now, i get to deal with severe mommy issues on a regular basis.

i live in the same small town as them still and neither of them faced any legal consequence even after two years of me desperately trying to get justice. i gave up, because unfortunately the system is just not suited for survivors, and it was not helping me to heal at all.. i think it really hindered the process actually. please do not comment about me taking any legal action, because that's not what i'm looking for. i just want to feel better.

i feel so tired nowadays, i'm seventeen and i've barely progressed through recovery. i'm in a better home now and have been since i was fourteen, but i'm terrified that i may not be able to progress in life in general because of this massive weight on my shoulders. i have to graduate late because of this too, because my focus is so thrown off that even the smallest assignment exhausts me. it takes hours sometimes to do them, and i just.. cant.

i haven't been able to talk about anything specific to any therapist or anyone in general without choking up and hesitating, and i've only ever told one person any specifics. i cant even remember most of it because i was so hungry and tired and dissociated all of the time that it's all just so blurry..

i got into using drugs to numb my pain recently, however i got caught and now i'm suffering with withdrawal as well, which really sucks honestly, i feel somewhat worse than before i started using and i regret it. but i just feel so helpless that i didn't know what else to turn to- i have support people but as i said i've rarely spoken about any of this to any of them, and i don't know how i could now because i'm so secluded that i barely even talk to them anymore..

is there still hope for me? am i a lost cause? can i really heal from fourteen years of repetitive, daily child abuse?"
Just Tired,1,mjqw2c,8,"I don't know anymore, man.  I've gotten to the point where I feel completely hollowed out, apathetic, expecting only the worst.  Decades of relentless childhood abuse and constant reminders that my abusers might find me again and show up unannounced.  No feelings of safety anywhere.  No money to afford a place of my own.  No job from poor people skills and too depressed to keep searching.  Dozens of lost ""friends"" who spread rumors, betrayed my trust, manipulated me in ways that damaged me forever.  Laying in constant fear of even the slightest movement outside or the sound from the apartment above like someone is going to come break through my door.  I'm not sure if I'm just naturally unlucky or cursed to have a shitty life.  Even if something good happens, it never lasts.  Seeing the way the world is slowly growing worse through idiotic teenagers on the internet screaming at each other without a shred of empathy doesn't help, but even after cutting social media from my life, I can't ignore that these kinds of people, all too similar to my abusers, are growing in number.  

I fucking hate this world.  And being forced to be alive is a never-ending torment.  I once heard a former therapist, current psychology professor say that too much trauma is irreparable.  He said it with such apathy that I wondered if it were really true.  Is my brain so badly fucked that I'll never get to experience the elusive thing people call happiness?  Is it only downwards from here?  As a society, I don't see much changing for the better.  And that only makes me more inclined to close my eyes and never wake up."
"I had a ""set back"" recently which has brought back so many feelings and thoughts that I realize I'm not as far in my recovery as I thought/would like.",3,mjqiek,8,"(update below post :-))  


It's okay and I'm using the weekend to ground myself into the present. It's working and I am so grateful. Life is good right now and I am doing the best I have ever done.  My set back was really an emotional flashback and I was triggered by someone I really look up to.

But damn, did I get thrown through a loop and did I start digging up the past to help explain my intense reaction to a normal conversation.  I think I figured it out but then I was left with some feelings of guilt (over my reaction) and sadness (for all that I have been through).

The triggering event was a critique I got on an assignment that I worked very hard on.  The past includes lots of emotional abuse and neglect.  So many times I was made to feel like I wasn't good enough but I got through it because my emotions were shut off.  Fast forward to the present, I feel.  I feel good, mostly.  I was so surprised when I felt so hurt and betrayed with the feedback and how quickly I abandoned my own critique of how I did well and how intensely I focused on the negative points.  It scared me that a kind, nice person that I look up to was able to trigger such awful feelings of inadequacy from within.  I feel bad for making them feel like they did something wrong when it was the abuse I endured and how I'm not completely ""over"" it and how I'm still working on healing.

I've worked hard in therapy to get to where I am now and WHAM. Not a slap in the face but hit by a truck. Now I know why I was nervous about the assignment -- it made me so vulnerable.  By the way, it was a presentation.  After years of getting picked apart by my parents, but my dad was worse, I still am so insecure.  I try not to be, I try to build myself up, I try to be kind to myself, and I am still successful (in general)... but this. this was so hard.  Even though I did well, I only heard negative comments.. I felt myself going to a negative place and asked for reassurance.  Reassurance came in the form of annoyance.  This person had NO CLUE what I've been through and didn't realize how much that would sting.

I hide so much.  I want to be ""normal.""  I don't want my past to haunt me nor hold me back. I don't want to dig through the past to explain why I am this way today. I want to be able to receive criticism knowing that I still did a great job and the criticism isn't about being inadequate but a way to be better although not completely necessary because if I gave the same presentation again it would still be good.

When I explained, they were kind.  They asked how they could help. They were truly understanding (as much as they could be) and they honestly tried.  This is not how my parents would have handled being confronted with ACTUAL abuse.  I have always tried to go and figure this out on my own (possibly to my own determent) .  They thanked me for sharing information and brainstormed ways to work with me in the future.

I am fortunate and grateful I am in this place today... and I'm adult who can feel and reflect on their own emotions.  I can have open and honest conversations with people who are not abusive.  I am closer to my goals than ever.  I am doing so well and I only continue to grow and become more loving toward myself.  I will get there.  This was a reminder that I can be more kind to myself especially when I'm in a vulnerable situation.  


\*\*UPDATE\*\*    
After ruminating but keeping afloat with grounding.. through questioning my every interaction with everyone since childhood (okay, not really -- but close) over the weekend, I had a scheduled therapy appointment today and OMG I feel so much better.  Not quite 100% yet bc I still feel a little embarrassed about getting triggered in the 1st place but it was a really good appointment with my therapist.  

Therapist agreed that it brought back so many feelings from childhood and she pointed out that I look up to this person like the father I never had but needed.    


I feel much less sad about the emotional abuse from childhood when I realized just how fucked up my dad was, how he blamed me for his shortcomings, how he never owned his shit, and how he abused my mom(his 2nd wife), his 1st wife, stalked a young woman, but yet made himself out to be some great amazing guy that everyone else loved (even my brother I grew up with thinks he was the most amazing person on the planet).    


When I think about how awful my dad was in general, I realize just how innocent I was.  My therapist asked if I thought about writing a letter to the younger versions of myself about how we're doing okay and we've come a long way and that we're safe now... it made me tear up.  To think that I could let my younger self know that she isn't alone made me realize just how alone I felt then.  There is so much pain packed away here.  


Up until now, I've focused on my dad's episodes of psychosis and how frightening it was to be in his care during those times.  Now, I realize that the lasting pain I feel today is less about a handful of instances where he was off his medication, but the majority of the time when he was picking me apart and convincing me I was to blame for his negative and abusive treatment toward me and that I would never be good enough.  


I am happy to say that today turned out pretty good.  I have work to do on myself but I want to stop the cycle of my dad's abuse so much.  I don't want him to haunt me -- he's done enough damage.  I'm ready to face the world unhinged from my shitass dad, lol, and I deserve to be free from the inadequacy he instilled upon me.

What I realized getting a pedicure for the first time,103,mjqflj,17,"For the first time in my life a few days ago, I got a pedicure.

I’m a woman by the way, but I was never taught self-care by my parents. No matter how I dressed or presented myself, I was always their ugly daughter.

I was also always worried about surviving so I never focused much on beautifying myself. I thought it was a useless thing to worry about because I was preoccupied with making money so I could survive on my own.

As an adult woman, I’ve picked up a few beauty skills but I have still have so much to learn.

When we started the pedicure, I realized that it was a foreign experience for me because I wasn’t used to being the one getting care and being focused on.

Having someone cater to me and carefully clean me
up nicely was so alien. I noticed I had a little bit of anxiety, but I’ve learned to become more comfortable with myself recently and it wasn’t awkward at all.

It was a nice experience and it encouraged me to start doing nicer things for myself like that. I always considered it a luxury but once in a while is nice.

Being gentle and kind with myself, pampering myself and treating myself, celebrating myself...

It’s a good thing. It’s not something to be ashamed about."
Dissociating and trying to take the other person's perspective during social situations...? (Fawning and people-pleasing),7,mjpxbk,2,"I've realized this is something I do, I think I've done it most of my life, and it's kinda horrifying. 

A lot of the time when I talk to someone, it's like I can feel my attention changing in a way where I start almost observing myself somewhat in 3rd person. Especially if I've been alone and relaxes and then go to talk to someone, it's like I tense up and can feel the sudden shift. My focus shifts, and rather than being able to just be me and focus on my thoughts, I'm literally trying to figure out what I think they're thinking and how they'd want me to be, and ofen end up acting that way. I'm spending most of my brain power trying to figure out what the person thinks and what they're thinking of me, and sometimes my brain takes the thoughts as fact even if they might be inaccurate. 

The reason it's so horrifying is because it's like it  shows part of how I feel like I don't get to exist in the world as my own person. It happens so naturally to me around people. It's like the 1st person view, my sense of myself as an independent existing person and everything is just suddenly swept out from under me like a rug. Most of my own thoughts leave my mind, and I'm trying to act like this little puppet and please the other person. If I try to fight it, try to be myself and just not think about this at all... well, at times it's just impossible to do, and it feels so intensely anxiety-inducing that I have to dissociate and people-please again to keep from going crazy with anxiety. 

I don't know whether this is a people-pleasing, fawning type think, or whether it's masking (from ASD), or what.

Does anyone else do this?"
Just realized I’ve been raped multiple times when I could not remember,31,mjp96a,1,"It started when I was really young, like my earliest memories are from when I was 2 with this babysitter. Over two decades later, I just put it together that she was making diaper porn of me and doing stuff I don’t remember in bed. 

Now I’m realizing multiple people since, including my ex I dated for several years, have drugged me, raped me and filmed me. They would not have done it when I was conscious because I would have fought back. Now it’s too late. 

When this first came up (my friends told me they were raped in the house I was living in and I stood up for them, resulting in a ton of bullying), I thought my trauma was secondary. I think my brain was protecting itself because it was too painful to think my ex would have done that. 

I had a breakdown and went to the psych ward. I am almost certain I was raped there too when I was restrained because they drug you hard and take you to a private room, and I just woke up feeling different. 

I lost some time to psychiatric trauma and forced medications. I think because my abuse started so young it made my family resent me on some level because my mother is super narcissistic and neglectful and treats me totally different from my sister. They are incapable of giving me the support I need, and I was the one who initially brought myself to the psych ward. 

It happened again very recently but in a way I’m glad because I did not deeply trust the people who did it this time, and it made me realize what happened in the past. 

But I am so terrified and isolated and I do not know what to do about it. I can’t believe how many times I’ve been violated, and I hate that I will never really know the extent. 

I’ve been treated like I was insane, but all I’ve ever known is abuse. My mother set me up to get in abusive situations by mistreating me my whole life and financially abusing me (she literally starved me). And then I was drugged and raped by people I thought I could trust. 

I don’t think I’m crazy but no one can deal with my life. I am so alone and scared of everything. Trauma has prevented me from doing the things I want, and I don’t know who I can trust."
you ever have nights where you just want to vomit your entire life's trauma,85,mjpb4q,22,tonight's one of those nights. i can't stop typing out and deleting all these thoughts. holy fuck
"DAE ""make up"" personalities in your head to deal with abuse",50,mjozkp,20,"I remember I would conjure up another personality to take some of the verbal abuse I received. When it happened, my world would get blurry, I felt very spacey, and sometimes my body lightly sways. I would imagine up a tougher, more hardened version of myself to receive trauma, and I would imagine they would be there in my body while I watched from the sidelines. I (?) would think ""I have to keep (my name) safe, this is my job, I have to do this."" They would also sometimes offer comfort to me when I was upset. But only sometimes.  
Does anyone else experience this as well?"
I'm in a flashback because of my counselor,14,mjotxv,10,"I tried to come out as lesbian to her and told her I would have to hookup w a woman and she (knowing I have religious trauma that we have recently worked with where I was shamed for my very being and sexuality), told me that she thought I was just confused. She stopped me from continuing what I was reading to her and said ""I've heard enough. You can stop."" 

Shes literally told me ""it's okay to make mistakes and explore"" and now that I was wanting to try to be with a woman as a hookup, she told me I might be confused from my trauma which is sexual. I told her I understood where she was coming from but that I felt so much lighter and freer and I had been so much happier since coming to terms with this. We talked in circles for about a half hour. 

She asked me, ""Do you value your body?"" I was like ""what?"" She was like ""do you value your body or find it sacred?"" I was like ""not really. It does what I want"" 

She was getting mad at me for wanting to explore and j was getting pissed off. We had JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW I SHUT DOWN AND GOT TALKED TO FOR AN HOUR BY MY DAD WHEN I NEEDED SOEMTHING. then I brought this up, that I needed her to hear, and got shut down again.

I feel so hurt. So invalidated. And so sad.. I've been with her for 3 years and I am in absolute fear mode right now. Shes the only person I have and now I'm shutting down and it feels like theres no one there for me. I already feel myself shutting down. I want to kill myself. I'm in a flashback. I have a job orientation coming up and I'm PISSED AT HER FOR FUCKING PUTTING ME IN A FLASHBACK. SHE OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD NOW HOW FUCKING FRAGILE OF A STATE IT IS TO BE IN WHEN YOU HAVE CPTSD. FUCK HER I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER. I WANT TO HURT HER AND CUSS HER OUT (Just anger but I'm pissed) this all hurts so bad."

Ruminating on CSA memories,1,mjo7qi,1,"I have put really bad memories of what would be considered CSA in the back of my mind for years now. My dad didn't give me any privacy as a kid, frequently walked in on me (and my sister), and violated my bodily autonomy by not allowing me to perform basic hygiene myself. Off and on through my life I've questioned whether or not this was CSA, felt very uncomfortable for a few weeks, ignored my dad or limited contact, then went back to talking to him. But this time... I had a long talk with my sister that put a lot of pieces of the puzzle together and I was reminded of things, and had my experiences validated, and confirmed that yes those experiences were NOT okay, and instead of maybe him doing those things to me without knowing what right from wrong, maybe he did them intentionally to me. And by having that discussion with someone else instead of just in my mind and thoughts, it has made me even more uncomfortable that I am not sure I can ever go back again to having a relationship with him. Bringing myself to believe that what happened to me was some sick fantasy to fulfill sexual desires just makes me feel disgusting. I'm very confused on how to handle a future relationship with him, after a long period of time where seemingly nothing was wrong. Can anyone else relate?"
Was reminded of the where to turn for grounding. Writing.,2,mjo2cx,1,"The rise of the sun,
the setting moon bring me home,
home to reality. 
Grounding when falling into the abyss. 
Reality falling from the face of the earth. 
This mind melts from this shell of a body.
Would follow the sun for a million years to bring this body home to their peace. 
A friend, family of home where there is none. 
Could stay in their presence for the rest of eternity, only for time to move forward, 
the day moving forward, until we meet again in another morning, 
saying our hellos once more. 
The sun and moon reminding this body and mind the home and safe place it longs for. 
Reminding this shell of a body it's more 
and it's ok to be less."

Body flashbacks,2,mjn2jn,4,"Recently I've been experiencing a lot of body flashbacks/sensory flashbacks of one of my sexual assaults.

We lived in the same house, we ate meals together, we were in the same therapy group. It's scary that someone who was out of treatment and looked like she was doing so well, just boom gone. It scares me because I thought I would never attempt again after that treatment program, but just a few weeks ago, I was close to attempting. It just is so fucking sad that like an alcoholic will always fight their addiction, me and the women I went to treatment will have to fight the urge to self-harm and attempt suicide.

"TW- starting to get suicidal thoughts again, I think",6,mjml36,3,"Hello all, hope you are doing well :)   

I am currently not in a good head space right now. About two months ago I had some pretty bad suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. Ever since then, I went to an inpatient facility and got on some medication for depression, and the suicidal thoughts went away.

Now, it's been roughly a month since I was admitted there, and I think I'm starting to get them again. I'm not actively thinking of them, nor do I want to do it or have a plan for it. However, my interest and attention towards suicide have recently increased, and I sometimes get intrusive thoughts of when I used to have those suicidal thoughts. 

I am not certain what I aim to accomplish with this post. I am trying some coping methods, like listening to music, going outside, exercise, reading, etc. However, they haven't really been helping. I think the only way things will change soon is if I were somehow able to drop everything and go somewhere else, preferably a place that is full of nature. Albeit, it is not possible for me at the moment.

If any of you have any advice for coping with them, I would appreciate it. I don't really respond well for some reason to sentimental posts or posts of encouragement. Not that I want to, of course, but it would seem as if my mental faculties, while capable of processing them on an empirical level, simply cannot internalize them, so they kind of just go overboard.

Thanks once again for any help, my friends! I hope you yourselves heal well in this crazy, short, and chaotic time and space we call life :)"
Is anybody else not really career-driven?,17,mjm6yb,9,"All my life, I've been a pretty good student and I would say that I'm pretty damn good at math. I love learning, too. Despite this, I never really had a huge interest in scoring an interesting or well-paying job. I'm currently in college to become a math teacher because I want to build up my social skills and have people to talk to everyday, when I could've gone for more mathematically challenging jobs like computer science, engineering, medical field, etc. I feel as though I may have ""wasted"" some of my potential, but at the same time, I don't really care, at least not at this time in my life. Hell, I'm even fine with the idea of working a generic boring office job, as long as it pays the rent.

How does this relate to my childhood? Well, like almost all of us, I've always had a terrible home life, a terrible/nonexistent social life, and low self esteem. I want to have better self esteem, a good social life, and a good home environment (aka my own apartment) more than ANYTHING in the entire world, which puts my career on the back burner.

I've spent my fair share of time working a mundane job at a movie theater. This job was almost NEVER the cause of my emotional distress. If anything, it was a nice escape from my problems. My poor mental health has ALWAYS had to do with my poor self-esteem and personal life. Obviously, if you're working a terrible job that's affecting your mental health, you should try and find a better place to work ASAP, but what I'm saying is that for me personally, working an uninteresting (but not necessarily bad) job doesn't seem to be the problem here.

Maybe once my personal life DOES improve, my desire for a more fulfilling career will grow, but for now, I could care less about where I work because there are other things in life that I want way more than that.

Anybody else feel this way?"
Anger Meltdowns with CPTSD?,7,mjm5oy,2,"Trigger warning: self harm, suicide 

I'm in need of advice. I don't know if this is something others with CPTSD deal with or if this is just some other issue I have separate. 

I don't get angry very often, at least not angry enough to let it manifest into anything. But slowly over time, I seem to build up this anger and finally something small ""sets me off"" and I have what I think is a small anger meltdown?

My brain turns off. I'm numb. I just sit in one place and stare into nothingness for about 5-10 minutes. I isolate myself completely. I start thinking of ways I can self harm, which is something I have a history of. I start thinking about suicide. 

Then I began to cry, throw things, break things, etc. but only for about 10 minutes. Then it's over finally. Then I kind of feel numb again. 

Can anyone relate to this? I feel lost. I'm just now realizing this is a pattern."
I don’t know if I have CPTSD (I can’t think of any specific trauma) but I have a ton of emotional issues,3,mjlzh2,2,"I don’t know if this is the right sub, I’ve never been diagnosed with CPTSD and I don’t have any memories of any trauma, but it’s been kind of suggested by a therapist that I might, I just never explored it. I don’t even understand it too well or know the symptoms...but I’ve been feeling like crying all the time lately and I want to hit myself so bad because of it. I never ever talk about my own self harm but that’s what I’m feeling right now and I hate it. I just smoke weed all day to numb as much emotion as I can because I get crazy overwhelmed. Relationships are something I just laugh at now cause it’s impossible at this point, I don’t even try because there’s so many thoughts and emotions going on"
I never got to be a kid,16,mjlwmn,4,"I recently turned 15, and all I wish is that I can turn back time. I remember being punched and slapped if I made a mistake on the piano, and my parents making me skip dinner if I didn't win at a competition. I remember having to play with sprained pinky's during a competition because ""it was my fault I broke them right before an important competition."" While this was happening to me, my friends were hanging out at malls, going to each other's houses, playing outside after school. I remember going to school the next day and hearing about how much fun they had at sleepovers while I had to pull an all-nighter to practice piano.

My parents forced me to do piano since I was so young, (I guess it's an asian parent's thing) and it's all I have memories of. Just practicing until I fell asleep at the piano. Being woken up at 3-4 am to practice again. Being told I was lazy if I wanted to sleep in or play with friends or have fun like the other kids.

I just want to turn back time. Some people say ""I want to go back to when I was a kid and experience it again"" but I don't have any memories. But I want to try it once. I want to go shopping with my friends, have sleepovers after school, things like that. I don't want to feel left out whenever my friends talked about how much fun they had that weekend. I feel like I was never a kid, I just kinda skipped past that stage."
DAE feel like their life is in danger when they have a flashback? Or that someone is trying to hurt you?,41,mjlqe2,13,Sometimes when I get a strong flashback I become convinced that I literally need to hide for my life. I go into a closet or under a bed and if anyone comes looking for me I can't speak because some part of me is convinced that if they find me they will kill me. Is this a normal flashback? Why do I get this feeling? It is the most paralyzing and terrifying experience and I don't know how to break free when I fall into that mode.
"Always feeling unsafe, no matter where I am. [TW: Scary/Stalking/Abuse]",15,mjlfks,7,"So, this is the year where I went no contact with my father for 10 years. Yay! But I got triggered by something (my own fault), because morbid curiosity got to me. This might be a bit jumbled, because I'm really tired.


I never feel safe, anywhere. In my own house I constantly have nightmares and intrusive thoughts about what scary people can do to me. And I wanted to vent a little bit about this.


My father was (is) a very controlling man and he went crazy lengths to limit the amount of outside contact we had. He stalked me whenever I was gone from home, but also within our home. When I was at school or at a friend's house, he'd follow me secretly to check if I'm actually still there. He'd stand outside the door, staring through the window of my bedroom door in the middle of the night (absolute nightmare fuel) and I have vague memories where he's standing in my room at night just staring at me. 


After my mom and I escaped, the stalking did not end. He'd monitor my school for years, hoping to kidnap me. Follow my mom around attempting to find our address. Patrolling the streets day and night just to find us. I had his license plate memorized, just in case I had to hide. He'd interrogate and threaten people that knew me or my mom to give him our address. He'd track down all my phone numbers and seemingly asked other criminals he knew of to track me down. He even had people at facilities that help abused women leak information about my mom and me. 


Once he found us, pulled me in his car and attempted to murder my mom and my sister by hitting their car at max speed. The only reason it failed, was because I jumped out of the car.


He stopped for a few years, until he one day randomly showed up at our front door when I still lived with my mom. Usually, I'd hide under the bed whenever he attempted to barge into our house. But this time, he saw me through the front window. He forced himself into our house and tried to touch my face. When I refused and told him to piss off because I'd call the police, his pupils dilated immediately and he attempted to attack me.


I never felt safe anywhere and I still don't till this day. Especially because police did absolutely nothing for us.


A few years ago, my father tried to bribe me with paying for a drivers license. He communicated via my mom and promised her he wouldn't seek contact. I was very apprehensive, but my mom said to take the opportunity because of financial reasons. Claiming she'd protect me from him. I quickly found out that he manipulated the driver's instructor to give him information about me, despite me strictly instructing them to NEVER give any details to him. It was a big mistake and I won't ever do that again. My mom also recognizes she made a big mistake and being absent from him for years, made her feel like she could protect me from him completely forgetting that he is genuinely insane. Realizing she had been manipulated into this as well.


I also found out that he has photos of me that he only could've gotten from immediate friends. I grew very paranoid, because all of them swore up and down not to have sent him any pictures.


And these are only my stories. He does the same to my sister. He used to stalk her at her job, allegedly mapping out where the surveillance cameras are, so he could avoid getting caught. The only reason he stopped, was because one of my sisters coworkers threatened to throw boiling oil over him.


My father is a master manipulator and a very scary individual. Police does absolutely nothing. I was watching documentaries about cult leaders and my father has always had a similar way of indoctrinating people. He starts out very nice and slowly physically and mentally abuses them more and more. He's very charismatic and manipulative. Almost every person I've known in my life that also had contact with him, betrayed me in one way or another. It's genuinely scary. Why is he allowed to walk around freely?


I never feel safe anywhere. My fear is not necessarily my father, but people like him. They're out there and that scares me. He isn't the only one."
"DAE get tired of living by the standards of the world, and actually allow yourself to just give- up?",14,mjldmu,10,"I’m tired of living by the demands and standards of graduate school. Life is too short, the pandemic has shown me that. School feels like a waste. I’d rather be happy than conforming constantly and working myself to death.

I have been bumping through PhD school now for a while, 3 years, and I have ideally 3 (maybe 4) years left. The expectation for everyone is to work around the clock, all weekend long is not something I want to do anymore.

I stopped myself from doing this for a while, because I decided my health was more important. But now, I am back to working at my two jobs, reading, and writing for PhD school 7 days a week. I had great weekend/ evening boundaries. Now it’s turned into only seeing my husband at night for a few hours to eat right before bed, and early evening to bed time on the weekends. 

The program said that we would be working through every weekend. I didn’t believe that was healthy, and decided to discontinue that practice as a disabled person, but I am again. I am also under a lot of external stressors, economic, as well as familial things going on right now, too. 

I often feel as if PhD school is not meant for people that have lived through things, and/ or come from backgrounds like mine (poor rural working class, QTPOC, disabled- adhd, chronic pain/ illness disorder, CPTSD). Especially with my program existing in NYC, a city with a culture of hyper production. The expectations are to constantly work, with no economic support, no healthcare provided by the school during a pandemic, working multiple jobs, and to  just keep regurgitating. I have two months left for this semester. Then one- two years of course work (depending on if I do full loads each semester), couple of dissertation years. So, almost halfway done. But it’s been a hard several years. My health and consistent tragedies in my life have resulted in them providing even less support, among other things.

But, I think I’m done. I haven’t been able to do my self- care in weeks. I can already tell a difference in how I feel. I was doing such a good job managing my self- care, listening to what my mind and body needed. Now I’m just focused on producing for everyone, and my needs have went to the side, again. The conditions feel fertile for a flare with the high levels of stress. 

I feel trapped in academia. The economy has tanked, there aren’t any jobs, all of my work is connecting to some sort of academic something, things that I know I should be grateful for, but they are several small ones, so it’s constant working for no money. I feel like I’m trapped in suspended in animation with the PhD hanging over my head. While also dealing with disrespect and being treated poorly by people in my department for not producing like everyone else does as rapidly.

I wanted this PhD, but not now, i am honestly not sure what I want to do with it. Be a tenured professor at an institution that will perpetuate a system of over- production and disavows the care of people like me that aren’t often in PhD programs (disabled, QTPOC, working class), and other marginalized communities?

Does anyone else ever just get tired or having to be this? To be this constantly producing this/ that/ the other or you aren’t enough? Do you ever just say “I don’t care this much” and walk away? And at what point? I can’t figure it out. I won’t get this work done by the end of the semester unless I work through every weekend to the end of May. That’s two long months of not taking care of me."
Anyone else have a negative emotional reaction to guided meditation?,49,mjlbxi,20,"A while back, my therapist sent me some guided meditation recordings, hoping they might help me. And I've read about the benefits of mindfulness meditation, and it seems like it should be a healthy practice. But as soon as I start listening to anything like that, it's like my anger switch flips on, and I want to punch the person whose voice I'm hearing.

""Close your eyes."" 

""You can't make me."" 

""Take a slow breath in, and hold it for three seconds."" 

""No! Shut up."" 

""Focus on tensing and relaxing each muscle in your body, starting with-"" 

""I refuse! !@#$ you!"" 

That's basically how it goes. Not very helpful after all...

I had a professor in university who had us meditate before exams, and I still occasionally get youtube ads for a meditation app, and every time it affects me the same way. I have no idea why. Does this happen to anyone else?"
This is still my life,6,mjl9r3,4,"I’ve been through too much in my life.

It was too much to put on one person. 

I still have to do this life thing, for no discernible fucking reason. I get to add almost trafficked by an insane and delusional misogynist incel redpill trust fund pig to the list. 

Survived physical abuse at the hands of countless adults through my childhood, as of now outlawed medical procedures and trauma, made it to adolescence with just a pediatrician’s diagnosis of depression that my family ignored for 2 years until my “depression” deteriorated enough to bypass all attempts at therapy and jump straight to medicating me out of the absurdity of my condition. Survived children’s residential treatment center and the troubled teen industry in my childhood, to go on to be raped a few times. Survived a physical abusive relationship with a pos and a bunch of polite dating of predatory men I didn’t even want to be talking to but I’m too attuned to how to fawn towards people who can’t take no for an answer. 

Of course I can survive human trafficking. Yeah, completely and seriously by myself with not a fucker in sight — has there ever been anyone there for me before? 

The place I am now though seems like the most appropriate hill to die on, though. 

Who would blame me if something awful were to happen now?"
Just screaming into the void.,9,mjku1l,5,I feel so alone and wrong and out of place. I wouldn't wish any of this on my worst enemy.
Why are every single one of my relationships so difficult?,3,mjkjqa,7,"That’s it. That’s the post. 

I can’t possibly be picking horrible partners every single time, can I? 

I’m so tired of fighting. So tired of the racing heart. So tired of wasting my entire day because I’m too exhausted from my emotions. So tired of missing my workouts and canceling plans. So tired of telling people at work that things are shit.

Tired is spending thousands a year on therapy and pain management. So tired of ruined holidays. 

It’s like we just make ourselves relive everything we already went through in our childhood. Do we do this subconsciously? 

I tried to pick a better partner this time, I really did. Am I the problem? 

This says vent as the tag but feel free to reply however you want."
Does anyone know any good self-confidence books/workbooks?,3,mjkjg9,2,"Anything that has worked for you is appreciated. 

I've been struggling for a long time, but recently things have been worse. 

Thank you for any help! ☺️"
Here’s why I don’t express myself to other people,17,mjk8ml,21,"What if I’m just being an asshole and getting angry over something dumb? Even if I were to express myself I don’t know how to verbalize how I feel without sounding like a dick or a robot reciting the therapy phrase “I feel x when y happens.” 
Like for example today, my friend forgot it was my birthday. I was upset about it but didn’t say anything because I felt self-important for even getting mad about it. So I was passive aggressive and quiet, which is lame also, I don’t want to be that way but I just *can’t* be direct and call people out without feeling intense shame. When he realized on his own he forgot and apologized I wanted to say “I was hoping you would’ve remembered” but then thought no, you’re just being a dramatic entitled asshole, he probably is just scatterbrained, it’s nbd. So I swallowed my anger and said nothing. 

This is a repeat root cause of a lot of relationship issues I’ve had. I don’t want to build up resentment for anyone but I just can’t seem to express any anger or hurt without feeling shitty about it. 

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you work around it?

Thank you in advance"
So so angry that my abuser got away with it,43,mjk078,10,"It just really really hurts, I lost most of my teen years, a relationship, several friendships and very nearly my fucking life more than once thanks to my abuser and yet she never got *any* sort of comeuppance for doing what she did not only to me as a kid but I recently found out other kids as well. She just got protected by the headmistress of my school cause they were both jesus freaks then ended up moving to another one and undoubtedly went on to abuse more kids. No comeuppance, no justice, no regrets on her part, nothing. 

And yet *I* have to deal with so much pain and hurt and anxiety and regret over lost years thanks to her and it's not fucking fair. Literally for want of a nail I could have had a normal stable life if only I'd been put in a different class in my school at the age of 5. It's something that little that changed so much of my life for the worse and I feel stupid even being upset over it as it sounds silly. And now I'm saddled with so much pent up anger and rage that has nowhere to go and it's not fair. I'm sorry for the ranting, I just needed to vent, I'll delete this if it's inappropriate."
I finally think I'm going to be okay!,15,mjjuvo,6,"I've been in counselling (for childhood SA) now for 14 weeks (1 hour a week) and up until literally this week I was starting to lose hope a bit and it didn't feel like it was going anywhere. Like I was finding it helpful to work through other childhood issues but not the the actual reason I was there.

Then I had a memory come back, which is the first time it's ever happened to me and it's essentially me telling someone for the second time that something was happening, I mulled it over for the entire week before I saw the counsellor again and gleaned all I could from it, or so I thought.

It was the longest and deepest discussion we've had to date and it was incredibly helpful. He helped me see the significance in trying to tell someone for the second time (first time went terribly, think lists of anger and no talking), that I mustn't have been happy or wanted it or been a willing participant if I tried to tell someone for the second time what was going out despite how the first time went.

For the first time ever I said the words ""maybe this means it wasn't my fault and I didn't want it, maybe I'm not bad"". While I know there's a maybe in there and I'm not at a stage where I could take that word out, it's the first time I've ever dared to think that and for the first time ever I actually think I have a chance to heal and move on properly from this.

It's very cliché, but I've felt a lightness in my chest since the session, and I've been able to make steps to talk to a friend how I've found the session and it's almost like the massive ball of shame I've carried since I was 5/7 (I'm 24 now) is finally getting a bit smaller and I honestly didn't believe I'd ever get here or that it would help this much.

Hope that all makes sense! I've just felt so positive about the progress this week and just feel like I could shout from the rooftops that maybe this is it, and maybe everything is gonna be okay."
"Didn’t go to my abusers baby shower, despite receiving abuse in the process of not going.",5,mjjtet,1,"My sister is one of my abusers. I still don’t have it in me to forgive her or just “forget” the things she’s done. I’ll also add she’s done absolutely nothing for me, and would probably skip my baby shower if I hypothetically ever had one (which I won’t). I resent the fact she’s being thrown this lavish fancy shower when in reality she’s the last person to have a baby, and it wouldn’t surprise me if the state takes it away, given how unfit she is to parent. Her child really doesn’t have a chance in this world. Plus I have no reason to be part of it anyways. Also with my severe anxiety, I can’t handle really overwhelming shit like that.

Of course, my mother is trying to make me out to be some awful person. When my dad finds out I didn’t go, he probably won’t help me pay for housing in the process of trying to move away from my abusive mother (he’ll claim I’m too mentally ill to live alone if I was too depressed to go to the baby shower). I’m going through a pretty bad heartbreak and literally can’t even get out of bed because I took an extra big sedative last night, on top of depression. I canceled plans with my best friend to do something tonight that’s actually at the very top of my bucket list and have been wanting to do for my whole life.. that’s how seriously bad off I am right now. Normally I wouldn’t miss that for anything. My anxiety is off the fucking charts, particularly from worrying about my fathers reaction and the way I’ll probably be punished. I hate this. Ugh :("
Tips for coping when hyper-vigilance is triggered?,13,mjje39,3,"Hi guys,

This is my first post. I am in therapy but obviously, with the long weekend, my therapist isn’t available until Tuesday (when we have our regular appointment anyhow). 

My hyper-vigilance surrounding death got triggered last night and today I am just completely drowning in that feeling one gets after experiencing trauma. (**TW: suicide**) A lot of my trauma comes from having found my mom mid-suicide attempt and saving her life, I only found her cause I got a “bad feeling” and went to check on her. Obviously this created years of hyper-vigilance, worsened by my OCD, and I’ve worked hard to overcome it. Last night that hyper-vigilance was triggered again, not regarding her but another even more dear loved one (my very old dog), and I’m a bit lost on how to cope, with no professionals to discuss tools with for a few days to come. Edit: I was able to overcome my past hyper-vigilance by processing the trauma that caused it — right now I’m so overwhelmed that I can’t even remember if I have any actual tools or strategies. 

I have some responsibilities and social obligations to attend to tonight and over the weekend. Does anyone have any tips for coping with an extreme sense of being triggered and hyper-vigilant?

Thanks so much 💖"
How do you make people understand your cptsd? What has worked for you?,49,mjjcam,8,"The past years have been heavy. I could never explain to people what was happening to me and how much I was hurting. Getting this diagnosis made me feel so good, because it explains everything. But I still struggle with feeling like I cant make people understand. I want my boyfriend to get what I am going through. I want my friends to get just the heaviness of this. Because I feel like I don't get the support I need. But I don't know how. I really dont know how.
Also I have always down played how badly I was suffering and now that I am finally admitting to the amount of pain and trying to explain, it feels like people wont believe me, because I seemed to be so okay for such a long time. But I just didn't have the words to communicate it yet and have sat through it without saying anything. I feel really lonely with this. I feel like I am carrying so much on my own. 

Whats your experience with this? Any ways that have worked well to express all of this?"
advice on letting something traumatic go? finding it hard to just look to the future and move on,3,mjj33i,4,had a bad experience recently and it's rattled me for months. I've talked about it ad nauseam - I explained the whole story to someone today again months later and honestly I feel like I just relived it all and I feel worse. How do you let something go and stop obsessing and bringing it into your future. It's making me feel a bit hopeless.
Fake Crushes: Did anyone else do this?,5,mjiw61,2,"I'm in my 30s and I figured out a long time ago that most of my crushes in my teens and early 20s were forced or fake. I would notice that a guy seemed fine and would probably be my type and just pretend that I liked him. I think I only had 3 genuine crushes until well into adulthood. 

I recently admitted this to my therapist and my husband. My husband was surprised-- and I assured him I actually liked him from the beginning, and it wasn't forced-- but my therapist and I had a really good discussion surrounding it.

I was sooooo shut down, that I couldn't really allow feelings. And then there is the vulnerability of allowing yourself to like someone.  Just spent a lot of time detached."
anyone else deal with nerve/rsi issues?,1,mjiluf,2,"ive been an artist my whole life but starting when i was like 15 i started to get carpal tunnel a lot, and recently ive had cubital tunnel syndrome/ulnar nerve issues for, like, 3 months straight now. it seems the worse my anxiety gets, the more persistent my rsi issues become."
Not sure if this symptom is correct but let's try anyway,1,mjijuz,1,"My bfs kid loves to be super personal with me and constantly gives me hugs nearly always right next to me if not on me. I just feel like I have to put on a happy face, but it's exhausting. Most days I try staying away in my own world, but it won't matter. I feel ambushed when she comes for hugs and today I nearly froze. 

I don't remember what happened when I was younger than 10, but dealing with kids has always been too much to handle for me because I have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any advice for getting used to children coming up for constant attention and hugs? I'm not a super touchy person unless it's my S.O. I try making sure I spend some time with her, but I can only do it for so long before the 9 million questions start getting on my nerves and I just don't have it in me to say anything that will make her sad."
DAE not really learn much about hygiene stuff from their parents?,691,mji4xn,160,"I've been learning that I don't really know much about hygiene and such because my parents hygiene is... Questionable, to say the least. I'm pretty sure the last year I lived with my parents I could count the number of times my mother bathed on one hand...

Like, I struggle to shower more than once every week or so, partly because I'm exhausted all the time and finding the motivation and such to do it is difficult, but when I do I find that there's shit I don't really know how to deal with. For example, I don't really know how to deal with having a bunch of dead skin, especially on my face and neck. 

And I don't really feel comfortable talking about things like this with people I know, since I often feel like I'm really disgusting to everyone else, and it's just embarrassing being around people a lot of the time even if they're totally unaware and I'm simply being paranoid over everything. (So I usually stay in my room most of the time...)"
My middle-school bully,2,mjhztp,5,"I recently, through a series of coincidences, reconnected with one of the boys who treated me so badly in middle school. I was a very shy, traumatized girl (from trouble at home) and the boys in my little group were merciless, teasing me about my weight and my crummy clothes, etc. We all went to the same school and church and dances. None of those boys would ever ask me to dance, which made me hate myself even more. My best friend was the cute girl, and I was the punchline of all the group's jokes. I know it's not like today's bullies who lure kids into the woods and kill them, but social exclusion is a form of bullying, and it left me feeling suicidal. So now I'm able to talk by text with this guy, and he totally remembers our shared childhood differently, like we all just hung around and had fun together. I told him that I didn't like myself much back then, and that I think I was picked on because I was so shy. He replied, ""But you overcame that! Good for you!""

So ... should I tell him that he was abusive to me back then? Would it help anything? Does he deserve to know, and if he apologized--I don't know that he would--would that help me feel better? I'm seriously ready to stop thinking about middle school, but here it is in my face again."
I hate people to feel sorry for me or worry about me.,27,mjhme2,10,"I know it’s a sign of people caring about me and just want to make show their empathy, but I find it pointless because it doesn’t help instead makes me feel bad like I’m a burden or something. 

Maybe I’m looking too deep into it but that’s how I feel about it. I had too many experiences with people who felt sorry for me to make me feel like I was inadequate or inferior.

Don’t  feel sorry for me instead help me. Sorry venting 😅"
I feel horrible,3,mjgvjr,3,"Using a throwaway account. Not sure how to even flair this. But this will be full of trigger warnings of various family abuse, dissociation, and minor drug use. 

Hello. I’m 24 F. I have ocd and gad. And just recently diagnosed by my therapist as having cptsd (or ptsd like symptoms). I’m at my wits end. I’ve been on Prozac in 2016-17 for mild depression. I wish I’d never taken it. It neither hurt nor helped. In 2018 I received the depo shot which flared up my dormant ocd that I never knew I had. Fucked up my hormones bad, got on Celexa. Once again never hurt nor helped. I never addressed my underlying mental health so that’s probably why. I gained a lot of weight and had zero interest in sex. Which sucks, because I’m in my first ever serious relationship. We’ve been dating since we were 21. Had another ocd flare up, figured out it was ocd in 2020. Got put on Wellbutrin to fix all of the other shit the SSRIs caused. It worked very well. Until I got covid in December of 2020. That’s when my life changed. I had an extremely mild case. I recovered well, so I thought. Until February. I had a massive panic attack at work. And I’ve never been the same since. I quick tapered/cold turkey the bupropion because we thought that might be agitating it. I was having panic attacks almost daily. I turned agoraphobic, which is unlike me. Doctor switched me over to Effexor to battle the panic attacks. I took one 37.5 mg dose and had an adverse reaction. Was told to come off of that. It should be noted, before the Effexor debacle I took a cbd gummy with thc in it. It was independently sourced. For reference, my pothead boyfriend and his friends can eat 4 and get high. I’m extremely sensitive to thc. I didn’t know either that you couldn’t really take cbd with bupropion. It was marketed to me as just cbd. I took it, got pretty bad body high. I thought I was going into psychosis. I remember everything about that night. How helpless I felt. How horrible I felt. How scared I was. I remember sobbing to my boyfriend and telling him that this set me back. Anyway, took the Effexor three days later and had that reaction. It scared me from ever taking meds again. I didn’t want to feel like that anymore. 

Everything triggers me into fight or flight it’s like it’s stuck. I went back to my family home and have pretty much become bed ridden. Dissociation has taken over my life. My family home isn’t ideal because it resurfaces unresolved child hood trauma. Especially considering my dad is a narcissist and my mother is extremely passive and doesn’t understand anxiety/mental health.  But I was scared to be alone, and being alone made me feel like I was going to lose control. I went to a cardiologist, am in a heart monitor for 14 days. I still need to find out my post covid issues. It’s apparent it’s long haul. I have to see a rheumatologist because my ANA came back positive which could explain why my body is stuck in fight or flight. I need to rule out autoimmune now. I’m chronically stressed. I can hardly get into cars now much less drive. I have so many things I need to do. I can’t even work right now, I had to take another leave. I’m in my last semester of college, and I can’t even see the future anymore. My psychiatrist wanted me to get my ocd under control so she prescribed Zoloft. It sat in my cabinet for weeks because I was frightened to take it. Well, I took it four days ago and the side effects were horrible. I came off of it after two doses. It increased my dissociation. I was crying all day for no apparent reason. I had my first suicide thought. Not to mention it ruined my GI. Thus, triggered my first major ptsd attack. It started last night. I felt out of it all day. My dad was mad at me and said someone would check me into a psych ward. He’s very impatient and a poor listener/communicator. He likes to do “tough love” when he doesn’t understand that’s not a thing. Well, later that night I felt symptoms from the night I took that cbd gummy. I felt like I really needed to go to the psych ward. Even though I was in my rational mind, I felt trapped in the flashback. Which is what happens now since that day. I remembered every emotion so clear. I felt like I was high again even though I knew I wasn’t. I was so scared that I thought I might need the actual hospital. I could hardly calm down. I got a migraine afterwards and felt so heavy. Today I’m having residual symptoms. I feel dissociative, unwell, and I’m scared that I’ll feel like that again. My brain keeps bringing up the flashback. It doesn’t help having ocd because it agitates the problem. I feel so sick. I know some of it is from the Zoloft. Maybe SSRIs just aren’t for me. I have my first EMDR appointment next Wednesday. I just want my life back. I’m terrified of medication because of one night. I should have never taken it. I should have gotten help all those other times I was on medication instead of being lazy. I have a lot of unresolved trauma and I guess that cbd gummy was enough to break the camel’s back. I’m so tired. I’m so exhausted. I don’t know what to do. I can hardly take a klonopin without being triggered back to that one night. I want out of my childhood home. I want to see my boyfriend again. I want to be able to work. I’m exhausted and scared. I’ve had flashbacks before but I normally think of the memory in third person or I dissociate myself from the memory. My therapist says I have an overarching diagnosis. I’m just scared. It’s like my brain is stuck right now.

I just want to recover, but I don’t even know where to begin. Or what to do. The list just keeps getting longer and it seems like my life is getting out of reach."
How do you guys cope with toxic shame?,81,mjh1ki,24,"So I haven’t been doing trauma work for a very long time now, maybe a month or two, but I think I just came to the realization that when I’m stuck in freeze (nearly 24/7), it’s mostly always bc of the shame I feel. For needing, for wanting, for existing... I even feel shame for not being ashamed. What do you guys do when you feel consumed by shame like this? Both in the moment and long term"
What does post-traumatic growth mean?,3,mjh17j,5,"**TW: mentions of grooming, csa**

This is my first reddit post here so bear with me. 

TL:DR; What do you \~do\~ with trauma? If you can't tell other people, how do you deal with the fact that these horrible things occurred and you just have to move on. 

In general, I'd say I'm confused. I've been in therapy for a year at this point but I can't seem to comprehend what to \~do\~ with my trauma. For context, my mom showed me some home videos and I saw instances of my abuser beginning his grooming. I immediately went into a flashback. I'm better now, but I suppose I'm confused because this is what's going in my mind:

I am so bitter that these awful things happened and every detail is so fresh and vivid in my mind that I can't help but want to scream it at anyone that will listen; at the same time, because it's so awful and disgusting, I don't want to tell anyone. They don't need to know and they're probably not equipped to deal with or help me after knowing that knowledge - in my mind, someone saying ""I'm sorry that happened to you"" really doesn't make me feel better. Like, if I tell them what happened and I recieve that response I might get those horrible details out but I'll still be empty and unfullfilled, if that makes sense. So I'm at the point of thinking of what I want. What I want to is to yell at those who harmed me, to tell them that they're a horrible person - but that's not an option either. 

So that's why I'm stuck on this question of post-traumatic growth. I can learn flashback managment to a tee, I can practice mindfulness until it's second nature, and I can learn every skill to manage my symptoms if I work hard enough. But at the end of the day I can't help but but be stuck with this thought - **that all these horrible things occurred to me, that it didn't mean a signle thing, and that I'll just have to carry it until I die**. I suppose I understand that post-traumatic growth can give me gifts of patience, empathy, and what not, but I genuinley do not know how to \~deal\~ with the knowledge that I was abused for years and I just have to keep moving. Do yall have any thoughts? Is there something I'm missing or is this just a reality I have to accept?"
Cup analogy?,3,mjh0ox,1,"I think  it’s been a long while since I posted here, but I had a small breakthrough in therapy today I wanted to share. I’m not sure if this idea has been here before-if so I promise I didnt mean to steal it. 

I often feel worn down and just can’t fill my cup, and I realized today that it’s because my cup is just bigger than other peoples. I’m spending so much of my day working through the trauma and dealing with the circumstances that my trauma has created, on top of everything else that’s already difficult in life, with less coping skills than people who didn’t go through trauma and were able to learn to function normally. Sort of like spoon theory I guess, but to me this explains why I always tend to withdraw."
Coming to terms with the fact that your childhood savior was also abusive,7,mjgzir,2,"Something new im dealing with in my quest for healing.
Actually looking at the situation from an adults perspective.

I always saw my grandmother as my savior,  she rescued me from my abusive parents.

But she also raised one of those parents.
And she didn't keep me protected, she just kept me alive and with the abusive parents.
Keeping the family together was important to her appearance,  but our family should not have stayed together.

She knew what was happening and spoiled me when I was with her,  I viewed her as the only person who loved me.

Now I'm remembering begging that person not to take me back home, offering all the gifts back. Telling her I didn't care if Santa couldn't find me.
No matter what I begged, id always be taken back to that hell house and told that it would be fine,  just 5 days and then I could be loved again.

By someone who clearly didn't care what was happening those 5 days 

She just let it happen while making me think she was saving me from it"
How does anyone successfully date?,22,mjg8zn,7,"I have PTSD, not sure about CPTSD but the other sub auto-deleted my post. Anything can set me off . I have hyper vigilance and I can only sleep alone. Lately I've had to deal with guys who get hurt feelings when I don't want to sleep over, don't invite them over my apartment or want to become a part of their life early on, and it makes them think I just want something casual. I don't want something casual, I just don't want to get hurt again. I need to take things slowly. I try to explain it to them in a simple way but I'm always scared of over sharing and they just brush me off. Guys ask for Instagram and social media which I don't have and they don't know how to respond when I can't give them my profile. Sometimes a guy from online dating tries to invite me to a party when we barely even met, and the guy who raped me did that. I'm so suspicious of people who invite me to parties or to meet their friends. Then when one tiny argument comes up, those same people are willing to throw me out like garbage and never speak to me again. How can they have the audacity to invite me into their life and pretend like they wanted me? I wanted to be open to letting people in again but every time I try it takes too long for them and they become tired of me, I start to resent them for being all the same and I can feel their annoyance with me. It's exhausting trying to be happy around somebody all the time. No one wants to be around a miserable person but I'm not happy when I feel pressured at all. How did you find someone who respects you and your boundaries who you can feel safe around?"
Can't function after retraumatized by medical issues,32,mjgb9h,6,"TW: medical trauma, suicide, fear of death and suffering, existential crisis, drug addiction

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is going to be long, I apologize. If anybody can lend any support or words of wisdom, I would appreciate it. I need it very badly. I think I also just want to get my story down on paper because at this point it's too long and complicated to explain verbally and I just want to get it out somewhere. TLDR because it ended up being even longer than I expected: life was severely fucked up by medical issues, I've been clawing my way back ever since, medical issues are back and I am mired in a severe existential depression and can't escape constant intrusive anxious thoughts about future inevitable suffering and death.

So I am a 36 year old woman living in the US. My adult life has been defined by a series of serious medical issues: when I was 18, I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and struggled with that hard (in a single year I would have multiple hospitalizations due to flares) through my 20s. When I was 25, I had a small bowel resection that left me with an ostomy (this was reversed in three months thank goodness). Before and after the surgery I was on Remicaid, which is a biologic IV drug that suppresses your immune system and helps some people with the Crohn's symptoms. Unfortunately this drug was most likely why I was diagnosed with leukemia when I was 27 as leukemias/lymphomas are a known side effect of the drug (I was aware of this when I was on it but was desperate to control my symptoms and my doctors said it was a good option). I had chemo and a bone marrow transplant. 8 months later, while I was doing better but still recovering, I developed a neuromuscular condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome and lost my muscle control up to my chest - I wasn't on a vent and could still use my arms, but couldn't turn over in bad, was incontinent, had to relearn how to walk. I was in the hospital for months recovering from that.

Ever since then (until recently) I've been physically healthy. Mentally I've been a fucking mess for the last ten years. While all this medical stuff was happening I was actually pretty stoic but it has all completely changed the course of my life in a way that I don't think I'll ever recover from financially or emotionally: I was in my last semester of law school when I was diagnosed with leukemia and I managed to graduate and even pass the bar exam while I was recovering from the transplant. But I've never worked as a lawyer (why will become clear shortly) and I am in hundreds of thousands of dollars of educational debt. I'm positive I will die still owing this money.

I came out of the hospital for the GBS completely emotionally dependent on oxycodone. I see this addiction as being 100% my fault. I knew I ""liked"" painkillers because I frequently had to legitimately be on them for my Crohn's flares and for me they had the nice side effect of euphoria in addition to managing my pain. I'm not sure how they ended up being ordered for me during the GBS hospitalization because I don't remember being in pain or complaining I was, but I was offered them everyday and I took them with kind of a ""why not"" attitude because they made it easier to zone out and relax and be content doing nothing but sit in a hospital bed and read or cross stitch. When I was discharged I was given a huge bottle of them and continued to use them in the same way, until I started getting rebound headaches which were horrible. I ended up flushing them one day during an argument with my boyfriend but it killed me to do it. We broke up shortly thereafter and I had the great idea of starting to strip - our upstairs neighbor was an ex-stripper and made it sound great and like i'd make a ton of money, finding a professional/legal job felt overwhelming with the huge gap on my resume and I didn't want to sit in an office anyways, and yes I wanted to get my hands on some more oxy.

I ended up stripping full-time for two years. I enjoyed it the first year but I had absolutely no mental health care during this time and relied extremely heavily on alcohol, coke, and oxy to self-medicate my anxiety and depression. Eventually I burned out and managed to get a good job at a consulting firm doing database work. I was able to put down the coke, the oxy became a once in a while treat. I had a good year doing this, then my boss left at work, they brought in someone new who I found extremely difficult to work with, I broke up with my boyfriend, and my mental health crashed hard and fast. I found a therapist and a psychiatrist, but I was in crisis and my workplace made it so much worse by being extremely unsupportive. I was told I was abusing the sick leave policy, I was called in for a meeting where my manager questioned my ability to do my job because I ""seemed so unhappy all of the time"", and I was eventually put on a performance improvement plan. The PIP was too much and I quit very shortly after that. Within the month I was in the psych ward for the first time because I was suicidal.

The next few years after that consisted of a downward slide that I'm still trying to climb out of. Basically I moved home, my relationship with my narcissistic mother and enmeshed siblings came to a head, I returned to the psych ward twice, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, went to rehab for substance abuse, and cut off contact with my family while I was living in a sober 3/4 house and trying to do NA. I had to cut them off for my mental health but it has been very very very hard to function with no support network and grappling with my mental health and substance abuse issues. I did not have a good experience with the 12 steps: I left the first 3/4 house because they were bullying me for my sexuality and for dating a trans guy, moved in with said guy only to get locked out by him in the middle of the night, went back to rehab because I had nowhere else to go, and then was kicked out of my next 3/4 house because I missed a house meeting because I was in an urgent care after getting heat stroke at work. I crashed with an acquaintance for about a month after this but the situation was unstable from the jump and I ended up leaving for a bed at a domestic violence shelter. This turned out to be a blessing because they were able to get me into an income-based apartment, where I still am to this day.

As you can probably tell, I haven't felt safe for a very long time. I have been clawing so goddamn hard to be stable again. While I was at the shelter I got a job waitressing at a local diner chain, did that for two years (including working overnight shifts which were not good for me), and then was able to get a REALLY good serving job at a fine-dining restaurant...two months before covid hit and the restaurant was shut down. I delivered for Amazon for a year after that which was horrible for my mental health. Once I moved into my current apartment I've been seeing continuously seeing therapists and psychiatrists in an effort to get control of my mental health with basically no noticeable results. I have not really had space to heal or come out of crisis mode and I have not been lucky with finding a therapist skilled enough to help me navigate this process. The borderline makes it extremely difficult because I'm frequently in a huge amount of emotional pain and the only thing I'm capable of doing when I'm like that is dissociating on reddit for hours at a time. My current therapist suggests ways to ground myself and various DBT skills but none of them are helpful during those periods where it feels like my skin is on fire and I want to explode into a million tiny pieces with the rage, frustration, and fear I feel.

Ok so now we come to the present: three weeks ago, I am relatively happy because I have found a job working from home as a paralegal and worked my last shift at Amazon ever. I had had a weird day of crampy stomach pains that worried me because it reminded me of Crohn's pain but i tell myself to not freak out because it's probably just something I ate. I sip on clear broth for a day and the pain passes. Unfortunately, the crampy stomach pains return a week later, become worse throughout the day, and around 11 PM that night I am in intolerable pain and vomiting. My SO calls the paramedics and I am admitted to the hospital. The next day I'm told that I'm obstructed and I need another small bowel resection.

I cannot describe what a nightmare this hospitalization was. The doctors were cold, robotic, and completely unempathetic. The first thing they told me was that my Crohn's was back and after the surgery I would need to go back on medication ""and probably biologics"". I FREAKED out and asked them if they were even aware I had a history of leukemia??? ""Yes we're aware."" I was terrified and panicking. The nurses were completely overworked and burned out. Nobody seemed like they communicated at all, doctors would say one thing in the morning, something completely opposite in the afternoon, and when I said ""but Doctor So and So said this thing that's completely opposite???"" they would just be like ""oh we didn't know that, ok we'll have to talk to him."" So what would have happened if I hadn't said anything??? For two days they said there was a chance I could avoid surgery by getting an enema and doing a balloon procedure to blow up the obstructed part, then the day it was supposed to happen it did not happen because there was a ""miscommunication"" about the enema I was supposed to receive the day before which I did not receive, and because of the miscommunication they couldn't do the procedure and oh well now I'm definitely having surgery. Which might leave me with an ostomy, they couldnt say for sure (I did not end up with an ostomy thank goodness). And this whole time I have a huge gauge NG tube in to suck the crap out of my stomach which made it virtually impossible to be comfortable or to sleep. I had that damn tube in for six days until I finally snapped and insisted they take it out. The first two days it was in it pressed on sinuses so badly I was in 8/10 pain and couldn't do anything but lie in bed with an icepack on my face. I BEGGED the doctors to do something to make the tube more comfortable and they just said ""we know it's uncomfortable but you need it."" finally they agreed to switch it to the other nostril while i was under for surgery, lo and behold no more sinus pain when i woke up. they could have switched it the whole time, they just didn't want to be bothered. It took hours and me losing my shit at them after surgery to get the PCA pump set up for my pain control (i had been assured before my surgery that that was how my pain control would be managed, i had been really worried because they were not taking my pain and discomfort seriously). I was in there for a week and the entire time I was just suffering through these horrible feelings of nonstop panic, isolation, trapped in my body, trapped in the hospital, and the thought that NOBODY could or would help me. My heart rate would randomly spike up to 130 bpm. i had ativan ordered but it barely took the edge off.

anyways I got out of the hospital a week ago and I have been a mess ever since. The surgery went well and my wound is healing. They saw no active signs of Crohn's disease but I've been to see the GI they set me up with since then and while she doesn't think I need to immediately jump back on medication, she does think I need to be very closely monitored because I am at high risk for developing more problems. The inside of my head is an absolute hellscape. All I can think about was how helpless and trapped I felt in the hospital and about what kind of similar suffering awaits me and my SO in the future when we become sick and ultimately die, I have especially fearful and intrusive thoughts about us developing a devastating degenerative illness like ALS or Alzheimers or Huntington's or something like that. I'm terrified of the possibility that things might get so bad I might need to choose between suicide or extreme physical suffering, and how to make that choice because I'm terrified of death. I've struggled with this kind of existential panic and dread ever since I had leukemia but it's never been this bad.

I have no appetite and can barely eat, anything I try to eat is disgusting to me. Obviously I've been retraumatized and my anxiety is out of control but I don't know what to do about it. I saw my therapist last week and she was completely unhelpful, just offered the same old shit about how i should try to be mindful and ground myself by doing stuff like ""petting your cats and focus on how soft their fur feels, listen to some relaxing music or a guided meditation"". I told her I didn't think those tools were powerful enough to help me and she just told me ""they are, you just might have to practice them a lot at first"". She is supposedly extremely trauma informed. I've tried them and they do NOT work, the intrusive thoughts and panic are too strong. I've called a few other therapists, including people out of network that do stuff like somatic bodywork, biofeedback, and polyvagal therapy, but no one has called me back yet. I have another bottle of oxy i was discharged with and I haven't taken any for the past four days because I haven't needed it for pain and I know better than to use it to self-medicate, but I want to so goddamn bad. i feel...not just dead inside but like i'm crushed and rotting. i'm so so angry that this is happening to me after everything else i've been through.

if you made it through all that, thank you for reading. i am very grateful i have a place to come where people understand."
Burning the bridge to my homeland,7,mjg9sk,19,"I despise my home country. Civil war torn and had to flee as a kid. Even before I was born, it was violent and corrupt. Even to this day; it’s a broken country of broken souls. I hate it. I hate everything about it. It’s language Arabic. It’s religion Islam. It’s culture. It’s belief that mental health is the work of jinn and devils and demons. It’s such an awful place and hate having to bring it up when someone sees my name. I was to “burn the ship” and sever the ALL ties with it. It produced a violent dad that beat us mercilessly all our youth. I want to renounce him and everything he is and our country. I change my name to an something Westernized and American, make a new happy story to tell people (a lie) rather than the sad song I have to give each time now.

Am I only hurting myself more making a new identity and persona? Or is it a true resurrection from the ugly ashes of fire consumed life?"
"Feel suicidal after assessment, realising I live in denial about how bad it really is",5,mjg5xt,4,"I had an initial psych assessment for community mental health team (UK) few days ago. It has left me feeling empty, alone and suicidal.

I think I live in denial about the extent of my MH issues. It is only when I have to speak about all the shit that has happened to me and all the shit I have thought, felt and done over the years to I realise the extent and gravity of how truly fucked up I am.

When I was younger and had periods of stability I truly believed that I was somehow magically better, and that I would never have another mental health problem again. Unfortunately this has been an ongoing and severe issue that has plagued me for the past 14 years - half my life. 

It seems that as time has gone by my periods of stability have gotten shorter. 

I've been thinking about suicide a lot recently. And not in the way I usually do, which is just hair trigger ideation. It's becoming expansive. I've thought about it most days for about a week now. 

I don't think anybody would even find my body until the smell of decomposition got so bad."
Angry with my parents,1,mjg1t6,2,"In January I told my parents that I didn’t want to see them this year. 
When I was in middle school, my mom went bank to school and checked out. From really 12 on they were both checked out. This part isn’t so bad. 
I came back from college during the recession. My mom took her stress and anger from her insane accounting job out on me. Screaming, yelling, demeaning, bullying and insulting me regularly. My dad supported her. He agreed with everything she said, enabled her bad behavior, and told me I deserved it. This was over household chores. 
I leave for grad school, and want able to get a job immediately after so I don’t know where to go and come home. I get an internship and then a part time job, living at home for another year and a half and their treatment resumes. They want to move and I am taking up space. I am forced to consider homelessness twice as an option and perhaps I should take taken it. 
I get engaged to a man that isn’t white, they tell me that I can’t marry him because it would be embarrassing for them, we fight it out. I should have just told them them to duck off but I also wanted to keep up appearances for my new family. 
My parents vote for Trump. We keep fighting. I tell them off this January. I asked them if they had any regrets and they just tell me why they did it.
I will get no empathy or love from them. The anger is eating me alive and I needed to talk about it somewhere."
"I am so terrified of moving on that I am literally frozen in place on a continual day to day basis and I am doing so poorly. I feel like how the Polar Bears must, with all their melting environment continuously being lost and me out on the edge of nowhere with no place to feel safe. HELP!!!!!!!!!!!!",7,mjg01i,1,"I'm at a stage now where I need to choose between my fight, flight, freeze or fawn response and man am I a human popsicle right now! 

I've always found it hard to move on. To let things go. To forgive. To let things BECOME better... Isn't that just balls out weird? The things that could literally save my life I am in a lot of ways right now actively trying to avoid? Trying to hold on to unhealthy familiarity... 

I frustrate my own damn self with that kind of reaction. I guess I never learned how to deal with the trauma all that well. I guess I am this way cos of all of the guilt, the shame, the neglect, the abuse and the pain... 

These bad habits have me convinced I need to stay where it's ""safe"" where I have crawled into a cave and tried to bury my past... But I have to come out into the light some day right? **I HAVE TO TRY!**

It's hard to STAY positive about much these days because I don't have many things going for me at the moment... I'm clinging on to the hope that I will rise from the ashes like a phoenix but it's like the burning of my soul never ceases to end! Just when I think I'm improving and getting somewhere, someone or something tries to prevent me from elevating to another level. The slightest upsetting thing can send me spiralling and also I go back into hiding, isolating, distancing myself from the world cos it has so far been a big disappointment. 

I can't even say I'm cautiously optimistic right now. But IF ANYTHING I want to be present and available FOR ME! Nobody else will be and nobody else HAS BEEN so I want to not ghost myself and FINALLY take the steps, no, the leaps and bounds I need to climb into a new kind of existence; one I can be proud of... 

I'm going to need all the strength I can muster.

will it ever get better?,3,mjfy0d,5,"some days its better, some days its worse than the worst. i just have this misery sitting within me. always waiting to manifest into hallucinations or voices of everybody telling me im a nobody.

i really just want to sleep till this is all over."
trying to make sense,1,mjfwqk,1,"I think this is kind of weird, but I also just need to take steps to accept it and accept that these things happen. 

I met a guy online who I became extremely close to really fast. He pretended to show a romantic interest in me and misrepresented himself and many details of his life in an attempt to get me to meet him in person. I  initially declined several times because I am not the the of person to meet an online stranger in real life. I’d never met an online friend in real life before, and I mostly do not date because it’s very hard to get me to be interested in building a strong enough connection with someone past friendship. Friendship is a pretty formidable and rewarding enough goal for me that I don’t aim past anything but that, and usually anything more is too much for me to handle, though now it even seems potentially perilous to attempt at friendship as well. 

I tried to turn him down and insisted that we get to know each other better before we met. He kept insisting to give him a chance and wanted to meet as soon as possible. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable meeting him yet and that I also had plans in my life that I was pursuing and that he was welcome to visit me to meet up IRL while I pursued those. He was super kind, accommodating, and patient and not at all angry, impatient, or offended at me, which I greatly appreciated, but continued to press scheduling a date in the near future to meet each other, to make sure that I wasn’t leading him on or anything. I ended up having to make plans to visit him IRL (shitty boundaries) which kept falling through because I didn’t feel comfortable flying out to meet him yet. He ended up having to pay for several plane tickets for me to see me and he did not give up or even care how many times I failed to make the trip. 

I’m trying to come to terms with the truth that this guy has been attempting to traffic me. It comes at about the same time and with striking similarities to someone else recently in the news for similar things. 

It was just a couple of weeks ago he was emailing nude pictures of girls he was talking to online (he was nothing like this when we first started talking, he presented himself as a completely different kind of shy and quiet and demure kind of personality when we first started talking). He recently sent me emails telling me my offspring would have been deformed and genetically defective (he had frequently mentioned marriage to me and said he wanted to have children with me).

He sent me really inappropriate amounts of money that I have repeatedly asked him to not send and to please let me give back to him, because we broke up after he started threatening to harm my family if I didn’t do what he said. I told him it was no longer appropriate for him to try to send me gifts of any kind, because the relationship was over. Months after I tried to break off all contact with him he still sent me money that I told him I didn’t want. 

There are a lot of details... I don’t really know what to do with this experience that I’ve had to have and live through. I don’t know how to make any part of this experience something more meaningful than just predatory traffickers exist and I guess maybe your ex-boyfriend does fit the profile, especially given that he ended up being radically different person than you initially thought he was.

Sorry that I’m still here. I think it just really hurts to understand that there really are real people out there for who people just don’t have any intrinsic value as people, and do very much see you as worthless and replaceable, easily interchangeable. And that they never had a true human interest in getting to know who you are or understand where your true values lie. It doesn’t seem like it was ever about that, but just plying me with greater and greater lies administered with the frequency of brainwashing to get me to misjudge the reality of who this guy really was and what his intentions with me truly were."
Daydreaming as a coping mechanism due to abuse.,32,mjfq8q,10,"After a lot of observation and meditation over my daydreaming habits, I've come to the conclusion that they're there exclusively for comfort. From the moment I wake up to the moment i go to bed, they ""activate"" to soothe. Like, I know it has to do with my inner child.

Dayreaming is my earliest for of a coping mechanism. Even before I got so anxious to have panic attacks, I was already daydreaming about things I wanted in my life but somehow couldn't parse that then. They started out as me with my ""tribe"" of sorts, then they turned me into a character I liked and related to and their relationship with their ""tribe"".

Lastly, I 've noticed that thinking about my daydreams as coping mechanisms makes me feel extremely, extremely sad. The other day I was listening to Arsnonist's lullabye by Hozier (one of my favorite songs of his) and reading an analysys of the lyrics. The writer said that the character ""needs"" the lullabye (the song) to fall asleep and be calm and that realization sent me into a crying spell.

I don't know what it is but i wanted to include that here. Maybe I feel a lot of pity towards that kid back then. There's something about adults using ""kid things"" to cope that make me emotional: stuffed toys, normal toys, lullabyes, drawings, poems, blankets, nightlights, comfort, favorite foods, special items, bracelets, you name it. Or maybe my inner kid wants those things, feels comfort in seeing other people struggling crumble in such vulnerable ways too. The tenderness, warmth and softness in such a hard, cold world makes them want to reach out maybe.

Anyway, I found that certains times of the day and events trigger them. We have:

1. waking up: I daydream a bit about waking up happy and warm next to someone i love, or something nice through a character. This way, waking up isn't as daunting and painful as it is if i just get up get up wihtout the emotional help. Getting up makes the daze dissipate and I forget I ever daydreamed.
2. Helplessness: Sometimes, I feel like what I'm doing is wrong. Not necessarily because my inner critic is telling me so but because what I'm trying to achive doesn't come out the way i want it to. Maybe I feel dissociated and it's hard to talk. It might just be my freeze response so of course I start daydreaming almost involuntarily, like breathing shallowly while anxious. My daydreams here consist of a character doing either something unrelated or going through the same thing and being comforted by others. in short, they aren''t hopeful in tone. Can become self-loathing fests.
3. Going to bed: I have a feeling this is about processing what happened during the day. If i learned something new, I'm going to have a conversation with a character or through a character and come to my own conclusions. If i feel like crap over my inability to do something or not ""making enough progress"" the daydream will become about my character being from mistreated to being punished for doing questionable to evil things. Tragic villain kind of things.
4. Writing. Ususally fueled by things i watch and things i learn. I start to incorporate it into my characters and worlds and make something else out of that. I ususally try to put them to paper but don't always succeed.

I don't know if this post will help anyone. Frankly, I just want to reach out and see if anyone has a similar experience. Daydreams are so intrinsic to how i interact with the world it scares me, because it's not good or bad, it just is and it's never been less than that. If anyone took it away I'd feel defiled and wrong. I'd feel vulnerable and weak.

Maybe i should bring more outward tenderness to my life, maybe that can reduce my reliance on conceptualizing a happy world where my traumatized body swears there isn't one."
"Tried to watch some Youtube videos on C-PTSD and couldn't get through them because it hurt so much, but I can spend hours on this subreddit. Why is that?",3,mjfly6,5,"Was it the audio? I'm confused.

Kleptomania?,5,mjedwy,5,"DEA had a time in their childhood when they were stealing things? I am very ashamed of this and I really don’t understand why I was doing it, but there was a time I was stealing. It was compulsive, I was unable to resist. And I felt horribly guilty afterwards. I would never use the things I stole (I would hide them, give them away or simply throw them out). I usually stole small things, like toys and stuff. I suffered a lot of trauma and was also severely emotionally neglected, but I feel like this is a cheap excuse for such behaviour. I still feel like there was something really wrong with me or I was demoralized. I feel horrible about this, I was one of those kids who lied, stole, did strange things and I don’t know how to process this..."
Feeling pressured to heal in a timeframe? (Pandemic-related),43,mjdoim,9,"(This is a throwaway account!) Does anyone feel pressure to ""heal"" or ""resolve their issues"" by the time COVID ends? The pandemic has been terrible, but it has given me the opportunity to rest and heal my nervous system as I *just* barely get by on unemployment. Now I feel like I have to get my stuff together before it runs out. 

Also, I've been on an immunosuppressant during the entire pandemic and I've been diligent about keeping my distance from others in our high risk area. I feel once summer comes, people are going to want to be social, celebrate, and spend time, but I'm realizing I might not be ready.

I've spent the last three years physically destabilized by work on my C-PTSD, and along the way picked up a diagnosis of MS, followed by severe case of PNES and other somatoform issues which have caused me to live on day-to-day basis. Thanks to serious work with a two therapists and a neurologist who works on somatoform disorders, I've gone from having trouble forming sentences and sleeping 16 hours a day to what is starting to look like a normal life. I've made so much progress during COVID. However, there is still SO MUCH more to be done. I am just now stabilizing, and the phase of remembrance and grief has just begun.

Part of me feels like, ""you've had three years of illness–wrap it up and get it over it, already!"" But I am scared of having to heal within the hustle of normal life."
DAE feel super sensitive to others moods and feelings but at the same time you can’t imagine how they perceive you as a person,404,mjeihz,34,"It’s a weird feeling that I always had.

I can sense super well how the other person feels and which mood they are in, but I just can’t imagine how they must perceive me. I’m not able to see myself through their eyes. I can’t imagine what goes on in their minds when they see me and talk to me. 

Is it maybe because I have never felt seen by my parents? They were very narcissistic and self-absorbed. 

Also, they were happy to see me being sad, they were laughing about me and mocking me about it and so on.. (they are very very immature). I assumed that they didn’t notice that I was sad. I tried to overplay it but in reality they still noticed and laughed about me, I just didn’t know. 

Now I really have no idea if people can really see who I am and how I feel."
"People who have flashbacks, what do they look like for you?",9,mje4ei,11,"Apologies if this has been asked recently. Last night I was in a flashback for about an hour. It has been a couple years since I’ve been stuck in one so long, and didn’t know where I was/how old I was. It made me very curious to know what other people go through when they have a major (or minor) flashback."
How have you coped with realizing your family never honored your truth?,44,mjdzkg,8,"Hi, friends.

I've come to the realization over the last couple of weeks that my truth was rarely, if ever, honored growing up and even periodically in my adult life.

I'm realizing now, at 32, why I get so quiet at family functions.  It's because if I ever spoke my truth or let an authentic part of me show, it was invalidated.

I have one aunt and one uncle who were particularly damaging.  I majored in music education in college and I currently have a very rewarding career as a band and orchestra director.  The aunt once got in an argument with me because I told her I didn't particularly like one style of music.  She also chastised me, once, for not wanting to perform on demand.  She also once argued with me about my musical knowledge.  This aunt is a lawyer who has her own issues with having to be right about everything... 

The uncle refused to respect my boundaries around sharing my coming out with my grandmother.  I set a clear boundary saying that I wanted to share this with my grandmother when I was ready and he got angry at me when I told him that it wasn't his place to share.  When my dad defended me (yay dad!), he said ""fuck you both"" and stormed off.  This was at my cousin's wedding.  I spent the rest of the event in a dissociative rage and I truly don't remember that day as a good day, which is a shame.

I'm realizing that my family is made up of very judgy WASPs.  I have another aunt that once got annoyed at me for not putting tortilla chips in a decorative bowl for the homemade dip I made for Christmas dinner.  Seriously petty bullshit. 

I have another aunt that never once came to one of my performances in undergrad or to one of the performances of the semi-pro group that I play with, but the second her daughter-in-law (who my cousin later divorced) played a recital at Carnegie Hall, she was there.

This is also compounded by flashbacks of my ex who was truly manipulative and preyed on my innocence.  He was gaslighting, character assassinating, and awful to me.  Truly, he was a predator of my innocence.  Any trait of mine that was valued and loved by my friends (and even loved by my whacky, dysfunctional family), he shot down and attempted to invalidate.  Thankfully, I cut him out.  I broke my attachment to him, blocked him on all platforms, and asserted my deserving something better.

At first glance,  the family things all seemed to be innocuous irritations to me (the ex was definitely serious emotional trauma).  But, over the last few weeks, I've realized that all of this has been extremely damaging.  Couple all of this with my mom being simultaneously narcissistic and enmeshed with me and the work I've had to do to deconstruct the walls I used to protect myself from that whole mess, and I am exhausted.

I feel like I haven't been at peace since I started to unpack all of this and its impacting every facet of my life.  My Critic, installed by my judgy, WASPy family, and bolstered by my awful ex, tries to tell me that I don't feel the right things for my partner (which I do, because I have felt all the ""correct"" emotions and accompanying physiological responses), that I'm a bad teacher (which is crap, as my groups consistently earn top marks at performance assessments and my marching band is a state champion group), and that I should be ashamed for feeling this way and for developing cPTSD when compared to my partner who does not have cPTSD but had a similar difficult upbringing.

It also externalizes in the form of jealousy for people with ""normal"" families.  I see families having meals together, having fun on vacation, enjoying funny family group texts, and people genuinely looking forward to family events and instead of feeling happy for them I feel jealous.  It's just GROSS to feel this way.

I'm very slowly unpacking this with my therapist and through my own work in journaling and somatic awareness.  I had a really great 3 weeks where I felt content and at peace, and then I had a flashback.  I'm trying not to let it ruin me, but, man, do I miss that peace and joy I was feeling just a few short days ago.

Does anyone have any advice?  I'm working to not let the Critic self-punish but, my god, is it difficult and exhausting.

Thank you in advance for any advice, friends."
Is this a trauma response?,9,mjdz4a,4,"I've noticed that whenever anybody touches the space between my shoulder blades, the muscles in that area all tense up like crazy for a second or two. Even when I'm feeling safe and happy. It's been happening since childhood. I can't control it. I don't feel panicky or anything when it happens but my muscles react regardless. I can't remember any trauma involving that area. I thought it was just a sensitive body part for everyone but my girlfriend got really concerned when she noticed it."
i have no money for medication and psychiatry. fuck this,6,mjdxxd,4,"I've been having psycotherapy (?) every 2 weeks which i can afford, but i need to change my medication and after paying rent, medication, college tuition and a lot of other stuff i have no money for an appointment and for more medication. i don't know what i'm going to do. i can't believe taking care of my fucking mental health is so expensive. i've even tried selling pics but it doesn't help much. I also tried selling old clothes i don't wear anymore but it's the same shit. i hate this."
"It's over, forever. I'm free and my body is beginning to feel that way too.",8,mjdsnk,4,"She can't hurt me anymore. Not because she doesn't have the power to try, but bc I'm not Stuck by her anymore. I can process my pain and let it go, and I will. She can never stop me from striving to live the kind of life I want."
Tired of Being Mature,88,mjdon5,11,"I'm 13 almost 14. Most of my childhood I've been abused. Being hit whenever almost everyday whenever I made mistakes on the piano. Being molested at 10 by father. Getting insulted and emotionally manipulated my whole life.

My parents tell me that I'm too immature. So I try to act mature. But now that I'm almost turning 14 I'm starting to realize that I never got any time to be immature and childish and innocent. My parents stole my childhood and... I'm tired. Just tired of trying to act like an adult. I wish I could be a child again, but the lost time cannot be restored.

When someone says ""She's almost 14. She should be able to manage that."", it hurts me. I don't know why, but it just does. "
"How can I make progress in a new, healthy relationship after leaving an abusive ex?",5,mjdo3v,1,"I’ll try to keep it short and sweet: 5 years ago, I left a toxic relationship where my ex would constantly r*pe me - he even once attempted to murder me in my sleep but when I woke up in panic he told me that he thought that being randomly choked would have turned me on. 

Anyway, it took me all those years to muster up the courage to try dating again. I was lucky enough to meet the most wonderful guy ever in the last few months. The problem is whenever we sleep together, the following morning my anxiety goes from 0 to 100 real quick. My symptoms are so bad that I become physically ill (upset stomach, excessive sweating etc). Is it my subconscious trying to keep safe despite being in good hands? It’s really bothering me because I want to be able to stay at his place without having a full blown panic attack. The symptoms seem to subside as soon as I’m on my way back home. 

I’ve only told my new bf about my sexual abuse, so I suppose I haven’t completely processed it yet."
Does anyone have experience with the Complex PTSD workbook?,4,mjdh0q,4,I was recently rediagnosed with complex PTSD and my therapist recommended I buy the Complex PTSD workbook. Does anyone have experience with the book? Just wondering what it’s like before I make the purchase.
Annoyed at people overusing the word trauma?,24,mjdfoj,19,"This is something that I feel guilty about at times but I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same as me and if not, I'd really love to hear other opinions. 


I can't decide if people (in certain circumstances only), either in real life or online, saying they are 'traumatised' is helpful if not. I have two ways of thinking about it, 

1.) It's really great that people are talking more about trauma and being more open about it. Plus who am I to judge what does and does not traumatise someone. At times, a reeving engine (a benign example on its own) takes me right back to horrible memories of my mother so I get that. 

2.) I get the impression people are using the word very fucking liberally and what at times seem, incorrectly. And it annoys me and I wish it didn't because I see them saying they are traumatised but very much getting on with their own lives and I'm here traumatised and just fucking barely able to stay alive. Is it 'trauma' or just... Something else? Maybe jealously is informing this thought also and I'm aware of this. 

This is very difficult to explain and I'm really sorry if I'm not articulating this properly but it's a thought I wanted to discuss with others in the same boat but basically there's a part of me that's almost sceptical (in certain situations only!) when people say something like ,""lol and that's on childhood trauma 🤪""  and they seem, tbh, grand."
SAAM and a trauma anniversary are quickly wearing out all my self-soothing mechanisms,8,mjd78h,7,"I'm stressed and feel like I'm falling apart. My college campus is big about putting up posters and displays for SAAM, and several of the areas they put these up are nearly impossible for me to avoid, I'm talking the dining hall entrance and fields in front of buildings I have class in. The 18th will be 2 years since I left my abusive ex. The flashbacks and guilt and pain have already picked up again, going from 2 flashbacks or less a week to multiple a day. My last therapy appointment was the 23rd and my next isn't until the 13th because my therapist is on vacation. My support system isn't good on quick response, so I'm left trying to soothe the flashbacks myself and while I'm okay doing that when they're less often and I have time to recoup the emotional energy between them, right now they're quickly outpacing my ability to cope."
DAE not want to be helped?,13,mjd4xc,2,"I have been severely abused as a child and I dealt with it all myself. I didn’t tell an adult, I didn’t get therapy, I didn’t even tell my friends. I just lived with it all by myself, and I’m proud of myself for that.

If someone popped up in my life, offering unconditional love and support, I think I’d hesitate to accept it. I just don’t want to be dependent on others for support. If I can deal with it myself, I will do that. Getting other people involved with my demons seems a lot harder than just taking them on myself."
What do normal people talk about for so long?,89,mjcs9h,24,"I don’t understand, what do they talk about? I exhaust my topics for conversation pretty quickly. When I’m with a person who makes me feel safe I might have a connection but that’s usually from me listening to them talk. I never connect to people when I try to be the active one in a conversation and it’s rare for me to have a conversation where we both talk and listen. Has any of you figured out conversations?"
I’ve been feeling down and emotional the last week or so...,5,mjcm8g,11,"I was recommended this sub from r/Healfromyourpast. I am not sure if I have CPTSD, but I guess this sub can help with some of the emotional issues I’ve been dealing with. My emotions just come at me out of nowhere, or sometimes, like now, I’m just sad and constantly overwhelmed even when nothing is going on. It’s incredibly distressful and frustrating"
So....I noticed a pattern with my anxiety and depression spiking after dark,9,mjcad6,11,I’m almost never anxious or depressed during the mornings or afternoons (unless it’s a huge episode lasting multiple days) but I often get anxious once the sun sets. I don’t have any trauma related reasons to be scared of the dark. Does this have to do with sunlight and its beneficial effects on the brain?
I just heard my father be an asshole to a salesperson and realized it's not about me...,101,mjbydt,18,"I heard my father berate and be unreasonable toward a door-to-door salesperson today. The poor guy was just trying to do his job, make it in this difficult world, doing a difficult thing, and he received the completely undeserved cruelty of my father. My father did this because he was embarrassed by being taken advantage of by salespeople in the past, but that doesn't mean he should treat a completely unrelated person with disrespect. 

And then I made the connection that my father is unreasonable asshole to many people, and they didn't deserve it. He has anger issues and poor emotional intelligence. And that his behavior toward me throughout my life was not my fault either. It seems obvious in retrospect, but I have ""personalized"" his abuse toward me: I always interpreted it as if I deserved his behavior toward me, that I did something wrong, or that I *was* wrong and deserving of his abuse. The mind of a child tries to rationalize the behavior of their parents. 

I hope that poor salesperson isn't too negatively affected by my father's behavior and it doesn't cause him too much pain. It's not about him. It's my father."
Mixed feelings about becoming an aunt,1,mjbvsd,4,"So... my sister visited with her husband. They revealed that they are expecting a baby come September. I am overjoyed. I just worry about a baby being brought into this world. I love that there is going to be a new life coming into the world. I am taking my role as an auntie seriously. I want to be consistently there for this kid as a kind auntie. I don't think either of them have c-ptsd. They are wealthy and very compassionate. I am just so worried... what if the baby triggers their childhood trauma and they develop c-ptsd? What if the baby has epigenetic problems from the trauma history of our family. What if the baby develops c-ptsd from other trauma?

I have also seen cracks in their relationship before. At times... I have thought her husband was abusive and he runs a high temper at times. She is a perfectionist and doesn't understand mental illness and victim-blames. 

I don't know... I just can't imagine ever having a child without at least a decade of psycho-education, therapy and self-exploration under my belt. It makes me nervous... 

I worry that they are doing this from societal pressures and out of fear of biological clock ticking and being alone.

I secretly wish that something will go wrong and this baby wont be born...."
what do you do to actually feel safe when you are actually in a safe place?,5,mjbq9x,4,"I did a lot of hard work cutting some people out of my life and I’m in a much better, happier place. I love who I’m with now and I’m working hard on loving myself. question is, even though I’m in such a safe and loving place it can be really hard to feel present because I feel like I need to be on alert and make sure everyone’s feelings are okay and also be on alert because I’m unsafe even though I’m not. do you all have any tips on how you gently coax your mind into believing your space is safe when it is? thanks- i hope you all are having the best day!!!!"
Falling apart after deleting email,1,mjbcih,8,"I’m trying to find a new therapist. I emailed someone yesterday to see if they were accepting new patients. They emailed me back last night but through some kind of secure mail system. I had to create a password for the system, and my phone created a strong password that should have been saved into my phone’s passwords... but it wasn’t. When I tied to reply later I was locked out of the system AND it deleted the email. 

I am a complete failure and I should be dead. There’s no way this person is going to work with me. I emailed her back (not through the secure system but regular email) to let her know what had happened and now I sound like a crazy person. It’s over before it even began. It’s been hours now and she hasn’t responded because she can already tell how awful and fucked up I am. I shouldn’t be alive. It’s not easy to reach out for help and now I’ve humiliated myself and will be rejected again.

Books around regaining trust post-trauma,10,mja7bz,6,"Hey folks,

I've been chattering away to my therapist and it turns out CPTSD is a thing. Mine's leaving me with some gaping holes in the old 'trust of other people' area in my life and that's a serious bummer.

I learn by reading, absorbing and putting things into action. So I wondered if anyones got any solid recommendations around post-trauma trusting of others?

"At almost 29, I finally have the courage to separate from my toxic family.",82,mj9x92,13,"Yesterday was a really big moment for me and I felt like I should share. The words that I said to my Mother yesterday have needed to be said since I tried to take my life as a teen as result of her physical and emotional abuse. I never said anything though because I’ve always felt like she didn’t think what she did was “bad” or “overboard”.

So I just decided I was gonna be a good daughter and just love my Mom unconditionally anyways. After all, she had a rough upbringing too and damaged people damage people. That’s the excuse that I’ve been telling myself this whole time. I’ve been so afraid to leave the 3 remaining family members that I have that I’ve never held anyone accountable for their actions around me. I’ve always been afraid to be honest with her because she would hit me over the littlest things- she was diagnosed with BPD by 3 doctors but never sought real help or took her meds. 

But yesterday was different. Yesterday she tried to tell me to my face that “children remember things a lot more dramatically than what actually happened”, and that “back in the day getting spanked with a belt or hand was just normal”. But she didn’t do just that. She hit me for consecutive days, pushed me so hard when I was 8 that my small child sized head made a hole in the wall behind the couch, she told me that she “didn’t remember” dragging me down the concrete steps of our CO home by my hair when I was 9 and just so many other instances where she went wayyyy too far. 

Basically what happened after the argument was the typical scenario where no one asked me if I was okay, just coddled the crying abuser. So I left and now I’m crashing at my only friends office! And I can’t tell you guys how well I slept last night despite feeling like I ruined everything yesterday. 

I have (1) friend, my BFF, and she happens to be amazingly supportive and has always validated my feelings. Guys, I CANNOT stress how important it is to have at the very minimum just one person in your life who validates you and you can talk about your feelings openly with. I honestly don’t know if I would’ve been strong enough mentally to leave this situation and I know that just having that one good influence has made a world of difference for me. 

I say if you need to say something to your abuser and you *want* to... do it!! They deserve to hear it and be held accountable. And if they choose not to become better people with the information given to them then we just have to walk away and live our own lives. I don’t feel angry that my Mother pretends like what she did was okay. I pity her because I know that the soul cannot grow without admitting your faults. Thinking of it that way has helped me tremendously. 

Idk where life is going to take me but I trust in the healing process and I know that a big part of self love is surrounding yourself with good people who don’t gaslight you or try to make you feel dramatic for feeling pain. This month I ditched an emotionally abusive ex, told my Mom how I felt finally, and I couldn’t feel stronger or happier than I do right now even though I’m the most alone I’ve ever been. 

To all my fellow humans on here: You CAN make it without them. You are good enough, smart enough, and talented enough. What you do with this life is up to you and no one can take that from you!! You are a resilient fighter and even if you have no one currently in your life that’s good for you- we’re here for ya! 

Thanks for reading, stay strong everyone 💚

Can cptsd make you transgender?,5,mj9wft,4,"My whole life I've gone back and forth about being trans, to the point of transitioning once, detransing, then retransitioning. I've struggled so much being dissociated from my body and not feeling like I belong in it. Transitioning helped... somewhat. But after reading both Body Keeps The Score and Pete walkers book I'm realizing that sense of dissociation/depersonalization is common in abuse survivors. I grew up in an emotionally abusive house and dealt with extensive homophobic bully from extended family and community. Just wondering if the dysphoria and alienation I feel could be from that instead of being trans? Anyone else struggle with is or have thoughts?"
The experience of taking my inner child to Wilderness Therapy.,57,mj9v6k,3,"A few years ago I went to train as a Wilderness therapist in the Southern U.S.. I sort of felt guilty though because I wasn't going there with intentions of taking the job. I was going there because I wanted to have the experience of getting therapy for my inner child.

For our first part of training, We would spend three days deep in the woods of North Carolina experiencing what it would be like for the students. For those three days, I was able to be 12 again.

During the training we learned how to make a fire using only wood, how to create a flint stone, how to properly Leave No Trace, how to use the environment as a tool for therapy and so much more. I was paired up with two other trainees, and one of them was named,and I kid you not, ""Destiny"".

I also made many mistakes during this trip and I was shocked to notice that my trainer helped me through things and didn't make fun of me or ridicule me....Maybe making mistakes is part of the learning process, and that's how you get better.

The most important steps came at the last day. There was trouble back at base camp and our trainer had to get back ASAP. The only problem is we were a good nine miles deep in the woods, it was pouring rain and we had a ton of gear to bring back.

As we were starting to head back, it began to pour. I'll never forget my trainer turn to me and he had this big smile and said, ""You have no idea how good this is for you!""

I thought he was out of his goddamn mind and was actually a little scared. How could walking 9 miles in the pouring rain with 50 lb of gear be a good thing???

When I got back to the base camp and collapsed on the floor, I kind of realized where he was going. We had just overcame an incredibly difficult thing, and we did it as a team. We didn't let anybody quit and we supported one another. And when we got back, we shared some ice cream and huddled up by the heater. It was just Breyers, but it tasted like Carvel from Heaven. I swear I could taste each individual vanilla bean. It was so sweet to appreciate something after going through a difficult process, especially with support around me. We all fell asleep on the floor in our sleeping bags and it was one of the most peaceful nights of my life.

Before I left the owner pulled me in and told me that originally he didn't think I was going to make it or that he would offer me a job. He said I was a bit awkward and attention-grabbing at the start, and I appreciated his honesty because no one has ever done that before with me. Constructive criticism can be a good thing, and I took his words to Heart. I turned down the job offer, but I was so happy that I got to give my inner child some therapy and experiences that helped him grow and be nurtured."
Noticing bad parents is ruining some of my favorite movies,745,mj9lxb,155,"I’m wondering if other people have the same issues when they start getting help for CPSTD or emotional neglect.

Yesterday I had The Secret Garden (1993 version) playing while I was doing housework, which had been one of my favorite books/movies growing up.

But as I was watching it, I started to become so irrationally angry and felt real hatred towards the father in the movie.

Your wife died, so you were so “hurt” and “afraid to love your son because you had suffered to much already” so you didn’t interact with him at all for ten years? You let him stay in bed and so he never learned to walk? He never went outside once? He never had a friend his own age, or any other companion? You were just going to let him live his life in his bed without ever looking into it?

Then you got custody of your niece who lost both her parents, saw her once, and took off?

He is presented as a tragic figure and forgiven at the end, but all I could thing was wow, you are a shit person and shit parent, and so self centered and selfish.

As I work through these things I hope that this mellows out somewhat... I don’t know. It feels like wasted energy to be angry at a movie but I feel like I’m noticing this stuff everywhere lately.

Edit: wow, such interesting responses and discussions, thanks you guys! So thankful there is a forum like this to talk about and think through/feel these thoughts and emotions with people that understand and have such insightful perspectives too"
I don't know if this counts as cpstd,1,mj9gr4,2,"TW: Ableism, sexism, sexual assault, workplace trauma 

In 2019 I got a job in CAMHS. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, a part of the NHS Mental Health sector for young people. Although the job itself had its emotional and physical trauma for me, the most trauma I received came from my boss. 

Just a little background on myself, when I found and applied for the job I had just turned 21. I was diagnosed with Hip Dysplasia at the age of 18 so I had issues with pain and my hips. I had major surgery in 2016 to try and ""fix"" my dysplasia. Whilst in hospital I experienced a lot of physical and emotional trauma. After I came out of hospital I developed agoraphobia and was unable to leave my house for 3 years. In January 2018 I started graded exposure therapy to get me out my house. That February I met a boy, we fell in love and since then he's been the one main person to support me and help me with my recovery. A big part of that recovery was getting a job. January 2019 I found a job description for a Support Worker in a childrens psychiatric hospital.  I looked further into the description and discovered that its in the hospital I went to as a child for therapy. ""It's a sign"" I thought. So I applied and got the job. And obviously in the job I had to disclose my disabilities and any longstanding health issues. Which I did. 

The first few months of my job my boss loved me. She would talk to me and encourage me and help me. And then it all started going down hill when I  had an incident. I was on the ward and my hip popped out spontaneously.  I was walking down the corridor and it just went. I tried to play it cool and not bring attention to myself by propping myself up against a windowcill and beckoned a colleague over. My colleague asked me what was wrong and subtly I said ""I've popped my hip out help"". All my colleagues knew about my disabilities and were always super supportive. She then went and got one of our on site doctors to talk to me and give me advice. All that we could do was take me to A&E. This was when all the staff started to notice and the kids started to ask what was going on. I ended up having to be wheeled out in a wheelchair and spent the next 8 hours in hospital. 

The day after, my boss summond me to her office. ""What the hell"" she said ""why didn't you just work, you never told me you were disabled"". To which I said ""I definitely told you, I distinctly remember talking about it in my interview"". She then started to gaslight me and talk about how unprofessional I was being. She started to ask if I was really disabled ""you don't even look disabled"". I was the diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and told her immediately. But she called me a liar. 

This is when she started ignoring me at work and talking about me in the office. 

A few weeks later I had my first night shift. That night, I was sexually assaulted by a member of staff. But I was ashamed and scared of what would happen. So I didn't tell anyone for a long time. 

Over the next few months my boss refused to talk to me. She wouldn't even say good morning or good afternoon to me. She wouldn't acknowledge me. She would badmouth me to staff, talk about me as though I wasn't there.  

About 8 months after my S.A I finally told my boss. She sat there and just laughed. She laughed straight in my face and blamed me. 

So I decided that from then on I wasn't going to tell her things and instead tell HER boss (who was the matron). The ableism she showed me continued over the next few months. 

On another night shift, something traumatic happened with a patient and I ended up sitting in her room with her for hours, covered in her blood. Obviously I can't go into specifics with that because it's not mine to tell. But it was emotionally traumatic for me. And obviously told my bosses immediately. Then it backfired. They blamed me. ""How dare you say that about any of my nurses, I don't think they did that, I think you're lying"" Is what the matron told me. 

The gaslighting, ableism, disrespect, bullying, and horridness all continued throughout my work there. I wasn't given the same support, opportunities or respect as my other colleagues. 

The worst incident happened in June last year (2020). One afternoon my boss sat all the staff down whilst the patients were up in school with the teachers. ""We're about to have a new admission"" but she wanted to tell us some things before they came. Obviously I'm not going to mention specifics. But whilst talking about their case, my boss told us all that the patient was extremely violent towards staff. 
On the afternoon, right before the incident, the alarm goes off. And on the ward, if the alarm goes off you HAVE to run. So I ran to where the patient was. When I got there, I heard shouting and screaming. My patient was attacking staff. During their stay here I managed to get a good report with the patient. I was the only staff member they trusted and we did some great work together. 

However, over the next 2 hours I would deal with so much emotional and physical trauma. Over this time, the patient punched me continuously. They kicked me and at one point kicked me so much they dislocated my jaw. They also bit me on bare skin. And spat at us and even at one point spat at me whilst I was talking to them and it went in my mouth... And very almost stabbed me. But I don't blame them for what happened. And I still don't think badly of them. 

A few days later we had a debrief. Where we talked about what happened and anything we as staff needed to say was said. But our boss sat there and laughed at us. ""I'm so glad I wasn't there"" she sat and told us she didn't know they were violent or abusive. She laughed at us for over an hour. That's the horrid bit for me. 

I had to leave work 2 months later. I have Fibromyalgia and the attack was so bad it caused me to have a horrific flare up. Im now in a wheelchair and can't work. 

But I basically needed to tell people. So..here I am....telling someone..."
Tremors,12,mj8ukd,9,"Hey y'all, I've always experienced tremors where I would shake involuntarily and have either full body or hand convlusions. I would never loose consciousness during any of these episodes. I discussed this with a neurologist and he told me that these are common amongst people with aspergers. After posting in r/aspergers, a user told me told that this is a common occurrence amongst people with cptsd and suggested that i make a post here. Does anyone here deal with this?"
Healing has me feeling like I'm going to die,60,mj8e7p,27,"Lately I've been releasing a lot. Crying, sobbing, screaming, wailing – the release I've long for after years of emotional shutdown and unavailability has been hitting me in cycles of monstrous waves. It feels like I'm finally able to grieve and there's just so much to let go. I keep going through layers and layers. 

While I thought this would feel good, in some way, I wonder if it will ever end because I can't sleep or rest enough to recover from these storms. My five-hour-a-night insomnia – and sometimes even less than that – coupled with all this crying feels so destabilizing. I feel nauseous, unsteady, I'm shaking constantly. I've lost so much weight. Getting up or turning over in bed sends my heart racing. I feel raw and also terrified. 

I know this terror is what was underneath my numb, frozen exterior. I know I asked for it to be melted and to get to the pain beneath so I could begin processing. But why am I not sleeping more? Why do I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack before the healing is over. I'm trying to keep it together and do things that'll bring me some comfort like reading, playing my switch, yoga, meditation. I've heard that not sleeping is a huge impediment to healing grief and trauma. I feel so much sorrow and fear that I'm going to destroy myself before anything good comes of this newfound opening."
DAE have PTSD dreams even after hearing the smallest disagreement?,3,mj7wj3,2,"I haven’t had a dream for maybe months? It’s been so strange, somehow they just stopped. Yesterday I was on the phone with my mom and she and my dad had the smallest tiff (though I could sense the tension was building and cycle had already started). 

And then last night? PTSD dream. Even when I lived at a home stay a few years back, two people (not the parents) would fight at like 9pm and I would hear it, and then... trauma dream. 

But I haven’t been to my parents house in nearly four months. So it truly is wild to me that I had a dream after the smallest interaction. 

Anyone else experience this? Anyone know what makes the dreams stop? I am afraid they’ll be back for good now."
For anyone who needs hope,167,mj7v1v,26,"I posted a couple of months ago when I was (finally) diagnosed with having c-ptsd after years of therapy and having every symptom imaginable- constant anxiety, panic attacks, dissociation, insomnia, ticks, physical numbness, burn out depression....

I had to face the reality that even to this day, there was an unhealthy amount of enmeshment with my family: parents and 3 sisters. My dad is unmedicated bipolar and potentially schizophrenic, in and out of psych wards throughout my life. My mom has the beautiful narcissist/borderline combo (I also worked with her for 8 years, which broke me, she has no soul). They are emotionally abusive, and neglectful. 

My 2 younger sisters are narcissists in the making, raging, and abusive in other ways. They make crazy every chance they get. My closest sister is a gem, but she struggles to regulate her emotions, they’re explosive and usually attention seeking (she was in a bad accident, traumatic brain injury survivor).

I think I reached a point, perhaps considering my age (33), that I had no choice but to fight and finally face the family drama machine: calling them out on their shit, cutting ties, blocking numbers, creating boundaries.

I feel GREAT. I went from being a shell of a person, having never “individuated”, a lost sense of self, full of fear, to flipping my life the fuck over. 

I spent the first few months in therapy crying, having panic attacks, video journaling, writing, posting here, not leaving the house, not sleeping, a fucking mess of emotions daily: I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror, I don’t know why I deserve my husband and how he stuck around.

I woke up each day a fraction more strong, slightly more settled, and then one day I started doing things for me. I blocked them all, no warning really. I finally put up my portfolio online, created my website (after years of being a ghost graphic designer). I started and Instagram account to promote my work. Any place online that made sense to put myself out there on, I did it. And holy shit. Similar to the supportive world here on reddit, I found it in the designer corner. I’ve met so many cool people, my works been featured, I got 10 requests for work, a ton of new followers. I wake up excited about the day, tapping into a new energy source. I started to take care of people in my life that don’t cause me grief, friends/my husband, and got all the love I need back. I feel finally a sense of freedom and I can feel my feet on the ground when I walk.

Even if it’s uncomfortable, I suggest you go for it: something that’s yours and yours alone, just pour yourself into it. I don’t know how I found strength in this. But I’m much happier and I have so much more hope. 

Sending all the love to everyone here."
"A shift from ""traditional"" language to trauma-informed",26,mj7p7y,5,
Samee!!,1,mj5r2v,1,Omg Ik 14 and I’ve been getting that exact same feeling at different moments in my entire life and I’ve tried to search this but nothing comes up. I remember when I was little I would get it get it so often out of nowhere. Usually it would be when I woke up in the morning and just feel disgust towards my whole family and it is exactly how u described when you said that it would be especially in the moments when you would feel close to them and it would last a few minutes. The best way I could describe it would be repulsion or like when people say they’re getting the icl to their partner except it would feel like that but it would be out of nowhere for no reason and towards everyone in the world but especially my close family members except they never did anything wrong so idk why. I would describe the feeling as when u eat something too sweet and then u feel sick. I would usually get this feeling on Christmases or Easter or days that my family just felt a lot closer to each other but I would also get it on random days too. A lot of the time I would get the same feeling when I’m talking to close family members about emotional things I would just straight away feel sick for a few minutes. The weirdest thing about it is that I get this feeling when my family feels close. And I just remembered this today because I haven’t gotten this feeling for a few years since I was little but I woke up with this exact feeling again and also it’s Easter and my family feels closer so idk if that’s why. If you know what this feeling is please let me know.
How do I overcome my trauma bond and stop the attraction to abusers?,21,mj76sj,3,"Looking for advice on overcoming my trauma-bonded attraction to abusive people?

I have been diagnosed with C-PTSD. I am in treatment and I feel like I am learning to understand my condition and move forward. The one thing that I cannot seem to make any progress with is my attraction to abusive people. 

I grew up in a violent home and went on to have violent relationships. Learning about C-PTSD and the reasoning behind my symptoms has improved my life in all but one area: the trauma bond. All the reading in the world doesn’t seem to stop me from fixating on seeking out the approval of people who treat me badly. 

I am consistently drawn to intimate relationships in which I find myself trying to earn a partner’s approval. I cannot make any sense of this because it does not seem to follow any pattern. If I date a person who treats me badly, 99% of the time I will just stop seeing that person because I recognise that they do not treat me respectfully and that there is no point in pursuing the relationship.

However, the other 1% of the time, the person will hold some kind of mesmerising power over me where I find myself preoccupied with earning their approval. This never, ever ends well. It always ends in exactly the same way: I keep seeing the person who treats me badly and that person continues to treat me badly. I end up feeling terrible about myself, yet I am drawn to this person by an insatiable craving to earn their approval. The illogic of my attraction is compounded by the fact that there is nothing special about the people whose approval I am obsessed with: on the contrary, the abusive people I am drawn to tend to be less successful than other people I am not drawn to. It makes no sense.

I believe that I am living with the effects of trauma bonding. I am at a complete loss on how to stop fixating on abusers. Can other people give me some advice on how they overcome their trauma bond?"
"I grew up abused all my life,",10,mj7ktb,2,"I'm not even sure if I have CPTSD but I'm pretty damn sure just haven't been to a specialist yet but I'm all kinds of seriously fucked up. 


I was sexually abused, mentally abused, physically, etc and have been all my life, all by people I trusted and thought were good people.


And now I'm worried I'll be like this the rest my life"
I ran into my mother yesterday and I have a bad freeze response.,47,mj6zto,13,"I hadnt seen her in about 3 years but yesterday I ran into her. I am too bad to type the whole story now but I ended up avoiding a conversation with her and told her no. I cycled off. At first I was fine and was proud for avoiding a very triggering situation. But since yesterday evening I keep seeing her awful face in front of me and I feel paralyzed. I am so triggered. I came from my dads and he also told me that the night before this she came to his house drunk late at night.

I dont know what yo do now I feel so terrible"
Were you manipulated into not telling anyone?,29,mj6vfy,15,"Growing up, my parent used all kinds of techniques to stop me saying anything to anyone about the abusive environment caused by them and my stepparent.

\-If you tell them the truth, they'll find out how bad you are and that it's all your fault.

\-You're a liar and an attention seeker - that didn't happen.

\-You will get your siblings taken away forever.

\-You'll end up in a foster home which is worse.

\-No one will want to talk to you, everyone will look at you like you have problems.

\-Nothing is really wrong, it's just little mistakes, and if you just learn to behave it will get better.

\-Things are getting better, I've thought of X,Y,Z way to calm (stepparent) down so it won't happen again.

It's so frustrating to think about how scared I was to trust and talk to anyone. Just wondering if any of you also experienced this?"
If someone (important to me) doesn’t tell me something (that I think it’s worth sharing) I feel like I’ve been abandoned by them.,16,mj5mhm,10,"As title says, this is happening a lot lately with a person that is important to me (I also know that I’m important to them because they told me and I trust them). 

I think it is also increased by the fact that we can’t see each other since a month and for the next 5 months. Because we are in different countries. 

If anyone has also felt like this, please share :)"
I feel completely disconnected lately and I dont know what Im doing wrong,3,mj55nt,6,"This last year has been a big healing journey for me, one where I feel Ive gotten very far, for a better life. But this last month Ive been feeling completely out of sync, dissociated and Im having alot of social anxiety, anxiety attacks and flashbacks. 
I wake up in the morning feeling EXTREMELY angry and it lasts for hours. The anger and the anxiety is the worst parts.  I dont look forward to anything, I dont want to do anything but doing nothing is terrible aswell, as I cant get a moment alone from my negative thoughts. Its frustrating - I was getting so good and turning my negative thought patterns into positive, healing ones.

I dont understand why its happening and what Im doing wrong. I dont know what Im so angry about all the time. I dont know if Im depressed again, I doesnt feel like it did before. I still do my school and my work. I still see my friends and my boyfriend. I just dont really enjoy it like I used to."
I had the worst meltdown ever yesterday.,7,mj4h28,3,"One of my brothers blindsided me, my other brothers support him. As a result my job is in jeopardy, we (4yo and me) may lose our home, at the very least I'm going to be about £1.5k in debt by next month, rising every month after. I'm going to have £25 to pay bills and buy food for the next 8 weeks. Its not doable. This after I paid £600 I didn't have for his therapy to help him get where he is.


So I fucked them all up too. Let the council know one of my brothers is a convicted paedophile and there's supposed to be stipulations, he's not following them. 


I let the landlady of their establishment know that the other ""partner"" in this business has been left off the loan applications, because he's an alcoholic that has embezzled thousands, most recently two weeks ago, the embezzling two weeks ago ended with him driving across several times while drunk as fuck, nearly killing himself and others. 

 He's got an arrest sheet as long as my entire body and isn't allowed to be running a business, obviously. I also sent in tips about the fraud they're committing. 


It was a bad meltdown and I will probably feel awful for it later. But not that awful, because I'm facing serious debt thanks to these guys."
Cptbs vs DID,2,mj4gnv,11,"Hi everyone,
I have a question that is almost haunting me. How do your feel and describe your parts like inner child and know it's not DID?

Do you feel you get harassed / sexually harassed more by men as a CPTSD individual?,4,mj42o9,3,"Do you feel you are targeted more for sexual harassment than normal healthy people?

DAE find nothing works?,6,mj3zsv,4,"I've been to therapists and I'm always discharged with a letter stating I'm 'psychologically minded'. No idea what that means. Theyre always pushing getting a job.

Basically I have my appointments we talk about my past etc but I dont get better. I'm not afraid to look at my past or bring it up. I never have been. I know it wasnt my fault but it makes no difference. I just have this constant sense of impending doom. Everywhere I see people I feel my survival threatened and get this strong continuous physiological response and its exhausting so I've stopped leaving the house and as a result i find i can keep my fight flight system in check. So here's the thing, all people are my triggers, men, women and teenagers. Basically the only thing that doesnt give me a fight flight response are young children and babies. .I'm hyper vigilant 24/7. You see there was no patterns to the abuse I suffered as it was continuous so clearly my subconscious thinks i need protecting 24/7. No amount of self talk helps. I can tell myself a thousand times no one is gonna attack me but it doesnt help. The trouble is its ruining my future. Exposure doesnt work. I need my cognitive centres back so I can study from home and  be able to work from home."
UK Q: does your GP know you’re getting trauma therapy / have CPTSD?,6,mj3z9w,4,"I minimised my trauma/mental health for so long, I didn’t want to be dismissed or invalidated any further when I finally realised I needed help, so I’ve been paying for private trauma therapy for the last few months.

I was wondering if anyone else in the UK has told their GP, even in hindsight? It makes so much sense of my medical history, I thought it might be useful for them to know, to help others spot patterns, or improve the way trauma is approached?

My experience is that not all GPs are trauma informed (...I wasn’t even trauma informed until 6 months ago) so I would never have said ‘I have trauma’, or been asked about trauma/life events. I’m so used to the efficient ‘ok, let’s rule this out / let’s do this test’ etc GP mannerism, it’s all added to my survival mode/I’m fine/minimisation.

It’s only when I went to a dentist recently and I said I hadn’t been for about 10 years (it was actually 18 but I was embarrassed to say that), she put down her notes, came and sat by me, made eye contact and said ‘ok, is there anything that’s happened that led to this. Is there anything you’d like to let me know about’ and I was like AHA! Trauma informed healthcare!! I cried on the way home out of pure relief of being asked!

I’m wondering whether to write out a trauma history linked to my medical notes and hand it to my GP just so they know the long term pattern that can be caused by CPTSD, and so there’s a record of the missed opportunities for seeing this kind of trauma pattern earlier."
My Mind is Crowded,12,mj3oc8,4,"There’s so much that goes through my head as I’m trying to fall asleep. Every night is a fight against calming my thoughts. A fight to to get a good night’s sleep. Most days I wake up groggy and my brain is foggy.

Yesterday was different as I woke up with a clear mind and unusually high energy. I felt good. I made sure to get as much done as I could before I eventually succumbed to triggering thoughts and my mind trying to defend itself from past threats it thinks are real.

I haven’t moved on from my mother’s death yet. It happened when I was 12. I’m getting better, figuring things out. But I still seem to be stuck on many things that happened to me. Working through it is difficult. Worth it, but admittedly very tiring.

I hope I can eventually go through most days without being on constant alert. I hope my brain will be clearer, and I can focus better. At some point, I’m sure…"
I don't know how to articulate what it is about how I was raised that was wrong or how it hurt me,5,mj3nud,3,"Edit: nevermind this is a rant
I'm looking for any articles or videos or just your own suggestions and comments on what to tell my mother to make her understand that what she has done to me is not okay (hitting me, lashing out in anger at me, etc.). She always uses the excuses that 

- she's a ""single mother"" to me and my younger sister(she's not, my dad is very much alive, we used to go to his place every other weekend before the pandemic, he pays child support, used to pay alimony, my mom has no job, he checks on us by text and actually listens and has apologized for being an alcoholic, neglectful, always at work when we were younger, acknowledged that he has hurt us), 
- how she's going through a hard time because she struggles with depression (so do I and my sister and my dad, I even used to cut myself, which she knows about), 
- how her mom just died two weeks ago (she was MY grandma and we actually had a good relationship unlike her and my mom and she raised my sister and I from ages 12~17 when the pandemic hit),
- I ""have an attitude problem"" since I was 13 (when I stopped being a cute kid that listens to whatever they're told and started to defend myself instead of just crying and taking the abuse because of the sudden realization that I COULD defend myself and wanted/deserved better)

et cetera et cetera. Sorry this is unorganized she just came into my room and we had a little ""talk""/argument. It's midnight and I can't talk about it right now, my brain is everywhere. I just want it to stop. I just want my ""good"" relationship with my mom back, even if it wasn't actually good and was actually abusive, but I can't go back to being that child that thought how I was being treated was okay and I just need to support mommy and she'll love me properly and take care of me so making her understand is my only chance. Please just help me. I don't care if it's advice or emotional support or you tell me the relationship is unsalvageable I just need something right now."
DAE get intense hyperfixations?,55,mj3mct,11,"First post in this subreddit (and reddit as a whole actually!) Hope it’s relatively coherent.

I have dissociative tendencies and fiction has forever been my main escape route when everything else has been chaotic or upsetting. I tend to “binge” on media I find comforting or interesting for days on end instead of addressing other, arguably more important things. 

Sometimes I’ll get properly obsessed with a franchise, and I’ll have difficulty focusing or talking about anything else. More specifically, I’ll get obsessed with one character within the franchise.
Hyperfixations to do with specific characters are a lot more intense and visceral, and I feel like I’m in love (whatever that’s supposed to feel like) with this idea, this concept of a person.

It gets painful sometimes, and I’ve have (or almost) cried for the sole reason that they’re not real/ not happy/ dead. I sometimes separate myself from the people around me because they’d take me out of the fantasy I desperately wish to live in. I don’t hate them, not at all, they just don’t fit.

I’m currently in the throes of another fictional crush right now and I wanted to know if it’s normal for people with cptsd or just another part of being a teenager."
Does failing to reduce harm to others negate the efforts in trying to do same?,1,mj3d8h,2,"Not a day where im not trying. Not a week that im not in therapy or medicated. 

Does my failure to be a productive calm member of society mean i am failing?

Am i kidding myself when i say my maladptive coping strategies are better than nothing?"
I constantly feel that I am unworthy of living a life and that I better give it to others.,1,mj351i,1,"CPTSD has turned me from a human to a house-elf who exist only to serve others. We are so used to give away everything that we can't keep anything for ourselves, not even our own lives. I am coming out of a long battle with depression and finally at a place where I feel okay. Now my automatic response is to tell myself that probably some other trauma is waiting for me in the corner so I don't need to be complacent or I tell myself to rest because some time later, I might have to fight for some more issues."
What's the line between a normal and abusive home?,3,mj34rp,4,"I grew up in a severely abusive home but I was told the whole time that it was normal, to the point I grew up not having any idea why I felt the way I did - CPTSD, dissociation, amnesia, trauma, feeling separated and distant from others. 

Just wondering what you feel is the difference between a normal and abusive home? Obviously nothing's perfect, but where is the line drawn?"
I’m jealous of people who can engage during therapy and talk about things and grow,4,mj330f,8,"I’ve been in therapy for a decade. I really like my current therapist. She knows about dissociation and trauma. She should be able to help me. But... all I do is dissociate and struggle to verbalize my emotions and experiences. And I have heavy emotional amnesia unless it’s about 2am and I’m alone. I’m wasting her time. My trauma literally wasn’t even that fucking bad. I’m embarrassed about how poorly my brain is coping with it. I see everyone else here with trauma that’s significantly worse and then I look at myself and yeah. It’s just embarrassing. 

I feel like a lost cause."
When Does It Get Better?,2,mj32gr,5,"Everyone keeps saying that. Everyone keeps telling me that it gets better eventually. All of my family keeps telling me to stick it out, that if I can just pull myself up and get working that it'll get better and every day feels so, so much worse. My friends say that to make things better I need to make major changes in my life but when I tried that I ended up hospitalized against my will and now my counselors think I'm crazy. My mom said she might need to get a guardianship on me, and I don't think I can stress enough how viscerally terrifying that idea is.

I was supposed to be on a plane today. I had a ticket to go to a friend's house and she was going to help me, and then everything happened and my mother said she'd get a restraining order on my friend and get conservatorship over me and when I tried to tell the counselors at the hospital how badly I needed to leave they said that I was a danger to myself.

I keep having nightmares and despite that I'd rather stay asleep because sometimes they really feel better than this does. I've tried so many different things and somehow it's all managed to make things worse. How did I fuck up so badly? How can I actually make this better? I'm so paralyzed by guilt and sadness and anger that I can hardly function and I'm so so scared that if I seek help they're going to put me back in the hospital but I can't keep living like this. I can't talk about this to anyone because I'm scared they're either going to use me and manipulate me or I'm going to be sent away again. I can't wake up. I can't even stand the thought of doing something with my life anymore. I don't know where to start to make any of this get better."
The 2 Main Types Of Narcissism And How To Spot The Difference,3,mj2p2y,2,"Hopefully this is helpful for people who have been confused if their parent is a narcissist, because they don't display grandiose narcissist traits that mainstream media always talk about. I was confused at the beginning of my healing journey because my mother is a vulnerable narcissist and she didn't fit mainstream grandiose narcissist behaviours.

And hopefully this is useful for people who are living with their narcissist, so they can form different coping strategies once they can identify which type the abuser is.

watching kid shows to feel safe?,8,mj2hgi,3,"idk if this is considered age regression i dont really act like a kid it just makes me feel safe and secure lmao. or ill want to do specific things i did in childhood like play nintendogs ( on the DS. ) fall asleep to cartoons, i still sleep with the blanket i had got when i was born. yeah, idk."
"Does anyone feel safer in little, dark spaces?",17,mj297l,15,"I used to hide in small spaces for fun as a child (I felt safe, and I made lots of sheet tents), during the bad years I used to hide in the bathroom, I feel safer in darkish, closed little spaces, to the point where I'm seriously thinking of making a ""panic closet"" when I live on my own.

I dunno if anyone else feels safer like this, or how can I reproduce this in my room(I don't have space in my closet), or why I feel safer when I do feel claustrophobic in some spaces(it has to be the ""right one""."
Anyone else thinks they are very unfunny/ annoying/ odd?,20,mj1r1s,5,"This is connected to my trauma. I’m very hesitant to speak freely about my ideas and thoughts and especially to joke around. I have so much shame connected to my sense of humour. I know it’s unreasonable because gaging from other people’s reactions, I’m pretty funny, but anytime I make a joke and then realise it’s not the funniest or don’t hear anyone laugh, I get a little bit triggered. My initial trauma stems from the neglect and abandonment in my family but I was traumatised again at the age of 12-13 when I lost all of my many friends at school when people started telling me I was too odd and unfunny (which was more because of ADHD hyperactivity and lack of awareness that came with CPTSD at the time). Whenever I’m being funny, or laughing, or sharing my thoughts, I always get fearful at the back of my mind. I get scared that I’m unlovable at those times and I need reaffirmation from people that I’m okay.

It has gotten much better over the past few years though. I used to never express myself through humour and very rarely speak my true thoughts. Now I’m much more brave when it comes to expression and sometimes I really don’t care what the other person thinks because I’m just having fun. At the same time I’ve become a little more socially aware, so it helps to sometimes stop myself from saying something that doesn’t fit the situation."
"intense ""waiting anxiety""",2,mj1q99,3,"every saturday i have a  class at 1 that my fmaily pays for and that im doing completely of my own volition. i dont need the class but im too scared to end it. even though i have normal class during the week, starting wed thurs or fri i start to get really anxious about it. this morning i have the day off but i woke up thinking it was saturday, anxious about this stupid hour long class. i cant relax right now because im thinking about it. i dont know why it being on the weekend makes it so much more stressful. how do i deal with this?? im not a busy person, my teachers cool (although im always scared im wasting her time and boring her), and i shouldnt be this fucking stressed about it. maybe im just constantly anxious and my brain needs something to cling to to be anxious about.

ive seen waiting mode talked about on this sub so im wondering if anyone else experiences what i described and how to deal with it?"
DEA feel guilty when using disability accommodations/resources even when told your CPTSD qualifies?,5,mj1cna,5,"I spent a year trying to get disability accommodations through my university and finally got them recently. All my requests were approved plus some stuff I didn’t even ask for so logically I know the psychologist at the disability office thinks my stuff qualifies. 

And yet here I am, debating possibly getting a D in a class instead of asking to take a quiz that I missed due to an anxiety attack a day late because I asked for a similar thing earlier this week and “I am taking advantage”. Am I the only one?"
DAE grow up with an inconsistent parent? (Possible TW?),6,mj1ay9,7,"My mom was my best friend a lot of the time, but when she was bad she could be pretty nasty to me verbally. I wish I could remember specific instances but I can only remember a few that stick out which is weird because I’m only 24.. I would be in my room after school every day and I’d judge whether or not I should come out and say hi to her based on how she responded to the dog greeting her at the door. Her moods were very unpredictable and it felt like a game for me almost, having to decide what to do and navigate around her. I was a very rude and rebellious preteen and teen though so I can’t say it’s 100% her fault. 

She also made things about her a lot of the time because she had an eating disorder and had to weigh every piece of food she ate, would only eat a few specific foods and would not eat anything that wasn’t from home. I think this caused me to act out a lot and want attention. All it did however was make her disapprove of me so I don’t know why I did it. Clearly it wasn’t working the way I wanted it to. 

We had a lot of great, funny and sweet times together but the other times were the complete opposite. I have fond memories of us having movie nights, comforting me when I was sad, her taking me to the mall to buy me the clothes I wanted and sharing laughs. I also have memories of things she said to me that still fill me with shame and anger. Her relationship with my dad is the same. Anyone else?"
Shitty people make me hate myself even more,2,mj19hf,5,"I decided to do something for myself and I booked a boudoir shoot with a specific theme for Valentine’s Day.

DAE feel like you need to “buy” love?,43,mj0vmp,13,"Ever since I can remember I’ve felt like I need to give *something* (sex, drugs, money, presents, whatever) to people in my life in order to make them stay. Even if it’s not asked for, I still feel like I have to because I don’t know what it’s like to have someone just love me because of who I am, not what I can do or give them. I don’t know how to make it stop. I want people to just love me, to care just because they care, but I’m too afraid to try and have them leave so I’m constantly doing whatever I can to make sure they want me around. It doesn’t matter how damaged I get in the process, as long as someone wants me around for something then that’s enough right? It doesn’t matter how exhausting it is for me, how much I give up, how much it hurts, it’s better than being alone"
My outsides don't match my insides,6,mj0qq7,2,"I'm having a hard time. 

I don't know how to ask for and accept help, so saying here right now I'm having a hard time is the best I'm able. I'm very much struggling with my self image post divorce. I'm not dating and have lost contact with most of my friends from a life long ago. 

I hear I'm pretty. I'm tall. I'm curvy.  I remember being talked about, but not to me... more like I was a topic of discussion to my parents. ""She's so pretty. So mature. She looks so much older."" As though my breasts and hips and ass were a compliment. Something I had earned. Something of merit. 

I guess I feel bad and wish that I had more advanced skills to soothe myself from this. Pardon the outcry for appearance based validation"
Silliness as a coping skill. Hear me out.,5,mj0qil,5,"I've got some pretty heavy shit in my head. I know you do too. It can be pretty dark and extremely stressful and full of despair.

You ever try to listen to something ridiculously silly while you feel this way? Something that you know will make you laugh?

I know you really don't want to when you feel bad because you're not in the mood...

But I want you to do something right now and just see if my stupid little coping skill works for you. I want you to go on YouTube and create a playlist of just a couple of things that you know will make you laugh. Watch it the next time you're having a flashback or just having a hard time and tell me what you think. I know it feels like it's stupid maybe a bad idea and goes against the grain because you really don't want to look at something funny when you're having a flashback but just try it out.

If anybody wants to know the kind of stuff that I watch or listen to that makes me laugh just let me know"
My (27F) boyfriend (23M) had a panic attack at a social gathering at his house at 2 am and his housemates decided to get me out of the house without his permission which has severely triggered my CPTSD since.,1,mj0mub,13,"TLDR: My boyfriend of 2 years had a severe panic attack at a social gathering at his house that he shares with 3 people, they then decided at 2 am that he needed to be alone in his room, where at the time I was in bed, asleep so they came in and started picking up my stuff, woke me up and asked me to leave. I feel traumatised and am still having nightmares about it despite therapy.

Trigger Warning for a brief mention of rape and childhood abuse.

Okay so this situation is messy and the post is long, I'm sorry for that in advance.

I live in the same suburb as my partner who lives with 3 housemates, one of which is my good friend and the other two I get along with but one of them is quite cold to me sometimes. During COVID lockdowns last year things got weird and he said the cold one of them does not like me and that was what was making it hard to have me in their house or for him to visit me during lockdowns. I got really suicidal as I was alone in my apartment for sometimes a whole week with no human contact which was really hard when he lived like a 5-minute walk down the road (not hyperbole), but I would try my best to make do and failed quite a bit. I try not to be too hard on myself because I have CPTSD from childhood abuse and rape when was a teen. My boyfriend knows all about it. Sometimes I would call him up late at night crying because I started having these weird panic attacks, I asked him and my friend to leave me alone at times because I felt so rejected and scared, they came over a few times when it got really bad but were saying they felt they didn't have the capacity to support me. I was really confused as I was seeing a counsellor, meditating and exercising, and didn't want to talk about being depressed or my trauma or anything I just wanted to spend time with other human beings and like watch TV or play board games instead of just sitting on zoom meetings or talking to my cat. I felt like my traumas were coming out because I was alone all day and I think they tried to understand but felt it was a bit much I think. I think it was hard for me to understand because they were so close by.

My partner still tried to visit me when he could but would often have to leave at short notice if he got a text that there was a housemate dinner on or something he had to do the next day. I cried a lot after this happened quite a few times and I told him that this felt really ""fucked up"" to me. He has told me recently that was very traumatising for him. I feel terrible about that and have apologised. But after lockdown when I could see other friends and go back to normal a bit, our relationship became more peaceful and his love and affection for me seemed to deepen, but he still didn't have me over at his house as much as he stayed at mine (which in some cases was like 5 nights a week) which wasn't really that much of a problem but it did mean his housemates didn't really see us be couply I guess, and he told me not to come to some ""housemate exclusive"" events which I thought was weird just because they were like in public spaces and I never experienced that with past partners. But he insists that those relationships are important to him and he just doesn't want to make anyone uncomfortable. I don't really understand to be honest as they would sometimes invite me to parties or things of their own accord so I thought we were all friends.

I'm still traumatised by the lockdown and confused by all this dynamic though, I guess but I tried really hard to make amends if the error was on my end, after lockdown, I got everyone Christmas presents and gave everyone gifts for their birthdays, I helped out around the house when I was allowed over and on projects or things they needed.

But after a few months post lockdown and still feeling things were a bit strange, with his permission, I spoke to my good friend in the house and she said it was awkward as they were like a soundboard for our relationship so she felt like maybe that influenced them not wanting me around a bit, and one of them not liking me very much, but she could see how unfair that was and that she still loved me and wants to include me and support our relationship. I was telling her how lovely and supportive we had been lately and how I was in such a good place with him and so happy and in love in the relationship, to be honest, so the soundboard thing was a bit of a surprise to me post-lockdown anyway, she was a bit uncomfortable and shocked and said oh okay really? I blamed myself, as to be fair I did distance myself from her (and the rest of the house) quite a bit after lockdown and I apologised for that. She was so receptive though and said yeah that she did the wrong thing in lockdown letting me be alone in the apartment when they obviously could have just walked down the road or invited me over. I said hey that's okay, my mental health is my responsibility and you don't have to apologise for your mental health either. So things were all good.

My partner had been having panic attacks as well in January and February that they didn't like him and didn't want to live with him anymore, so to be honest, I sort of treated the whole situation as not my business as much as I possibly could and tried to support him while still distancing myself a bit from them. I did tell him though it's probably not normal to be this involved and this bothered by your housemates and their needs, he is close friends with them though so I understand how that complicates things. Further, in January his parents announced they are getting divorced so that really took the wind out of his sails.

Then a month and a half ago my partner, while at a small gathering at his house, started to hyperventilate big time, his eyes were like rolling around in his skull and he was saying he couldn't feel his body, and complaining that everyone hated him in the house and that he had to leave. I asked him to stop drinking alcohol and come and sit in his room with me, we sat in his room and I rubbed his back for him, gave him a kiss on the forehead and asked if he wanted me to leave him alone or to stay with him if I needed to go turn the music down if we should leave, go for a walk, go to my place, whatever he needed. He basically was unresponsive, so I just went and turned the music down and told the one who is cold to me, who is closest to him in the house, that he was feeling unwell. She said she understood and was supportive of me getting people to leave him alone. I brought him some food and water and he seemed to want me to leave him alone so I did. Then I couldn't help but be anxious about his panic attack, like the physical symptoms of it, so I came back and asked him if he wanted to go to my place or go to bed, he said no and he then got up and left his room and went out and said he should be fine now. I then asked if I could lie down as I was tired and go to sleep and he said sure, I'll see you later.

I lie down on the bed and google his symptoms and debated calling an ambulance but was so anxious, I didn't want to embarrass him or make a big deal though, so I then just fell asleep. I woke up and one of the party guests was rubbing my back and said I had screamed in my sleep and she just wanted to see if I was alright. I had no memory, or idea of what was going on and said I must have had a night terror, I hadn't had one for years, the last one was in 2013 when I was with my ex-partner so I was pretty shocked. She just laughed and said oh you're alright then and gave me a hug and turned off the light and left again. I was a bit anxious as I didn't know where my boyfriend was but was so tired I just fell back asleep. The next thing I knew the housemate I am good friends with is shaking me awake, she is quickly gathering my things from the floor and said 'hey, your boyfriend needs his room right now okay? you need to go home now'. I was bleary-eyed, straight out of deep sleep and asked what was going on, she seemed to get frustrated and just said 'you know this is his room, and he is allowed to want to be alone, so if he needs it then you need to leave, okay?', I started to cry and I said 'hey he is an adult, can he just come to talk to me first?'. She said 'I know he is an adult but he has a right to be left alone' and so I asked her to leave me alone to gather my things, she had brought another party guest, another good friend of mine, with her and as I started crying as she walked out and my other friend came up to me and whispered to me 'oh don't worry your boyfriend is just passed out somewhere I think, we're all going home now I think that's all'. I asked her where he was and if he was alright and she said 'yeah he's fine I think he's just fallen asleep somewhere in another room'.

I felt so overwhelmed, I got my stuff and searched the parts of the house I could access and then when I could see them coming towards me trying to hustle me out, I walked out to the front yard and then onto the street to start walking home. It's 3am, but I'm so overwhelmed and scared right now, adrenaline is starting to pump, tears are pouring down my cheeks, I just decided the best thing I could do was get out in case I was making things worse by being upset. My good friend went out to the front of the house and yelled at me from the front porch 'I really care about your safety please let us drive you home'. The housemate who is cold to me came out and yelled 'can we just let her go, she can just text us when she gets home'. I was really scared. Everyone had been drinking and so I didn't want to get in a car with a drunk driver so I just said 'it's all good, I'm walking thanks!', then one of the party guests (the one who came in and checked on me after my nightmare) asks she can walk with me, I say yeah sure. So she takes my hand and walks me home, I asked her what happened while I was asleep, she said she doesn't really know what is going on but that my boyfriend was having another panic attack after I fell asleep and was sobbing about his parent's divorce. She said she really didn't feel like this had anything to do with me and that my boyfriend flipped out basically and she said hey it's okay that you're upset, just go home and have a cup of tea.

When we got to my apartment building, the housemate I am good friends with, the other housemate (not the one who is cold to me) and my other friend were in a car out front, staring straight ahead, they didn't get out or see if I was alright they just were staring straight ahead. I went up to them and my friend rolled down the window, they then asked if I 'wanted anything, if I was alright', and I just asked like 'I'm sorry for being upset but like I don't understand what was going on, like why did this happen? is my boyfriend okay?' and the housemate I am good friends with just yelled back at me 'I just did what I was asked to do okay? I didn't mean to upset you okay? this isn't my fault'. Then I said 'hey look, I'm really upset by this okay, like why is no one telling me what is going on, I don't know what is going on', and then the other housemate said 'hey look let's just go to sleep okay this isn't really the time'. I said I was sorry, and I stood back, the guest got in the car and I sat on the curb and started crying and they drove off. I sat there for a good while until about 4am and then got up, and went upstairs. I messaged my boyfriend to just send me a dot or an emoji if he was still okay and that I loved him. I couldn't sleep though.

I've had no sleep and then at 1 pm the next day he comes over and he gives me back my apartment key and says he needs to take a break in the relationship to focus on his mental health as he had a ""manic episode"" the night before and flipped out. Said he isn't happy with himself or the relationship right now. He said he fell asleep in a housemate's bedroom, the one who is cold to me, on her floor after having a panic attack which was made worse when he heard me scream, he said he had a long chat with her then he was asleep so missed out on them kicking me out. Said he had nothing to do with that and did not ask them to do it. I said um okay, I'm traumatised, can you please go see a counsellor as I don't think we can be in a relationship or even friends without addressing this incident as that was one of the most bizarre experiences of my life and I've experienced some bizarre stuff already. Since then I've been having nightmares of being like thrown out of buildings or seeing him getting murdered and not being able to help him. I've tried to distance myself from my relationship with him and his housemates but I still see him a couple of times a week to have dinner. I don't consider myself in a romantic relationship with him anymore and he agrees that yeah it isn't going to work if these things are happening. But we still tell each other we love each other and support each other quite a bit emotionally, just no sex or romance of course though. I'm concerned that he still hasn't gone to the doctor or gone to therapy. I've told him he needs to go soon and he agrees.

The one who is my good friend, when I've seen her at events we've both been invited to since, and she has like come up to me and said hi, she even got me an easter egg. She said she loves me so much and is sorry that she 'isn't the friend I need right now'. But I haven't really talked with her about it, I just apologised for upsetting her. Interestingly the other two housemates have ignored me completely at those events. I'm just going to say in case someone asks, they seem fine, happy, all have jobs, go out, see friends, exercise, a lot of social media blabbing about friends and loving each other and all that stuff. It was my boyfriend's birthday a few weeks ago and they threw him a party and invited me but I didn't go as I didn't want to upset anyone. I don't have their story but other people at the party say that they were complaining about our relationship and asking him to break up with me because they are sick of him ""using them as an excuse not to hang out with me or be supportive of me"". That made me really uncomfortable to hear as I'm not sure where that would be coming from or what they meant by it or why they would talk like that. And I also would rather people not be having a running commentary on my relationship, even though I know these things are somewhat unavoidable, people comment on their friends all the time.

I've said to my now ex, that if we are going to continue in a relationship even just as friends that I would prefer if he stops speaking to them about our relationship and to not invite their opinion of it ever again, especially the cold one, who was the most vocal that night about getting me out of the house apparently. I asked him to seek out his other friends or his family for a sounding board and support and to please, please see a therapist. He doesn't agree that he shouldn't speak to them but he does agree that he should see a therapist. He doesn't think the cold one (or any of them) would try to hurt me. But I don't know what to think. Last night an acquaintance who literally met us all once before, asked how our relationship was going and as soon as I said we weren't together because of a lot of different pressures right now, this person of her own accord brought up the cold housemate's name came up as they said oh his housemate, she's a bit mean to you isn't she. I think it was because yeah she does say mean things sometimes and it is noticeable. But she's really protective and a good friend to him and to others, so I don't feel comfortable asking him to distance himself from her. I've never had problems like this with partners friends in my previous long term relationship so yeah I don't really know what to do about her other than be nice.

Why this is still my problem is my friendship groups are all mixed together, close friends of mine are close friends with them so I have to see them at things. And I keep having panic attacks about that night despite seeking therapy, it's not working yet. I even have small panic attacks at events they aren't at sometimes because someone mentions one of their names. I'll just silently start crying and have to excuse myself and go cry in the bathroom or my friends will cuddle me. My close friends who are friends with them just say they made a mistake, they aren't bad people but they just made a mistake and I just, like I don't understand how you make this kind of a mistake unless they think bad things about me to some extent. I've asked my now ex-boyfriend for answers and he says he doesn't understand either. Says they were trying to do the right thing, seems like a miscommunication happened. And I've said that I would really appreciate him digging deep and figuring out what went wrong as I don't think what happened was the right thing for him and I, and our relationship as people. He said he feels that it isn't that big of a deal though and says maybe it is just an incompatibility thing. I'm not so sure. But I'm patient in letting him try to figure it out. He says he wants us all to be friends again, and for me to form a bond with his housemates but he doesn't want to force anything, of course, and I said look that is all up to you from here on out.

I think this triggered my cPTSD a bit hence the nightmares and panic attacks and sometimes agoraphobia, but yeah I hope I am doing the right thing in giving him the benefit of the doubt here.

TLDR: My boyfriend of 2 years had a severe panic attack at a social gathering at his house that he shares with 3 people, they then decided at 2 am that he needed to be alone in his room, where at the time I was in bed, asleep so they came in and started picking up my stuff, woke me up and asked me to leave. I feel traumatised and am still having nightmares about it despite therapy."
Feeling unhappy in my relationship with a CPTSD person,1,mj0llf,2,"I've been dating someone with CPTSD for nearly a year now. Things were great when we were talking to each other online and even when we met in person, I thought things were fine. We moved in together at the end of last year but I'm not sure the relationship is working out for either of us.

The main issue is because of her CPTSD and perhaps some other mental issues, she doesn't seem to experience positive emotions very strongly at all, which means she's never motivated to do anything. She doesn't have a job and just plays video games all the time but never feels like doing much with me. I can't tell how much she actually gets out of the relationship. And because she moved to a different state to live with me, she doesn't have Medicaid and has no access to a therapist.

And because she has generally operated at a level of being emotionally numb for a lot of her life, I'm not sure she understands that I have emotional needs I want fulfilled? She's more lively whenever she drinks because I feel like it allows her to loosen up and experience emotions more freely but she's an alcoholic so I'm also in this position where I have to monitor her alcohol intake.

Overall though, I don't know if we're good for each other? She says I provide emotional comfort for her but also it sometimes doesn't even feel like we're in a relationship with each other.

I don't know if this kind of emotional numbness is common with CPTSD people but it just leaves me wondering if I'll ever be able to have a normal relationship with her. I'm just not sure how to help her. I feel like she had more support in her home state but I don't know how much she's attached to me? How do I even best help her?"
Does anyone else have substance issues?,8,mj0cqp,9,"I know it’s a symptom and stuff but how many of you guys abuse substance? It used to make me feel good and now it doesn’t make me good anymore and I can’t stop using it. Any tips? I notice that when triggers and stuff happen I usually instinctively wanna get high or drink sometimes

Edit: I want to add more emotion. I’ve gone through so many cycles of wanting to get high and then as soon as I get high I hate myself. It scares me because sometimes I see how much smoking hurts my body and I still can’t stop. There’s always an excuse and always one last time. My ideal self is sober. I’m not an adult but I certainly abuse substance all the time. I know when I get triggered or a flashback my instant response is to suppress it."
"Sometimes I feel like I don't make actual progress in therapy, because so often I just spend the whole time crying",13,mj05a7,7,"Seriously, 90% of the time in therapy I'm a slobbering, blubbering, sobbing mess of a human. It's probably because she's one of the only people I feel safe enough to be that vulnerable in front of. I worry that with my other friends they don't have the emotional bandwidth to handle the intensity of my emotions when I'm in that state so I often don't share with them, I really only feed them scraps.

Also I'm at that point in my 12 step programs where I'm going to be making amends soon and I don't know how it's not going to be a self-degradation fest because man I am so fucking ashamed and resentful for the person I was when I was drinking and using. I feel like I've used up all of my emotional, financial, and adult help allowance from my family so I can't let them in on how bad things are getting.

I know I'm doing the hard work, I know logically that it's good I'm doing this grieving process and it's part of my healing, but I can't help but feel bad for my therapist for having to constantly see me as a mess. I get so tired of being in crisis. I just want like 3 months where I'm not in crisis, where I don't feel overwhelmed by all the ways my life is falling apart and how emotionally unstable I can be sometimes.

For the record, I'm on the best medication cocktail I've ever been on, I have a great group of friends and maybe theoretically I could lean on them or my family if I wanted, but I still feel I used it all up when I was drinking and drugging and I don't want to be anything like that person. I go to meetings, do step work/talk with my sponsors regularly, pray/meditate, read self-help books, and try REALLY FUCKING HARD to eat regularly (and things like home cooked meals instead of fast food, which is often a struggle). So I'm literally trying my best"
Advice on how to approach therapy,1,mj050f,3,"Hey. I'm going to be starting therapy soon (hopefully after paperwork and all) and was wondering if you guys had any ideas or suggestions on how to appraoch this. I hear that I almost have to interview them to get an idea but all of my past therapy attempts were so catastrophic of failures that I feel like taking my own advice would be a bad idea, especially since the bar is so low that simply a bad therapist is already fantastic enough in my book (which certainly would explain the viscous cycle). I've been in and out of therapy for awhile now because I have to recover after being dehumanized each time. I'm pretty sure it has to do with my schizophrenia co morbidity and the stigma attached that is leading to the dehuminization problems. Are there any cptsd specific questions I should ask? A problem I seem to run into is that my past therapists claim they can help me but then aren't able to do anything about any of my problems that I'm seeking assistance with. They never refer me out and instead just sit there like a brick wall and hope that something positive happens. Below I have some brain storming questions:

Do you know how to treat cptsd?

Are you able to work with someone who has medical trauma? 

Are you able to help someone with lifelong emotional neglect? 

I know this is truncated since I have a whole lifes worth of blank spaces to fill in but Is there anything else you guys would add? Brainstorming ideas on how to approach this will also work as well considering the missing whole life story part and all. Thanks! 💕"
There is no nostalgia.,5,mizxtt,3,"When you have no sense of a time before.

Before the mistreatment. Abuse. Neglect.

When there just was no time before.

There was no before.

The pain just always was.

There is no sense of nostalgia.

Only pain and holes."
Is PTSD/CPTSD really common?,11,miz9ki,5,"Out of curiosity I searched ptsd and it said it’s very common. I find that hard to believe. If it’s so common, then why is it so misunderstood?"
I'm scared of being honest,2,miz19r,4,"I've been in a relationship for two years with a wonderful woman. She's kind and cares about me for who I am. 

As I get healthier and more accepting of myself I have become more aware of the people I want in my life. I like deep relationships that have meaning. I like talking with people about real things.

During this pandemic season my girlfriend moved in with me and we have been living together for 8 months.

We're not physically intimate very much anymore and I'm not enjoying her company nearly as much anymore. I'm finding I'm not interested in her as a person. I don't respect her choices. We aren't able to go deeper because she doesn't want to discuss hard things in her life or dig in spiritually.

---------

I'm scared of being honest with my feelings. I'm scared I'll hurt her with my feelings. I'm scared I don't know my feelings. I'm scared I'm just in some kind of funk and I'm not thinking clearly.

I spent most of my life not trusting my instincts and not really knowing what I'm feeling because my feelings weren't allowed in my family.

I'm so confused about what to do or how to navigate this."
I just hate myself and am triggered,15,miyzvc,9,"So I saw a meme about cptsd and it was funny and then the rest of the day I spent time panicking and remembering a bunch of shit I went through. I’ve always hated myself, I think. I’ve never wanted to be me, always wanted to be someone else. I’ve always been depressed and anxious and always told negative things.

I’m just in a spiral and I’m tired and I’m trying to be positive and do the positive things but I really want to do the negative things out of anger. I just hate my face, I have never felt valued and I can’t value myself. I’m back to obsessing about my appearance and being anxious about trash night."
Stellate Ganglion Block in AL/TN/GA?,1,miyz7l,3,"I am strongly considering getting the Stellate Ganglion Block, but the one place I’ve been in touch with so far (called Stella) is located in FL and Chicago, both about six hours from where I am in NE Alabama. I’m wondering if anyone in Alabama, NW Georgia or bordering areas of Tennessee has advice for me on how to find somewhere that does it closer to here. 

Also I have heard that some folks have been able to get insurance to cover it at least partially, any advice about that would be most welcome. I’m not even sure if it’s possible since I am on Medicare and Medicaid but if anyone knows otherwise please let me know!

In case this info helps:
- I’m not a veteran
- I’ve not been formally diagnosed with any type of PTSD, but fit allllll the specs for it and plan to follow through with a new psych & therapist and get formally tested
- I have Alabama Medicaid secondary to Medicare through Humana PPO"
I think I’m getting closer to the buried memories and I’m overwhelmed by anger and rage and feelings of such intense loss.,2,miyuvp,3,"I hardly know how to put this into words. I learned I have CPTSD about 2.5 years ago and it’s been such a difficult journey of exploration and unearthing and acknowledging childhood trauma (spiritual, physical, emotional) that led me to where I am today. Over and over, it has been clear that I deal with so many of the classic signs of childhood sexual abuse...but I have zero memories of any such thing. It’s as though I live with the results but have no proof (even the slightest) that it actually happened. It’s been a source of incredible shame and self doubt and feelings of being an imposter. There have been people throughout my life who have noticed signs and asked me if someone hurt me, but I always felt like I must be somehow deceiving people because the answer was no!

But as I’ve continued therapy in a couple forms, something seems to have shifted recently. I’m having stronger bodily reactions to the subject of CSA, and the fact that it seems so likely something happened. I feel like something awful is coming. It’s hard to explain. 

Through tears, I blurted to my therapist this week that if this did happen, and whoever it was was standing in front of me, I want to kill him. I feel like my whole life was stolen. There is so much pain and trauma that I’ve struggled with, and it feels like I have no idea who I could have been. I’ve done my absolute best, but it’s like I am in a terrifying dark hole and could never get out. 

I feel sick. I don’t want to be scared. I just want to be free, and unafraid, and able to love myself and not feel so dirty and gross."
my experience with Narc Mom,1,miyu3n,2,"I’m a currently college student, living mostly by myself, but soon to be back at home for the summer. I recently started therapy and am not diagnosed, (so I will not say I had CPTSD), but I feel as if I do relate to the symptoms of CPTSD sufferers. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells around my mother, and I couldn’t make mistakes or I would not only be attacked for what I did, but also personally attacked and put down about irrelevant things, including that no one would ever like me, or she wishes I wasn’t her child. I feel like I’m constantly being gaslighted by her, but I typically deny it because she's never neglected me and does provide food and shelter for me, and at times seems caring. It gets to me that she will typically never back down, and even though I've gotten used to and try to ignore her attacks, she continually tries to get under my skin and pick fights over the most insignificant things. Just today, I had to go finish projects for school and couldn't (nor did I want to) leave to go on a walk with her. Because of that, I was called fat (I'm below average weight...), I'm disgusting, that no one likes me, that I would never be pretty enough or have a likeable personality where someone would ever want to get married to me, etc. I'm 20, and have lived without them for about 2 years, but when I'm home, I'm not allowed to leave the house, talk to friends without being shamed, and I'm constantly location tracked. It's as if she has to have control over me, and if I try to break free from it, I'm irresponsible and selfish. I've confronted her about it, but then I'm crazy, don't know what I'm talking about, and that I'm being too sensitive. I feel a lot of guilt due to that, as any time I think I'm being dramatic and hurt by things she does and says, I think about how she has never left me to starve and helps financially with college (actually, she doesn't but my dad does). He enables it, but does not contribute too often; however, had tended to side with her more often than me as I've gotten older. I've talked to friends about this family dynamic, and have been able to tell myself and believe out that it's a part of manipulation and gaslighting, and feel like it's less of my fault. However, my instinctual emotional response or feeling extreme guilt, over apologizing, and fear when making mistakes or expressing my emotions has also bled over into other relationships. Any time a friend expresses that I could improve on something, or even just if I make a small mistake, I feel extremely amounts of guilt and my emotional response automatically makes me feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me. I have bouts when I have no motivation to do anything because of feeling worthless. I have not been diagnosed, but I have also struggled with what I strongly believe to be OCD since I was young - particularly contamination OCD. I have not been diagnosed, but I feel like I live in 2 different worlds and have daily anxiety over what things I can or can’t touch, and like I have different zones where things are safe to touch vs not safe, and the zones can’t cross. If those two zones cross, I fixate on it until I'm able to relieve the anxiety by giving into my compulsion to reverse it, and that typically will involve cleaning. Most of this time, it doesn't cause extreme anxiety since it's easily relieved of by cleaning, but it is something I do on a daily basis. I also tend to avoid going out to public places at times due to this fear. This has always been a part of my life and is pretty much a normal occurrence, but something I'm working on managing. I moved out and lived with them over the summer and am back home this week due to some family gatherings. This next summer, I will have to move back in with them while I work. I decided to reach out now because the last few days have been kind of low points, as I've just felt extremely on edge and anxious. I rarely get anxiety to the point of not being able to fixate on anything else, but it's gotten to me. Every time my mother even walks past my room, I find my heart racing a little bit and feel nervous around her. My suspected OCD also seems to get worse whenever I'm home, probably as a result of being in an environment where I'm not very comfortable. I've found myself getting more anxiety over my ""zones"" crossing, and it's been adding to my deteriorating mental state. I've always been hesitant to get very vulnerable, but I feel like I really need the extra support right now."
I’m letting my kids be kids.,17,miyaln,2,"So, I was diagnosed with CPTSD in late January. It was a shock to me. While I was being diagnosed I powered through complex PTSD from surviving to thriving and women who love too much. And it triggered me into a REALLY bad really long flashback (think weeks) where I was a mess. Functional, but a mess. 

Anyways, a lot of my trauma is from my mom. And two weeks ago I really hit the nail on the head that I never felt like my mother loved me. So I spoke through it in therapy and I’ve been reflecting. 

Anyways, my downstairs neighbor is my moms age. And acts just like her. We are all friendly and hang outside when it’s nice. But she’s also a drunk. And likes to pick fights. Last summer I was out of control and she picked a fight and it was bad. We didn’t talk for 9 months. 

Anyways, tonight while my toddlers were silently playing on their kindles sitting down she texts me about how loud my kids are. And it wakes up her granddaughter and it’s “knocking the paintings off her wall” and I tried to ask her when did it start happening (we rearranged some of their toys so there is a trampoline in the living room now. I thought it was that) but she was complaining about when we were jumping on a mat yesterday. Okay. So she’s really just not answering my question and just telling me my kids can’t be loud and this and that. And I instantly got mad. I stopped texting her because I knew I would blow up if I did. I just deleted her texts and moved on with my night. I was annoyed, sure, but I wanted to figure out why. 

It dawned on me as I was putting my toddlers to bed that what she said is something that my mom would say to me as a kid. Be quiet. Don’t do that. Don’t do this. Stop being so loud. Don’t you talk. Just everything to make me not be a kid. And I realized that I DONT want that for my kids. 

I’ve always had this like thought in my head about when the day comes and my kids act out in public and some older person makes a comment, what I would do. Obviously, my fight mode always comes out. But I realized that this situation is very similar to that thought in my head. 

So I decided that I’m not going to do anything. Am I going to continue to jump with my kids all over the living room? Likely no, let’s be real. I’m not that rude. But am I going to make them stop playing and screaming and jumping and enjoying themselves? NO! Why? Because they are TODDLERS. They should be allowed to be toddlers. Not only that, they should be allowed to be toddlers in their OWN HOME. 

So I’m giving my little toddler self a hug right now and I’m going to allow my kids to be kids because they deserve it. They don’t need to conform to societies standards of being quiet and well behaved all the time. It’s okay for them to be kids. 

I’ve had a lot of moments like this where being a better parent to my kids than my mom was to me triggered me into realizations. And I’m not going to lie, I’m so thankful for that. I may not be the best mom, but that’s okay. I’ll be a good enough mom."
Sex drive is nonexistent and full of fear. Afraid it’s going to end my relationship of 3 years. Trigger: CSA,8,miy8z3,3,"Hi, all. Very sorry about the long post. 

 I (23F) recently started Somatic Experiencing treatment in January with a specialist and am seeking reassurance that there’s hope for my long term relationship to survive through the trials of trauma treatment.

 I sought treatment because 1 year into my relationship (summer 2019) I started having panic attacks during sex. This 1 year mark coincided with moving in together with my partner, which my therapist identified as a common trigger for people who have experienced CSA. My partner and I previously had an amazing sex life, frequent, intimate, passionate, etc. Suddenly the thought of sex started to fill me with fear. The panic attacks grew worse and worse until I began pulling away even from kisses, afraid they would make me have more panic attacks.

For concision purposes, I was diagnosed with CPTSD with multiple counts of sexual assault (one CSA) several months ago. I guess I had been suppressing it all my life because my sex life was “good” before the onset of panic attacks. 

My partner has been really incredible for these past nearly-two years since the surfacing of my CPTSD. However, sex has been a huge struggle. Before I began trauma-specific treatment in January, I had figured out how to skirt around some of my triggers. Sometimes we successfully had sex and other times I had a panic attack (60/40). Ever since starting SME, though, this has been on a steep decline. We’ve had sex 3 or 4 times since January, and haven’t at all in nearly a month. 
 
I am torn and don’t know what to do. I know treatment is the most important thing and so does my partner (he’s incredible supportive) but I can’t get past the guilt of not being able to have sex. I constantly tell myself just to get over it and DO it. I was able to do it so many times before, but I just don’t feel like I have access to that part of me anymore. I’m not asexual or anything — I have desire — but I just can’t get past the wall of fear and anxiety. I really do drive myself to the brink of exploding with shame and guilt.

My partner and I are very open and honest about how we feel. This includes his obvious (and very normal) frustrations with not having sex. He always says yes, I wish we were having more sex, but it’s more important that you get better. And while it’s reassuring, it does reinforce this pressure to “get better” unintentionally. 

But what if I don’t get better? What if this is where I’ll be stuck forever, able to flirt and sleep with strangers easily (because it’s easy and unnoticeable to them if I dissociate), but unable to substantiate sex with a long term partner? What if I lose the best relationship I’ve ever had because I can’t get rid of the fear? 

I’m just hoping someone can offer some hope, coping solutions, or, at the very least, empathy. Right now it feels like I’m living on an island completely alone."
Looking for Treatments and Executive Functioning Advice,5,mixzw5,4,"Hey guys,

I wrote a huge thread the other day but its very long so I condensed it down to something important I wanted to gain some insight into.

For those of you who are healing/have healed from CPTSD, what treatments worked? I’m specifically wanting to restore/fix executive functioning and I’m looking into ketamine therapy, EMDR & neurofeedback. Eventually MDMA therapy but it’s not legal yet, unless I find an underground therapist. I've done a lot of work on my mind using psychedelics and educating myself, but the biggest issue right now is the impacts my brain is having on my day to day life.

I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, but I believe 20 years of trauma has caused my brain to be completely fucked (to put I lightly). Executive dysfunction is crippling my life very badly and I wanna function ""normally"" so I can get things done in life.

Any pointers as to which kinds of therapies I should start first? Any stories to share around executive functioning coming back/strengthening with treatments?

I started looking into doctors and clinics today. Looking to take a few months off working ASAP to start doing a lot of healing.

Thanks in advance."
Emotional Badass podcast,9,mixy91,2,Hey everyone I just want to share a free resource that discusses things related to CPTSD and also being a highly sensitive person (HSP). I've found it to be SO helpful. It's called Emotional Badass! <3
I am free,10,mixi1o,3,"Yesterday I found some letters to/from the man that severely abused me from my teenage years until recently, I am now in my 30s. 

Reading how utterly desperate, confused, scared 17year old me was and how cunningly manipulative his responses were triggered a huge change in me.
I felt such sadness,compassion and love for 17year old me, I just want to hug that little girl and protect her. While I am much older now I want to guard my teenage inner self and with that I finally have accepted myself and for the fist time in my life I now know what self-love feels like. For unxplainable reasons my body and mind are now one instead of 2 different things that never fit together. 
This experience seems to have unleashed floods of supressed emotions, especially sadness - but the self hate,shame and guilt are gone. 
It has been the most beautiful experience in my life. The weight I was carrying around is gone, I am finally free. 


I am typing this in hopes to encourage the ones that need it, as a reminder to always keep going. Miracles do happen."
Sometimes it's hard to not get angry.,2,mixjpq,1,"I don't speak to my father because he is unpleasant, unpredictable and violent.

My mother is generally okay, now. Things were weird when i was younger.

But like I'm constantly reminding her not to talk about him.

And she does anyway, and sometimes I can let it go, but then she brought his like... sub-race or ethnicity or whatever into it and just every ugly fucking stereotype which...

Damn mom. That's my people you're talking about too. That fucking hurts, and kinda explains a lot of my childhood i like to pretend wasnt that way (namely that my mom and her family were less racist and stuck in the old country, not why the fuck they married).

I always knew my father hated me for who i am, among other things, but it's pretty awful realizing my mother blames my ""race"" or whatever the fuck for anything she doesnt like about me as well."
"How do you keep on course with ""doing the work"", whatever that work might be, when youre feeling okay?",3,mixd5y,3,"Basically, I am okay some of the time. My cptsd is always there. I am kind of always in a triggered state and, while uncomfortable, its easy to get comfortable feeling that way. I always feel a level of anxiety and depression and its become normal for me. 
There are days when my anxiety and depression are so bad that I contemplate suicide. Its in these moments where it hurts too much to bear and I usually do anything and everything to heal. I buy books, sign up for a program, talk with my therapist, write in my journal, reach out to people, etc. 

But as soon as I feel a little better, I get exhausted and stop. 

I'm sure most things are like this and I'm sure my energy is unusually low, but I want to actually heal this time. 

What makes you keep going? 

Bonus question : what have you found (program, therapy, friend, etc) that works for you?"
DAE feel really old?,19,mix9vb,7,"""old"" might not be the right word, however i really feel like ive been on this earth for thousands of years but i can't even drink legally yet. does this strike a chord with anyone else?



eta: this is worded horribly i hope it makes sense im sorry"
One of the reasons we need a safe space,4,mix5z0,1,"A lot of my healing journey has been breaking parts of myself down in order to accept help.

In my experience toxic people can be really good at getting and keeping you in your window of tolerance, when it's beneficial. This is one of the biggest draws of reengaging during a rough patch. It's difficult to go to a safe person who doesn't feel safe, which depending on your CPTSD can be everyone healthy. Or everyone.

This is why therapists start with slow boring safe spaces, so we can stay calm and start making the change ourselves."
Recent diagnosis,2,mix4ar,2,"I was recently diagnosed with CPTSD and it was kind of surprising to me since I just assumed it was a bunch of other things and I always just assumed I never went through any trauma (spoiler alert: I did, I just always excused the other person and assumed I was over reacting) and I really don’t know much about it at all. Does anyone have any recommendations for books or articles about CPTSD so that I can learn more about it? And also some for my mom because she wants to learn more about it since I live with her"
"First try to describe the pain, this is what came out. Long read.",3,mix13m,1,"Today I thought to write. 
I asked myself one of the millions of questions I ask but never answer. I was thinnking about my life and playing out how I might explain my self medicating to the people I have known who assume the worst about me. And it hit me I still cannot describe the pain I was treating by getting drunk as often as I could.
 
I never liked being high or drunk. That is not to say I did not have some good times, but I can only count those on one hand. mostly the effect I wanted from getting drunk was what happened after I sobered up. That pain was diminished and receded into the back ground. 

How can I describe it? It was oppressive. I often feared I might start to spontaneously scream and scream and scream wildly. I knew I was not crazy I just didn't know where it came from or what it was. Even after I got sober for about 10 years it was there but greatly diminished. Then went out again for another 4 years, it was there but still small. Then I got triggered by the people at the treatment program I went through. I began to obsess about my childhood before continuous memory began at age 7. Eventually I had an epiphany about one the the nightmares that woke me up; It was  a memory not a nightmare! 

When I began looking for info I kept on remembering more and more as I spoke to people who still behaved in the gaslighty way they did when I was a kid. That is the connection to the people who triggered me, the similarity to the gaslighting me about empirical facts. Anyway the final straw that lifted that oppressive ball of pain that dogged everyday of my life was innocently asking an Aunt about a memory I had.  She gasped. Then unconsciously said out loud ""you remember that?"" (I was 2) when I answered her not yet realizing what was going on she attacked. She turned into an evil person speaking nastily at me (we were on the phone) Telling me no one would ever know and even if they did they would not care. Then she hung up and immediately blocked me from being able to call her number. 

I was confused and hurt. But it was that conversation which brought up the memories that finally gave me the reason for the oppressive pain. She was my chief abuser. She was the architect of so much torture, sex abuse, mental abuse, conditioning, grooming, and a plot to murder me which she told me about over and over again, in a staged accident so that she and her mother could sue the owner of whatever property they managed to succeed on. 

Two more things. I believe her resentment of me was directly related to her jealousy of her father, my grandfather's love for me. Every night when he came home he would carry me around and sit with me and talk to me. I wish I could remember what those conversations were. And I lost thing 2.....oh yea she and her mother my grandmother would tell people at these places they took me to stories about me that were obviously not true. They'd describe me as very active and desirous of climbing on things and how they worried I might fall. I would of course be very afraid and not do it for them when they prompted me to climb. Some lady they were trying it on noticed my behavior and realized something was hinky. I remember her confronting them about how afraid I was and how obvious their lie was. IDK if it went any further. 

I was also being starved by them to weaken me and ensure I got injured more easily. They'd lock me up all day in a cabinet so I couldn't get exercise by moving about. Auntie was in training to be a nurse and using that knowledge to design her tortures of me. The main one being stretching my neck to weaken it. She would tell me it was to make me taller. Everyday when she came home from HS she would do it for a while then sexually abuse me and do it some more. She was 16 when I remember her start sexually abusing me. It lasted until????

IDK when the murder plot began. But about then too. 
Still cannot describe the oppressive pain. I painted it once back when I got sober the first time. I woke up in the middle of the night and painted it. 

I'm not healed by any means but that oppressive pain I thought might kill me is no longer.

Edit- It just occurred to me that this impulse to explain is part of why we tend to doubt ourselves. I think the need to explain is an attempt to figure out our symptoms."
Having a child with CPTSD,3,miwx4c,8," My partner wants a Child and wont budge on it. 

I can't talk her out of it.

We do own a house, our finances are decent. My partner did say she will wait 2-3 years more for me so I can continue work through my trauma/depression. 

I used to be ok with having 1 child but my depression resurfaced a couple years ago now.

I think my biggest fear is being anything like my Father to my child. 

I think depression may have warped my world view to be even darker.

I just have trouble wanting to bring another life into this world. It seems to be getting harder and harder to buy a house, cost of living goes up, salaries don't raise to match cost of living. Climate change on the horizon.

Greed is rampant - money and excess wealth often seems to make people uncaring and arrogant.

To me things often appear to be getting worse and worse with the world and economy etc. Higher stress more productive work for less take home pay and buying power then previous generations etc etc.

Maybe it's just we now have the opportunity to see all this injustice and suffering with the adoption of the internet etc? Maybe I just pay way too much time and attention to all this shit I can't control?

My partner thinks things will get better. She refused to change her mind and wants a child.

Am I just so fucking depressed my world view got warped again these last couple years?

Is the world going to get better? Should I just turn a blind eye to all that shit like everyone else seems to?"
I was trying to get better.. instead I'm seeing my ex tonight,2,miwu2s,9,"I hate myself so much and I feel so ugly that I'm going to get all ready and be super pretty so I can go hate F my ex. He cheated on me, lied to me, yelled at me for it, and said there was no point in apologizing. I always fawn so I didn't even say anything nasty. I just cried. He'd always yell at me, and say terrible things, and manipulate me, and gaslight me, and guilt trip me.

I tried to tell him last night as I was crying my eyes out. He didn't care. OF COURSE HE DIDNT CARE. It was just ""I never said that"" and ""I didn't do anything wrong until then"" etc. and he just focused on irrelevant stuff. I went 2 weeks with 0 contact. Unblocking him and trying to tell him just hurt me even more. I'm so fucking broken, and I hate him so much, and I hate myself so much. So of course instead of saying I don't deserve that, and leaving again, I'm doing this. I hate myself even more. Which makes me want to do it even more.

I've spent so many years just fawning, and never being mean to people, and trying so hard to be perfect. I don't give a fuck right now. Fuck it."
"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just replacement of one one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""",1612,miwsf7,91,"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

Borderlines are highly stigmatised in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. I posted it on r/BPD first ([here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/miwc67/please_do_yourself_a_favour_and_replace_the_word/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) and now I am here: the place where I feel the most understood.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.

*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**"
"Please! Help me, mental and physical health have tanked, just getting worse.",2,miwpof,1,"I desperately need some help. 

I have always suffered from anxiety throughout my life, as well as brain fog and depersonalization. I attribute a lot of this due to having an undiagnosed sleep condition (probably sleep apnea). 

For instance, in high school I would get 7-8 hours of sleep, yet still wake up unrefreshed and anxious.

My grades and social life suffered throughout those years and I was in a constant haze (brain fog). 

However, I stayed home my first year of college, taking online classes, with the added benefit that I would be able to sleep in throughout the week. 

That entire year, it was as if the fog lifted, and the anxiety significantly decreased, my grades improved and I became a while different person.

Due to this change, I decided to live on campus and with a roommate (who I did not know). 

This is when my nightmare began. 

At first things went well, but then, throughout the quarter, my roommate would wake me up multiple times a night, claiming that I was making too much noise while sleeping, and claiming that I was purposefully disturbing his sleep. 

This harassment went on for two months, during which my sleep schedule tanked, as well as my grades and mental health. I basically feared going into my room and into my bed. 

After months of inaction, the university finally kicked the roommate out, and for the last few days of the quarter, I had the dorm to myself. 

After the quarter ended, I came back home (because covid), and for the first night slept well. 

The second night it was as if a switch had gone off. 

The moment I hit the bed and got into a comfortable possible, my heart started beating rapidly, and my body tensed up. It was as if the roommate was still in the room (obviously he was not), I wasn't able to sleep until 2AM, and the sleep was fragmented. 

The past ENTIRE year, from March 2020 to March 2021, I have been suffering from this shit in agony, my body is constantly hyperaware anytime  I lay down in a comfortable position, my heart starts beating rapidly. It has just gotten worse. I don't remember the last time i sleep well. 

My mental and physical health is suffering, I couldn't even diagnose my underlying sleep condition at the sleep study, as I didn't fall asleep due to my hypervigilance. So much money wasted. 

I was a straight A student before, and now I have been suspended from the university due to my poor grades. 

Due to the lack of sleep I can barely function, and have turned into a vegetable really. 

Can anyone please please please help me with this hypervigilance issue??"
"DAE doubt their trauma was ""severe"" enough?",30,miwob3,13,"My therapist told me this week that I likely have CPTSD. This makes sense given my symptoms and the way I have generally lived my life for as long as I can remember. The thing is, I remember a couple of traumatic memories - a molestation by a 'friend' at the age of 5 and a traumatic punishment for having an accident at the age of 3 that my therapist says I likely processed as a sexual assault. I also have reason to believe there was some attachment issues/postpartum depression. I can't remember anything else in the ways of specifics though. I guess I am getting hung up on the way CPTSD is described as resulting from severe or repeated trauma. Maybe I just don't remember? Can anyone  else relate to this feeling?"
triggers everywhere,9,miwnsu,7,"I want to cry. My triggers are everywhere. Sex is so common in society. 

Reading a Reddit thread? Sex joke. 

Seeing an ad? Half naked people. 

Just being in Instagram recommended? Women only wearing almost nothing and showing off their butts. 

Instagram explore page? The god damn news channel posts about sexual things. 

Outside? Faceless humans/masks. Anyone else can't deal with that? 

YouTube comments. 
YouTube ads. 

Not to mention the sound and smell flashbacks. 

My half naked father. 

And many more things. 

I am constantly getting flashbacks. I am stuck and slowly dieing. It is exhausting. I just want to forget the horrors. I really want to get away from all these triggers. 

I feel like I am in immediate danger and try to protect me similar to ocd. 

The true horror is when I can't do anything to protect me. Then I lay there thinking I should give up and that I will never be safe. That I was doomed or something."
Hyper focusing on a hobby,1,miw8gl,2,"Firstly I want to explain that i can’t choose when this happens. It just does. I also have ADHD. I think this is some combination of cptsd and adhd

Ever since i was young and my home life became abusive and traumatic, i have hyper fixated on hobbies to escape reality. I honestly had no grievances with this coping skill, outside forgetting to eat, drink water and use the bathroom. In highschool, I started dating a very narcissistic individual who used the same manipulation and abuse tactics as my family. He was more of the subtle and emotional abuse type, although he did break stuff and occasionally shove me. During this relationship, i started getting so hyper focused on hobbies during stressful time periods in the relationship. The worst of it being beginning of march last year w COVID lockdowns. I couldn’t sleep, and went periods of 4 days without sleeping (i’m not exaggerating, no sleep whatsoever for 4 days). I was escaping my problems by getting really into video games. My memory got really shitty from the lack of sleep and I wouldn’t remember that i played a video game for 10+ hours at a time.

Ever since the relationship ended, whenever life gets stressful, i sometimes hyper focus on a video game. I sleep well now, and have been for almost a year. however, i only have a faint memory of what i did when i hyper focus. it’s the same kind of blurry, fuzzy memory i get when i disassociate and try to remember what i did while disassociating. I have a vague memory but nothing specific and i feel confused.

It’s almost like the hyper fixation has become more than just an escape, it almost feels like a dissociative experience. However, when i experience derealization or depersonalization, i feel nothing but panic and confusion during it and feel like i’m going crazy. i genuinely enjoy hyper fixating, i have a really good time enjoying my hobbies. (it’s just a little excessive) Idk it’s weird and i wanted to see if anyone else has this"
I didn’t do anything wrong.,6,mivtat,6,"I was just a child. I was never beaten or physically abused. But emotionally it was day after day after year of fighting and witnessing violence and being gaslit and there was no set way I could act that would satisfy my abuser. My parents weren’t emotionally equipped to stop the abuse (and in some cases brought their own abuse, though these days they’re much better, even if one is chronically fearful and the other is chronically unable or unwilling to show love). 

They should have thrown her in boarding school. 

So I’m just sobbing. It’s not my fault. It never was. Yet I’m caught up in alcohol (day one here, day two hopefully will begin around 3:30am) and it just makes me feel worse. 

I want to be emotionally resilient. Drinking provides the exact opposite plus a lot of other issues. 

But it’s not my fault. I am an adult now and it’s up to me to make life decisions. I can’t take away the past. But my brain neurologically is about 11 years old—it’s still stuck there. 

But like Matt Damon’s character in Good Will Hunting, it’s not my fault. 

Thank you for reading."
My parents getting along now makes me want to hate then,4,miv1dg,1,"Now that my parents are retired, they are getting along so much better. I get it, that as they got rid of all the work related stress and as all the ""difficult"" kids are out of the house, they have much less to worry about. But they were so fucking nasty to each other 10 to 3 years prior and it impacted me badly. 

It makes me so mad, that now I am sometimes tempted to drive a wedge between them, just to proove to myself that they still don't really get along. 

But the longer I stay at home at holidays, the more I recognize, that in fact they really do not get along. It's just the outer circumstances that changed and allow them less potential for conflicts. They still can't communicate wothout bickering and critizising, they still raise their voice over trivial stuff, still have this unempathic way of being. And that actually gives me pleasure, but not because I want them to feel bad, but because I am happy for having the gift of seeing this toxic behavior and for not perpetuating this behavior, at least I hope I'm not..."
vent/ is this trauma?,5,mituix,0,"I am currently 15, and i have been battling my mental health since i was 11/12. I am constantly trying to find out what is wrong with my head and am always doing thorough research (no self diagnosing just lost and want answers) i am 90% sure i have trauma, and my school wants me to get tested for autism, SAD, and other things are possible.

When i was 12/13/14 i lived at home with just my mum as my dad worked away, my mum reacted badly to my self harm, the earliest thing i remember and one of the only things i remember is her mocking my self harm, physically and verbally, i hid in my bed and cried for her to not touch or come near me because she scared me i guess. 
From then on the arguments got very verbally and sometimes physically abusive. 
I cant remember a lot of it, but i know what was said and what happened.
i am about to list some of the things that happened/said, so if this could trigger you please don’t read this bit.
as of right now these are the only things i can remember:
•i once left blood on my bathroom floor from sh and i remember her saying ‘if you are going to slice open your arms clean up after’
•this is the only physical thing i remember, but she pulled my hair back while i was sat on my chair, she did this because i wasn’t reacting to what she was saying, so she got angry and ripped my hair back.
•She was particularly angry one day in the car on the way to school, so she started hitting me and grabbing my leg, she then started driving at high speed into school, this really panicked me and i went into school having a panick attack, to this day people driving fast still makes me anxious.
i remember a lot of the words she used and things she would say, evil, vile, attention seeker, she mocked me A LOT, she trashed my room, threw plates, wouldn’t leave me alone when i begged and cried for her to stop.

I now can’t have her touch me or hug me, whereas i am fine with affection from my dad (sometimes), i get anxious when she comes up the stairs, i panick when she raises her voice, it really effects my relationship with other adults especially female teachers.

i really can’t remember a lot of the last three years and it takes a long time to piece things together, the worst part is i told school and they got social services involved but my mum twisted everything so not much happened. 

I’ve had multiple suicide attempts that caused a lot of trauma aswell, but when i drink my first thought is my mum, i don’t remember much but my friends tell me i panick about my mum when i am drunk.
I want no relationship with her and i feel ZERO connection to her at all, no empathy for her at all, i feel so guilty but i just don’t love her in the way i am supposed to.
There is no way of me getting closure for certain reasons but mainly because she refuses to admit to any of it, and i’m so scared of telling school again incase i get out through what i did last time.

i also developed an ed a couple months ago, a lot of it was as a result of her and what she did, i wouldn’t eat if i did something ‘wrong’ as i felt i didn’t deserve it, i lost my hair because of it and that broke me A LOT.

There’s a lot more to this but there’s so so much to dig up and list."
DAE has been living with existential dread?,3,miut8n,3,"Don't know how else to put it. I have been diagnosed with trauma related depression only, so I don't know much about anxiety symptoms and maybe this is it. But ever since I grew up I have had trouble going to sleep. I worry about anything really, but especially before I fall asleep I get so scared. Small things turn into nightmare fuel. I feel like my life is falling apart, and this has been a constant.

I don't know why that is. I have been taking sleep medication and it has helped tremendously. Also SSRIs. But the fear is still there. It still comes up. Always lingering. Like I am constantly in extreme danger. I have learnt to live with it and therapy certainly has helped, but it's never fully gone..."
is this a flashback???,1,miugqv,3,"hey y’all. im not formally diagnosed with anything trauma-related, but i do relate a lot to some of the stories on here, n i show some symptoms of cptsd so i think this community is best fitting for this sort of inquiry lol
  
i sit next to a window in my sixth period class which borders the courtyard of my school. the faculty was blaring music for an event that was being hosted inside the courtyard. the bass of the song was radiating through the walls kinda (as loud music tends to do lmao) and it reminded me of when my brother slams his hands on the walls or hits things during fights with my mom or my family in general
when it happened it started to take over my mind in a way, like it was all i could think ab, and i couldn’t focus. the teacher was speaking but it went kinda in one ear out the other bc of those thoughts.  
this isn’t the first time this has happened, either, loud talking tends to make me think about my family’s fighting, and alcohol makes me think about my dad bc of his former alcoholism. it does that weird thing to my focus every time too. does this constitute a flashback? is it cause for concern?"
feeling emotionally disconnected from people in my life right now,2,mity6o,1,"I'm just feeling mad at everyone and resentful and alienated and just basically emotionally removed from everyone in my life right now. I feel exhausted by all of it. Part of it is I get such intense social anxiety from being on zoom calls with people I don't know very well, where I just replay and obsess over the call afterwards and pick apart what I might have done wrong or said. I was in a ""conscious menstruation"" zoom workshop over the past few weeks, and this past week was the last session. I just couldn't wait for it to be over. I felt so disconnected from the other women in the workshop. That surprised me and made me sad. 

Now, 3 days later, I'm finding the same feeling carrying over. I feel resentful towards my mom for being so critical of everything, towards myself for bringing her same habits into my relationship and criticizing my partner, towards my sister for being flaky, toward my friend for not texting me back, toward my partner for coming home drunk last night (he at least admitted his fault today). 

I'm still not sure if this is related to a potential for having BPD (I don't have a diagnosis. my dad had BPD tho), or my PMDD, or my bipolar2, or my trauma stuff. I just want to understand WHY this is happening and what triggered it. 

It's not quite dissociation, but it feels sort of like it. Like when I think about those people, I just feel a wall and a sense of cutting them out. 

Do other people have this experience?"
Feeling frustrated and want to move out,2,mithes,1,"Man I'm feeling really frustrated right now. I've been doing therapy for 4 months now through betterhelp trying to work through some past issues from childhood trauma, I also began a new medication, trying to get my life together. I've gambled most of my money away because of lack of self control and now I'm trying to find another job. I'm pretty unhappy right now.  What makes it worse is I have a terrible relationship with my parents and they always make it worse, and I live with them. It's really hard for me to talk to them about anything because they always criticize and never try to help me. I don't hate them but they make it really hard to like them, I assume it's them because they don't have any friends outside of work. I'm about to take all my stuff in my car and move in with my cousin. I don't want to do this but I don't really have another choice, it feels like I'm just getting farther away. I'm trying to find work so I can move out but it's very hard to afford anything. It's becoming harder and harder and I just want to leave. My last job 7 months ago was at a warehouse and I was very unhappy, I quit and I've been working on getting better mentally since then. Can anyone give me some advice."
How do I known if I’m in a healthy relationship?,21,mitfcm,8,"I grew up with emotional neglect without experiencing any sort of secure attachment to any person. I (literally) don’t know how to trust others.

There’s this random gut feeling that sometimes alerts me that something is wrong, and in those cases I have no idea if I can trust my own judgement. I can’t tell if I’m the one who’s in the wrong, if I’m demanding too much, if I’m doing too much, if I’m communicating poorly despite my greatest efforts. 

There are moments when I don’t feel loved enough, and it instinctively feels like I’m being neglected on purpose. It’s frustrating. But I also don’t know how to express the need for more affection to my partner because I don’t know if I’m asking too much from them. I don’t even know if it’s appropriate or normal to ask for more affection, or if this is just something that is meant to balance itself out naturally in a healthy relationship. And what do you even say in such a situation without making an accusation?

I feel like as a man, especially in a romantic relationship, I’m not expected to be insecure and excessively sensitive. I’m meant to be confident, mature, stable and have my life figured out. I fear that opening up too much or being too emotional will drive people away. 

I have no idea what I can expect from my partner in a healthy romantic relationship. I don’t know how to define boundaries. I feel like I’m not even made for relationships, but I also feel the urge to be close to someone. 

How do I know if a relationship is healthy? How can I tell if my behaviour and communication is healthy?"
"I feel so ashamed, I can use some advice on how to deal with this and in need of some ""self compassion inpso"".",3,mite6f,5,"Hi, I don't know how to deal with this and I'm struggling with this for a long time now..

(Tw; sexual abuse and eating disorder are mentioned)

This maybe sound a bit silly, but for me it is a huge stress factor in my life. I have this weird coping mechanism that I am ashamed of and it's a bit of a mess and I feel judged for it.

I have a problem with finding the right clothes for me.. (yes, like I said, it sounds like a silly little problem I know), for multiple reasons including a sensitivity on my skin. Somehow I get physically and mentally overwelmed when my clothes are irritating or something is to tight. I think it has something to do with trauma that I am so sensitive to that, it's just a HUGE trigger for me. 

Also, I have had eating disorders including anorexia from age 10, and now is the first time in my life I am doing really really good and my weight is going up in a slow but steady pace and I am really happy with that but feelings of being dirty (from the sexual abuse ) and feelings of being ugly from the bullying are getting triggered by getting more womenly curves from the weight gain, even though the body immage is getting a little better.

I still don't feel okay in my own skin and I feel like I want to jump out of my body, that's what it comes down to, and having comfy but nice clothes helps me sooth that a little. I don't think I have a shopping adiction (I have this ""episode"" 2 times a year and don't spend a lot) but it definitly is a coping mechanism.  I also find difficulty decision making very stressfull so that's why I don't like to shop that often.

So, all that said, I am ordering a lot of clothes lately, because all the other clothes are the wrong size, worn down, or don't feel comfy anymore, but I return most of the clothes I order because I also struggle with finding what looks a bit nice on me now that my body is changing.

I feel frustrated because of this, but what's the most stressfull for me is the shame I feel. I feel like the whole street is judging me for ordering so much, and the delivery guy made a comment today about my shopping habits ( not meant in a malice way, but still feel shame about that comment). Also when I return it I feel like the lady at the post office is thinking:
"" there she is again,  gosh! she shopped AGAIN?""

I got some delivery today, but almost nothing feels right, so I'm already shopping again but dreading the moment I need to open the door for the delivery guy.

On TOP on all of this, I also feel al lot of guilt for spending money on myself, because my narcissistic father didn't want to spend money on me and became angry when he needed to, so now I still feel like I'm doing something wrong. 

I know on a intellectual level that I shouldn't be so bothered with al of this, but I am.  
I know I should have compassion for myself, but how do I do that? Can anybody give me some  ""self compassion inspo""  or something.. :-)  or advice on how to deal with these kind of things. I feel so torn and overwelmed with this."
Why do I feel that my mother badmouths me in front of my family?,6,mistgd,6,"34/f Battling panic attacks, depression led me to learning about cptsd. Have been reading up and working on myself. I have this constant anxiety that my mother talks about me behind my back. She never stood up for me.. She didn't defend me against sexual abuse nor verbal abuse. Few months back when I told her about my cousin molesting me  when I was 6, she didnt say anything and just forgot about it. Now that I am working on myself and not fulfilling her narcissistic needs, she has become hyper alert. She gets angry when I don't call her everyday or don't pick up her call once. Whenever we talk on call, I have this constant fear of getting in her bad books. I am scared that she will talk bad and make fun of me behind my back with my brothers. I have seen them laugh at other's for their mental health issues... Calling them crazy etc. They ridiculed me when I told them about my depression. Once I had a severe panic attack when my brother verbally abused me in front of my parents. They didn't stand up for me. My brother kept telling my panic attack was a drama. I couldn't speak up as I was in the middle of the attack. Ever since I started working to set boundaries with them, I feel alienated. I fear that they might be scheming against me, calling me crazy.They might not me doing this or scheming but still I am just so anxious about it. How do I get rid of this feeling that they are gossiping about me? Is it some kind of paranoia?
 
I have a loving husband who understands and supports me so much. Still I feel miserable, abandoned and without a family. I am too weak to go NC. Any progress I make goes out the window when I talk to mother and brother."
"My nurse practioner just added ""paranoid personality disorder"" to my diagnosis.",14,misqlm,9,"Apparently one of the symptoms of ppd is being suspicious of someone without any real evidence.

Now how would she know there is no evidence to my suspicions if she had never witnessed my experiences? I may keep an emotional wall up about certain things but not without good reason and she knows that.

I don’t know if I am the bad guy.,15,misqby,7,"Hello. 19/F - CPTSD, PMDD, Depression, Severe Anxiety Disorder

I am so tired of having arguments and disagreements with my partner and not knowing whether or not I am being too sensitive or if it really is him being a shitty person or if I am halfway sparking out and flaming shit up because it’s PMDD time. Regardless, he is able to move on about his day like it was whatever and I am always left with a seething pain in my heart and physically crippled from the weight of the depression I feel after we argue. I feel like he does not love me and simply wants to torture me and won’t admit it for whatever reason. Sometimes I feel like he wants me to give in and die. It just feels like he is an emotionless void of a human and does not care about me at all. My life is so lonely. I work 40 hours a week at a Taco Bell making shitty pay and dealing with toxicity from my coworkers too and doing my best attempts to hold in any outbursts. I have no hopes of ever being promoted because I built a reputation for myself of not having any confidence and I am incapable of being 100% professional and normal. Then come home and live this pained life where I don’t know if today we will love eachother or not. I wish he knew the pain I knew - or that I didn’t have to continuously know this pain. 

I was abused and neglected by my parents physically and verbally my whole childhood and teen years. I have a long list of men who have groomed me, sexually abused me, physically abused me, the list just goes on and on. I started being sexually conditioned by grown men at 9 years old. I could keep going. I was just recently diagnosed with PMDD and it just feels like a bigger death sentence on my love life. It feels like guys I meet want to run away from me or pretend they understand but then leave me with even more trauma. I have these moments where I can feel myself almost rippling apart and replicating what I’ve had done to me. I have these moments where I feel like if I could just scream loud enough and punch something hard enough it would all change. I am so tired of being a broken person. 

I have only been in therapy since September and we honestly don’t meet enough (we meet for an hour biweekly), and because I feel so bonded with my therapist I find myself omitting certain information from her that could probably be helpful because I don’t want her to think I am a bad person or it just hurts way too much to talk about yet. Sometimes I wish I could just tell her how absolutely empty I feel and how I am ready to give up but I have no insurance so I can’t afford to be forced into a mental hospital. I don’t have the drive to deal with whatever stack of paperwork I’ll have to sign for financial assistance. I don’t want to take the debt because if my credit tanks I sure as hell will never be able to make it out of here. So there are some barriers there. 

I have no friends. I believe covid is real so the only people I see are my family occasionally. I don’t really see my old friends from high school because they are all drama and toxic and party and I have been on a break from all substances for a year now and no one wants to respect that. 

I am so tired of not feeling like myself at all. I am tired of being the ridiculous one who feels too much. I am so tired of not being able to be the numb one who is able to just smoke a bowl and laugh on with my buddies after a tense argument with my partner. I feel like I am going to be stuck living this kind of life forever and I’ll never really know if it’s by my own doing or I just have this terrible luck of getting tangled up with bad men. I spend so much time thinking about my future and the plans I have but I feel like I’m destined to end up killed by a partner or by my own hands eventually."
I am trying to understand why I am the way I am and I think it all stems from a childhood of traumatic experiences. (Trigger Warning: Family / Childhood trauma),7,mise0e,3,"I'm sorry. I really just need some insight from other people in a similar situation to mine. With the help of my older sister, I am starting to remember things my parents did during my childhood that might have been traumatic for me. They never did anything to me directly but I still feel it left an impression on me. 

I was just talking to my sister who is a lot older than me. About our childhood. If our parents also we're fighting constantly when my siblings were small. And she said that it wasn't as bad as when I was a child. 
And she also told me that when I was a child that my mom had an affair. 

She also confirmed that my parents never really cared for us. There was moldy food in the fridge. My mom smoked on purpose when she was pregnant with me and had a fight with my dad. 

Also, my dad always wanted a really manly son, just like him, and I guess my older brother wasn't good enough so he took it out on me

When I was a child (between possibly around age 4 until age 14) my parents were almost constantly fighting. And with fighting, I mean things like this situation:

About when I was 6, I was in between my mom and dad when they were having a bad fight, just sitting there and listening to them. My mom stood up and got a knife from the kitchen and was threatening my dad with it. Sometimes they punched each other and they were bleeding badly. 

Once it got so bad and I was so scared that somebody would die that I went to my siblings and told them about it. Afterward, my mom didn't talk to me for a few days.

They were constantly involving me in their fights. Asking me for my opinion, mind you, I was a child. I didn't really have a place to retreat to. So I was sitting there with them. I always thought it was normal. 

I really only have bad memories of my childhood. And the rest I pretty much forgot about. 

Sometimes I even get flashbacks to all of it.

Some of the stuff I remember more clearly has happened in the past few years.

My mother got diagnosed with kidney cancer a few years back. The day she got diagnosed, we didn't really know how bad it was. Most of the family was there. My sister with her sons, one of them 5 years old, were all sitting there, not knowing what's going to happen.
My dad was walking around and grinning, then he went up to my 5-year-old nephew and asked him ""what are you gonna do when your grandma is dead?"" and grinning and laughing while asking it. 

I think it was also around this time when my mom got pushed by my dad and fell toward the heating unit with her head. She had a really bad wound and needed to get stitches. 

It was in the middle of the night. I had to get up early the next day because of work (I'm still living in the house with them and have my own floor). 

She called me and told me I have to protect her from my dad and that I needed to help her. 

Even after that, they never divorced or started living apart. No, they are still living together and I think they are emotionally dependant on each other. 

About 8 years ago, when I was 20, I was moving out for a while and started living on my own. My mom asked if she could visit me and of course, I told her she could visit me, but I asked her if she could call beforehand so I know she's coming. She told me that she would rather not visit at all if she had to call me before. 

There are a few memories I would rather not go through at all cause they trigger me really badly. But this is basically the gist of it. This is basically what I was experiencing during my childhood and early adulthood and I think it is the source for all of my other problems.

My anxiety, the self-hatred, the depression, not able to have a functioning relationship, constantly hurting myself emotionally, and so many other things that I don't even know where to start and how to fix anything. 

A few days ago, I came out as trans to a few school friends of mine cause I thought they would hate me and I could hurt myself with it. (They were respectful, so thankfully that didn't happen)


Of course, I only told you about the bad things my parents always did. But they are also nice to me, which makes it so much more difficult to understand any of it."
What are some good books about CPTSD?,5,misceg,3,"PTSD tied to a single event is something I find less frustrating, even if still a major issue, and less embarrassing; I feel less like I'm getting upset over nothing.

I was diagnosed with CTPSD a year and a bit ago, and would love to read some literature about it - just to understand it a bit better, and maybe put some language to it. I've been avoiding it out of a longstanding worry that I'll just put someone else's idea of CPTSD in my head, accept it, and become less believable than I already am.

Any ideas? :)"
dont ever put me in a situation,8,mirip9,1,"i know thats a meme but i relate to it way too hard. i only ever go outside to get groceries or to the dog park, but i always have to go with my aunt or my mom because every situation that isnt being in my room alone is entirely too stressful. not to mention being outside makes me dissociate? i have no clue how im going to go back to in person classes. everything is terrifying and i dont even realize it because im always avoiding everything"
My bf is struggling and isn't taking care of himself. How can I encourage him to get support?,7,mirmje,2,"My partner is currently not speaking to me and is in such a ""doom"" state about us that I'm not sure we'll be able to pull through it. Using a throwaway to maintain his privacy.

Our last fight last week was around how I'd like him to be more present with me, how it'd mean a lot to just acknowledge that he needs space, or acknowledge my feelings after he's gone silent. I don't expect him to be perfect, I just wanted him to verbalize his understanding of my feelings. I brought this up that Tuesday as empathetically as I could, but before we'd get anywhere, he'd say he was too upset and we'd talk later, but he'd never actually meaningfully follow up to REALLY try to understand me. On Friday I was really upset and cried, and that's when he disassociated completely. I specifically asked him for comfort and he said he just couldn't. Still, I made the effort to compartmentalize my hurt and told him it was important for me to support him, which in this case meant giving him space and acknowledging that pushing for a resolution when he wasn't ready made things harder for both of us. From previous fights I know that he won't likely use this time to self-soothe; he's trying to forget.

On Sunday, his sister (who lives in another country) reached out to me; this surprised me because we've never met in person and haven't spoken too much. However, she wanted to check in because he'd been impossible to reach in the last couple weeks and consequently thought I might be facing some challenges with him. She explained a lot I'd suspected already, though he never delved too far into the details with me - their childhood was difficult; emotionally absent parents in a toxic relationship that ended in divorce and a split home, a rejection of vulnerability and emotional expression, his father starting a new family focusing more on them, and any attention was typically critical/negative. Their mom was just burnt out from it all. In his last long term relationship, he unfortunately experienced prolonged infidelity while he struggled with seeing his father ill and in the hospital. His sis said that his answer to all this was to shut down and resist any feeling for days/weeks, explosive anger when he feels ""cornered,"" and a general resistance to vulnerability. My internet search landed me here, and I'm so grateful to have found this community.

My home was not without problems, but it was stable, happy. My dad is a grumpy man who sometimes has a hard time with me/my sisters' level of agency, but he never overimposed and was never absent. Any deficiencies as a father were balanced by his unequivocal love for his family - his childhood was scared and uncertain and he promised ours would never be that way. My mom is passive in her own life, but raised us to be assertive while kind/empathetic. All this to say, difficult conversations have never been scary or off limits for me, and I've always felt that fights/conflict are easy to compartmentalize and separate from my actual overall sentiment for the person (e.g., I can be mad about something but still have warm fuzzy feelings overall) I've found it incredibly hard to navigate this space carefully with my partner. My conversation with his sis helped shed some light onto what's going on with him, and she also said that she's seen a surprising emotional growth from him in the last year he's been with me, but she wants him to be more proactive in addressing his hurt. It surfaced more questions for me:

What's the best way for me to support him right now? Now that I know these behaviors existed outside of me, I'm a little less hurt by them and want to prioritize his emotional safety with me for now. I want him to feel supported and valued. Then, importantly, how do I approach the topic of his trauma without him feeling cornered? He's incredibly resistant to delving into his past and reliving certain memories, but I really think it's crucial to healing. Lastly, are there any tips you can give me for voicing my needs/concerns in a less triggering way for him? I've purchased some resources (body keeps the score, etc.) but any anecdotes from you guys are also very helpful.

**Tl;dr: My bf has a history of explosive anger and disassociation, and is resistant to fully feeling his feelings. How can I provide him emotional safety and encourage him getting the help he needs?**

"DAE's partner ignore nc requests? If so, how do you handle it?",3,mirr7s,9,"Tldr; my husband has repeatedly ignored my no contact requests for my father. I'm not sure if we can get past this? I now see it as my husband is okay with seeing someone repeatedly disregard my feelings. 

As title and tldr state,  my husband has repeatedly ignored my requests for no contact for my father.  

Recently, I've been evaluating my life.  I'm still not quite sure if it's a breakdown or a breakthrough. Maybe a midlife crisis? But I've started to address some issues that need to be addressed.

One of the things that I've been thinking about is my marriage.  Been together 20 years,  married for 5. Outside of our kids,  he's the best thing that happened to me.  I think he's saved me, in multiple ways.  

But,  there's issues that I've been ignoring, so they've gotten worse. 

One of the issues is I've tried going no contact with my dad,  numerous times.  But my husband & dad have a relationship. This relationship usually leads to re-engaging with my dad.  It's kind of hard to not speak to someone who's in your kitchen,  drinking coffee on a Sunday morning.  

My dad & I were never close,  never had much of a relationship with him.  He's a narcissist,  and my brother is and always has been the golden child. My dad has always helped him out, which has had disastrous effects,  long term. He's very critical of me - my job,  my hobbies,  my appearance (Sunday morning coffee leads to him making comments about my apparel,  stating he hopes I don't dress like that for work - while I'm wearing sweats and having bed head because I just woke up). 

My husband asks me to do our not do things, with the assumption I'll listen / comply. For example,  his dad reached out & sent gifts from our registry when I was pregnant with my first.  He's never had a relationship with his dad, but has an awesome step dad! He asked me to stop talking with him.  Although we're still Facebook friends,  I don't message him,  post on his wall,  comment,  etc,  because he asked me not to.  But I don't get the same respect.  

Told my husband I wanted to go no contact with my dad a few times.  One was when we moved, because my dad was being an ass (rented from my dad for 12 years before moving). Prior to our move,  it was difficult to go NC with him,  being his tenant.  But his boundary crossing was insane at the time.  He'd go so far as to bring friends to our apartment when we weren't home.  

I also asked him to go nc before our wedding.  When I asked my dad to contribute to the reception, I was called an entitled cunt for asking him for money.  Even though we didn't ask him to contribute to our wedding at all.  By the time the reception rolled around (a month after the wedding), my dad and his girlfriend were in attendance.  We still weren't talking much.  He *did* give a fairly large (in my opinion) monetary wedding gift,  which ended up being our budget for the reception.  (*yes*, *I'm* *petty* *like* *that*). 

But what still hurts,  5 years later,  is that he physically gave the gift to my husband. When I wasn't there.  To me,  it screams of dowry or bride price,  or something along those lines,  which hurts.  And to be honest,  I really don't know if he *actually* gave my husband the money,  or if my husband just said that,  to smooth things over.  

I've realized that my dad likes the warm & fuzzies he gets from making offers or promises.  Getting the accolades & seeing the happiness of the person he makes the promise to.  He's done this with trips (multiple times), money towards a down payment for a house,  etc.  But with me,  he. Never. Follows. Through.  So, it is quite possible the wedding ""gift"" never happened.  

But anyways. 

Within the past year or two,  my husband has purchased one of my dad's properties on a 10 year contract. I told my husband not to do it,  because my dad doesn't do anything unless it benefits him. The building is in disrepair.  My dad doesn't have anywhere near the skills my husband does with fixing things.  So there's a lot of work that needs to be done,  inside and out. It's a multi unit building.  Essentially,  my dad gets one of the rents. He decides who's in there.  How much the rent will be,  etc.  But my husband is responsible for repairs of the unit still.  If my dad dies,  the contract passes to his girlfriend to fulfill / pay.  

I told my husband not to buy the property.  Obviously,  that didn't work . With the 10 year contract,  going nc is difficult.  And I think my husband will end up paying more than my dad would get selling it, because of the work that was/ is needed.  And my dad benefits because he just transferred ownership with the deed,  so he won't have to pay capital gains because it's a rental.  

After bringing to my husband's attention that I stopped contact with his dad when asked,  over 15 years ago & stuck to it,  my husband's solution is that *now* he will go no contact with my dad.  They were talking multiple times a day and usually seeing each other at least a couple times a week.  So the sudden stop was noticeable to my dad.  Which led to a very uncomfortable conversation with my dad. There's been a few recent incidents with my dad that have left me hurt & angry.  Nothing super major,  but it is what it is.  In just tired of him (my dad) hurting me.  

I'm a realist.  I know my husband & dad will talk.  I know he'll be in my house.  My husband said he'd stick to no contact. But if calling me an ""entitled cunt"" wasn't enough to stop talking to him,  I'm sure my bringing the difference in our actions related to speaking with our dads won't.  I've asked repeatedly, what his line will be,  if calling me an entitled cunt wasn't enough.  

I'm not sure this is something I can get over,  to be honest. Essentially,  I realized that my husband is and has been okay with seeing me repeatedly hurt or angry.  Anyone been through something similar or have any advice? After some discussions with my husband,  he's worried it might be relationship ending."
I feel really defensive about the fact that I can't remember/freeze when trying to remember what happened to me and I just need to yell about it,7,miqx12,2,"I struggle to remember specific incidents from the years I spend growing up in an abusive household. And the years of deeply traumatic homophobic bullying/ostracizing by my community.  Like there's whole years of my life I have little to no memory from because things were so bad and I blocked it all.  Then there's all the times where I know there's a memory there, but when I try to recall it I just totally freeze and briefly dissociate and can't verbalize it.  Usually after that I end up saying some blander, safer and less bad memory instead of what I was trying to think of.  

 This has lead to so many people in my life not believing me, downplaying it, or outright gaslighting me into thinking nothing happened.  I gaslighted myself into thinking it wasn't bad and I was just weak and needed to get over.  My therapist, who has never given me reason to think she doubts me, asked me about the first time I remember being angry last session and I gave some bland, non abuse related memory and then went into this spiral of defensiveness about it and feeling like she was judging me (even though she wasn't asking about abuse necessarily!).  I indulged in that feeling for the first time and followed it and realized I have something to say:

It all fucking happened and I don't give a shit that I can't remember parts of it because I carry the marks of it with me every day.  I don't owe you or her or anyone else the details of it.  I know what happened to me and I know it was wrong and I'll be damned if I ever let anyone tell me otherwise again.  I carry the scars of my childhood, my body does keep the score and it's fucked up but I'm getting better.  I'm doing it mostly on my own, because so many people haven't believed me or just don't get it but I am going to get better because that judgment doesn't mean anything to me anymore and because I love myself and I'm fucking strong enough to do so. So there.

This has been going through my mind for the past few days often with less words and more raw emotion and I feel like I needed to put it out there for other people to read and not just say it to myself. So thank you for reading that and thank you for this community that I as a lurker have taken so much from.  I hope you all find that love for yourselves too."
I'm so angry at myself for making a mistake!,2,miqltu,2,"I don't even know if I should tag it as ""rant"" or this! I'm sorry! I'm dumb!

I'm clearly a fucking idiot! What the fuck is wrong with me! I *KNOW* paying the bills and rent takes priority! I was taking care of them at all times! It was always me who made sure they were paid! And then I left! And my mental stability slid so bad I couldn't move! And suddenly! I can't do shit! I don't fuckign THINK! WHY. I hate this.

I KNEW that buying myself a phone (because my current one is a hot garbage, the android is so old, most apps just won't run on it anymore; not to mention the battery - the powerbank just slows down the leakage of power, doesn't make it stop, or better) and weighted blanket will be my ""big spends"" for this month (I'm poor, leave me alone). I KNEW that afterwards I won't be able to buy anything else, except food. I was okay with it!

But *why* I didn't take into account that I was on fucking *sick leave* for two weeks! That's 80% of my base pay! And I skipped all the overtime too! Because my sister got corona and we had to quarantine! And it was nice! I got some rest, even though my mental state went into shambles again! but GOD. What the hell! I KNEW all these things were happening! Why did I still try to do the big spends! It made no sense to do so!

And I only realised that AFTER buying! So now I'll need to get into a long and tedious fight to get my money back. Because of course they took the money immediately, but now it's weekend and then easter and then what nots and it'll take AGES to get that money back. FUCKS SAKE WHAT WAS I THINKING. I WASNT! THAT'S THE THING! WHY WASN'T I THINKING!

STUPID FUCKING IDIOT."
Something I realized hit me hard,9,miqcw8,3,"I've been having a rough few days. I told someone I love very much that I ""was tired of being sorry"", for things that I had to be responsible and accountable and sorry for. I'm not tired of being sorry, I'm tired of hurting people. I'm tired of being responsible for other's pain sometimes. I'm really trying to fix myself. I'm trying to work on my issues. I'm really trying to work on the things I'm doing and work on my trauma and I hurt. I really, really hurt, and I'm trying. I'm in so much pain and I'm so proud of myself. It takes so much time and effort for me to fix the things I was taught, the things that were done to me that I can't do to anyone else."
I’m shaking uncontrollably with anxiety all morning. I need some help.,6,miq5uu,2,"The AH father has been using the stalking method to make me feel on edge all morning.

Rationally I know he’s never hit (that I remember) and won’t start now unless he wants me to call the police but I still feel worried. It’s like my body is more afraid than my mind is.

Please help me, I’m really struggling."
How to escape your freak parents?,4,mipjg7,2,"My parents are both narcissists, 4 year old fuckers in adult bodies trying to prove to the world how great and nice they are and how ungrateful, lazy and evil their son is. Even if i was all that its still their fault but  people are just stupid to realise this. Nobody believes me so i am isolated and bored in my room. They try to abuse me emotionaly but its not working i cant even take them seriously anymore. However i dont know how will i escape. My brain is rotten from the venom they poured in it. I have learning disabilities and i cant get a job or a degree. Atleast not now while my brain is fucked. I swear the same thing cigarettes do to lungs is what these freaks do to your brain. I am healing pretty fast to be honest but idk if its gonna be fast enough. In 1 year i stopped having panic attacks, i have less anxiety and stuff like that but its still not enough. I am 19 and i must get out of my parents house. I tried rewiring my brain from the root and it seems to be working but slowly. Those learning disabilities are caused by an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, (us with cptsd have this problem) a part of the brain.  I was hoping if someone has some advice for me and how i can escape this nightmare and go live my life finaly."
How do I stop misdirecting my feelings and emotions?,4,miow5h,3,"TW abuse talk
It's been about 2 years since I moved out of my abusive mother's house, this August it will have been 3. I still have to talk to her because she pays bills that I am legally unable to take over (and she feels guilty so she pays them for me).

My mother has always been neglectful, narcissistic tendencies but not a narcissist, guilty in denial, abuser. She wanted everything to be normal and enabled her husband to abuse me because she was too scared to stand up to him and he made me the bad guy. A kid. And my mom believed it at some point. Telling her I was angry at her got me nowhere. Telling her she hurt me got her thinking, but after a while she excused it. She cut off her entire family because they told her and her husband that they were abusive and abusing me.

Now that I'm an adult I've been trying to work through my trauma. I did intensive group therapy, I'm going this week to see a new therapist who specializes in trauma/PTSD. I am making a routine for myself to hold myself accountable for my actions and behaviors towards others, and myself. Even if it is hard I am still brushing my teeth every day, proper hygiene, saying sorry when I need to, working on issues with others, trying to reduce self destructive behaviors, etc. But I still have this issue of misdirection.

When I am mad or upset or sad about something, others have noticed I tend to misguide my feelings and put them within different issues. This causes a small issue or a workable issue, to be bigger than it is, more intense, or more hurtful. For example I realized yesterday that the reason I'm mad at my boyfriend was because I feel like I couldn't talk to him- when really I was taking the emotions I had towards my mother and contributing complex and painful emotions and feelings onto a workable issue. So then it blew up and I thought the best outcome would be ""let's break up with my boyfriend"". I feel horrible, guilty, awful about it. I am so ashamed and I didn't even realize I was doing it until he pointed it out.

I do this often and don't know how to not mix up all of my emotions and feelings towards other things. How do I fix this? Any therapy resources?"
Adrenal Fatigue?,6,miopwm,11,"Hey yall... gotta question. Has anyone dealt with ""adrenal fatigue"" or similar symptoms?  The description by many sites says it's a layman's term, and it feels very... naturopathy to me., which I'm not a fan of. But I don't know what else to ascribe my symptoms to. After a long day at work, or ESPECIALLY a good workout, about an hour or so later I get indescribably cold, sluggish, and sleepy. If I work out at 6, I could easily be asleep in bed by eight. If I stay awake, I'm almost drunk, groggy, and at times slap-happy. I drink plenty of water (60-80 oz/day) with a cup or two of coffee a day, and even have taken to drinking post-workout drinks like gatorade or other electrolyte beverages. I occasionally deal with intermitent unexplained hypoglycemia, and my blood pressure tends to drop significantly after pausing exercise. However, no nausea/vomiting/weight loss or the like.

&#x200B;

Caffeine and electrolytes seem to help a little but it's INFURIATING as someone who is required to work out for their job, I can't function like this. I've been struggling with it for years, but my doctor said my thyroid is normal, i'm only slightly anemic (like 11% when anemia is marked as 12) and I have no markers for autoimmune diseases. Doctors have sort of just... shrugged at this and told me to take it easy when I need to and pop a jolly rancher when I get hypoglycemic (thanks!??!) I really haven't had a lot of issues with it the past year because I basically stopped working out with COVID stress making it too much for me, but now that I'm back to trying to get back in shape, yesterday was awful. I did sprints for like 20 minutes, and afterwards I was like sitting in front of a heater draped in blankets, too weak to really want to move, and bordering on wanting to sleep at 6pm. Like... come on?!? Has anyone else dealt with this, and figured out how to alleviate it? I'm on mental health meds, which seem to help some in all aspects EXCEPT this."
I’m angry.,6,mionpz,3,"I’m angry at my entire family.  I’m angry that I grew up with a mom that didn’t love my dad.

Compulsive urge to SH everyday,2,miomob,1,"TW for descriptions of self harm
(TLDR at end of post)
Hello, I have been abused since I was very young. This caused a lot of issues for me with being compulsive, especially developing OCD at about 12. After about the age of 12 I started to get into self harm and after a year or two, I started to get into really heavy self harm and self mutilation that was weirder and heavier than a lot of people's harm I've seen. I did not do it for validation, and didn't often do it for any type of attention. I did it to see how much I could hurt myself. 

And now that I'm 19, I very lightly self harm about once a year. I recently did it again and I told my roommate what was going on because he was worried about it. I told him I have a very high urge to self harm every single day- because I want to hurt myself, and because it looks pretty to me. And I understand it is selfish to not care about what others think of my self harm, I still want to do it. The only reason I only do it once a year is because  I don't like other people getting freaked out by it or telling me they care about my safety. I feel selfish but I don't want to and can't stop. 

My roommate told me it wasn't normal to want to self harm every single day and wanted me to tell my therapist or psychiatrist. I've only told one therapist in my life because what are the rest going to do? Tell me the consequences and why I shouldn't do it, tell me they care and that I need to stop? It wouldn't make me stop. And they've tried medications for it too, nothing has helped a ton. Even after making a huge accomplishment of getting my OCD to extremely severe to mild/moderate I still have the same urge, same intensity, everyday. What's the point of getting help when I already tried? What's the point of stopping? I know the risks and repercussions and how people will react. And sometimes I even feel proud of self harming. I don't know how to change these feelings, but I am aware of them. I just need advice.

TLDR don't want to stop self harming, can't stop, and I don't care that much of what others think of my self harm and will do it anyway. I am resistant to changing these feelings but am willing if I can find the right motivation. Advice?"
My antidepressants are the best thing that’s ever happened to me.,18,mioluz,4,"Just appreciation post for this medicine. I honestly cannot believe it and I’m so grateful for how strong I feel on them. For being able to have a voice on them. For being able to see more clearly and to see my own worth. To see the value I bring. To be able to live a “normal” day. Like holy shit. Can we all just take a second if you feel this way, let me know in the comments."
"After a decent spell of UP, I'm now crashing DOWN again. The pain is almost unbearable",2,mioibf,2,"Since the repressed memory of my CSA resurfaced in Fall 2019, my life has been quite up and down. The discovery of useful tools and concepts to aid my self-therapy helped with the ups, as did finally finding a therapist I like (after trying way too many).

While up, I've been doing everything I can to help others, including a number of supportive comments in appropriate subs to reassure others who seemed to be doing worse than me (at that time).

But today I've had some upsetting messages from my family who I cut out of my life, full of blame, criticism and guilt-tripping.

Intellectually, I know I'm not a bad person and that I can move on by switching to another email provider and then they won't be able to reach me again.

But emotionally it's a different story, and honestly, right now, I hate being me and just want to lay in bed and cry all day.

The thing is, I can't. Still I have this horrible block when I want to cry. I try to let go and all that happens is my entire skull aches like I've been hit round the head with a bat.

If I had strong drugs like codeine or something like that, I'd just take a bunch and wake up in 20-30 hours feeling much better.

But I have nothing and feel nauseous, don't wanna eat, just want to not be here anymore."
Most people haven’t felt creeped out by their Dad?,126,miofhg,72,"I just had a therapy appointment and am now processing the fact that most people don’t feel creeped out by their dad... this is an odd concept for me because I have always felt creepy around him. He was yelling at me to pick something up when I was 12 or so and all I remember is sobbing, not wanting to bend over in front of him and I don’t exactly know why. 

My therapist said she has been doing her work for over 30 years and has spoken with so many people. I’m summarizing— but she said it is not typical or common for Dads to give daughters this creeped out feeling. 

I’m creeped out all over again now but it was a great appointment. She reminds me that before things get better in therapy, it can get hard and messy. Things get all stirred up which is so true. But it has already been sooo worth it. 

What knowledge/insight/experience do you all have with creepy Dads?"
"I want to acknowledge how much trauma I have in the interest of trying to develop some self-compassion, but the defensive mechanisms my brain uses to deny the sheer quantity of it are exhausting (and sometimes impossible) to break through.",9,miocrs,2,"I've been trying to do this recovery thing for a few years now. I can't afford a therapist due to financial setbacks in the last year, so I've been turning to a lot of literature on CPTSD/patterns of abuse. It's only been in the last few weeks that I've actually wanted to try healing again, but it's been so up-and-down. I'm not sure if this is a vent post or a DAE post or what, but I have a lot on my mind and I just wanted to put some of it out there since I'm not talking to anyone IRL about this right now.

I hope I can afford therapy again at some point in the next year or so. I'm so tired. I have these long-ass conversations with myself when I'm doing okay, and that's great, but it makes me feel crazy sometimes. I don't know. I don't really have a point here. It's just a lot.

I hope this wanting-to-try-again feeling sticks around for a bit. I was in a very dark place for a very long time over the last year or so and I am just really, really tired. Uh, if anyone has any reading/video recommendations I'm in a spot where I can look at that stuff again, so feel free. No pressure, of course."
How do you stop Your emotional flashbacks?,9,mio5mo,6,"**TLDR at the bottom** 

Ive seen every video, every podcast, every book (obviously not really but still) and they all have the same exact techniques. 

Which I do use! 

But

Mine is kinda weird and specific and the thing that usually triggers my worst one, last HOURS before the event is over and I know i’m safe once again. But even then I am burntout like hell for a few days. 

So the flashback is deep, gradually gets harder and deeper the longer the event (that I am no where near but worry is happening even if its not) continues, and by the time I recognize I am in a flashback, I am 2 full glasses of hard alcohol in, sleep aid in my system, crying profusely, all alone because I refuse to call anyone anymore during the highs of it (I do try but it doesn’t help much After the call and I resume being in the flashback), and so on. 

I am a damn mess and I have years of therapy to go. But rn I am here and everything kinda sucks bro 😬

Struggling with struggling.,9,miny5v,2,"Some days I feel like there isn't a single soul that understands what I am going through emotionally. I want so badly to just feel the joy I have in my life. I want to feel happiness without that dread of when will something bad happen.   


I feel like a failure as a person. Sometimes I feel like if my soul was just in another body I could finally be able to accept that I am safe now. I've been in weekly trauma therapy for over a year, I attend a weekly trauma group, I practice yoga, mindfulness, journalling, I've done Riki. I feel like nothing I do will ever heal this pain my body feels. I feel damaged beyond repair.   


 I just want to start this life over again. I am scared because I feel like I am losing sight of my sun. I can't accept all the beautiful things I now have in my life because I am just so scared of it. My abusers have made me scared to even be able to fully relax in my own home as an adult. I am sick of struggling with how I feel inside. I know this is all because of my childhood trauma. I have to keep reminding myself, none of this is my fault, I was a child. But it's so hard to keep telling myself that over and over, on top of trying to live a ""normal"" life.

Negative associations based on lived experiences,2,minv4l,1,"Hi everyone. Reaching out here hoping someone may be able to help. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD a couple of years back. I was detained and abused by my family for 5 months for going against cultural norms and wanting to marry someone outside of my culture. After I managed to escape, I went through a long process of healing, the immediate diagnosis was PTSD, and after over a year of therapy, it was categorised as C-PTSD due to events that took place throughout my life that I learned to cope with to survive my environment. 

Now I’m married to the person I love, estranged from my family, moved to a new country and continue my recovery. I found out I’m pregnant, and it was very much planned and I was looking forward to it. To my surprise, instead of being happy, I went into deep depression the first couple of months. Now in 2nd trimester and feeling much better and started to feel excited and joyful about it and have a lot of anticipation. Then I realised, every time I feel excited, I have an impulse of ‘shutting down’ the excitement to avoid getting too excited. It hit me after a while that I associated excitement with things going wrong because my now husband and I have planned our wedding twice before and each time something went wrong; first time I was severely abused by my family we had to cancel, the second time I was detained and again had to cancel. Both times, I was so excited and looking forward to it and had my friends excited about it too, so now when I feel excited about the pregnancy and when we tell friends and they get excited too, a sense of dread hits me. 

Has anyone experience such emotions while recovering from PTSD? How do you deal or cope or manage this? 

Thanks"
Relationship trauma: I get immediately suspicious if my partner shows sudden seemingly uncalled for happiness. I feel so guilty. Does anyone else experience this?,9,minra3,1,"Relationship trauma and abuse can really f*ck with your head for years after, and safe relationships after the abusive one are an unfortunate breeding ground for anxiety and post-trauma symptoms. I feel so guilty for the gut reaction of suspicion when my partner is showing sudden high levels of happiness. Like my brain is seeing it as a threat. My abuser was the type who would show love and happiness, then take it away and show abuse, then show love and happiness, then take it away back and forth. And he was extremely happy when he was hiding malicious things like lies, cheating, and eventually using private videos and pictures of me on porn sites without my knowledge. It f*cked with me and now my brain takes my current safe partner’s happiness as a sign of an impending threat. I hate it and I feel so guilty for it. Does anyone else experience this? I know it is tied to trust, and my trust was shattered time and time again. Building it back up is so hard."
"Despite having symptoms of CPTSD myself, I do not know how to support my partner when they have a traumatic response to a trigger. Advice wanted.",18,min14k,10,"I've done a lot of work on my own cptsd, but I still feel like I do not know how to support my partner when they have their own traumatic response to one of their triggers. They don't have a lot of triggers, but kitchen mistakes is the big one. For instance, yesterday, they were cooking dinner and nearly finished. When it was time to pull the dish out of the broiler, they reached in and grabbed it without oven mitts. They yelled when they realized how hot it was and dropped it. The dish flipped over and spilled the food all over the bottom of the broiler drawer of the oven and the floor. They practically ran to the other side of the room like they wanted to get away from me and screamed and started apologizing repeatedly and crying.

I can be calm and quiet and do what is needed materially in these situations, but I feel like I'm lacking emotionally. Like I was able to tell them that it was fine and a totally normal mistake. I gave them a job to keep the dogs in the living room while I cleaned it up. They were too upset to pay attention to the dogs. I really felt like it was way out of my league to deal with outside of holding them and telling them that it's not a big deal, I'm not mad, we can order out. They were really getting on themselves for being dumb, a waste of space, not worth the time. Everything that comes out of my mouth feels like all the pointless things that have been said to me by people in my life. I feel very helpless. I default to giving space and leaving the issue alone. I put on some Simone Giertz videos later for us to watch because I like how she shows that making mistakes, mourning them, and continuing on are all part of the learning process. 

They finally have health insurance again and have found a therapist that they want to reach out to, but it hasn't happened yet. I totally empathize with that situation, but it does mean that the kitchen mistake reactions are here to stay for a while. Are there any resources I can find so that I can be more supportive? I'm not interested in being someone's therapist, but I do feel like there's got to be something I can say or do that's better than ""you're okay, it will be fine, it's okay to feel bad, it's not a big deal"". 

I think it's so cool that they want to cook even though this kind of reaction is possible for them when they try. I wish I could say that in a way that reaches them without being infantilizing. A lot of my work on myself had to do with opening myself up to compliments/ praise without seeing it as pandering. I don't know if it's possible to do from outside or if it's even part of the issue for my partner. Really at a loss.

Edit: we did talk about it and my partner said I pretty much did what they needed from me. They really couldn't bear to look at the mess at the time so that was all the right stuff. It makes me feel better about what I did. It did bring up some stuff for me and how my parents dealt with mistakes, so I will be bringing this up in therapy for multiple reasons lol. I think my discomfort was mostly on my end and my own issues, not anything I was doing wrong."
Thoughts on treatment/recovery and medication,3,mimxqw,2,"TW: mentions medication usage (pro/con), alternative treatments, sexual frustrations (possibly medication related or trauma?)

I have been on antidepressants since I was 9-10, I had been experiencing depression for two years prior to then but I absolutely had anxiety my entire life. I was told that antidepressants would help with my mood swings caused my hormones, that itd make dealing with my ups and downs more manageable/less noticeable and i had the illusion that id feel normal for once in my life.

At age of 18 i quit antidepressants cold turkey because I was tired of feeling either absolutely nothing, not even a tear during a funeral. The medication made me nauseous, made me feel nothing, etc - and yet i still feel depressed/moody due to hormones. 

I decided to give medication a shot again (22F) as my flashbacks have been getting worse, Im still depressed / have issues with physical anxiety, and I just want to find any way of feeling normal for once - except im 3 months in to receiving medication and I feel just the same as last night except this time my sex drive is nonexistent. I mentioned this to my doctor but his recommendation is to increase the dosage but Im not sure. 

Im not sure if this is a rant or looking for advice, just a bit tired of medication being the first line of defense. I watched my father slowly waste away on the medication meant to help him and I just worry about being the same. Im currently trying to change my entire living situation to something more inviting, get a pet to help brighten my mood (big pet lover), and trying to get outside more.

I know medication IS needed in many situations, Im just tired of seeing no results as of late. On one hand I feel like no one takes how debilitating this is when I refuse medication, but i just dont see the results. Hoping PTSD specific therapy and my life changes will help better than the medication, I often feel like im running out of options sometimes. 

TL;DR: been taking different anti depressant medications my whole life but dont notice a difference, feeling frusterated and looking for alternative treatment methods"
First EMDR Session,17,mimu1l,5,"My therapist said I did really well and overall it was a positive experience.

...except it kind of rattled the cage that holds the beast that is my anger. And by ""rattled"" I mean threw it down the stairs and screamed, ""WAKEY WAKEY, EGGS AND BAKEY!""

So now I have this strangely calm access to my rage and nowhere to really channel it, and it's *exhausting* keeping it from redirecting at other people."
"""Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom"" ~ Viktor E Frankl",21,mimrvu,1,"I read a snippet in here the other day about how humans emotionally regulate each other as an evolutionary trait.  I thought this was an interesting point to keep in mind as we move through and respond to the world and people around us.  


We respond emotionally to other people's emotions, whether we notice our response or not.


I am still struggling with regulating my own emotions when others have strong emotions around me.  I thought perhaps others may be as well, and sharing my thoughts about how we can try to emotionally regulate ourselves while still being empathetic may be helpful to others.


Changing our emotional responses first requires recognition that they happen.  The only way to do this is practice recognizing body and mind's responses to what happens around us.  


I will warn you that in my experience this practice starts slow but builds quickly, and is incredibly uncomfortable for a time.  It got better when I started seeing and acknowledging when I was controlling my programmed responses and feeling a sense of victory in that.  Recognizing and celebrating growth helps us motivate to keep growing.


Examples of noticing how I react to to others emotions include that when someone around me is angry, I get anxious and flighty.  Every time.  This is because of people in my life who used their anger as a tool to get me to behave in certain ways.  There were often escalating consequences if I did not do or say what they wanted.


Also, when someone around me is sad, I tend to fawn because of people in my life who used emotion in a manipulative manner.  They weren't crying or expressing sadness because of genuine sadness, they were crying to try to get me to do what they wanted.  Now I often feel manipulated by people's sadness, even sometimes when it is genuine.  


I feel like I am getting better at recognizing manipulative verses genuine emotions, but that is involved and may eventually be another post.  I will say, watch body language and trust your intuition.  If an emotion seems fake to you, it may be, but use caution in calling that out, because it may not be for the reason you think.  It could be that person's trauma response leading them to deflect - meaning their emotion is real but it isn't about what they are thinking and saying it is.  Recognizing when we are deflecting comes with this practice as well.  And make no mistake, we do deflect.



Learning to feel my own responses to others' emotions, actions, etc was the first step to emotionally regulating myself despite outside stimuli.  It was hard, and the only recommendation I have for learning to do it is meditation, because that is what finally worked for me.  It is a constant practice, noticing what we feel and choosing what our response may be.   


This is where the quote in the title comes in.  I literally visualize space.  Stars, clouds, whatever.  This really helps me stop and create a moment for myself, instead of instinctively responding to things.


These days, when I feel myself starting to respond to something I don't want to respond to, like someone else's emotions, words, or actions, I can sometimes but not always slow or even stop my response.  Once the reaction stops, I can reason myself back to neutral and then respond dispassionately.   Or I can choose to respond with emotion, but appropriately instead of reactionarily and possibly disproportionately.


The last thing I will mention is that this is a practice.  That means you won't be good at it at first.  That is fine.  There is progress in simply recognizing where our reactions were not what we hope for ourselves, acknowledging to the people around us that we are trying, and starting again from where we are.


We have to forgive ourselves when we fall back into old patterns, and acknowledge that simply recognizing those patterns is growth.  Growth takes time.


Thank you all for being here, and for your posts and comments.   They help me figure myself out, and I am immensely grateful!

how is it like when you dissociate?,4,mimibe,7,"I know quite a few people who have trauma and dissociate and for them, they feel disconnected from their body and can’t feel anything or they don’t feel real, but I know dissociation can look different for everyone, but for me when I dissociate, it usually happens if I get triggered by something and I‘ll relive one of my traumatic events or sometimes I‘m not reliving anything and I didn’t really get triggered at something and it happens anyway, and I always say that I „leave“ because when I dissociate, I‘m reliving a traumatic event or just feel like I‘m somewhere else and when I come back, I have no memory of what just happened and I heard nothing. One time I dissociated while in German class and someone translated something and I left and had no memory of it happening and also when I was cutting potatoes and while I was in the shower that I literally almost forgot that I was taking a shower when I came back to reality lmao"
Bad morning,11,mim420,6,"Woke up this morning thinking I was going to try really hard to have a good day. Had a road trip planned 2 hours away for lunch.

Things are okay now. They gave him some medication and did some tests and will get back to me in two weeks. I just feel on edge and weird now. My head feels really weird and I don't feel like my body is real. Have nobody else to talk to so I thought I'd post here. Idk."

"DAE struggle with the inability to feel good, motivated and content with the smaller, more mundane things in life? It seems like I can only feel good whenever I get a kick or some kind of instant gratification.",31,milim1,3,"It has always been like this and I feel so ashamed of it.

"Nightmares, he has APD, im terrified",3,mil6j4,1,"I've been having awful nightmares since I came back home. They all go the same. He (scary ex bf) kidnaps me in Florida where I go to school, does a lot of terrifying things to me that feel super real including removing my larynx (wtf), which causes me to hide my ability to sign so he doesn't cut off my hands. I'm then struggling to communicate because my family can't sign, and for some reason I end up in group therapy and nobody believes me or anything, despite one of the therapist showing a recording of his trial. He then gets fired and then everyone is mad at me for getting him fired. Eventually the interpreter stands up and is like ""Guys, I interpreted for her when she was in the hospital and the nurse told her she could die. I saw her struggle to try to talk. You guys are just being bullies"" And then I wake up. It's just weird because dreams usually don't follow rules, but this did?

I think this is popping up because I'm back home. Where he lives. And I've been thinking a lot about one of the last conversations I had with him before blocking him everywhere. He told me doctors are trying to figure out how to treat him, and if his bipolar is related to anti-social personality disorder. Later, this was confirmed. He didn't know quite what that meant when he first told me, usually when he was playing doctor google he just looked up ""psychopathy"" and didn't pay attention to the name of the disorder. Now, I know not everyone with it is a monster who hurts people for no reason. But he is. And I remember a conversation I had with his mother shortly after breaking up with him. He was initially gracious about it, as long as we could still be friends. Later, He told me he was suicidal, and kept apologizing for hurting me, and generally going on about his problems (a habit that definitely didn't make me want to keep in touch). So, I rushed over to his house and stayed with him until his parents showed up. I showed his mom the messages. When I left, she showed me out and once we were away from him and his dad she asked me ""did he hurt you? What did he mean?"" and I said no. Telling a mother (and she is super sweet and kind, I respect her a lot) that her son is a monster doesn't sound like fun to me. 

I'm rambling. Idk I'm just scared. I need to talk to doc about going back on prazosin, but generally my anxiety has been insane. Usually I have more issues with depression, but this is worse than it has been in a while."
What to do about brain fog?,4,mil5eq,3,"I have bad brain fog very frequently. Usually when it's time to get to work and do something for someone else it lifts, but as soon as no one will be bothered by me doing nothing it comes back. It makes it so hard to work towards personal goals.

Anyone else with horrible dental/physical health?,31,mikmjm,12,"I was neglected a lot when it came to my health as a kid. To this day I’m suffering consequences of it. I’m 27 and nearly all of my teeth are rotting as I was never taken to the dentist as a kid. I’m working with a team to get them fixed up and already had 4 root canals/crowns done but need a lot more work. Going to the dentist triggers my anxiety to a great degree as I feel overwhelming shame about my dental health. Sometimes I feel like the only 20 something on earth with horrid teeth and it’s extraordinary isolating. Despite me doing something about it, it’s unbelievable frustrating to know this all could have been avoided if someone loved me enough to give me basic medical care."
"TW :: Abuse, Suicidal Thoughts, Drugs.",12,mikkrs,3,"I'm just gonna say it; FUCK PTSD.

I'm so fucking sick of it. I was diagnosed around four years ago and it's made my life a living hell. I can't sleep. I get audio hallucinations and it scares the shit out of me. I dissociate a lot. It feels like I'm not in my house half the time, but instead I'm back in my abusers house.

I was abused my multiple people throughout my life and I remember it as if it happened yesterday, sometimes I can feel it and it's making me loose my mind. I'm going to therapy for this but nothing's working. Nothing ever works.

I'm on medication for it but I'm not even motivated to get up and walk to the chemist to grab the meds. It feels like such a hard task when it's literally just a five minute walk up the road.

My mother left me three times for a long period of time. She left me for a few days but for the 3 times it was for months, years even.

The first time she left was when she dropped us off at my grandmother's. I felt like my whole world started falling apart that day. I sat in the garage and cried my eyes out, wk seeing what I did wrong and why my mother just left us there. Eventually she came back, weekly visits would turn into daily visits then back into weekly visits. It was nice living with my grandmother, I won't lie. I still love my grandmother to death. But she wasn't perfect. She yelled a lot. I'm not sure if it was because of her epilepsy but it was terrifying. She still does it to this day. She used to just loose it; pulling drawers out and spilling the contents into the floor, banging the cupboard doors repeatedly for ages, screaming and yelling at everyone. Sometimes she'd even put holes in the walls.

I don't blame her. Suddenly she was living her life then her stupid daughter just dropped off three kids and left. To be fair, we weren't easy to handle. We didn't listen half the time, sometimes we even mocked her. We weren't good kids but we've gotten better. My brother was never rude to her, but me and my younger brother were just stupid. I still apologize to this day for being a cunt to her.

My younger brother and I also fought a lot. Stressed my family out. I dunno why we fight so much. I'm trying to build a relationship with him but it's hard and I can't tell if it's my fault or his.

I remember my mum came back because she wanted us back. I was so happy I nearly cried. I thought we could just leave then and there. I was wrong.

We went into foster care for a while. We went to two homes. The second lady was lovely, but the first was disgusting.

She was nice for the first few weeks. Asked us how school was, what we wanted to watch on TV. But something was wrong.

My siblings and I lived there with two other people, a five year old girl (J) and a 17 (I think) year old boy (M). J was a spoiled brat. She was very rude to us and got us into trouble a lot. I remember once we were playing at the park and she was stressing my older brother out a lot and he started crying. We had to go back and J told our carer (B) and she wasn't happy. I stead of getting upset for making my brother cry and told him that if he cried again she'd hit him and we wouldn't be able to go and see our mum again. Our mum wasn't good but she was better than her.

So basically we weren't allowed to cry. It was just used, too. J could get upset and so could M but as soon as we did we'd get hit.

Something that really fucked me up is what J did to me. They had a small white dog. We were going on a trip and J tied the dog up to the door. The door was leveled a meter from the ground on a porch so I tried to untie it as we were leaving because I knew the dog wouldn't want to be tied up on such a small leash. Keep in mind the dog wasn't wearing a collar so J just tied it around its neck a few times to keep it secure. J stopped me and told me if I untied the leash she'd get B to bash me, so I didn't. We left for the day and when we came back I immediately went to let the dog off the leash because it would've been thirsty but when I got out the back it was dead, hanging off the back porch. Everyone came outside and B asked who did it. I tried to say J but she immediately said it was me. Now, I never talked back to B because she was fucking terrifying, but I fucking lost it. I started yelling, telling B that it wasn't me. I told her what happened and B turned to my siblings and asked if J really did that. They said yes. I don't know why. Maybe they thought I did it, maybe they were just scared. Maybe they knew if they said no she'd still believe J.

B lost it. She starved, beat and yelled at me for a week. She told me how worthless I was and that I didn't deserve anything. She even got her husband to hurt me. We got out once I told my mum about it.

It's been eight years and I still can't forget about it. I'm scared of dogs now and I can't go near that part of town again without freaking out.

My mum tells me to get over it because it happened years ago but fuck it's so hard to. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about what she did. Sometimes it feels like I'm back there again and I hate it.

I can't go outside by myself because I'm so fucking scared of people. I get scared when people look at me and I can't look people in the eyes.

I fucking hate everything.

Fuck this shit, I hate feeling like this.







I'm sorry for the long ass rant , I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm too scared to tell my therapist about half the shit that happened too. Fuck fuuuuck!

God I wish I was dead, then this shit would stop happening. I'm probably gonna delete this later because it's stupid. Sorry."
DAE get overwhelmed by too many options?,201,mikbxi,44,"If I have too many options for books, podcasts, TV shows, etc, I freeze.

Does anyone have any practical advice for how to short-circuit this problem?"
I can't let love in and sex disgusts me.,56,mik2dk,9,"I'm 22F and I've had my fair share of abuse growing up from sociopathic NF. The abuse was so severe, I was basically a dissociated zombie for almost 12 years. Some of the experiences I've had are:

* Being beaten up for watching porn & getting caught when I was 12-13
* Have my bastard of a father play pornography on loud speaker to scare me after I did not do my homework. 
* Him saying that any man who marries me will be unlucky and that he would definitely divorce me because I'm a nasty ""monster"". I was 10. 
* Being called a whore and beaten up for eavesdropping on my parents use the bathroom. It wasn't a perverted thing, I was just really amused by the peeing sounds. Just childish immature stuff.

This and numerous other abuses destroyed me completely. I've managed to heal my cognitive capacity now (after failing out of college with a 1.9 GPA) and am on track to graduating from another college with a 3.3 GPA now. I've also healed my emotional trauma and it has significantly improved my friendships/career prospects. 

However, I just cannot seem to undo the sexual shame within. I definitely am not asexual and do get attracted to guys but often feel scared that they will hurt me. The thought of sex disgusts me and I am frightened of letting a guy love me. Which is why I will fantasise all day long about my celebrity crush but if a cute guy walks past in real life, I will run the other way. 

It doesn't help that most people consider me extremely attractive (I genuinely do not see myself in that light) so when I do get interest, it scares me even more. There's this discrepancy between the ""shiny"" exterior everyone sees and the ""ugly shameful"" person within. 

I just cannot let love in. The thought of someone loving me is disgusting and the thought of having sex with someone who loves me, makes me nauseous."

For me (20m), I always been attracted to female always, and still do however, I been through 3 sexual assault, plus some unsolicited nudes that been sent by males, and some other small situation, at some of the situation I felt a sense of arousal, now I know it's normal and doesn't mean I liked it, and I actually get angry when people send unsolicited nudes ""all males"". But I think it affected my sexuality, sometimes I told myself if they want me to be gay, I will be gay. Now I am mostly attracted to females, but there are some days where I crave seeing gay-anime nudes. I love watching them at the moment, but after I finish I feel sad and feel disgusted.

After months of feeling ashamed, feeling guilty, seeing myself as worthless and wondering constantly why I'm just not enough, I realized I will never be enough for any of my friends, and they would all sooner see me die than give a shit. I attempted suicide 5 months ago, and afterwards got told by my friends that they ridiculed belittled and shit talked me behind my back, and that's what they had to do to cope with my wanting to die, like it was my fault for ever making them feel like that. Another one of them called me while I was in the facility, and told me point blank that they won't be there for me. Another directly made promises and plans with me to keep me safe, kept missing and bailing on those promises, and in response to my getting upset at him told me ""You're to fucking much. I can't deal with you right now."" and abandoned me at my weakest and most vulnerable, and fed me silence until I was compliant to the silent abusive ""truth"" that I was wrong and that I deserved to be treated that way.

I genuinely cannot believe how much I've let myself put up with against garbage evil people. They are horrible, and I am so glad that I see it fully now. It wasn't my fault they didn't care enough to be there for me, they really couldn't have given a shit whether I lived or died. But they made sure that I constantly felt bad if I ever dared speak up for myself.

This has to be one of the biggest milestones and victories for me over the past bit! I have finally realized that all of my friends were abusive assholes too and it almost killed me this year. But I'm actually smiling because I feel a sense of freedom and liberation I've never known before in my life"
Does anyone else have an inner teenager more than/as well as an inner child?,168,miimxe,37,"I think my inner child was able to cope better, early childhood was still bad, but my teen years were by far the worst. When I was 13 my Mum had a breakdown, my Dad got made redundant & could not find a new job which lead to some huge emotional instability for him, and my disabled brother became jealous & violent towards me. Plus my Mum pulled us both out of school to home school us so I was totally isolated in complete dysfunction & chaos. 

I've had trauma throughout my life, but the highest concentration was in my teens. In my early childhood I was tenacious & stubborn, if I imagine my inner child & inner teen, the child is definitely either comforting the teen or hands on hips yelling at those that hurt her. 

Anyone else have a similar situation?"
High school bullying has ruined me,18,miimc6,2,"p.s english is not my native language

Before I am going to explain everything, I would like to mention that I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I have been to therapy and it really helped, but I have a feeling that I also have PTSD and that it might be the root cause of all problems. 

I got bullied throughout my high school years and always tried to find ways to ""fix"" myself so the bullies would not pick on me anymore. After high school I totally lost myself and didn't even know who I really was as a person, because I was so used to changing myself for other people.

At school the bullies would laugh at me and I was always excluded in project groups. They also made comments about my mustache, my nose and ethnicity. I felt extremely ugly and would cry myself to sleep every single day. Eventually I transferred schools because the bullying made me sick and after transferring the new bullies would also pick on me. I made some really good friends on my new school, but the bullying never really stopped. 

And to be honest I sometimes did understand why they were bullying me, probably because they sensed that I was acting fake. But there were times when I didn't understand it, because they would just make comments about my face and it made me feel extremely ugly. I remember this guy in particular, he said something to me that I could never forget. He said something in the lines of ""A person like you will never succeed in life"" and ""Don't look at me with your ugly face"".

Fast forward after high school I found ways to make myself look pretty by using make-up. Besides that, my facial features slightly changed throughout the years so that really helped. I suddenly got a lot of attention from guys and didn't know how to handle it and I felt like an imposter. I didn't know my own worth and was extremely insecure. 

After that I met my now ex-boyfriend, I was 16 and he was 21 years old. He used my money and abused me mentally and physically. We would do almost everything with my money and I feel so stupid and naive for allowing him to do so. 

I could never talk to him about my problems. He would abuse me mentally for addressing issues in the relationship. He would always say things like ""It's not easy to find a guy like me"" and ""No guy will ever love you as much as I do"". Now remembering this it makes me cringe so much, because he was the complete opposite. They guy also had some anger issues and choked me a couple of times. Besides that I always felt ugly, although he never told me that I was ugly, but the high school trauma made me feel like I was. 

Now two years later I am slowly recovering from everything but because of the relationship I developed an anxiety disorder. My anxiety gets triggered especially when someone is ignoring me, because my ex-boyfriend used to ignore me for days if I did something wrong in his eyes and when extremely mad he would send texts with really hurtful words. I never really felt comfortable when not wearing make-up. My ex-boyfriend never called me ugly without, but there was this time when I was late and I ran to the train station without make-up, and accidentally saw a couple. They didn't really like my ex-boyfriend and started to take pictures of me. Not sure why they were taking pictures, but I strongly believed that it was because of my face without make-up and this was a trigger for me. 

At the moment I am working in a project group at university and I am working with some people from another university. And I feel so uncomfortable working with them, because they tend to joke a lot. Sometimes they make jokes about me or make fun of other people from other project groups, especially the people who are less attractive, which is pretty fucked up. When they were joking around it triggered my PTSD. Once I came late for a meeting the girl told me ""Well, I guess we are going to kick you out of the group :) hahaha""  and told me that it's a joke afterwards but it triggers something in me. It makes me want to vomit when they're joking around. It feels like I am reliving high school all over again. These people are bullies, but they are the adult version of bullies so the bullying is less intense? They are not picking on me all the time, because when it's time to work on the project they are serious and act normal like everyone else. 

I am just so damaged and confused at the moment :( Would appreciate any advice."
Confronted my high school bully. Can you forgive in the absence of a real apology? I think I did.,23,miijzf,6,"TLDR: OP overcomes some pain and trauma by confronting her high school bully.

I decided to confront my high school bully via Facebook Messenger. I guess for closure after 15 years and because I wondered if I was ready to let go of my anger and pain. And, maybe, she had changed. 

Here is what I said:

Dear xxxx,

I am writing to you to ask whether you will consider apologising for your behaviour towards me during our time in year 7 and 8.

It is prompted by another apology I received some time ago from another person who bullied me in early high school.

My memories of that time are of the most profound and cruel isolation from my peers as a result of your behaviour. I was routinely mocked, ostracised, demeaned, undermined and treated in a way that no person should have to endure for a period of two years. Teachers, members of the school community and classmates were well aware of the behaviour and who was responsible.

The pain that I was caused as a young girl did not prevent me from becoming a strong, kind, compassionate, respectful, empathetic and successful woman 16 years later.

However, it left me with significant psychological and emotional scarring.

After 15 years, I do not understand why you chose to engage in the behaviour that you did. I do want to give you an opportunity to apologise (without reservation) for your actions, if you possess the insight and the inclination to do so.

....

She responded and claimed not to remember anything, but also explicitly denied 'going out of her way' to hurt me. She then did the classic 'im sorry if I hurt you' on the basis that her memory wasn't 'perfect' just in case she did something wrong. She then also states that she remembers enough not to have initiated the class bullying.

The truth is she drove all of it. Bitchiness, exclusion, taunting and cruelty because I was smart. For two years she was the ringleader. She was even suspended for bullying my sister after I left the school - hard to forget that, you would think. So I said:

""Thank you. I don't feel that you have taken responsibility but I forgive you despite your lapse in memory. I feel genuinely sorry for you given the amount of shame you must carry for how you treated me. I forgive you and I hope you have a fulfilling life""


I chose to give up the shame and self blame I have been haunted by for years. Forgiving means giving up the hurt - she can carry the shame instead."
Grieving what I lost,5,mii6d1,3,"Where I live, people have started to celebrate the Easter Holiday. I see my friends with their families on social media, having lots of fun. I am not saying that they shouldn’t have fun. It hurts to the core that I am living all alone and I don’t have anyone to spend the holidays with. I am soon 21 years old and I feel like I have lost so much and my peers can’t understand me. Around every holiday I feel this sadness. Grieving never ends, that’s how it feels like.

I went no contact with my biological family 4 years ago. My foster parents are okay but we  don’t spend so much time together. I do prefer living alone over with people because I feel so much safer this way. I just want to have a loving and supportive family. Is that too much to ask for? I wished that I could call and the person answering would be a mom or dad and their voice would be soft and warm."
I moved out from an abusive household and told the abuser she's an alcoholic,11,mihsju,1,"I have since a year back lived with a emotionally abusive alcoholic roomie, whom I couldn't move away from due to lack of money. It tore me down, gave me depression and triggered lots of old memories of childhood abuse. Today I moved out, taking her neglected cat with me (I pay for the cat's insurance anyway) and I told her she's an alcoholic, blocked her after she berated me over not saying goodbye.

She has kept me up by partying on workday nights, got so black out drunk she has entered my room while I slept several times unless I lock the door, made me take care of her dog and gotten mad at me when the dog loved me more, stolen my alcohol and just been a very mean drunk. She's a false person who lies and scams people and is an avid alcoholic in denial who mix pills with booze. I will never look back. She's blocked and out of my life.

I have adopted her cat and the cat is the love of my life, so despite living in hell for a year it was worth it, but damn, hope the next roomie is an alcoholic asshole just as her."
Anyone with cptsd doubt their trauma,25,mihhwh,15,"I have the symptoms of cptsd and have dealt with it all my life. Am just lately having a language to talk about it. I dissociate frequently and feel like I have different parts. It’s hard to put words to but my self has never felt solid. 

But I often doubt that it’s real. Most people don’t see anything wrong with me on the outside and would be shocked if I said I had cptsd. They would ask what happened to me to cause this. 

I have always been really sensitive. My parents loved me but I often felt emotionally unseen. I think I had early attachment trauma but don’t have the direct memories from then to know. I went through a series of traumas to my body starting at age 9. Sorry I’m being vague but it’s something some people would find traumatizing and others wouldn’t. I had a hard time fitting in at school. Then I had an eating disorder and struggled with depression while a teenager. I felt lost most of my 20s. Much of my life I’ve felt unreal and I feel grief at time I feel like I’ve lost.

I struggle with doubting myself and even wondering if I can say I’ve been through trauma."
"Carbs trigger flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety ?",3,mih8jj,6,"⚠️ As it was pointed out to me, this post might be triggering to those with ED


Hey, 

So i noticed something pretty damning for me that I want to share. English isn't my language so bear with me.

Carbs have been my main (if not only) source of food for years.
2 months ago, I did a long term fast for a few days, and noticed very encouraging results on my ptsd symptoms such as nightmares, flashbacks and anxiety. They weren't completely gone but wayyy toned down and actually manageable. Then when i started eating again, i focused on healthy food, fibers, healthy fats proteins and the improvements i had noticed were still there.
A couple weeks later, I had a slip up and started eating junk food again. Bam, the anxiety and flashbacks came back with a vengeance.
Did another prolonged fast, which calmed the symptoms a bit, then immediately started eating a diet mostly consisting of bread and cheese (i am a frenchie after all). You guessed it, symptoms came back like crazy.
So I did a third 4 days fast again, ate healthy again, symptoms gone.
Just yesterday, i had a binge of junk food and now i'm feeling like shit, flashbacks won't leave me alone.

Doing research, I couldn't find any study or evidence of the correlation between a high carb diet and ptsd/cptsd although there's a link between it and symptoms of depression/anxiety. 

But from my short term experience, the correlation is pretty damning. It's obviously not a miracle cure, nothing is, but it is really a huge difference.
My symptoms can be very much debilitating and with fasting or low carb diet, they are very much manageable.

I really suggest all of you to try avoiding carbs for a week and please if you do, share your results.

**tl;dr** : Carbohydrates might play an important role in cptsd/ptsd symptoms and avoiding them, in my experience, alleviate those symptoms greatly while high carb diet makes them worst."
How to accept that it might never get better?,2,mih67h,5,Is it even possible to heal? 
does this sound like hyperarousal?,2,mieg1v,0,"i wanna preface this by saying i havent been diagnosed with cptsd. i still live with my parents.

i am not sure if i really am, but it sure feels like im constantly anxious. i wake up and there's my heartbeat. i cant sleep in. my heart will often have some combination of racing or pounding. often these are in the still moments. ill be sitting in my zoom class, and ill have a brief thought or emotion that will trigger a wave of anxiety to run through my body, leaving my heart pounding. when i try to sleep it also beats. there's often a feeling of there being no ""floor"" under my heart, like its going to fall, just that physical anxious feeling in the center of the chest. i cant focus on tv shows or movies because of this. youtube is better if its comedy, but it seems like sitting still and focusing and watching something is the hardest. i read a lot of fanfic and i can focus much better on it than videos, but there's often something thatll ""set me off"" and ill have to take a break and look at twitter to make myself calm down. it doesnt feel like anxiety. similar but different...its like this itching, an unease but not quite. the only thing that really takes my mind off of things is drawing and sleeping. i think im constantly in some kind of state of derealization or depersonalization (i havent felt real for years, constant visual snow, etc) but somehow that dissociation never eases my anxiety. because of it i cant even nap. the first time i napped since i was a baby was a couple months ago when my family left for a few days. it was incredible. i felt genuinely refreshed from being dead tired.

during these periods of days where im constantly uneasy like this, im extremely productive art wise, but school assignments become even harder to do because the stress of having to do something assigned is so much. im not usually such a procrastinator but its gotten worse the more i consider the possibility of cptsd and think about my entire life.

most of the time im in this uneasy, extremely productive state (yet will still be exhausted all the time) but sometimes there will be a crash, where i lay in bed for longerthan usual and dont draw and just. wallow. for a couple days. even though its that empty sadness it finally feels like my body and brain lets myself rest. i can finally sleep without intense fear creeping up on me for no reason, and hearing what may be hallucinations or may be my insanely sensitive ears, and seeing the shadows moving. i can fall asleep easier. just now the atmosphere around my ears changed and the air moving from the fan sounds really strange and scary and im suddenly pretty scared right now. typing about this kinda stuff always makes me dissociate, so ill stop here.

oh also, my shoulder and neck muscles feel like rocks and i always hold tension in my jaw and eyebrows. i also seem to be quite prone to repetitive strain injuries? the ones with the nerves, like ulnar nerve issues and carpal tunnel"
"My brother has brought a girl over tonight and I’ve felt what I crave but I don’t have: intimacy, human relationships",9,mih0oi,1,"These 2 days my parents are out so I’m home alone with my younger brother (he’s M21, I’m M23). Last night he brought a girl to spend the night with her here. The 2 times that I’ve physically seen her have brought me feelings of butterflies in my stomach: yesterday night when she came and right now as I’m having breakfast as she left. These feelings have been uncomfortable, they mean that there’s something I crave but I’m not getting.

It’s a mix of feelings that I understand come from childhood trauma. I would like to have sex and intimate with a woman too, but I never relate to any. What I’ve learned over the past years is that for an intimate relationship to happen, there has to be an emotional bond that makes the 2 people get closer. It doesn’t happen because of logic, or because one member convinces the other. But because both members feel attracted and let themselves be carried away by their feelings.

When I was with my ex for 4 years (my only intimate relationship), I could never have sex or let myself be carried away because I was 100% repressed by the unconscious trauma I carried. Now I’m less repressed, I can do the intimate thing.

It’s alienating that I haven’t spoken face-to-face with any girl since the pandemic started more than 1 year ago. The longer this goes on, the more alien I feel to the notion of intimate romantic human relationships.

I crave intimacy but I’m not finding people who I relate to. I almost don’t even relate to my friends. Not only people but activities too. All my activities are solitary. After all the childhood trauma I’ve been through, I feel alienated. I’ve always felt like that, but now I’m more conscious. For the past year and a half I've only related to people when I’m here in /r/CPTSD or similar spaces on the web. *The sexual tension between me and no one*.

What has increased my feelings today is that this girl who has come home is not only attractive, but physically looks like a crush I had 3-2 years ago. She was the last intense crush I’ve had, and it stopped when I started discovering CPTSD. Since then my focus has shifted entirely to myself to heal. I haven’t had intense crushes since then.

**I want to spend time with people in person and create meaningful relationships, but I have no idea of where to go/what to do to find like-minded people.**"
Dissociating While Eating?,19,migqpe,10,"This is happening a LOT to me lately, and I was wondering if any of you could relate. I just go into auto-pilot and eat without tasting anything. Then it feels like I just blinked and suddenly, all the food is gone. 

It's like: *""Oh, wait what? What's going on? Oh, I'm done eating? What did I even eat? How did it taste?""*

It's stupid, but I've accidentally eaten spoiled food several times without even realizing because of this. (I'd find out later because someone else will point it out.)"

Does anyone else have moments when their body spontaneously spasms?,56,mig8ob,51,"Imagine like a dog going to shake, a very rapid wiggle from side to side. I can't control it and it usually happens randomly- most often often talking to someone else. I'm guessing it's to do with releasing pent up anxiety or stress. Noticed it probably a decade ago. It really weirds out other people sometimes."
This is my story. I would need to share it so awareness could be spread.,9,miftu7,1,"**T**hroughout my childhood I was exposed to numerous bad things. Most of them came from the worst person I've known to this day, sadly it is one of my parents - my mother.  
I was constantly shouted at, screamed at, beaten, kicked and manipulated. As some know, I go to hospital every two weeks for blood transfusions, due to anemia. This is since 2010. I got diabetes in 2015.  
My mother would always manipulate the people around me so they think she is caring and a ""good"" parent, which she is definitely not.  
I have been abused verbally and physically so many times. I found a good job in 2018, in a call centre (my first call centre). I met my love at work in January 2019 and we were together until Feb 2021.. when we broke up. (Things weren't going as good as before, so.. we decided to become friends and see if things will work out in future.. But.. she found a new partner and yeah.. she doesn't want anything at all now.).. This is not the important thing.  
In November 2020 I moved away from my mother as I used an argument (which she started) against her. She told me to pack my things and leave ""her"" apartment, which I paid rent for at the time, as I didn't ""trust"" her. My mother started calling my previous manager (woman) and asking her when will I get the rest of my money from my salary as I didn't get the whole sum. The manager wasn't in a good financial situation back then and it was really f..ed up from my mother to disturb her. And.. next morning after the call with my mother I went there with my (now ex) girlfriend and got my stuff. I lived with my girlfriend until Jan 2021. I moved under rent in that pretty good apartment and recently got a cat.  
I am so afraid to let my mother know about what happened and that I no longer live with my girlfriend, as my mother is awful. She will always turn things around against me and will start shouting, making accusations.. I am afraid that she will do something bad and will force me to go back to live with her, which I don't want AT ALL. I don't want to live in such toxic environment. She is an alcoholic and smokes a few packs of cigarettes a day. She is an excuse of a parent. And.. there was a period (a few weeks before the time I moved out from my mother's place) when my gf suggested that I contact the police for further assistance, but I was too afraid to do so.. My parents had a divorce since I was 5 and my father is in another city (my home city). I see him rarely, but we have strong bong and we text every day. My mother would often use ""I will call your father"" as a method to turn him against me, which is super toxic and awful.   
I went to my gf's place a lot before (like 4-5 days a week I stayed at her apartment and 2 days at my mom's apartment) and I felt comfortable there. Like in a safe haven. Now I am so afraid that something might happen to me if my mother finds out. If I suddenly disappear or never reply again, please be aware that something seriously bad happened. If you can, report this to someone. I can give details about my mother and all the necessary info.   
I feel threatened and I don't know what to do. Just being in the same room as my mother made me feel so anxious and depressed before, I do not want to go back there.

My dreams are a different world where I actually smile and love myself,2,mifl1a,2,"Every night when I dream, I go someplace else. I never remember where or what happened but I wake up so happy and peaceful. At least until the pain starts again. My dreams are respite from the pain of reality."
Jolting awake in a panic when I’m about to fall asleep? Is this a symptom?,6,mifcho,16,"Sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense I haven’t gotten decent sleep in a few days. This time of year is hard for me.

So lately when I try to fall asleep it’s like my brain doesn’t turn off the way it should. I feel my breathing slow down/consciously stop thinking about things but my brain is still “awake” and eventually I get this huge surge of adrenaline where I feel like I’m dying or something and I rush back awake fully terrified and sometimes hallucinating. 

I’m so so tired but terrified of falling asleep now. I need to be awake in like three hours. Is this a symptom? Or is it some new bullshit?"
Musical brain orgasms?,122,mif7j8,61,"I found out tonight that having 'brain orgasms' to music is not what people mean when they say ""they like music"".

I have always had very physical reactions to certain music; opera, some blues, soulful singing, classical-that sort of thing. 

I feel the music like energy in a very visceral way and it feels like my brain is being massaged and its often...exceptionally pleasant. A brain orgasm. I have no other way to describe it. I become the music.

So now I've found out that this isnt ""normal"" and I've just realized that I DISSOCIATE, hard-core dissociation, in a really nice way (not like my pre-flashback, trauma dissociation) and that's why I get so much pleasure from my ""dance meditations"" which is what I call what I do most nights where I induce this purposely.

I know this isn't big or important or trauma but it feels like the more I learn about c-ptsd and my brain, the more I discover. I would love to know if anyone else can relate to this in any way. 

If this is a symptom then as far as symptoms go, this one is my favorite."

Handling Chronic and Constant Anxiety,3,miebyh,2,"I have been living with constant anxiety for a long time. I am a victim/survivor who has always had a high level of anxiety. Experiencing calmness isn't completely uncomfortable or unknown but still an infrequent occurence. Panic attacks sky rocket at random and usually last for an hour or more. Its debilitating and emotionally draining. It sucks to feel okay and than wham. Feeling dizzy, nauseous, sick, and crying so much because it feels so horrible. Like my body turns on me regardless of how good I am doing. 

I wonder if any other people in this sub have found unconventional methods to help manage or reduce their anxiety. The more conventional methods don't work for me since my normal state is high anxiety. Any advice, support, shares , or resources is great. Also just knowing I'm not alone with this is also helpful. 

Thank you"
The system failed me but that's not my fault,34,midq1k,4,"Didn't know how to flare this as a few fit

Growing up i did report my m*m, I was just told she loved me. No one ever did anything. And I just realized that's not my fault. To quote Picard from Star Trek Next Gen, ""its possible to commit no mistakes and still lose."" I did what I was supposed to, it was up to the adults around me to take me seriously. Their failure was not my fault. I was a kid, it was up to the adults around me to keep me safe. It was up to the system to step in to keep me safe and they didn't. Realizing it wasn't my fault has been a huge weight off my shoulders. I did report her. My family even said they knew. The system just told me they couldn't do anything and it wasn't my fault. Neither was my family's inaction. Those aren't my burdens to bear. 

If you've read this far, and can relate, you didn't deserve it either. I hope you realize that."
Would you use this service?,1,midlwe,4,"If there was a talk/text service where you could vent, ask for advice, or ideas on how to deal with your trauma, would you pay for that?

I realize therapy is an option but it is often expensive, and sometimes when I was in therapy I didn’t need a whole hour of someone just nodding their head and saying basically “that sucks” with no real action involved.

I keep wanting to start a business somewhat like this, but keep feeling like no one would be interested. 
What do you all think? Is posting on Reddit enough or would this idea be valuable to you?"
Red flags,1,midcqz,2,Do you ever regret not noticing red flags and/or ignoring them? I wish I disassociated from an intrusive friend of mine.He had the nerve to ask me what I talked about in therapy ! I should've been more cautious.
POTS,4,mid7iw,1,"Has anyone here ever been diagnosed with POTS (postural tachycardia syndrome)?  I just got diagnosed and some of the symptoms sound a lot like CPTSD related physical symptoms discussed in The Body Keeps The Score.  I'm wondering if POTS is more common in us, if maybe it's related to childhood trauma?  It is dysregulation of the nervous system which would kind of go hand in hand with the neurologic changes seen with CPTSD.  Just curious."
Does EMDR open the floodgates?,1,mid1kx,4,"My trauma is very repressed and hazy. 

Does EMDR recover repressed memories for those who repress like me? Did anyone find this to be true?

How can I help my bf understand?,7,micguf,3,"Hi everyone,

I'm 47, my bf is 56. We've been long distance almost 1.5 years.

Recently my ex (7+ yrs divorced) involved my older kids in a violent upset that resulted in a restraining order for me and them. But he has now contested the order and I have had to appear in front of a judge 3 times. The 4th and final time will be in June. He never shows up, just sends his lawyer.

It has been incredibly stressful for me. I'm not intimidated by the judge but it's the rehashing of everything I went through (those 18 yrs of marriage) to establish ""an escalating pattern of danger"". As you can imagine, there has been affidavits, accusals and denials on his part. This has left me triggered many times. I wear a PTSD bracelet since diagnosed 6 years ago.

The most overwhelming trigger is feeling unsafe. Brain fog, wanting to run, uncontrolled crying, sleep disturbance, etc. The good thing is, my turnaround time is much quicker now. For a few years there, it was calm seas, so as you know it feels defeating. But I have hope. well...That is, when I don't want to run so far away, nobody will ever find me except the animals in the woods where I survive and thrive alone. It's just abject fear.

How can I explain this to my bf? He is kind, wants to help over video (thx, covid) and I cannot explain it to him. I try and try and he understands it's stressful but literally cannot understand the physiological drain to me. He cannot understand how those moments strip my confidence and worth, he asks how I can doubt his love and when I say I don't he says, ""but you feel unlovable so...""

He's European and PTSD is not widely known outside of military terms. But he wants to listen and help. I don't want to wreck this relationship. It's taken me so long to trust someone again. It's still in process for me.

Has anyone else found a way to explain this clearly and simply to their partner? I really need advice."
DAE Need a Hug?,60,mic0ze,25,"TW unworthiness:
She/her 34

I feel unlovable and desperately lonely. For many reasons, too many to get into here (see Trauma)

The short story is: I need a goddamn hug. Seriously, I keep spinning in circles trying to find appropriate places to get hugs and it makes me super weird. And it gets me in trouble. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Am I crazy? Like I haven’t been touched by anyone in days, possibly weeks. It makes me super anxious and sad. Touch is such a healing form of communication. If anyone has solid advice about how to get a need like this met or how to resolve  the anxiety created I’m open to hearing it. Ideas and reassurance needed."
How do I exit a conversation I don’t want to be in and never wanted to have?,5,mic0jx,2,"My mom told me she had covid, again. I’ve already gone no contact, and I honestly felt pretty indifferent about her latest covid declaration, but I replied to her message anyway cuz I was pressured by family (and my own basic human decency) to at least feign moderate concern. All I did was ask about her diagnosis and how she was doing but she’s trying to use this to reinitiate contact and is now asking me personal questions about my life. Oh, and she doesn’t even have covid. Granted, it’s not her fault that the test she took came back positive and that probably freaked her out but she was literally just sick. The “covid test” that she took was apparently just that forehead scanner thing which tests for sickness/fever/temperature/etc - it’s not exclusively looking for covid, yet she tells me that she tested positive for covid before taking an actual covid test. 

This is a mirror of what happened last time; she was just sick and she decided to weaponize her illness and act like she definitely had covid right up until she received her negative results. She milked every second of it (she decided that her roommates should cook and deliver every meal to her bedroom, made them do groceries, made them run back and forth through the house doing other random shit, etc - this might not sound so bad except she expected me to do on a regular basis for her when I lived there and she was perfectly healthy). Honestly, I’ve never witnessed someone get sick so proudly and it’s weird. I’m fucking pissed and I’m stressed out and anxious for the first time in months. I don’t want to tell her about my life or tell her where I’m staying so that she can ambush me by showing up. She doesn’t get to reenter my life because she got sick. I was enjoying my life and now Im back to feeling the same, gross, perpetual anxiety that I thought I’d finally figured out."
I was suffocated with a pillow at 4 and 7 years old by someone 10 years older than me. Can that be the cause of my serious dissociation?,15,mibvvj,9,"I am turning 26 on Saturday. I have been suffering from chronic dissociation, psychogenic seizures and memory problems since I was very young. The school system and doctors thought there was a learning disability or health issue, but there's none. Like, I have had episodes of not recognizing my own home from the outside. Other times I just struggle to feel connected. There is a lot to go into. It has taken a long time to get to this high functioning level, but I know that I am missing out on my potential both intellectually and socially. Any thoughts would be much appreciated. It's hard to open up to anyone. Thanks."
I really hate having feelings,10,mibpcz,3,Because no one cares about them
Is CPTSD an excuse?,13,mibf5f,6,"Of course not, but I wonder what you would say to someone who thinks it is. I have recently been diagnosed after making some really, really bad choices, which I've now learned were a result of my trauma and the coping techniques I had developed as a kid. But now I'm worried that people, especially loved ones I've hurt, are going to dismiss my diagnosis as just another ""excuse"" for bad behavior."
Does anyone else deal with a mom who is hypersensitive?,2,mibe1r,1,"My mom is know for her manic moments, where she’ll go on tangents for hours and in general really hyper and volatile. She is known for being really mean, she’ll make blatant sexist/racist comments, she’ll purposefully nit pick chores we do, is passive aggressive with family and is always the victim. It’s dumb but today she really upset me with this. We were bantering and she mentioned her boyfriends daughter, who she really dislikes. Jokingly I asked her if it’s because she’s fat. My mom is constantly telling me how she wouldn’t hire fat people, how they’re gross and she can’t stand them. She then begins to cry. She tells me how it’s not because she’s fat you’re making it seem worse. It’s because she’s lazy I dislike lazy people, who tend to be heavier. I just went along with it because her mood went from estastic to depressed. She felt like I was pointing out how cruel she was. Later in the day off handily she mentions the mean comment I say earlier that hurt her feelings while talking to her boyfriend. I’m frustrated. No matter what I do, I can’t predict her. I’m always wrong and it’s wearing me out."
childish anger,49,miav99,5,"(I know this is my 3rd post in 2 days and I promise to chill after this. I am just having a Really Hard Time™️)

I am angry about the fact that I have to reparent myself. An extremely childish part of me wants to scream and yell that it’s not fair, that I want someone *else* to take care of me for once. I have been so emotionally alone for so long. Everything I’ve ever learned about emotional regulation has been so filled with shame and hatred - I had to learn everything the hard way and it has fucked me up beyond even my own comprehension. B/c of that, I have coped in ways that were damaging in the long run, but still it was always ME. The loneliness at your very core. I have no idea how I will ever be able to let go of that pain. It seeps into every part of my life.

At the same time I know that I naturally shut down at anyone who tries to help. Nobody out there, not really even my parents, will ever be able to give her what she needs. I catch myself often wishing it could be my therapist, but I know that she can’t do it either. And even if anyone could, I have learned from my earliest memories that being vulnerable is not safe. It will either lead to being violated or rejected.

Like I want to be cared for so badly, but I know it’s never going to be the way that I want it to be. And I know nobody else can do it for me. What a bitter realization."
"Dissociation, possible DID",6,miadoq,3,"I’ve been going to a trauma therapist for about 4 months.  I’m a male in my 40s and done therapy before but never focused on trauma.  Holy crap she is really helping me.  One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.  My life fell apart a few years ago and lost my business of 15 years and almost burned my marriage down.  I somehow survived long enough to stabilize and now I’m doing the work to process my trauma.  It’s scary but I’m still here. My therapist thinks I’m almost ready to start emdr.  I’m slowly starting to have little glimmers of hope."
Reminding myself to BREATHE,23,miadnj,10,"Lately I catch myself holding my breath. Like I don’t know how long I’ve been holding my breath, or when this starting again but I know I wasn’t doing it for a while and now it’s back.

I just lashed out at my SO and let my anxiety win,13,mi9eku,3,"Im new to this sub and have only rly just begun my CPTSD healing journey. I’ve been trying very hard lately to work on myself and my attitude towards my SO. Hes always been ridiculously supportive of me and always there for me. 

About 6 month ago my father passed away suddenly in a car accident and I basically lost my mind and all the trauma of my childhood plus watching my dad die in front of me sort of drove me insane over these last 6 months.

I developed and incredibly bad attitude towards my SO as he was always just trying to be there for me and make sure I’m okay, but every time he did i just got mad at him and told him to leave me alone. He didn’t understand but respected my wishes. Well after 6 months of that he is understandably upset and feels rejected and unloved. 

I have been doing my best to be more aware of my attitude and how I am being towards him but it’s so hard. I generally am still quite angry and want to be left alone, but i know deep down i don’t want him to go away, but i keep pushing him away. I have no romantic desire for anything or anyone anymore and i have to constantly reject him. 

Tonight i came home with the mindset of being just kind and hanging with him. I had come back from the gym and he was cooking dinner. He mentioned “why don’t you shower while I cook?”. To which i replied “well i just got home and want to chill for a sec since dinner will be done soon and I’ll shower after”. He insisted that i should just shower now and get it out of the way etc and i was just like no it’s fine i just want to chill and it’s no big deal I’ll shower after dinner. ...well he continued to insist and didn’t understand why i wouldn’t just do it now😰 i begun to feel attacked and freeze up which unintentionally gave me an attitude towards him and i spat back with a very fuck you attitude that I’m going to shower after dinner. And he immediately shut down said whatever i don’t care and ignored me while finishing cooking. 

Then i came to the table and tried talking and he wanted nothing to do with me. I pushed and he was just completely shutting me out. I began to panic and feel angry and i have absolutely no idea how to be angry and it bubbled up and i just exploded and screamed at him “ i fucking hate you! You’re an asshole you piece of shit” etc etc... i don’t mean any of that i jsut didn’t even know what was going on. I threw the dishes in the sink was going crazy and just ran to the bathroom locked the door and took my damn shower ...

I’ve tried to go to him and explain how i felt and I’ve said I’m sorry. But he has nothing to say to me. I think he finally has lost his patience with me and my messed up head. I feel awful. I just don’t think i can even be in relationships anymore. Nobody deserves to have to deal with my shitttt Uhg

cw abandonment related and self degradation(?),7,mi96eb,7,"i couldn't really find a way to title this properly so i'm sorry about that. but does anyone else go through this huge mood swing thing where this one person hasn't replied to you for a certain amount of time, so you go into this cycle of self hate and afraid said person hates you and is abandoning you (plus loads of depression). then they reply to you and you're suddenly in a really good mood? it's like i never even went through that small but intense rough patch (i don't know if that's how you would word it,, i'm really tired at the moment). i was just wondering cos i literally just went through that about 20 minutes ago. i guess it leads to a good feeling in the end, but it's exhausting to go through"
Feelings,2,mi90a3,2,"Does anyone else get caught between knowing that 'others have it worse'/""shouldn't feel sorry for yourself"" and not properly examining their trauma? 

On one hand, I'm very lucky for my life and where I am. But on the other hand, I've endured so many traumatic experiences (and unnecessary evil stepmother/sisters, Cinderella b.s. my self-esteem and value system doesn't even exist in this dimension anymore) I'll never feel like I'm doing anything other than \*""erasing days""\*. 

My greatest accomplishment is probably learning not to occupy my mind with things I cannot change and people I can't love."
Great article about age regression,34,mi8xr0,5,"I often revert to a more panicked, child-like state, thought this article about age regression was really reassuring. Wanted to share in case others are interested!

Shaking,9,mi859i,5,"Not sure this is quite the right tag, but I'm hoping someone can shed some light on an issue I've been having.

I started doing TRE every once in a while maybe a year and a half ago, and I pretty quickly got to a point where I could just ""breathe into it"" and shake spontaneously even without doing any exercises beforehand. I've noticed some positive effects, but I've also noticed that I'm pretty much just shaky as a person now. It's pretty distressing in certain interpersonal and social situations, and it affects my ability to do my physical labor job as efficiently as I used to. I feel like it's honestly causing more distress than it's alleviating, currently. 

Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution/comfort? Does anyone know if I can reasonably expect it to abate at some point? Will doing more TRE and similar exercises make it worse, or do I just need to ""get it out of my system""? 

I'm so conflicted, because I think it does help my body relax but I don't think I can deal with being permanently predisposed to shaking like a leaf anytime I get anxious or try to exercise. Any insight would really be appreciated."
DAE Have a hard time finding music that isnt upsetting to listen to?,31,mi83c8,20,"I’ve never found anyone else who relates, and even my therapist is a bit baffled by this problem I have. I enjoy music a lot— I even co-run a small record label.  But it is SO hard for me to find stuff to listen to that doesn’t upset me in some way or another. Anything sad will absolutely wreck me. Anything too happy feels “wrong”.  Things that are too high-energy are often anxiety-inducing.  Anything too sleepy makes me sad.  It’s truly INFURIATING and has caused real problems in my life; I’ll often want some music on in the background while I work (because silence also feels wrong) and I can‘t count how many times I’ve wasted literal hours trying to find something to put on that doesn‘t negatively impact my mood.  I have had mental breakdowns as a result of the frustration this causes. I like audiobooks and podcasts a lot, but they aren’t great for more focused work. 

I know this sounds crazy and is a fuckin weird problem to have.  I wonder if its CPTSD related b/c a lot of the music I find difficult is difficult bc it evokes memories of trauma.  Anyone else deal with anything like this?"
DAE have a hard time letting go of anger/resentment?,46,mi7tds,12,"I’ve been working on healing for a over year but have a lot of trouble with this. I can easily get wrapped up into thinking about how someone has really hurt me and I’ll imagine these fake conversations where I’m confronting them about it, but nothing ever gets resolved and the anger is still there. It can consume me for hours. It’s such a waste of energy but I can’t help it. I wish I could just move on and stop thinking about these people!"
thinking of little me as another person has made me gain a lot of empathy for what she had to go through :(,682,mi7qty,33,"TW; CSA, abuse, etc

for a long time, i never understand “inner child” stuff. i still am not sure if i do as i tend to think very logically, not imaginatively. i am trying though because so many of us talk about healing our inner child.

i was sexually abused at 9 and kept the same perspective as her until very recently. i was so ashamed and caught up in that narrative that little girl believed: she was different, something was wrong with her, she’s worthless. i’m 20 and logically i have always known it wasn’t my fault but i really held on to little me’s beliefs about what happened. now i’m looking back and it’s so sad. she was completely innocent... and a man decided to target her for his own sick gain. 

i used to love webkinz, club penguin, etc. i LOVED bratz and barbies too! me and my similar aged cousins would play and have fun, but that changed as soon as it happened. it’s sad that he ruined her childhood innocence and joy. my family also helped squash it but he definitely left the biggest mark.
my heart hurts for her so much.

"What are boundaries, how to set them and when to oblige?",9,mi7fud,6,"I've been a LTL here and really appreciate all the support in this dub!


An issue I've found is that lots of places always say to set boundaries, but if you've spent your whole life having your boundaries ignored, or feeling like your responsibility is to lower your boundaries it can be really hard to even start to establish them.


I don't even know where to begin - counsellors say to learn to say ""No"" and to ""make time for yourself"" but I don't even know who myself is outside of ""carer, achiever etc"" that I feel like I don't have my own identity.


All my friendships fall apart so I rely heavily on my dysfunctional family and it seems like a vicious cycle. I don't enjoy anything that people suggest to help, other than reading but I feel like I can't relax. Ever. It's exhausting and I just don't know where to start.


I've tried so many methods but none of them ever stick for long enough to make a difference. Everyone seems to have SOMETHING that they have to relax so I just feel like I'm all alone.

Anyone else? Any help?"
Is this also freeze response?,3,mi6sza,1,"My symptoms fit perfectly into the freeze response category. I learned very early in life that I need to shut down completely in order to survive. I'm 22 and I'm just now learning how to open up and relax a little bit.

Recently I came across this grounding exercise when you pause whatever you're doing and you notice exactly what you're doing in that moment, then you keep expanding your awareness and notice the position of your body in the room, how the chair/couch/floor feels and observe everything you can observe around you in the present moment. When you realize you're not in immediate danger (like you were taught to believe), you focus on how your body feels. This exercise helps me relax, open up and be present.

The thing is I struggle with derealization and agoraphobia, too, because I just don't know what my role into the society is/should be. It's like I can't comprehend my position into the world. It feels like I don't belong to the country and culture I come from, but I also can't connect with any other country or people in general. That's how I figured out that the problem is not with the people in my proximity, but I have a problem.

Since I was a child I fantasize a lot about what I could be, about my potential, and I do have dreams and desires. The problem is fantasizing has been a coping mechanism and growing up like this made me isolate myself. It's like I can set the goal, but can't follow the path from point A to point B! And honestly, I'm not even sure if I want to have the career I imagine I'd like to have. I don't know how to be practical, because I don't feel grounded in my culture, in the dynamics of the people in my proximity create.

I'm not sure how to explain this better. If you've reached this far, THANK YOU for reading!

TL; DR Is not being able to understand yourself in the circumstances that you find yourself into (being born/existing in the family/country/dynamics/society you were born/you exist into) just another characteristic of the freeze response? How do you deal with this?"
"Thoughts on ADHD, and seeking perspectives on its relation to CPTSD",14,mi75im,13,"I recently came upon a TED Talk called Failing at Normal: An ADHD Success Story

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI)

I found myself crying in recognition of the ways in which her story was eerily similar to my own. I spoke with my mother who confirmed that yes, I was diagnosed with ADHD in my early 20s, but it was left untreated due to her fears over the current of addiction that runs through my family and her reluctance to have me taking medication. Since then I have been looking into this disorder and find my symptoms to closely align with many typical ADHD presentations. I also have a host of other diagnosed conditions, as is often the case with both ADHD and CPTSD. I have taken ADHD medication on and off throughout the years after moving out, to mixed degrees of success. 

The problem is, I have also been diagnosed with, and am being treated for, CPTSD (well, PTSD is the diag b/c DSM, but my therapist understands). Her take is that we treat the trauma and ""see what's left after that"". As I have come to understand it,  leaving ADHD untreated results in a myriad of comorbidites and worsening of quality-of-life, which checks out for me. I'm left wondering if I should be in therapy for my ADHD alongside my CPTSD.

Some suggest that ADHD is directly caused by trauma. Others posit that they are different and or different origins (biological, hereditary), all of which also sound a lot like the mechanisms of CPTSD (lineage trauma, executive dysfunction, etc. ) Even Pete Walker names how before there was a diagnosis of ADHD available, he was treating patients for trauma who's symptoms were identical. All I know from my limited research is how collectively little we know for certain about all of this. 

My symptoms are ruining me. My days are full of suffering and my life is in pieces that seem to be too slippery to pick up and reassemble. One school of thought suggests I continue to treat my trauma and ""see what's left. Another suggests that I find ways to cope with my ADHD symptoms through various top-down modalities to improve my daily functioning. I see pros and cons to each, but I am unsure which direction might be best.

I am curious what sorts of experiences y'all have had in this realm? Does anyone have both diagnoses? Have you learned about functional differences? What is your understanding of the connection between them? Have you tried different treatments for either or both, and how did it go for you?

Thanks for taking the time to engage, looking forward to the discussion that may arise here."
Why can't I cry?,25,mi74ze,8,"I don't know if anyone else can relate but every time I start to feel that pressure behind my eyes that comes before tears start forming, my mind disconnects and my body immediately shuts it down. I start to feel some tingling in my body and then I go emotionally and physically numb. 

It feels like there's this solid mass or *thing* in my body, resting from the front of my chest through to my back between my shoulder blades. It is like a boulder. Solid. Impenetrable. Heavy. As long as it holds together I'm safe. 

Sometimes I notice little cracks forming like a spiderweb across its surface and I have the fear of knowing that if it breaks I may never be able to put myself back together again. The cracks are quickly worn smooth, erased from the surface like they were never there.

Another part of me, small and quiet, wants nothing more than to cry in wracking, breathless sobs. This part of me knows the tears will release the pain and anguish I constantly hold inside from decades of trauma that began with the day I was born. But I can't do it, even when the only person in the room with me is just myself. 

The boulder is too solid now, another organ in my body that's attached to my heart allowing each breath. I'm afraid that there's nothing in me left that can destroy it without destroying myself."
"I talked about my inner child (relatively) openly in therapy for the first time, and now I’m super embarrassed",48,mi6hjl,15,"It feels so stupid. I know it’s real and valid and yada yada. I didn’t go into as much detail as I hoped I would, but I think I’d be feeling worse if I did

She clearly understood and helped me work through it  which I’m super grateful for. The instinct though is to never want to show my face to her ever again (hello, fearful avoidant attachment)"
I was taught to be suspicious of people who cared about my well-being.,100,mi5vmg,12,"When I was a child, my mother warned me away from associating with certain family members. In particular, I have an aunt, a child psychologist, who seemed concerned about our homeschooled, insular upbringing. Now, I disagree with this aunt in some ways, and she had noticeable flaws of her own. However, she became one link in a chain of adults that my parents nursed a sense of paranoia around, and fostered this same unease in us as well.

As a young adolescent, our insurance provided access to one doctor, a woman who not only asked about our physical needs, but psychological and emotional needs as well. This doctor appeared particularly concerned about my sister, who rarely, if ever, smiled. My mother despised this, saying, ""She's trying to trick my daughters into saying they're unhappy.""

Questions about well-being seemed to be viewed as a ploy- a ploy to what end, I'm not entirely certain.  Looking back, these conversations seem strange- what parent wouldn't want to know that others are looking out for their children? Am I alone in having this experience, and am I correct in feeling like something here was wrong about this situation?"
How to be a better friend/person when you’re absorbed with your issues?,11,mi5r4t,8,"My friend vocalized to me that I have been really unresponsive when talking about herself and her issues, but more than responsive when we dive into mine. 

It feels like I’ve become the person that I never wanted to be: ungrateful and self-absorbed. I feel like I talk too much about myself and my problems. I used to be a rock to my friends and family, but that shifted since I started working through my issues a couple years back. And honestly, I think I prefer being the old me who could be there for everyone. 

Now I’m nowhere close to there. I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had this experience. And how to stop hating yourself tbh"

They’re both drug addicts and he’s an alcoholic as well. Up until a few days before we broke up (when I began seeing signs of being devalued), he was as loving as usual. But I also started noticing signs of him relapsing back to her. Long story short, we ended up in a huge dramatic mess and they got back together. He hasn’t hoovered me this time like before. Does that mean he probably hates me now?"
To what extend is it ok to share things online?,2,mi5kr4,4,"Something really uhm... Triggering happened, and I took this thing to calm down, but even then, I feel this urge to explain parts of my past. Resumed. Which is usually impossible for me to do? But this time I'm being able to write down.

That said, I have a question.

The other day a doctor came to visit me and she precisely recommended me to write, draw or sing in this type of situation. But she said I must not share with anyone because they are my past.

Yet the feeling I have is the opposite, I want to share it because I feel... I want help, even though I don't know what type of help can I even get. I want someone to read it, I want people to know, many things I'm sure have crime names and I don't know them. I want to know, and I want someone out there to know, and no it can't be the doctor because I can't dirt the image of the family here it would do seriously bad. But is this good at all?? (to share about my past online I mean, being vague enough that nobody knows who I'm talking about)

What do you guys actually feel about sharing personal experiences? I think I kind of asked something similar once and someone said it helped, but is it morally fine?"
DAE feels Like they haven't talked to anyone their whole life?,102,mi5jmt,19,"I have had conversations, listened to people and responded to them. but I feel like my whole life this one part of my being has been doing the talking. It's the part that everyone around me likes to talk to, tell things, and get responses from. But reflecting on each and every conversation I have had in my life I came to the realization that I haven't REALLY TALKED to anyone. Never expressed how I truly feel, I am not complaining but it fascinates me that how I've spent 22 years of my life not talking to anyone. As I'm writing this post it almost feels like I'm floating and all that pressure of having a controlled, mature, and pleasing response is not there anymore. I just jokingly said to my coworker that I feel like I have never actually talked to another human being in life and she got a bit uncomfortable, but for the first time I felt like I talked."
Am I a narcissist?,10,mi543m,4,"My parents both are, I'm sure. And I recognize some tendencies in myself of covert narcissism. I know that CPTSD can result in NPD, perpetuating a cycle, but I don't want to be one. Is the fact that I'm even questioning it evidence that I'm not truly a narcissist? Anybody have any insight?"
I just realised that literal sociopaths stalk this subreddit and act like a victim.,2,mi4tay,4,"I cant believe just HOW FAR do these people go? I mean seriously who the fk can spend their time doing stuff like this. Even my mom started acting all weird since i realised that she is a narcissist. She just desperatly continues to gain control over me.I swear these creatures disguised as a homo sapiens are the creepiest and weirdest shit ive ever seen. I find it really disturbing that there are people out there who are not murdering just because they will go to jail if they do it. I wish i was never abused and just lived an ignorant,  stupid and happy life."
I hate people,51,mi4p1g,5,"I hate any judgment ( being weird, crazy and/ or something else)

I hate misunderstanding. 

I hate going around and around with insurance and medical professionals trying to make appointments and figuring it out and not getting anywhere... If anything going backwards.

Hate looking at a person and it seems they're not real and or toxic. 

I hate it. I hate being in their world and being pushed out, looked down on when I'm different."

How do I survive living with an abusive parent?,4,mi45j0,2,"How do you deal with having an abusive parent, seeing your mom/sister or brother get abused and gaslighted or blackmailed? My abusive parent is always trying to control everyone and he does this in so many ways. 

How do you live if you cant move out at this point? My entire life keeps getting ruined, time wasted, anxiety, I cant do my job and my abusive parent only controls me, always asking me to take permission before leaving the house, never showed empathy, when I talk about the issues he gaslighted me and made me feel it is all in my head, I tried in so many ways to heal our relationship but nothing worked and now I just avoid him but sometimes I feel like a prisoner. I feel like I am constantly dealing with damage he caused to other members of the family and these things he never even acknowledged or apologised for. I have a theory that he is a narcissist but I am not a professional. If anybody tries to complain or reacts he twists it and makes himself the victim. He is always intimidating everybody by constantly yelling and screaming or blackmailing or threatening that he will become violent. He was violent in the past but of course he denies he ever was. We all suffered different forms of abuse. I want to move out perhaps travel but it feels like it will be another big fight and I don’t care but how do I deal with all of this until I can leave? 

I don’t want to become bad or mean, but I want to protect my self and not let all of this ruin my day to day life, specially the anxiety and time wasted soothing the victims or myself or helping or fighting conflicting feelings of love and resentment. How do I survive? 

Side note: Sometimes I thought of killing myself but not because I want to die but simply because ever since I was a child I had to suffer this enormous non ending drama and I don’t see a way out. I am 26 and I am still yelled at, abused, mistreated and he always manipulates everyone so that I am under his control. Sometimes I fear that even If I somehow can leave, I will trapped or manipulated to stay. This has ruined my life from self esteem issues to choosing abusive or immature partners to projecting love and rushing to relationships in order to be saved. This also holds me back a lot. I am always dealing with all of this and I am left with little or no energy to work on myself or study or work or take care of my health or meet people or enjoy life. Will my life be like this forever? Because if there is no way I can actually live a normal life I really wish I am dead.

Is this all my fault? My life is falling apart? My anxiety keeps coming back, self esteem keeps falling, time and energy wasted, my whole life feels like I am trying to survive all of this. I am always sick physically and mentally and I don’t know what to do.

I feel like I am always taking care of my mom and I am raising my younger sister and I am suffering on all levels and he wont even admit it. He makes me feel its all us and he is the victim and that makes me feel like I am crazy. I love him of course but whenever I try to forgive, accept and avoid conflict with him, something else happens that makes me feel sick again. I am always going in circles."
DAE HATE april fool’s day?,103,mi43ys,28,"I never participate. Like I already don’t trust anyone, pls don’t make it worse"
DAE feel guilty for not working due to anxiety/depression that originated from trauma,169,mi3v6e,39,"I left my last job a couple months ago due to a string of anxiety attacks and disputes with my boss because she didn’t care about hygiene (masks) and once made mustard gas (she liked mixing ammonia and bleach; she got mad that I refused to enter the area and convinced the younger workers not to either until it dissipated). I had a series of panic attacks while trying to work with processing my trauma with a therapist and medications. I couldn’t take it anymore after 3 months of working after I moved to my current house.

I haven’t worked since November, and the pandemic makes it more acceptable to stay home. My husband works at a job that provides housing and really good healthcare for us, and mathematically we don’t necessarily need me working to be fine. 

I still feel guilty though. I’ve been working on myself and have been doing coloring projects and large puzzles to keep my mind on the path to recovery. But I still feel like I’m not recovering fast enough. I hear about other people here who work, have a family, and are juggling their trauma on top of that. I know I am privileged and don’t feel I deserve such nice treatment from my husband. 

I’m scared of being considered disabled by this. Is this just anxiety, or am I truly not recovering fast enough?"
Yesterday I finally was able to recognize an emotional flashback,13,mi3njg,3,"Or was I? 
I started the day with a email asking for
me to do a task at work that I was supposed to do anyway and I felt gilt and shame at first but, then almost immediately I became more and more upset in a way that my chest feel tight, light headed, wanting to cry without being able to. Automatically I become quite and unable to say how I feel. As if I’m not really feeling I’m just faking it so I should just shape up and not bother anyone. 
So while morning goes I’m doing nothing but send shit email apologizing and setting recurring emails to myself to remind me of my duties.
On lunch time I am just trying to keep myself going without crumbling. Everything is just hazy and I keep thinking that I am just a fucking idiotic bitch for taking things personally..... except... ta da dah. I’m not I didn’t take it personally, feeling gilt or ashamed is ok but why was I feeling so bad even though I agreed with the message wish was nothing more than “Hi, I will need more help from you, here are the tasks we have to do”. 
I never logically, consciously took it personally but, my feelings let me suicidal! Completely inoperative for a day because after lunch I just stopped. 

Is this a emotional flashback?"
Getting past hypervigilance,8,mi3kka,6,"I struggle with being in what feels like constant flight/fear mode. My body is always tense and hurting, and I’m never breathing full breaths unless consciously trying to.

A major disruptor in my life is hypervigilance, specifically at night either just before falling asleep, or after being woken up from outside sounds. I take steps to avoid getting triggered in the first place, like blasting a compact fan in my room for white noise, but sometimes outside city sounds still get through and I wake up. I get immediately triggered into a terrifying fear state that I am not safe. I rationally know that most likely I’m okay and nothing bad is happening, but I cannot convince myself until I get out of bed to check the window/house/doors a few times, etc. But the larger issue is I’m stuck awake all night until dawn because my body is stuck in a hypervigilant state. My body is convinced someone is coming to hurt me.

Do you have any advice for how to get out of hypervigilance? Emotional flashback management steps don’t seem to work as well in these moments."
Does anyone have any strategies for dealing with PTSD-related psychosis?,3,mi2yro,2,"I've had troubles with auditory/visual hallucinations since I was in middle school - I learned in the last year that it probably happens because I have PTSD. Which makes sense to me, because the things I see and hear are deeply trauma related. The trouble is that hallucinating is exhausting and emotionally difficult, and it makes it hard to do anything. I've done some CBT for psychosis I found online that helped and I do take an antipsychotic medication, which helps a lot but isn't perfect. When I was younger they thought I had Schizoaffective Disorder, so I've tried plenty of medications and I know that most of them do something for me but none of them stop me from hallucinating altogether.

Work is the hardest part for me. I try not to work if I'm seeing stuff but I can't afford not to work while I'm hearing voices because it's so frequent. I've been fired from more than a few jobs for being visibly mentally ill, so I'm always anxious about it too. I know that after 14 years of dealing with this that I can generally manage to keep a straight face and act normal, but it's unbearably difficult sometimes to have the voices of people who hurt me saying degrading and threatening things in my ear, to hear the sounds of dying children, people being raped..., and at the same time talk and look like a normal person. But then I also call in sick way too much already and the truth is that if I never worked while I was hearing voices I wouldn't be able to pay my rent, or even hold down a job at all maybe.

I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't even know if there's anything more I can do. Has anyone else struggled with this? How do you manage?"
I feel guilty for the way I must have treated other young people growing up because of the abuse I was experiencing,232,mi2hzz,35,"TRIGGER WARNING ABUSE

I have 2 younger siblings and a twin brother. I started babysitting them at 11, and other kids at 13. I look back at the way I treated them and interacted with them, and I know it must have really affected them, they could hold trauma today because of the role I played in their lives. 

I yelled and screamed, I made them sit in a corner for hours when they would act out, I would tell them how horrible they were being, and even went as far as threatening to hurt them and actually hitting them when things were going way south. 

I know I was taught to handle things this way, as that's how me and my siblings were raised by our parents. I know I was just a child myself and had no business taking care of my siblings and other people's children. I remember my parents and other parents not really caring that I treated them this way. I guess they thought it was normal or okay too. 

I really regret it all. It was straight up abuse. I'm terrified and mortified at the memories they must have of me and the scars they may carry. I wish I could go back and change it all. I wish I had known better."

Guilt and advice for dealing with Guilt,3,mi2cqg,3,"Holy crap the amount of guilt I feel all the damn time.  Does anyone have any advice?

For instance, I've decided that today I am going to do nothing but play video games.  Because I feel like I deserve it because Im getting my first vaccine tomorrow and am scared. While I know this is progress in some ways, how the fuck do I let go of the guilt??

All I keep thinking is how I should be looking for jobs (yay unemployment), I should be calling unemployment, I should be making sure Im productive, I should be do a million things...

I'm also really anxious all the time now. 

One if my friends has been doing very, very badly (mentally) for weeks now, and now this friend's father was put in the hospital and was not even conscious today. And i can't be there to support them in person because it overwhelms them. So i just sit around worried all the time. 

I have no one to vent to currently. My therapist has been away for four weeks already and i will see her again at the end of next week (hopefully - they had surgery done and were gonna come back this week but had to cancel due to not feeling well enough). 

I'm feeling like I'm breaking. I can't handle anything right now. I'm really struggling to support my friend and I'm struggling with staying afloat myself. 

Waaah. Any kind words would be so appreciated. Thanks for reading."
"Thinking of finding a new therapist, am I acting out/wrong?",1,mi1ou2,4,"Before this therapist, I worked with another for 3 years and left because I stopped being religious, and she was a religious-based counselor, and so that wasn't working anymore.

I started with the psychoanalyst I have now immediately after leaving my first therapist and also while I was going through a horrible, horrible, really painful breakup. I told her I wanted to find a way to build up my self-worth so that I could avoid being in such a painful relationship scenario again, hopefully. It is with her that I was told I had CPTSD, and I recognize that I do. However, I'm currently upset and thinking I need to get out of therapy with her because I've realized she hasn't really given me tools to deal with it and I also don't feel that she helped me process my childhood in a way that makes me understand it or myself and how it's affecting me today. For example, here we are over 2 years later and I'm still in a weird on and off scenario with the ex who I was going through the breakup with. In our last few sessions I've brought up how frustrating for me that is. I feel I haven't changed at all. I'm still doing the things I've always done and I don't know why and I don't know how to change. She just keeps telling me it takes time and to have self compassion. Those things aren't wrong, but they also arent' helpful when I'm quickly declining. I've been crying almost every day for the past month until the point that I throw up, which is way worse than I've ever been before. Today when I was pushing her on why I am still unable to fully break things off with this guy and was asking her why she didn't teach me about attachment theory, why I had to find it on the internet then read books about it. That I know somehow this guy and the relationship between my parents is related but we rarely really deeply talked about it. She kept saying things like ""But now you see that I'll support you in whatever you want"", which by that she means she was supporting me in trying to get back together with this guys because it's what I wanted, but I feel that it was her job to see that it was an unhealthy want driven by patterns and experiences and feelings that I didn't know about at the time. I think it's scary that she would encourage and support me in trying to get back together with someone who she also says molests me just because that's what I felt I wanted. I feel she has done very little to teach me or talk with me about deserving better. She talked a lot with me about having compassion for him and the hard childhood he had too and it just made me over and over again want to forgive him and give more chances and believe he would change and made excuses for how he treated me because I felt bad for him. At one point she told me ""Yes, it's hard, but he's getting better and all you can do is be there for him"". I guess because I did want to be there for him, but I guess I'm just conflicted on her encouraging me to think someone who hurts me is changing and that I should be there for him when he hasn't changed at all. Of course, today she is like ""I thought we did talk about it relating to your parents? Am I supposed to remind you of how it's connected when you start telling me you want other things like you feel like you love him and want him?"" And I guess in my mind that yeah I think she should've reminded me. I don't think her saying it once was enough for me to understand it and especially when she turns right around and basically supports me in staying with him by spending sessions helping me to maintain my anxiety around the situation of the relationship, but never helping me see it's a relationship I shouldn't be in. And today too she was like ""Well I don't think you should be with him. I think he's getting worse. Do you want me to tell you what to think?"" And I don't want her to tell me what to think, but I do want her to help me make informed decisions by learning about myself. 

However, now I can't tell if this is all something I've misunderstood or created or somehow a wrong interpretation of mine. Maybe I should talk with her more to try to work it out between us. Or maybe I should start over with someone else? I feel like I'm dying. She said today she thinks the treatment is working, but if it is why am I emotionally/physically worse? Why am I still in contact with the same person I was trying to be more detached from? I can't tell what is my fault and what I'm not understanding and where the breakdown is happening. I don't want to lose a good therapist just because I push people away, but I also have been gaslit so much I can't tell when I am right or wrong for getting the idea to run."
How do you stop neglecting yourself? Especially with chronical illness,2,mi1j5y,2,"I have T2 diabetes, I got diagnosed at 20 and I had pre-diabetes since I was 11. It has become apparent now after 6 years of uncontrolled diabetes that I neglect to procure medication because I feel so much shame for being diabetic. I eat carbs knowing it’s killing me, and I don’t know how to stop. I can’t make myself care to keep myself alive for the long-run. I know I’ve already shortened my life span by at least a few years with this and I want to stop. This suicidality and shame belongs to my abuser who I inherited diabetes from. When I was diagnosed my family blamed me and he called me a whale. When he was diagnosed while I was still a child I cried because I felt I was to blame for him becoming diabetic. My birth giver was a diabetic since I was 4, and somehow I’m the one who doesn’t deserve treatment, even when I was living with them their diabetes always took precedence over mine. I’m so tired of being sick and knowing where this comes from and knowing it’s not curable but “treatable”. Even when I took meds it wasn’t enough, the only way I can keep my glucose normal is by forcing myself to fast for days or eat a very strict ketogenic diet and I always end up crashing and back in the same levels and weight. I don’t know how to fix this so if anyone has advice or deals with this same issue please comment. It’s not just diabetes it’s every physical health issue I have I am so resistant to see a doctor and actually go through the full course of treatment, but diabetes is what will probably kill me at this pace."
Does anyone else struggle to believe they can heal/grow?,6,mi1fd9,3,"Sometimes I feel so tired of trying and question if I’m capable of further meaningful growth or healing.  Part of this comes from the short term memory and focus problems caused by my cptsd, it can be so confusing sometimes.  During times of balance I feel hugely better, including in my ability to think, focus, and remember.  But I struggle to feel like I’m making progress when my suffering is as consistent as it is.  

Does anybody else experience this?  How have you gotten through it?  Do you have any advice or perspectives which can shift my view to a more truthful and helpful one.  Thank you"
CPTSD and Parenting,5,mi1c6y,5,"I feel like this is such a deep topic and this little rant isn’t going to even touch the surface of the issues related to trauma processing while trying to parent but here is my little hurdle of the day: 

I have a toddler. A beautiful, willful, wild child who is currently learning by testing boundaries. 

I also have a fraught relationship with feeing helpless, and the flip to that is feeling angry... not the most suitable emotion for parenting, it seems. 

A skill I’ve been given to deal with the anger/helplessness is to try and identify not what is angering me, but what is making me feel helpless; and to then take steps to regain some power. 

Logically, this is great, and can be applied to all things.. all things except irrational, developing toddlers. Screaming, hitting toddlers. There essentially walking triggers- no respect for personal space, volume up to 10 and they leave no space for your own self, it seems. Mine won’t stop pulling our elderly cat’s tail. Do I just need to let go of any notion of control? Clearly, it’s out of my hands. 😐"
"Just left a traumatizing job in mental health emergency services. Now I’m unemployed, 24 years old, just feeling hopeless",8,mi15sl,2,"I’m no contact with my mom (blamed me when we lost our house and lied about it, kicked me out a week after surgery because she didn’t want to be stuck inside during the summer, hasn’t helped me financially since I was 13, expected me to dump all my money to her when I graduated and started working full time (which I can’t manage because of my cptsd) acted like I didn’t exist when she started dating abusive guys throughout my childhood,I could go on and on and on) and my dad is an abusive alcohol who is losing his apartment despite making six figures and also doesn’t help me. 

I’ve been living on less than 10k a year since I was 19. I’m starting to lose hope. I feel so depressed. The last job I had I lasted 8 months, it was a mental health respite facility. A friend knew someone who used to work there who called me and basically told me the boss there is an abusive psychopath who “takes joy in the clients struggling.” She said it’s a very traumatizing workplace and has a horrible reputation in my area for being a nightmare to staff and clients. 

I was paid barely over minimum wage, exposed to covid multiple times without being told until days after, put in one-on-one situations with aggressive full grown men who were off their meds and was told condescendingly to “do my job” when I reached out to the supervisor. Clients were section 12ed over nothing and retraumatized so much. Most of my coworkers would accuse clients of being “manipulative” and lying when they were really suffering from severe ptsd. Almost every shift someone would say “I hope they take their meds early, go to sleep and leave us alone.” I was invalided by my boss and supervisor when I asked for support around my triggers and trauma. 

My last shift is this Saturday and I just feel hopeless. The pandemic is catching up with me, the amount of retraumatization I’ve experienced at this job is flooding me now that I’m leaving. 

My housemates have been in a weird love triangle thing and things feel tense here. I woke up to a passive aggressive group text from one of them asking us to be more on top of emptying the dishes because they “can’t wash a single dish without unloading it.” I had been doing it almost daily like the whole time we’ve lived here, I cut back recently because I felt annoyed that no one else does it and this housemate unloaded it like twice and is now getting all petty about it. It’s not even a dishwasher it’s a standard size dish rack it takes five minutes. They also do nothing else around the house at all while I do a lot. It just made my mood spiral and I’m still in bed at 2 pm upset about it. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever have enough money to live alone. 

I have about $7,000 in savings because of stimulus checks and saved up unemployment from last year. Otherwise I would have under $1,000 probably. My monthly expenses are around $1,000 until student loans kick in.... I am so fucking tired. So insanely tired and hopeless. I can’t even imagine myself holding down a job right now. I actually started and quit a full time job this week because I was way too stressed. Two of my housemates are in school full time and work, and one of them has a great high paying full time job (44k a year with free insurance, from an insanely rich family and still likes to act poor/complain about money and they’re not in any debt). They all have much more supportive families. I’m just barely hanging on my a thread. I’ve been calling crisis lines again. I’m just really in need of support. Does it ever get better? I just want to live alone and have money. 

I was already really anxious and afraid of the world before starting that job. Now I don’t know if I can even trust myself. I feel so adjusted to taking abuse from my family it’s like I need ten people reassuring me when it’s really happening. Like I’m a magnet for it. I’m so tired."
DAE feel guilty for doing things they enjoy?,43,mi08st,6,I feel intense guilt doing things I find enjoyable. I even feel this guilt when I try to learn a new hobby. My husband encourages me but I just can't shake the feeling that I am doing something wrong.
"[TW: mention of CSA, no details] Talking about doubt and uncertainty of experiencing CSA in therapy? Can someone who has been through this too give advice?",3,mi044y,4,"My feelings of shame and being a terrible person for even thinking about the possibility that one of my parents might have abused me are weighing me down and preventing me to talk about these feelings and doubts with my therapist. 

I told my therapist that I can't tell for sure I have **not** been sexually abused. He said that growing up in a healthy family doesn't leave children with questions whether or not their parents are safe and that my feelings of not being safe at home are valid whether or not the abuse happened. 

The parent in question did something to me that I remember clearly. It makes me wonder that if they did this to me with someone (other parent) watching and they got away with it... what else could they have done? There are more 'clues' that fuel the doubt but I don't have memories of anything else besides a few (minor?) incidents which I prefer not to go into detail about. 

I am scared of making things up that may not have happened at all.   
Has anyone else been in this place before? How did you handle it?"
Did I just score a victory for myself or make everything worse for someone else?,2,mhzuil,4,"Ok this is gonna be a long one, so sorry in advance but I could use some support today. 

When I came home today my mom was sitting in the kitchen, fully aware that I would be walking through the door to make dinner at this time of the day and perfectly positioned, crying and wimpering that she was so afraid of life and begging me for help. 

She has done that repedetly in the past whenever something changed or she had to go to a routine health check or whatever. So nothing new to me. 

For a little context she parentified me ever since I can remember, made me hate my dad because he is such a egoistic and cold person (he is not btw) and told me I was an unlovable, cold person whenever I wouldn't be able to solve the problems she had. 

And I never could. Admittably she is struggeling with her mental health herself, but she is not interested in getting better. I suggested going to therapy several times, gave her options to solve problems, told her my honest opinion, or sat down for hours to research something she needed while working and being in grad school because she was mentally not capable to do the work herself. I also suggested self help groups but, mind you, ""I don't want to listen to other people whining about their problems"". 

NOT TODAY!! I know that the problem she had is real this time, but I am emotionally exhausted and I know that I can't keep this up. So I told her what I was thinking once. Then I turned to start cooking and only responded with a ""hmmm"" for the rest of the conversation. She started crying more because I don't care about her and ended the conversation with asking me wether she upset me or not. Perfect timing for guilt tripping and making me feel like a jerk. 

I am a bit proud that I will now invest the energy in trying to comfort mysef and not her, but I also feel like the worst daughter in this world. I am shaking and feel like vomiting but I can not change her situation and I can't make her stop feeling like she does. I could comfort her but then I would intangle myself in that net again.

"DAE consider leaving your long term partner after having dreams at night that they are cheating on you? My dreams of my boyfriend cheating are frequent and ruin my sleep. I am insecure and fearful when awake, too, but the dreams push me over the edge.",7,mhzmcd,10,"I am 25f, with my boyfriend (28m) for several years.

I wake up from bad dreams by doing any of the following: making crying sounds, actually crying, whining, growling in rage, yelling out, asking things like ""why"" or ""why would you do this"" out loud, which wakes me up.

My relationship has been rocky because of my personal issues. He has been as supportive as he can be and he is faithful to me as far as I know. In the past I have snooped thru his stuff so I'm pretty sure. 

But I do always worry he is deceiving me, lying to me, cheating on me, or that his thoughts are probably so vile I should maintain my dignity and just leave him.

The dreams are so realistic, I feel like my life is ruined when I wake up. 

I love him but I want to be free in my mind. 

I want good sleep that isn't interrupted by visions of him going to pound town on a better woman."
"My boyfriends best friend messaged me to tell me I'm a burden to my boyfriend, I'm holding him back. I broke up with him.",31,mhz8qo,10,"The 17 part message basically said:

-He's running out of time to do what he wanted in life

-I'm stopping him from growing and holding him down

-If I loved him I would help him

-I'm dragging him down, would go to therapy if I cared about him (haven't been able to afford it since last year)

-I'm faking the panic attacks and manipulating him into staying with me

-Draining his potential future

I have CPTSD and am considered disabled because of it. I feel pretty pathetic about that but. Well last night his friend and 2 other friends came to talk about work because they work together, and my boyfriend has been struggling. I guess the conversation turned from that to it being my fault because I overhear

-she's selfish

-she's probably schizophrenic, one day she will kill your family at night

-she doesn't care about you or she would help (I destroyed my education and little mental health I had to support our family and him when he was too depressed)

-insults about self harm scars 

-all these deep, personal issues talked about among a group of people insulting me 

After this I started crying. Didn't know they could hear as I was hiding in the basement. He said I'm crying now to be extra and if my bf wants to get away he will put him in a hotel.

I broke up with my boyfriend. I think it's true, I am a burden. Sometimes it is true. I'm unhealthy. I feel so shocked. I just told him he can stay here as long as he needs to find somewhere else, that I would be alright so don't stress about me. I woke up this morning and remembered it all and I felt overhwhelmed. Kind of broke down. Afterward he said I being a burden to the family for crying. I hate that my disability makes me a burden. I hide in thr laundry room when I have the flash backs or attacks but they still hear me cry I guess. I don't even know how to continue. I hope I can learn to not be like this."
If i had not experienced childhood abuse i wudve probably killed myself by now,2,mhyhe6,1,If i had not experienced childhood abuse i wudve probably killed myself by now.Ive been passively suicidal since 14 that turned to a more active at 17.But i was able to repress these emotions bcuz i was used to havin my emotions invalidated so rejected my feelings by default as a result i was able to pretend like this suicidal craving was not there.Idk the cause for it maybe i have some mental issue but again my family doesnt wanna support me so there is not much i can do for now.Regardless thats y ive survived for so long nd honestly i wish i hadnt.Im 20 now.Ive lived 7 years like this on egg shells nd borrowed time.If i had a relatively healthy understandin of myself i wudve killed myself at 14 nd honestly that wudve been better.Ive tasted a lot of disgrace nd insults bcuz ppl just dont wanna understand my issue.Everywhere i go there is just condescension.I shudve just died back then.
Had a week off and I just fell apart,7,mhydj4,2,"Well that’s it I suppose. All my hopeful thoughts about how my internal dialogue is becoming more loving and curious vanished into the mist of fucking despair. The “you are always going to be alone” voice came back and it was hard not to believe it. 

I know that this is a natural part of progress, I just don’t trust my new therapist and didn’t have any social outlets available to talk to about how I woke up a different angry human than the one who went to bed. Recovery is hard."
Can anyone else neatly divide their life into phases of “fight” and phases of “flight” with little to no memory of anything else?,1,mhxy8w,1,"Once I learned about the idea that all coping strategies, good and bad, are simply “fight or flight” type responses to a perceived threat, I immediately realized that I have basically always been existing one way or the other.

For weeks, sometimes months at a time, I am *on my shit.* All responsibilities, self care and goal oriented pursuits are accomplished, and I am telling everyone around me about how everything is different now, and I’m so much better and happier. It’s never felt sustainable, though, it’s always such a hustle and grind that eventually I wonder how on earth anyone could go on like that on a regular basis. 

Fast forward another month, and I am the exact opposite. Any and all addictive/numbing behaviors become overwhelming and all-consuming. Even in the moment, it feels like running and hiding. Negative, cluttered thinking leads to a cluttered living space and I spiral socially, physically and emotionally. Eventually, I hit a “bottom” and elect to overhaul everything, which leads back to the other side. 

Only in rare occasions can I ever remember not existing one way or the other. Am I doomed to be perpetually amygdala-activated? Is there always going to be something to sprint towards or away from?"

Holding myself accountable,1,mhxi0v,1,"Howdy,
I have had a very, very long day. And it's the beginning of a very very long month. By the end of the month I have some big decisions to make and make sure these decisions are solid ones.

In January I had a transformative moment in my life where it changed me for the better, and part of that meant me needing to be accountable. Me needing to understand I cannot run away, deflect or get defensive with my problems. If I am having an issues I need to work them out, work through them, or talk about them. 

Yesterday me and my partner whom I love had some issues. He was worried I'm not holding myself accountable because I do dip sometimes and I made a big decision and I'm not sure if I worked out this decision making properly.

How do I make big decisions while keeping myself in mind, whilst also being accountable and not running away from my problems? I cannot tell if I'm finding stuff to use as a way to escape a situation when it can be worked out or if I'm inclined to actually use that as something fine to use."
I think I might have high functioning autism,4,mhx09f,9,"I was recently trying to do some research on my symptoms for cptsd and found an article about the intersection of autism and CPTSD. A lot of the symptoms of undiagnosed autism in females overlapped with my cptsd symptoms. 

The random noises I make when I feel uncomfortable, rocking back and forth in times of extreme stress, to hitting myself on the head or hitting my head off things, not liking to be touched at all, losing my ability to communicate when I feel stressed or angry (I go from a fully functioning adult to 5year old screaming tantrum really fast) I experience sensory overload where it feels like noises are much louder than they are. Involuntary muscle movements especially when I head sounds that are triggering. The list goes on, the symptoms are the same for both illnesses

Wondering if it’s possible that I may have undiagnosed autism that was overshadowed by my severe trauma history. I don’t even know where to start to find out if it’s possible that I’m 26 and may have autism that was never diagnosed. 

I’m concerned that if this is true, that I’m clearly not receiving the proper therapy that I need. Which might explain why the 30 different types of anti depressants that I’ve tried have never worked and why I’m not seeing much progress after 15 years of therapy. 

Is there a test you can take to find out if you have autism? Has anyone experienced this?"
I'll never completely get rid of all my PTSD...,3,mhwxz6,1,"So, I still deal with Adrenaline surges. I'm no longer triggered over my past. I call that the counseling aspect. It's gone. I can think about it without any adrenaline surges.

However, anytime I'm excited over anything, good or bad. I get an adrenaline surge. My voice raises a few notches, I can't sit still, I have to move and talk. I'll feel the butterflies and some anxiety.  I don't fear it though. I let it wash over me. I allow myself to pass through me. I don't get aboard the train. 

If it persists, (say due to some conflict or something I'm unable to do anything about), I goto my goto, which is video games. I play daily for a few hours at baseline so if anything it may need to wait til then. 

But it's all good. My body knows I'm not in the trauma. It knows this is a natural response to some life event. My mind doesn't spit out crazy thoughts. It is what it is and it will pass."
"After reading The Drama of the Gifted Child, Im very depressed because I feel my entire life was just the byproduct of my psychological defenses, while the ""true"" self is empty and lost.",833,mhwot1,99,"I mourned and mourned as the book advised. But Idk when it'll end.
I don't particularly want to live a ""better"" life than before or than now, I don't look forward to romantic relationships, I am numb.
I am numb because I feel forever stuck to this understanding and state of mind that there are things way beyond my (or my caretakers/parents' when they were shaping the world for me-- them being abusive and growing me into having terrible mentàl health even though they never ""intended"" it) control that can have very long, insidious, not so great impact."
It makes me sad that no act of vengeance will give my lost childhood back to me.,7,mhwft3,3,"I’ve been feeling a lot of anger this past week. At first it was at all Catholics. Then it was at my Catholic extended family members who didn’t realize anything was wrong at my house, who I was isolated from. I want to call them and angrily ask why they didn’t care. I want to make them feel bad. I want to tell them what I have been through, and that I felt abandoned by them, and that there’s nothing they can do about it now. I’m 23 and that ship has sailed. 

But I’ve realized that that won’t make me feel better. It won’t give anything back to me. It won’t turn back the time and make them reach out more. I still won’t have had any healthy adult relationships in my childhood. And that hurts so much. It’s just not fair."
Someone tell me this is going to be okay? Leaving toxic parent for the fourth time.,2,mhw3wp,4,"My mother is toxic. She and I had a ridiculously codependent relationship for most of my life. I ran away from home when I was 14 because I couldn't handle her shit anymore- literally. She was a disassociating mess with years of unresolved trauma that she refused to deal with which made it so that it was impossible to know who exactly you'd be dealing with at any time. This was extremely unnerving and also caused some pretty extreme behaviors that were unsuitable for a child to be around. 


When I was older, she had dealt with the craziness that her disassociation had created in her life, and she apologized and was accountable for this, so I came back home to go to university because cash was gonna be tight. Our relationship fell back in to being codependent until I realized what that meant when I got sober 3 years afterwards. I tried to get her to see it, but she couldn't, so as soon as school was done, I moved away. 


She crashed and burned. I crashed and burned as she crashed and burned because I couldn't handle her crashing and burning. (My issue- not hers, I am aware.) She got a therapist. I got a therapist. With rent so expensive, we moved back in together- this time in my place, and it worked well enough for a year or so... mostly because, like with school, I wasn't home much with work. It got even worse when she stopped working with her therapist while I got more and more healthy working with my therapist, staying sober, and making strides in all areas of my life. The healthier I got, the more I had to deal with the mean, petty, and manipulative parts of her. I had no clue who was going to be walking through the door any time she crossed a doorway. It also came out that, from the time I was born until I was 8, when we visited my grandparents, she had sat upstairs drinking tea with her MIL while I was sent downstairs with my grandfather who had molested all of his kids- and she damn well knew about this the hundreds of times I got sent down there. The best part was when I had to tell her I had been molested FOUR TIMES before she would remember I had told her... which, fine, disassociation sucks for that, but if you know that you disassociate, maybe don't get mad at the person reminding you that you've been told?? Fuck me, right? Sigh. 

All of this coupled with how I ended up developing CPTSD to the point of being debilitated after aaaaaanother trauma in adulthood, I had enough. I was at a point in my life where I had to take care of myself, and I couldn't keep caring for someone who would, amongst everything else, guilt trip me when I wouldn't give her the insane amount of undivided attention she wanted and then gaslight me when I called her on it. 


I left home until the end of my lease which was 8 months down the road. I continued to pay for my lease there because she refused to allow me to sublet it which I accumulated debt for because I had to pay rent at the place I was staying at. I didnt have it in me to fight. I was that desperate to GTFO of there. And she and I made strides in our relationship. She was doing therapy (supposedly) and going to 12 steps (supposedly) and doing everything right (supposedly) and she stopped asking me how to handle her job, bills, taxes, everything. She was respectful and considerate. She was back to being the mom I loved and respected. I was thrilled. And should have kept it that way.


In the months after I left, she ended up needing a finger amputated, and my guilt kicked in to high gear because it was somehow my fault for not being there to force her to go to a doctor... even though she's been a full time social worker in management for over a decade. Yep. She also found out she was going to need two surgeries with an 8 week healing period for each, so I figured (foolishly) that I should move her back in with me until the surgeries were done. We made a deal that we would keep working on  ourselves and stay accountable. Found a place that she and I both liked, and we tried again.


Seven months later, I'm now looking at moving again- the third time in a year and a half, and I am fucking PISSED. Like. I should've fucking known better. She's just as bad, if not worse, than when we last lived together. She's not seeing anyone regularly. She's postponing surgeries. And I feel like such a fucking idiot. There's NO way that I can just up and fucking run right now because I can't afford the two places, but I'm just so fucking done. 


So. Yeah. I can afford to double pay for a couple months, so I'm only stuck here for another 3, but I honestly have no idea how to get through this. I am SO angry that I've spent my 12 adult years on this fuck of a person... for what? I'm shaking any time she's home- just waiting for the next panic attack she triggers... which she does on purpose...  or the next careless thing she does like leaving dark chocolate on the stairs for some goddamn reason that sent my dog straight to the vet with a $400 bill to follow and it's bullshit. ""I just forgot you have a dog."" Why would you leave chocolate on the stairs anyway?!? Sometimes wonder if she doesn't do shit like this on purpose... Honestly? She probably does. That shit happens so often. Then she forgets when she flips or she says she forgets. It's ridiculous. But. Whatever, I guess. 

I'm looking forward to having my own little place even if its a shit hole. Just gotta get through 3 months of being unsure of where I'm going to be living. Fuck around. Guess I needed practice with distress tolerance and not avoiding shit anyway....... fuck. "
A thing choosing bad relationships in adulthood taught me...,76,mhw0k0,25,"...is that I was my own abuser.


When people around us say things similar to our self-talk, we believe them, even when it is not true.  We are already used to how they treat us because we are programmed to treat ourselves the same, and to believe we deserve it.  I think this is why I stayed too long in bad relationships.  I now think that in a weird way, I needed them to teach me how mean I was to myself.  I didn't need how those relationships interrupted/ruined the life I was trying to build, but I also think I would have sabotaged myself in some other way without them.

 
You deserve the benefit of the doubt, kindness, and understanding from yourself and others.  Believe it, because it's true.   💕"
DAE just feel angry at everyone sometimes?,120,mhvkd8,39,"Sometimes I look at my friends and all I see are privileged spoiled girls who haven’t faced an ounce of true hardship in their lives. For many of them, the worst they’ve been through is drama with friends, some micro aggressions, or the occasional divorced parents. For me, the worst I’ve been through is growing up with abuse and being raped.

They all got to have these luxuries that I never got to have. They all get to whine about petty stuff, while I have CPTSD and panic attacks. It can be very irritating. My friend literally cried once because she wasn’t voted captain of her basketball team. Some of them are just so sensitive. It makes me half annoyed, but also half concerned. God knows what would happen if they ever faced real abuse one day.

I realize it’s not their fault that they’re privileged. Hell, if I grew up in a loving household, constantly being showered in hugs and kisses, I’d probably be crazy sensitive too."
"Has anyone had a huge swing in their interests or change in their identity? I'm wondering what's disassociation, and what's me, or what could be me.",2,mhvc29,6,"I spend a lot of my time with hobbies that keep me indoors, gaming, reading, spending time here in reddit and these kind of things. I know to some degree I do it to disassociate, and it makes it hard to know if it's what I truly enjoy, or what my identity really is. I know a lot of it was there before my CSA, most of it is just more extreme.

I'm just here wanting to hear if anyone has had the experience of completely changing their identity in this way, starting to hike a lot, or so dance, do martial arts or sport, become a painter or really just any change that has felt very much a 180 degree turn in personality or identity. And what this meant, if it was something that was positive, or permanent or if it was some kind of grass is greener ideal? I'm debating turning a new leaf and just trying on a new identity, I'm afraid of going through life having not seen if I'm someone else. But I'm also afraid of spending time away from the things I enjoy."
Has anyone’s religious faith helped them cope?,7,mhuqd3,11,"I’ve considered myself Agnostic for as long as I can remember, but I realised yesterday/today that I do believe in Catholicism it’s just that my mum has forced her own version of it onto me for as long as I can remember- which put me off from fully trusting or opening myself up to God. Going to mass, having sacraments, praying- everything was deemed to be ‘stressful’ or ‘a chore’, and there was no purpose/meaning behind it other than ‘you have to do it because you’re a part of this family/I said so’. 

It kind of pisses me off because she says that she prays frequently and she talks about herself as being religious- yet is the main cause of my mental health problems and trauma, and still overall is kind of selfish in her actions and words (she’s a narcissist). I think it’s really sad that I’ve had such a bad role model for a faith that I do believe in, and I went to reconciliation today to say sorry for not being able to forgive her (and dad) for how greatly they’ve affected me. I love them, but I don’t think I can forgive them because they’re still the same and I feel so shit even though all the bad things that happened were ages ago.

So yeah, I guess I was just wondering if anyone’s involvement/participation in a religion has helped them manage their symptoms/feelings/thoughts? And/or helped them form/realise their identity? I feel like if done right (and if it goes well) it could bring a very needed sense of comfort and guidance. I mean God is the ultimate parental figure, right?"
Stress sensitivity & CPTSD: burning out easily.,35,mhum14,7,"Hi all,

A question here, wondering if anyone else can relate. Ever since my trauma happened, i have been very sensitive to stress. I tend to get overwhelmed way easier than i used to, i need more time to recover from minor stresses and i can’t deal with stress very well anymore. 

I have been unable to hold a job, maintain a social life and do the things i like to do (hobbies) in the past few years. It’s either having a job and nothing outside of it because i can’t cope or it’s being unemployed & having a small social circle and being able to enjoy my life/hobbies. 

I don’t want to be unemployed and feel like a loser because of it. I feel like people look down on me because i can’t hold a job like a ‘normal’ adult. This creates a spiral where i keep pushing myself over and over again which always ends in me burning out even worse and my mental health going downhill again. 

I’m not sure how to continue my life, get a job or not.. Maybe work on trauma and mental health first, learn how to cope with stress before i get back into working/socializing? Everything seems to tire me out quickly and i spend days recovering from social events or a work day. 

Can anyone here relate to this? How do you cope?"

"Looking for help, understanding and feeling vulnerable and lost af",3,mhtogm,3,"Hey guys,

In advance, sorry if this is long. I'm just looking for some help, or some people to talk to this about because I really don't feel like I have anyone around that I can trust or who will understand me; therapists included, and I just want to understand a bit more

I only recently discovered CPTSD after my therapist recommended that I should do the Safe Sound Protocol and after looking into it, it lead me here. I have a lot of doubts, and also want to understand if this is something that I might be affected by. I also am not sure if I have some sought of trauma that warrants this... Or even if how I feel is valid. I have no idea, and to be honest I'm just really confused and looking for help.

After reading the symptoms, I can relate to a lot of the such as lack of emotional regulation such as anger (explosive, easily triggered) relationship difficulties, trust issues, I always jump when there is a loud noise, anxious and tetchy and a lot of sadness inside. I was once diagnosed with tendencies towards BPD but I really feel like that's not it.   
I can say that I don't have many or any fond memories of my childhood.

And finally, I just feel like it will never go away, I just want to feel calm, safe, happy... and I guess like a belong or feel loved."
I wish my parents had split up,42,mhtl6b,11,"We weren't even teenagers yet, we were children.

They involved us in their fights, we saw my dad hit my mom and destroy her most sacred belongings, we saw our parents cry and felt confused and helpless, they talked badly about each other to us (with or without their spouse) and tried to emotionally manipulate us throughout our entire childhoods (and still do), they made us pick sides and used us as weapons, they insulted and mocked us if we as much as resembled their spouse, they made us fall asleep scared and anxious hearing them fight all night long through the walls, shouting and screaming and hurling insults, they asked each one of us who we wanted to live with, they told us ""your mom/dad and I are getting a divorce"" for the 1000th time as if it was a threat to us, as if it was supposed to make us sad, as if we cared about their ""marriage"" ending.

The reason according to them as to why they never split up, is that they didn't want to ""do that"" to us, they didn't want their children living with divorced parents.  I honestly wish they would have just split up, both back then and also when looking back now.

I don't think it's easy to have divorced parents, of course. But my parents ended up doing way more damage to me and my siblings by staying together, than they probably would have if they just split up. We grew up in a hateful and loveless household full of fights, shouting, screaming, name-calling, side-picking, blaming, threats, mental illness, emotional and physical abuse and neglect, and overall misery.

Their marriage was not a real marriage and we were not a real family.

There was nothing to save in the first place, then what was the point?"
"What’s causing it, schizoid or PTSD?",3,mhtfu6,8,"My psychiatrist told me I’m borderline schizoid (3 out of 7 traits. You need 4 for it to count as a disorder) and that I have complex post traumatic stress without the disorder part.

The problem is I can’t tell whether the worst of my symptoms is caused by CPTSD or Schizoid disorder. Or both.

I have anhedonia + depression. The lack of feelgood chemicals makes me feel like I’m losing my mind, so then I have lie under my duvet for 1-2 hours to “prevent insanity” + regulate my freeze response.

I also have intense avolition, which makes me not want to do anything, and want to ‘hibernate.' A vicious cycle.

—

Do I need to wait for my antidepressant + EMDR to start working to treat the numbed emotions/anhedonia? Or do I need to ask for an anti-psychotic like Abilify to treat the Schizoid symptoms? 

I asked the same question to my psychiatrist and he said ""we need to discuss options.""

I can’t go on like this much longer, but I’d rather ask people with knowledge and experience then potentially wait weeks to discuss things with my psych. 

Please advise."

Making up a diy grounding kit,6,mht5fg,7,"Hi everyone

I’m off to see my parents this weekend for Easter. I have a lot of feelings. So I was going to try and prepare a little kit for me to use - something travel size really.

Does anyone have anything else to add?

How do you think about and perceive being present and conscious without getting freaked out about the concept of even existing and having a mind?,8,mhsk12,3,DAE experience this? It's really hard to explain. Whenever I try to ground myself and stay in the present and actually experience it I always end up freaking out because I become aware that I have a conscious and a brain at all  and then everything just feels very scary and unreal. Is this is a C-PTSD and dissociation thing or is there something wrong with my brain?
Struggling with the lack of intimacy in my life,8,mhsiox,4,"Hello!

Set a boundary expecting rejection and it was met with acceptance and affirmation.,154,mhsdis,17,"I've been seeing this guy for a few weeks now. I wasn't looking for anything emotionally serious on our first date, just sex, but afterwards we actually hit it off and have been texting everyday (which is a huge deal for me, I hate texting most people). Due to some past sexual trauma (some of it VERY recent) I sometimes have difficulty with sex. On our last date, we had planned for him to stay over at my house, but I had been having a very triggering day in regards to a recent sexual assault. I told him that he was welcome to stay, but I didn't want to even fool around, maybe light kissing and cuddling. Not only did he completely respect it, when we were cuddling in bed and I was feeling on high alert, afraid that he might try something, I spoke up and said I was having a hard time relaxing. He gave me space, but still held me and asked me what I needed. He gave me several options on how we could proceed: sleeping in the bed, but no cuddling, him sleep on the couch, or him leaving entirely. He didn't make me feel guilty for it and was reassuring me the whole time that he was just happy to be hanging out with me. I asked him to stay in the bed, but was still fearful of what might happen once I fell asleep. I fell asleep and woke up in the night and had forgotten he was there, which just doesn't happen. Usually I am hyperaware of a person in my bed. I rolled over and saw he was sleeping on the edge of the bed, giving me as much space as possible. He wasn't trying to grope me in the night, he wasn't grinding into my back to try and start something sexual, he was simply respecting my space. 

Our next date is at his place and again, we had planned for me to stay over. I thought that maybe I had given enough time to reset and maybe find my sex drive again, but it just doesn't seem to be happening. I was feeling pressure from myself to go and have sex at his place anyways, feeling guilty for not taking care of ""his needs."" It was a big topic of discussion at therapy this week. I have a hard time being honest and expressing my needs, but my therapist encouraged me to do it. I messaged him, fully expecting this to be the last straw and for him to want to just cut ties with me for being so fussy. Again, he was very supportive and said some very nice things that I won't get into, but I just feel validated and seen. I hope that he can walk the walk because he can definitely talk the talk. 

Speaking up and not just fawning is really hard for me and sending that text was terrifying. I was expecting the worst and I know that I would have been okay if it had come, but it's nice to stand up for myself and have it be celebrated."
Intrusive conversations,10,mhs6oa,6,"Does anyone else have a really hard time focusing because you’re constantly having conversations in your head trying to explain your trauma and why you are the way you are? 

Feeling that it’s less of a CPTSD specific symptom (could probably fall under intrusive thoughts though), but an indication I need to talk more about my experiences. 

Much love to everyone here!"
Have you ever gotten closure from your abusive parents?,1,mhs4c3,2,"I’m 20, so still quite young. In about 4 months I will have gone completely non contact with my mom and non bio dad for 12 months. 

Last august I found out my parents were emotionally and physically abusing my brothers , I left home when I was 18 and I have CPTSD due to their emotional and physical abuse, as well as a lot of accounts of sexual abuse (some indirectly from them) throughout the ages of 4-18. When I left their home, I was on my own, struggling and I thought they had “gotten better” because they were nice to me on the phone or over text, but they were putting on a facade they usually do for guests and we didn’t talk much after I moved out. 

So, I had to threaten to call CPS on them, it was terrifying and I had to bark louder than my fear, appear brave and confident when behind my phone I was suicidal and breaking down. My partner was there for me and I will never be able to thank them enough, as well as a few on this sub who shared their kind words with me at the time. I’m still in contact with my brothers, and although my parents will always be who they are to some degree, they’re trying. They no longer hit them or have anger outbursts as far as I’m aware through my siblings. 

My family is complex, so to give some brief context before I continue. My brothers are younger than me. I’ve been playing parent since I was 6. I lived in one place until I was 8 with my mom and bio father, who were going through a messy divorce. My mom met someone knew and gaslit me, groomed me and manipulated me into hating my bio father. Not dislike, not that he wasn’t a good person, she groomed me into hating him because she did. I have repressed memories from this time. She met someone new and I moved across the country, and she cut contact with my bio father. He tried to find me and contact me my entire life but I thought he was an awful person. I decided to open contact last October, and found out my mother had lied about ENDLESS things, including me getting diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 and never telling me my whole life. My father was a kind, loving man when we talked. I’m trans and he accepted me for his son. Unfortunately a month and a half later he died, I was overwhelmed and not replying to his texts and he died proud of me and wondering why I wouldn’t talk to him. I often wonder if it’s the stress that killed him. 

I didn’t tell my brothers the entire time I was in contact , as they’re young and the youngest doesn’t remember my dad at all. But the older one found out a couple months after he died, he called me and cried. I regret not telling him and him not being able to talk to my dad, but at the same time I don’t feel like it was my place. 

Anyways, after all this happened I found out my brother had told my mom + non bio dad about him and his passing, and they are both narcissistic but surprisingly supportive. Especially my dad. Sometimes I wonder if my mother brings out an awful side in him, because he can be such a kind man sometimes. 

My brother understands why I can’t talk to them, but I don’t think he fully will until he’s older (he’s 16). I have so much baggage, trauma , memories repressed or otherwise that I carry and I am working through in therapy, it is so rooted deeply inside of me and effects me every single day in a crippling way. I can’t talk to people, I have nightmares, extreme anxiety, disassociation etc. 

I guess , where I want to end this is have any of you gone back to your parents, after NC to ask them why they did what they did? Ask them if they understand the effect they had on you? Ask them to apologise, or just to get some closure on what happened? Have any of you gotten closure? For me, especially when it’s complex I’m afraid I will never get what I want because it’s not one event- it’s my whole life. I just want to know, I need to know.  Sometimes I wish I had any kind of parent at all, I have my biological grandparents I’m in contact with but that’s about it. I struggle to reach out so much. 

And how do you contact them, what did you say, how did it go?

I slipped up and told my parents about my upcoming adventure,5,mhs3on,2,"I was going to keep it a secret but I had just finally paid off all my debt and was excited about budgeting to take a dream trip I've longed to go on for a decade. I wanted to go on a cross country road trip to see a part of my country that I'd like to live. I do better in dry heat, and I kept not having money or waiting for things like surgeries that never happened, never visiting, much less moving. Using it as an excuse not to look for long-term love, bc I want to find a partner(s) when I settle down. I was invited on this trip, at least partially paid for by others I trust, who are moving and want me to go on this adventure with them. I trust them. My parents screamed at me for half an hour when  I told them. They don't want me to go because I live on disability and only people who work for a living should go on trips. That my mom accompanied me to a city to look at grad school and I decided not to go (she left me in a park at night after picking a fight, and I had to call my bf to use his iphone to tell me how to get back to the hotel. I was a young, disabled woman at night in a strange city in a park. THAT'S what I remembered about THAT trip. That my mother was so mad at me she left me to be preyed upon.)  My parents want me to move to this part of the country sight unseen, only after accepting a professional job that's ""good enough."" They give me money (which is why I was proud to tell them I paid off my debt) so they think they can tell me how to spend it. but this money is from a car accident settlement. these people who invited me asked me where I wanted to go and I started daydreaming and they extended their trip to accomodate me and im spiraling with guilt and shame. They don't want me to pay that much. They just want me to have fun. I haven't decided how much I will pay them..max $1000 but its not enough to justify. I want to finally start painting and give them paintiings and gemstones for the trip, bc they like those. I feel myself regressing into a little girl and cannot speak and I lost  my appetite again. I was never going to tell my parents about the trip, and I was right. All the joy is gone. 

And before people ask, I know these people and I trust them and I will pay what I can. We are part of a spiritual community and my bf is part of their ""family."""

I'm moving away from my hometown in two weeks and I'm freaking out,1,mhqwbz,2,"TW: dissociation, mention of menstruation

I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life, and I've moved around here a lot but never truly away. I grew up here with my narcissistic dad (the source of most of my trauma). My grandparents (his mom and dad) are also in town, as well as my mom, stepdad, and siblings.

This last year was really rough, but my husband and I got an opportunity to join some of his family in a better (for us) area 400 miles away, and we move in two weeks. Normally I handle change pretty badly, and I thought that this time I was doing okay until a phone call with my mom yesterday. I mentioned that I hadn't really been feeling like a person recently, and I was frustrated that my cycle is two weeks late for no apparent reason. Talking with my mom made me realize that I had been hardcore suppressing my anxiety over this move, but now that I've realized it, that awful tension in my gut/lower throat won't go away. I know it will get worse the closer the move gets unless I find a way to manage this, but I simply don't know how.

The worst part is that this move is going to be really, really good for us. Our town is small enough that I almost always see somebody I know when we go out, and there are memories everywhere. Living here is like being perpetually surrounded by my shitty past. Our new home is much bigger with far more opportunities, it's much closer to our political alignment, the weather is beautiful, and it will be a desperately needed fresh start. Still, change is petrifying for me, and while I've never been able to figure out exactly why, I'm positive it has something to do with my trauma. I just wish I could get it under control."

But I feel fine now. Or maybe I’m confusing it with numbness. I’ve been feeling bad for a week or two after realizing it’s probably cPTSD, but now not anymore. It’s probably because I’ve been resorting to my coping mechanisms (bulimia/maladaptive daydreaming), but still. Man I don’t know what to make of this. I’m just scared of change I think."

I don’t know how to get past it if I can’t ever remember it which is really scary. I don’t even know why I react sometimes but the most random event will send me into a full on emotional flashback and it always leaves me so confused. I don’t even know why I feel the way I do sometimes and I know it’s wrong sometimes but I just can’t get myself out of that mindset. I’m so tired of feeling crazy. Right before quarantine I was doing so good (therapy, substance free, working out, open about my emotions) and then as soon as I went home for that 7 months everything regressed. I didn’t even know how bad my life was until quarantine when my partner sat me down and told me all the stuff they had been noticing. I feel so bad for my partner having to deal with me because I know they see the most of my symptoms.

Thanks everyone for your answers. It’s nice to relate to people. It certainly helps me feel more valid and less alone in this world"
"A ramble about my experince, context warning for CSA.",5,mhogd2,5,"Just another warning to be safe, don’t read this if you are effected by CSA. It gets graphic. Rape is talked about in detail.





When I was a child I was molested and raped by a “family” member, Repeatedly. I lived in an awful combination of fear and depression, and in an absolute blur.

My mind repressed the memories of the rapes even moments ever they had happened. I remember being in my room and feeling my anus gaping wide enough for me to draw air into my rectum, but at the time I had no idea how i was able to do it. 

My first consensual sexual experince with a male was in highschool, a guy who I will call J1. We started by hanging in the woods, and just touching each other. After a little while we got down to buisness and I performed oral sex on him. At this point I had not recovered my memories but I still felt a strong feeling of “I’ve done this before”, and this at a time in my life when I could not identify when I was depressed or anxious.

 He wanted to preform anal sex on me, and I consented to it. When he penetrated me everything in my mind went pitch black, the outside world didn’t exist anymore. I begged him “stop stop!” And he did without hesitation. This was to me my first serious set of flashbacks. When I was performing oral sex on J1 it reminded me of my childhood home, my mind was drawn back home the entire time.



We broke up later over unrelated conflicts.


My next partner was a sweet boy who I’ll call birch.

He was my “first” in terms of having sex to completion (from my understanding at the time).

It was pretty awful, frankly. My mind snapped between the real world and that same pitch black, and I wanted to stop but couldn’t bring myself to tell him. So I allowed him to continue. 

Later on we were in his room, Mabye a month after, and I was performing oral sex on him (as he requested). He finished in my mouth and instructed me to swallow it, so I did. The taste was familiar, it didn’t feel new at all.

Another time I allowed him to finish on my face, and this again felt like old news. 



It wasn’t untill spring of 2020 when I got my memories back, and i wasn’t ready. My flashbacks would last hours on end, and I was a wreck. I tried to convince myself that it was a babysitter who had raped me, my minds way of protecting me as I was still living at home with my abusers, including my rapist. Had I known who it was I would have murdered him, and I still feel the urge to do it. I won’t kill him because I know it won’t do me any good.


So that’s the story of how little Shenya had her life ruined, little autistic trans girl going from happy and kind to bitter and depressed. I would sooner count the grains of sand by the river than count the times I wanted to commit suicide.

He ruined my life so that he could get off, and I’m healing in spite of that monster. I’m way better now, and I’m hopeful."
file under: I hate it here,7,mhnsvc,4,"I hate it in my body. I hate it in my head. I hate that the more aware I am of my trauma and triggers, the harder and heavier it all feels. I don’t know. It’s just that when I was just high functioning on survival mode it was like yeah every day was miserable but weirdly enough it was like this idea that someday it wouldn’t always be so but now that I’m fully aware of how deep CPTSD runs, and aware of the amount of energy and work it takes my brain and body to just be present to go outside to pick up the mail or get groceries without triggering all these parts. It’s bizarre but it’s honestly like I don’t know how I managed to do those same basic tasks 5-10 years ago while I was still living with abusers and in a toxic environment. It’s like I don’t trust myself or life to move myself to get out of bed without it feeling unsafe. Then I can’t take the steps to brush my teeth without that feeling unsafe. And I know it’s irrational. And that’s the thing. That I know where it stems from. I’m aware of it, but I guess this is where I feel like doom. This is my sentence. A lifelong sentence of hoper vigilance and inner critic mouthing off in my head, my body trapping itself in past traumas over analyzing every action and detail and word of mine and others to avoid more gaslighting. And there’s no book or science that tells me it’s ever going to be easy. And I’m resentful that I was denied a sense of safety since and as a child that now in my bloody mid 30s I’m struggling every single day to parent myself to learn how to self soothe and feel safe to feel and be safe and to just breathe. It’s not fair. And it just is. The world keeps spinning. The sun will rise again tomorrow. The trauma remains. I remain, me."
DAE regress back to the worst version of themselves after seeing their abusive parents?,36,mhnpsm,4,"TW: mentions of alcoholism, abuse, eating disorder

My parents are quite older, although I am young (23f.) I am in a loving relationship with my partner and I never thought it was possible for someone to show me so much genuine care and kindness without expecting anything in return. 

Anyway, my parents live a few hours away. My dad's going through chemo, both alcoholics with untreated mental illness. Lots of yelling, manipulation, don't respect me, gas lighting, just generally treating each other so disrespectfully it makes me feel sick, you know how it is. They get soo sad not seeing me so I feel guilty and end up going to visit for a weekend here or there... 

Before I moved in with my bf a few years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of the intense swings caused by my parents- fierce anger, guilt, depression, worthlessness, eating disorder, constantly sleeping, failing classes, all the bad things. Ever since I moved in with my partner it's like I'm actually sane and emotionally stable. I feel like I am a different person who is actually someone I can like... until I go to visit them.

Even just visiting for a day I find myself raising my voice at my partner in like a normal conversation without even realizing it. Thankfully he is so kind and forgiving and understands why I am lashing out and he lets me know so I can become aware of that toxic shit real quick. I end up disassociating, dropping hobbies, isolating, mistreating myself, filled with negative hurtful thoughts only towards myself believing I'm not worthy of any basic human necessities. basically hitting a massive low until after some unspecified amount of time I can pull myself back out of that ditch. Rinse and repeat every few months, it's exhausting. 

I know the correct answer is to cut them out of my life, but I just don't have the heart to do it, I cant even think about how it would make them feel... They support me passion/job wise which I'm very appreciative of and very frequently financially because of my horrific mental health, which I appreciate so much because I know barely any parents do that for their kids. Except.... financial related things has only been my since of stability and affection from them as far as I can remember. I wish I wasn't such a push over and I could set myself free of this torture for good. I feel like such a jerk for even saying these things, I feel spoiled and unworthy for the financial stability.... I just really needed to get it off my chest. Can anyone relate?"
Is My CPTSD Distorting This Possibly Harmless Post I Saw?,17,mhnenx,17,"I kind of didn't know where to post this. I guess I feel like maybe this is the community of people who might best understand how I feel about this. I'm really sorry if this is against the rules - I did read the rules and I don't think it is against them and I'm not trying to violate them or anything. If it's taken down I would understand but maybe would like an explanation if possible if that does happen. 

I was on Facebook (which I'm not often) and really just mindlessly scrolling as you do I guess. And I scrolled past an image shared by... not exactly a friend, certainly not an ""enemy"" or anything though. I will link the image [here](https://i.imgur.com/xZCKTZP.png). 

It's not at all violent or graphic or anything. It is just text overlaid a stock photo of people sitting in a circle. The text reads ""The isolated individual is not a real person. A real person is one who lives in and for others."" The image is attributed to something called the ""Telos Project,"" which I guess is a religious organization or something - I am honestly not really sure and that isn't something that I personally care about in regards to this specific post. Maybe this post ""makes sense"" in the ""context"" of the religion but even in that generous interpretation it still comes off to me as upsetting to me.

The reason I scrolled back up to read this was because I guess it just took a second for it to sink in what it was saying. Someone who's isolated is ""not a real person?"" I suppose this hurts so much because I in fact do not feel like a ""real person"" often because I am isolated. But it is not like I choose to feel isolated. I feel isolated even when I am around others. 

As for ""a real person is someone who lives in and for others,"" besides this sounding like a meaningless aphorism, still manages to come across as also... maybe to call this specific claim ""offensive"" is too far, but it is ignorant and judgmental in my opinion. I spent a long time living ""for"" someone else and all that did was make me less of a ""real person"" than I felt I was before. Again, in a generous interpretation maybe this is saying something like ""Be kind to others, see yourself in them"" or something (although even this is still vapid). But to use the words ""real person"" is just upsetting to me like I said.

I don't know. The shared post by my ""friend"" got like 7 likes. idk how many likes the original post has because I don't really want to engage with it. But I doubt it was liked by tons and tons of people. This seems like a small organization. I don't really think they were trying to phrase this in a hurtful way, but it nevertheless hurts to have someone else call me (even if not personally) not a ""real person"" for something I don't feel like I can control. 

I really wish I could just ignore this kind of stuff. I feel like I used to be able to, even in the early days of my trauma, but as time as gone on and I have grown older (I'm 24) I am growing more, not less sensitive to this sort of thing. How can I get back to that? To being able to not get upset by something like this? Am I just trending in the totally wrong direction with healing? Because it feels that way at this point."
It feels like I’ll never be able to afford a house and that makes me so depressed,27,mhn5mb,20,"Just saw this post, which validates things I already knew: https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mhdudx/oc_where_have_house_prices_risen_the_most_since/

I can’t express well enough how much I just want space that I own. Just a single fucking parcel of land somewhere on the planet that is mine. Nowhere feels safe, and if I had my own refuge it would mean everything. 

I hate renting. I hate that maintenance can show up in your apartment whenever. I hate knowing someone else has the keys to my home. I hate hearing neighbors through the walls and living in a human beehive. I hate living with roommates. I’ve lived with abusive roommates, I’ve lived with roommates who are absolute slobs. It seems we all have roommates who slam doors and walk loud, a common trigger. My sister has had multiple roommates steal from her. I hate the inconvenience and uncertainty of things being moved. It might sound minor but I mean this in every way: food in the fridge, the cabinets, dishes, etc. There is something so immensely therapeutic about knowing everything will be exactly where I left it, barring natural disaster. Knowing that I own the space and am the only one who can change it. I hate hiding away in my bedroom all the time. I want quiet when I want quiet and I want to be able to blast music when I want to.

I’m going to be living minimally this year, bouncing around and living out of my car at various campgrounds because I’m so disgusted with my money being siphoned into rent. Maybe I’ll explore van life, or some day buy a tiny piece of land and building a small cabin on it, but even that is costly.

Property prices are just going up and up, more and more landlords are just adding places to their portfolio, house flipping is also trendy and just drives up costs everywhere. I can’t even find a run down house in my city to patch up at a reasonable price. Seems my only chance is to slave away at a job to save up for decades while somehow still affording rent and hope the housing market crashes again.

Not to mention how far behind I am financially, I’ve been paying rent since 18, while most of my peers have been living with their parents and saving up money. And now I need to use the little remaining savings I have for healing and therapy so I can just function. I don’t see how I can compete with that./r/

This shit just sucks y’all, I hope it gets better."
Sick of feeling like a perpetual child,15,mhn4gk,4,"I saw a photo of a girl who lives in my city on Instagram. She was wearing a super cool, semi sexy outfit, nothing outlandish but she was clearly going out to celebrate her birthday. She looked awesome! I don’t know her personally, just like her style and was about to scroll past when I realized we’re the exact same damn age and now I can’t stop thinking about it. 

I was raised super fundie Christian, and I would feel like an IDIOT in an outfit that showed my body. Like a kid playing dress up. My brain has me in such a bizarre, stupid limbo. On one hand, I was extremely parentified by my own parents and was always ‘mature’ for my age (you all know what that means lol). But on the other, I’m so disconnected from my body from the years of various religious cults driving it into my brain that my body is not my own. 

Does anyone else here feel like they’re not actually a part of their own peer group? Like the things that come with being in a certain age bracket aren’t open to them, for no logical reason? For me, this innocuous post really drove home just how juvenile I still see myself as for some reason, and now I don’t really know what to do with that information."
You know this feeling?,5,mhmzq3,2,"The feeling that you want to be loved and feel full. But, from all the abuse and trauma,  the fighting of the fear and trust issues is just too overwhelming. So, you give up and fake that smile and accept the emptiness and defeat. You get through, faking that you are ok even though you want to say, "" I need help! Please! "" You want to cry and melt away. You don't though. You can't because you don't want to be a burden on the people you love and are afraid of at the same time. You want to shut down completely but keep f****** going instead because if you stop you will lose everything and everyone.  And you worry and create horrible scenarios and beg a higher power to release you. Until you go f****** numb and take leave of your self for awhile. And it never ends, ever. I hate this feeling. I don't know what to call it.  But it is my life and it wasn't my fault. I just need it to stop for a little while, maybe forever. This is how I feel inside and it is a horrible secret to carry around."
Does anyone else close off from someone completely after ANY red flag or trigger?,28,mhmosm,7,"I’m really, really struggling with the concept that other people are human and they make mistakes. The instant anyone hurts me at all, I feel like I mentally shut down and close off from them forever. I put up so many walls that it’s impossible for them to ever get close to me.

I never forgive, or forget. It’s like I keep a running tally in my head of all the ways people hurt me. And with each tally mark, I unconsciously close myself off from a person more and more. Even if they apologize- even if they change their behavior and actively work on improving- I never trust the person again. Sometimes I just dissociate from them completely, become emotionally distant/ monotone, or I feel complete apathy towards them. Sometimes I even forget everything about them (as my dissociative disorder comes into the mix).

But I’m worried that sometimes I may end up prematurely freezing out people who are actually ok or relatively healthy (although not perfect) friends. I’m a little trigger-happy (pun-intended) when it comes to pushing people away. I think this response probably stems from fear- essentially everyone I’ve ever been even slightly close to (family, friends, etc.) has hurt me. 

But my therapist has explained that even a healthy or trustworthy friend will likely make mistakes / display at least one red flag at some point over the course of the relationship, and that it may not be grounds for instant termination of the relationship every time.

How can I distinguish an ok/ healthy person with a red flag/ who has hurt me from an abuser who will hurt me more? I genuinely have no idea. I seem to react to everyone as if they were an abuser.

Is anyone else in a similar position?"
I'm tired of seeing uplifting posts,32,mhmglu,15,"I don't want to hear that I deserve things, that I'm good enough, that I'm valuable, that I deserve to be loved and deserve to love myself.

I don't think I'm worthy. I feel like a failure. I never felt good enough, and I just want someone to fucking recognize that I feel this way. 

I'm tired of feeling invalidated, of feeling like I'm invisible and that no one gives a damn."
Treating Self-Injury through Research Study,2,mhm5zj,1,"Thank you to the moderators of r/CPTSD for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

How Childhood Trauma Leads to Addiction,131,mhloaj,6,
I sure wish there was a way...,7,mhl8ue,1,"I sure wish there was a way to say ""I'm sorry that my CPTSD causes me to withdraw for survival a few times a month"" without sarcasm in my tone.

People don't understand that at some level I'm fighting for physical, mental, and/or emotional survival when I do that. I never asked for panic attacks or being diagnosed with CFS, OCD, ADD, IBS, and a non-apnea sleep disorder... all vying to take me out at any moment.

And the need to unplug and sleep 20hrs a day once-in-while is a bad thing?

The indifference to how hard it truly is for so many throughout the world saddens and frustrates me. I'm sure my CFS is the obvious result of 50+ years of undiagnosed CPTSD. The body can't survive extended neurologic takeovers like that for more than a few decades; depending upon the intensity of coping mechanism someone needs to employ.

And often by no conscious fault or choice of our own.

I was a workaholic and it fried my circuits by the age of 50. I also kicked ass for nearly 40 years as an IT Manager as the result of my ""defects"". I performed just how the system taught me to.

And I don't see any way off this train gracefully.

We only get to pick only one at a time:

1. Work
2. Retire wealthy (that ship sailed)
3. Live on welfare (in one or more of the many forms) 1 Year of disability rocked while it lasted but that ship sailed too because everyone thinks I'm faking it or just being lazy.

So, work is my only option. I've become the statistic who lived paycheck to paycheck too long, regardless of how big the paycheck got.

It's now time to plug back into the Matrix, and I'm dreading it.

Not that I don't want to, had a great run for several decades. I now fear I'll never get back to full-time work. A few hours a day is all I've got the bandwidth for, but I still push to try and do full days to be more productive and experience more of life. But it always comes with a price. Some internal pressure valve goes off and I have to stop everything, regardless of consequences (jobs, friendships, social groups).

Anyway, guess I just felt like rambling for a minute. I suppose I could also post this in r/existential_chrisis since this cuts to the deepest core of navigating life's demands where everything is harder than it should be.

Keep the faith, getting through any day with minimal struggles is a day to be grateful for. I'm grateful to be able to claim that now, at least for today. Tomorrow will be whatever it will be.

Blessings!"
It's my birthday tomorrow,28,mhkq6v,22,"I've felt ""off"" all week-- sensitive to rejection, self-conscious, awkward in my body. Today I finally realized that it's because I associate birthdays with feeling like a burden, and like I'm too much trouble to celebrate. I'm so many years away from those experiences in my youth, but on days like this it's so hard to shake the feeling that no one wants me.

Has anyone been able to cheer themselves up from birthday ennui? I don't have the gumption right now to coordinate an event, but I want to be more proactive than just sitting in this sadness."
I'm trying to not fight my feelings and feel them instead,15,mhkp3a,1,"It's hard, but it seems to be helping. giving myself permission to be sad, to be angry, to be whatever it is I'm feeling has been helping. I can't get rid of them, but accepting them as part of me instead of beating myself up for not being perfect has been helping more than I figured it would. I think I owe a lot of therapists an apology. I wasn't allowed feelings growing up. If I was sad, I had no right to be sad. If I was happy, how dare I be happy? It's made it hard to even acknowledge I have feelings, let alone that they're okay to have and that I'm entitled to them. I don't have to be perfectly pleasant 100% of the time and that's not just okay, that's normal. No one is perfectly happy all of the time. I'm not a Stepford Wife, and it's unhealthy to try to achieve that."
Hating being affectionate?,6,mhknc7,4,"Whenever my partner asks me for blatant affection or to be spoiled it ignites something in my gut. I get a terrible mix of irritation/anger, disgust, and guilt and I’m not sure why. I can’t fully stop it from surfacing because of how strong it is. I wish I could react normally and happily to being asked for affection, but it just makes me feel disgusting.

Does anyone else experience this same thing? Maybe it’s trauma related?"
I know I am doing my best but therapy is hard,7,mhkjkw,2,"Hey guys! 

So I started CONSISTENT therapy about three months ago. It’s been RAD. I am realizing so much, connecting to my inner hurt child, I am feeling a piece of me that’s stable and more happy becoming more significant every day. But OH MY GOD how am I supposed to do this work and ALSO do well in school?? I’m already on my 6th year of undergrad with at least another year, and I am so fucking frustrated. I had three REALLY GOOD semesters so I’m sitting at a 3.3GPA, but I am hopelessly behind and failing this semester. I’ve already withdrawn for medical reasons twice before and I thought I was doing well enough to start this therapy process. I feel so torn. I’m doing so much better emotionally, even took up ceramics and fell in love with it and I’m happy. But it feels like my brain just doesn’t want to do anything other than process and rest right now. Am I totally screwed or am I catastrophizing again? I just want to be done with college already, I’m itching for summer so I can enjoy my free time again, without feeling guilty constantly. Has anyone experienced this weird progress caused mental pause?"
"Does anybody else lose themselves for hours a day in video games / TV? I've been doing this for over 20 years, and I'm wondering if it's a CPTSD symptom.",575,mhkdzk,82,"I'm an only child who grew up with two abusive parents with prevalent mental health issues. I was very softly spoken and introverted, so I used to hole myself up in my room reading, gaming, and watching TV. Now as a 30-year-old, not much has changed. I spend most of my time when I'm not working losing myself in games, books, and TV. This can be up to several hours a night. On weekends, it can be 7-8 hours. I find myself on autopilot a lot of the time and thinking, ""do I actually want to do this? Am I having fun?"" The answer is often no. I'm also finding that I'm isolating myself and avoiding social interaction because I'm too tired, so I'd rather just sit indoors and lose myself in escapist things.  


I wonder if this is a maladaptive coping mechanism. Has anybody experienced this too?"
"I have noticed some stages I have been through, not necessarily linearly, on my way to trying to have better relationships with myself and others",4,mhkast,1,"When I first realized I have cPTSD a couple of years ago it was like a door opened in my mind and I could see myself a little bit more clearly.  I was also able to start the work to forgive myself for some of my past mistakes.


As I started noticing where I wasn't being the person I wanted to be in my daily life, and seeing the struggles in my relationships, I began trying to change the things about myself that I didn't like.  It wasn't/isn't easy, but the work has been so worth it.  


I got triggered the other day by something tiny and unexpected.  A little one but enough to send me into anxious, flighty thoughts and some of my current flighty behaviors.

Any time I am in flight mode, my self talk is atrocious.  I like to say there is a mean bitch in my head.  I am working on not listening to her and eventually silencing her completely.  She is absolutely not who I want to be.


I wrote the below as a way of working through the latest trigger, and giving my journey some perspective for myself.   As a kindness to myself.  To remind me that I have been a long way already although I still have a long way to go.  A self-therapy and self-soothing exercise, if you will. 


I thought maybe sharing these thoughts could help someone put their own journey in perspective.  It is all my opinion and words, although likely echoes some things I have read over the years.  I may or may not remember sources if I try.  Aside: I have a lot of book recommendations if anyone wants them.  I could put together a ""books I've read"" post in the future if anyone is interested.


This got long so I'd like to express gratitude here at the top for you checking out my post, for being here, and for being you.   You're awesome!  I am so grateful for this whole community, you have all helped me so much.  


Sorry for any formatting or spelling errors, etc.


I am very interested in reading any thoughts that come up for you, although I may not have the energy to respond quickly or at all.  I am feeling a bit of a crash coming on and may need to make myself take a break for a bit.

--
Stages I have noticed in my journey (that I have mostly moved through, or still jump back and forth between):


1) Not understanding any of my triggers and being subconsciously triggered often, spending days or even weeks living in fight/flight/fawn mode at a time, before it all came crashing down into depression.  Repeat flight/crash cycle ad nauseam for 40+ years.


2) Reading about and starting to recognize and understand my patterns after a trigger, starting to recognize my cycles and patterns of coping from my past experiences, paying special attention to the way both my body and mind felt throughout - as much as I could remember, which was not much.  Also identifying triggered behaviors and coping patterns, which usually involved a lot of alcohol and pizza, as well as perseveration with venting to whomever would listen.



Interjection:   These next few stages are even less fun than living these cycles subconsciously or passively watching them play out, I think.  Acknowledging where we are using poor coping skills is hard.  Know that those coping skills served you at one time, and there is no shame in developing them.  Changing them is hard, but when they aren't serving you any more, maybe it is time for a review and purge.  It's harder than it sounds, but worth it.

-Stages 3 through 6 are where a lot of people (including myself) get stuck, IMO.   Taking an honest look at ourselves and ultimately controlling our behavior is more painful than living out our patterns subconsciously.  Especially when we have said or done not nice things to others when triggered.  So we blame all of the relationship problems on the other people in them, and keep repeating the same patterns over and over again in new relationships, expecting different results.  This is certainly insanity.  (But not according to Einstein, to whom this is often misattributed.).    
It is hard to acknowledge our contributions when relationships are difficult.  And most relationships are difficult at one time or another, I've found.

Finding and maintaining relationships that bring out the best and downplay the worst in us is key.  Some of us trigger each other constantly and repeatedly because of clashing coping mechanisms that do not serve communication, trust etc. in that relationship with that person.  That doesn't mean you are they are bad, just not for each other.   Practice is the only way to get good at setting and enforcing boundaries on your way to healing.  I recommend keeping the people in your life who encourage and help you to do so and getting rid of the ones who don't.   Two people who are healing may be able to make it work.  A person who is healing will have a hard time in a relationship with someone who refuses to let them grow or who believes there is nothing wrong with their own maladaptive coping behaviors like taking their anger out on others.  They usually justify their behaviors.  For example, by believing that everyone they unleash their emotions on deserves their anger, when that is often not the case.  They are often deflecting anger from the past onto their current closest target who did some small thing that reminded them of a big or repeated trauma, or did nothing at all to warrant their anger and is simply there to receive it.  Then they pile on the manipulative guilt because you ""made them"" do or feel something they didn't like.  To be clear, people's feelings are their own responsibility, you cannot ""make"" someone feel something, and you certainly can't make them do anything!  Don't let guilt trap you into a cycle of accepting responsibility that isn't yours.  (This was a hard one for me, so I wanted to be sure to mention it.)


Interjection over, back to the stages:


3) Identifying how I feel in my body and mind during the flight/crash cycle nearer and nearer in the past, and recognizing my maladaptive coping behaviors as they pertain to and interfere with my having healthy relationships with myself and with others.


4) Feeling myself in flight mode after an unknown trigger, identifying the trigger, and being able to reason myself down days or weeks after going into and living in flight mode.


 5) Feeling myself in flight mode after an unknown trigger, identifying the trigger, and being able to reason myself down minutes after it happens.    
-By this time I have usually run away from the situation, or lost my shit and then run away.  Hopefully the former.


6) Feeling the beginnings of flight mode after an unknown trigger, identifying the trigger, and being able to reason myself down in the moment, before I lose my shit or run away.   I often still feel the effects of the adrenalin rush, but am able to use breathing techniques to calm myself down and not react the way I would have in the past while staying in the situation (discussion, party, meeting, etc).
-I can only do this sometimes.  Most of the time I am still in the above stages, recognizing the trigger days later, or sometimes weeks.



Addendum:


Throughout this process, I recognized my trigger categories in a somewhat stepwise fashion as well.   (This write up started as an exploding brain meme, and got way too long and involved.  I've posted the below on cPTSDmemes in exploding brain format by itself.)


1. Realizing certain words and phrases in writing and in conversation trigger me.


2. Realizing abrupt tone changes, and sarcasm used to cover truth in conversation trigger me.



3. Realizing macro-expressions that gross me out, are condescending or don't match people's words and tones in conversation can trigger me.



4. Realizing micro-expressions that gross me out, are condescending, or don't match people's words and tones in conversation can trigger me


5. Realizing micro-expressions that gross me out, are condescending, or don’t match people’s body language in strangers in passing can trigger me


Re: triggers.  I've also noticed I have big triggers and smaller triggers.  The small ones I can usually work through faster, the bigger ones take a little more teasing out, and I often take longer to identify them.



Thanks again for reading if you got all the way here.

Being Needed Scares Me,12,mhk1ca,3,"Does anyone else have this experience?

If I just float around, am a flash in the pan, come for a good time then leave, I am more at ease and feel more comfort than if I am a permanent feature. I'm getting older, and coming into a time in my life when I need more permanent things, more permanent people, but somehow this being needed - it makes me anxious. I have a lot of experience moving people around, I'm a great coach and motivator, mediator, but having to take on these roles exhausts me. Drains me. Takes me back to a time when those were the skills that helped me survive.

Can anyone relate? How the skills that saved them are now these huge assets that they don't really want?

I want company, connection, but also I just want to be left alone"
Has anybody else experienced this sort of hypocrisy? Esp amongst professionals?,24,mhjxsu,5,"Granted, this is far more common in the poverty bracket—public health/mental health systems, but the professionals talk so much about having self-worth and self esteem, advocating for yourself, etc. But the second You try to do it with them, there’s pushback and they start to say things like, “you’re not special” and think I’m trying to ask for special treatment when I’m just trying to get my basic needs met. I don’t think I’m better than anybody, but I also can’t at all accept the way things are. The horrible, negligent sort of care they give (or don’t give, rather). I think everybody should get their needs met. The only reason it looks like I’m asking for exceptions and wanting special treatment is because they treat people like shit. And I know I’m worth more. How can you possibly expect people to get better and actually have self worth if your actions don’t follow through. You can say it all day long, but if you don’t back it up, your words are emptier than your souls. And they’re all complicit. They act like god made these rules and nothing can be changed. What a crock. Humans created this mess. Humans can fix it. They just don’t care enough to. I wish people could see that the pandemic should prove a lot of their points wrong— YES change CAN happen quickly, if you want it to. YES you CAN change laws and make exceptions. Too bad only stuff like that happens when the rich/powerful are effected."
"Seeking resources for the Eugene, Or area.",2,mhjjun,1,"Does anyone know a reputable therapist/company who specializes in emdr, or trauma therapy?"
Just need to get this out,17,mhj9po,2,"A person I follow on another platform, who is in the Army, asked specifically for any guys who had experienced sa/r while in the Military. (Sa/r in the Military is known as MST, Military Sexual Trauma). I was one of only 7 that responded, after 4 hours.

I asked if she wanted active members or can they be Veterans too? Since only 1 of the other 6 responded that they would talk to her. The others were like “they knew a guy once, in another State, at another base, maybe who been raped. 

So, I thought maybe I could provide some good Intel for her. Why did I think that? She said no, only Active Military.  So I told her “Okay”.  Guess she’ll get what she needs from only 1 responder. 

Maybe next time someone asks, they will want to hear my story too. But maybe I will do as I normally do, keep quiet. That’s safest thing anyway."
Do i have any reason to stay alive?,2,mhivnc,1,"Hello. I dont want to be pathetic, and thank you all. Im a 20 y.o. I cant say that my life's bad, but i literally dont understand my feelings. Now i dont have any close friend, but i have a gf. My gf's perfect, but i think i will be seem like a burden, cuz she got more problems than me,  at least I think so. My  father narcissus, and i did all what he wanted, when i was a kid. He didnt think about my opinion, i felt i was like a soldier in the army. He said he wanted only good for me, but no one in the familly didnt feel that. I have 2 brothers, but their mental health are better than mine, they rly dont care about him, literally. I dont know my brothers are bad or good, but my mom said they're good, cuz my brothers can be happy, but i cant.. Every fucking time when my dad's screaming i can't stay normal. I mean i cant stay normal when everyone's screaming, cuz i got a flashbacks about daddy's scream... What's wrong? Why am i like this? Only my mom knows about my  diagnosis, i dont want to talk with this with my dad, cuz he will be think about me like a psycho, i cant prove him about his mental health (i said in the start, he's a narcissist), he wont believe me. He didnt trust anyone. I know, this's his disease, but what i can do with my dad? I cant talk with him, i felt like im the soldier, literally. I cant fucking stay with his screams, with any screams. I get a panic every time,  when i hear the fucking screams, it's so difficult to describe. I feel all the problems I had because of me, i dont know why... I rly cant understand why, but i feel it's only my bad, is it ok?  He puts mental pressure all the time. He controls me everytime. EVERY FUCKING TIME. I know i need to go away from my dad, but i cant.  Cuz he will blame my mother, my brothers. But this is not all...  


In the 2016 i survived the gun threat. It was my  CLASSMATE. He wanted money from me, but i didnt give him, and got a  threat. I.. After this i cant stay outside the house.   


In 2018 my good mate died 2 days before my birthday. Now i hate my birthday,  cuz i didnt know about his anxiety. He didnt say and show it to anyone  his feelings.   


And from 2018 my life's going  downhill. I agree i got good memories, i got a good feelings, Im grateful to my girlfriend for the support, but i dont want to be a burden, cuz i rly love her.. I dont know what i can do, cuz now can't be social, i talk only with my girlfriend, and  I haven't gone outside for more than 3 weeks. I think i'll most likely have problems at the university, but i dont care about that..  What can you recommend? How can I remove the sensation of flashbacks from my childhood? I know that therapy is needed, but now I have no money for it, spent all the money on identifying the diagnosis hah,  but I think I'll start a little later.  What can i do before the therapy? Can i improve my mental health?  


Thanks everyone again who noticed my post, im sorry about my english.."
Someone please tell me that this can get better,3,mhj12g,2,"I was just discharged from a 2 month hospital stay in a unit that specializes in dissociative trauma disorders where I was diagnosed with PTSD and DID. Feeling extremely raw right now. Understandably, I think. 

Before I went into the unit I was in denial that I had even experienced trauma in my life and thought my experiences could all be explained by stress or the bipolar disorder which I have been diagnosed with for a few years. I always knew something wasn’t fitting with my diagnosis and treatment, but I was so against the idea of this (trauma) being the problem. I’ve become more accepting of what happened to me/what I’m experiencing but now I’m having a hard time accepting that recovery is even a possibility I guess? I am overwhelmed by the feeling that this world was not made for me and I cannot exist in it. 

I have never done trauma therapy before, I’ve never even had what I’d call successful therapy of any kind in the past. And I’m feeling very pessimistic about the possibility of therapy being a treatment that can change my life in any meaningful way. I still wish this was bipolar disorder or depression or stress, those feel like simpler problems that could possibly be fixed with a medication and a routine. There’s no pill for this. 

Please someone just tell me I’m not the only one? Tell me it can get even a little bit better?"
"Remember, it is now April Fools Day in some places so be extra wary of anything you see for the next 36 hours",259,mhir01,17,"Remember people who aren't dealing with what we are might try and do something that they think is funny that might set you off, could be a fake pregnancy announcement or something that causes your stress levels to spike, be vary wary of anything you see in the next day or so just in case. Protect your emotions and don't let assholes ruin your day/week with a stupid thing"
DAE also lose their vision in certain situations?,11,mhinzj,7,"It's been happening to me only for the past 4 years (I'm 27). In certain situations, for example, being surrounded by too many people and smells, waiting in line in a place I dislike or being in a bus going somewhere, I begin to feel sick in my stomach, nusea, starts sweating cold, my heartbeat and respiration become erratic, I can't control my respiration at all and then slowly my eyesight begins to dim out until I can't see at all.

It happened to me again 2 days ago. I went to get some lab tests so I had to get my blood drawn. I was siting just fine and suddenly I started to feel the signs, the inability to breathe correctly even if I'm consciously trying to, the cold sweat, nausea, blackening vision. I told the doctor and she gave me a cotton with alcohol which helped me return to normal.

Edit: just noting about the above situation that I'm not scared of needles or blood at all. 

Have you been through this before and do you know why?"
Did anyone else have “homework time”?,3,mhiim4,7,"Edit: This is a lot longer than I thought I could make it, but it’s the most condensed “formula” to their usual pattern for this abuse/experience. It is primarily all like.. crazy making, word twisting, projections/insertion/accusation, emotional and psychological abuse. The physical abuse didn’t strike me as abuse til adulthood, the mental aspect is what was the worst in my perspective back then. She makes it feel like your brain and reality as you know it is ripping to shreds inside your skull for hours first. 

**So TLDR; DAE parents sit them down for 5-8+ hours to do homework, but only use super mind-break-y word twisting, “got cha” style escalation to instigate conflict/frustration, work themselves up into a mental break, and escalate into physical abuse? **

_______

My parents did this to me, the oldest and all my younger siblings. They would have us sit at the kitchen table for hours(usually around 5), literally sometimes up to 8 hours, consecutively with no breaks sometimes even withholding bathroom breaks. 

They called it “homework time” 

Basically it is a non stop escalation from calm to annoyed to enraged to terrorized. 
It would turn into our parents making frustrated and angry(blatantly disrespectful to us as individuals) remarks on why we are taking so long, badgering enough until we get stressed and then actually cannot focus on the work. They drink beer or wine non stop as the night goes on, and get angry along with it. 

Eventually they get us to the point where we are extremely upset, and say “I can’t think” when they prompt us with something about why we are still doing homework, why do we have so much homework, why don’t we understand the homework, why (literally anything) homework? 

Then they force/order us to ask for their help, as though the reason we can’t do the homework is a lack of knowledge or understanding of the material- rather than being extremely emotionally overwhelmed, and under extreme pressure and fear/terror even for fear of “getting in trouble” and “the consequences”. 

Once they are “helping” with the homework(a few hours into them screaming, and us panicking) they become ENRAGED at any number of reasons, primarily these two:


- why do you even have this much homework assigned? 

- (insert school subject) has changed since I was in, why would they change it?(especially math) 


In which they would then 
scream AT US in a violent rabid rage/tantrum as though we are responsible for the school giving too much homework, or for the education standards changing from the 70s to the 2000s-2010s. 

By this point we have been crying, having panic attacks, dissociating, all of which is EVERY TIME met with threats of punishment, or accusing us of disrespect and disobeying. 

“You better stop crying before I give you a real reason to cry”

When they ask why are we crying, and we say anything than the two bulleted complaints above, it is disrespect. A horrific offense to them.  How DARE we accuse them of being bad parents, because if they made us this upset then that makes them bad parents so it isn’t them. Besides if we made them mad we deserved it. 


When they ask why we are crying, and we say one of the two bulleted complaints above/state the reason we are upset is the same reason they are upset and screaming, they threaten us that “that isn’t a good reason to be upset” and that we are “spoiled brats trying to get out of homework”. 

It is kind of like.. one of those video games where every choice you make prompts s different ending, but every choice or NON choice made is explicitly WRONG and terrifying.

The escalation goes on until they decide to hit us, which would be the ending in this video game scenario. And every time, it is always the same ending no matter WHAT choices were made through out. 

 Every ending results in being whooped, as in just.. attacked in any way they can land a hit on us- then blamed that if we had just been still for our whooping it wouldn’t have been all over. Really what it was is that their anger escalated to the point that they physically attacked us to release their emotions. 


This happened 3-5 nights a week(depending on how much homework I wasn’t able to compete before getting home) for most of my childhood from probably 2nd to 3rd grade, until my sisters were “old enough” to over take my homework time by “needing parental supervision” when doing homework. So years. 

And each occurrence, this is usually how the afternoon/night ended. And every time it would go on for hours, once it started it **never** ended until it reached completion (being physically abused).


**tw blunt description/listing of physical abuse after this point**

Sometimes it would even go on well into the night, on nights that our mom could not pull herself away, and then it would take on a different cycle. Kind of like the typical “abuse pattern” in relationships but rapid, one full cycle every hour or two. At this point, my dad would just disappear to watch Tv or something- he just tuned out and let it happen. “Nothing he could have done.” Because if he got involved at this point on “our side”, he would get a part of it too, I guess.  And this is when the physical abuse also changed from “angry child slapping up a punching bag” style “whoopings”, to my mom doing stuff like squeezing fist fulls of skin and pulling, trying to crush our arms or hands, yanking or shaking our heads by her fists in our hair, screaming like a banshee with her mouth centimeters away from our ear or face, trying to throw us (she wasn’t strong enough for this tbh and we were all underweight)."
"I've decided that my parents don't get to be my parents anymore, I'm my own parent now",25,mhhuof,1,"Finally found a good therapist at 28 and am starting to untangle my CPTSD after years of repeated abuse, misdiagnosis, and mistreatment, and something I've been doing is trying to give myself the love and comfort my parents never did. I know this might not be useful for everyone, but I'm proud of this note I wrote to myself today and wanted to share:

""I know it's OK to have bad days and feel bad feelings, but I want you to remember something, my love -- even after everything you went through, even after everything you're *still* going through, you kept your heart kind and open. You rejected the anger you were force-fed and made an active choice to never be like the people who hurt you, even though it's hard, even though you're burdened and suffering with pain that has never been your fault. I am so proud of you and love you so much for that.""

Maybe reading this will help you too, and if you're not ready to say these things to yourself yet, well, I will be your mom now too."
Just fucking venting,7,mhi105,0,"I just need to vent this, because I feel very heavy right now and need to be able to go to sleep. Trigger Warning: neglect, abusive relationships/parents.

I got a lot of healthy love as a child until I was around 12. Then I got heavily neglected in a way that left me with much trauma. The people I pick for relationships now are the type of people to shower you with love and then drop it at random times and then theyll get cold or even aggressive. I see that pattern and I am working on resolving it, but it still hurts. I am only 20, but I am starting to get very tired of this desperate search for affection. I am good friends with myself, but theres a point where you need somebody else to give you a hug and be there without being unpredictable, or me having to be scared they'll get angry with me for nothing the next day. Also (and I don't mean this with any offense), I have started to wonder, whether that's just the risk of being with a man. I know that can't be right? But every single man who has had a loving role in my life before, also has scared and scarred the fuck out of me."
The need to be heard?,8,mhikl1,1,"Please forgive my late night ramblings, as I’m laying in bed and this thought has been going through my mind. If I don’t write it down I will forget it within a few minutes thanks to my FUBAR memory.

DAE get the feeling sometimes that they are fed up of being seen as a strong person and just have a major meltdown. Then to almost be restrained until calm, then actually listened to? For me I think this is because until recently I have never been listened to. I have a lot more to deal with yet but I’m currently on a waiting list for that."
"27, and honestly wish I had just died... what’s the point? No family, and a sea of flashbacks and bad memories. This is torture.",42,mhie1l,11,"This is torture. Why do I exist? Why was I born? What’s the point? It’s like a nightmare I can’t wake up from. But wait, it’s my life. 

Malevolence and the actions of my abuser have defined my entire existence. I feel completely trapped. 

What’s the point of living after being broken by so much cruelty?"
Does anyone else get shaky/anxious & have to move around when they are happy/excited?,12,mhic37,5,I’m having a really good day today and I’ve realized when I am it’s like I get a caffeine boost without the caffeine. Is that my nervous system responding to that emotion like it’s a threat? Lol I feel like I’m in flight mode but I am happy.

The concept of nostalgia makes me sad. I don’t have a happy childhood to pine for because mine was stolen from me.,839,mhhl06,83,"I’m in my late 20s and it seems like a lot of people my age love looking back on their childhood fondly, remembering all their happy memories of being a carefree kid. Playing with friends, having no worries. They talk about wishing they could go back to those days and feeling nostalgic for simpler times. 

And it just makes me sad because I can’t relate at all. I don’t recall ever being a carefree child. I have always been plagued by anxiety and trauma and loss and fear. Family stuff, then bullying which developed into social anxiety which developed into panic disorder.... I’ve had to carry the weight of the world since before I could even articulate what the world was. People who didn’t know what was going on would call me mature for my age but it was the constant anxiety, even since elementary school. 

I missed out on a happy childhood and never got a chance to be carefree. Now I’m missing out on getting to be nostalgic too. And it’s really hard to function as a responsible adult when you never got a chance to be carefree as a child."
anyone just tired of everything?,15,mhhnn1,2,"It's getting so fucking hard trying to live everyday when i just want to be six feet under. I'm so tired of suffering everyday i'm so tired of having flashbacks i'm so tired of being tired i'm so tired of being so mentally ill i can hardly do shit for myself. I just want everything to be over. I don't wanna do this anymore. It's so hard explaining cptsd as well, everyone just thinks i'm crazy or i just want to be sick like this and i'm not doing anything to help myself when I feel like i've been helping myself for years. i'm tired of helping myself i'm so tired of trying. I just want it all to be over. i'm in so much pain trying to live and be normal"
I need to be around people,4,mhh49e,2,"I really like having a roommate or living with someone else or I spiral into a weird headspace and don’t keep a schedule well. I know a lot of people - my sister included - look to isolate themselves, but when we talked about it between us, her abuse happened in a group while mine was one on one. 

I like to live in a city because I also feel like someone can hear me if I get in trouble and would help me. 

That, and everyone else moving pressures me (in a good way?) into moving. The general buzz makes me remember that life goes on outside of my own trauma and mind. 

I don’t have abandonment issues, but have also not lived alone in 4-5 years. With my recent unemployment, I’ve been staying at a boyfriend/friend’s since I didn’t trust myself alone. 

I find I’m in the minority RE traumatized people on this - but...anyone else?

EDIT: And I was alone in an apartment before in college and kept having non-epileptic seizures. It’s not that I can’t be alone, but having someone to check in with or to do teamwork stuff with is a positive for me. In my isolating and abusive relationship I did a good amount of community work."
I feel like my trauma isn’t valid,4,mhh116,2,"So my trauma started when I was...uh, born? 
Throughout my whole life I’ve always been alone in some way or another. My first experience being away from my mother, I had such bad separation anxiety that I cried the whole time and when my mum came back to get me I went ballistic, and I was physically restrained to ‘teach me a lesson’ about getting so upset. 

The whole time I was at school up until the time I was seventeen I was excluded. I didn’t have a long term close friend until I was fourteen and didn’t have a friendship group until I was seventeen years old.

Every single person I have intimately trusted except for my dad has either emotionally abused, neglected or abandoned me. My mum suffered with severe anxiety problems and used to take it out on me, sometimes blowing up and screaming at me for the tiniest thing until I was crying, at which point she would either laugh at me, shove me into my room and lock the door or threaten to leave and never come back. 
This wasn’t an every day occurrence - most of the time she was a relatively good mother, but when I got older especially she was never very motherly. She always solved the problem by using verbal and emotional aggression, both for my benefit and to punish me. 

At school I was ritually humiliated for fun, and because I wasn’t seen as one of the ‘worthy’ kids the teachers did nothing about it and actually encouraged it in some cases. It went on until my family threatened to call the police, because I was regularly receiving death threats and threats of physical violence (breaking arms, legs, strangulation) from other kids. People stole my stuff and hid or destroyed it, pretended to be my friend and then humiliated me, or asked me out for a joke. 

I also have autism, so I was basically in fight or flight for my entire childhood because on top of all of this I also had sensory issues and extreme social anxiety.

My best friend of six years lately abandoned me for the sake of an easy sexual opportunity and told me that I was toxic when I reached out to him for help because I felt suicidal due to this, the pandemic and my eating disorder. I cut him off, but I was on suicide watch for about two months afterwards. 

Since I’ve had therapy for my eating disorder, that coping mechanism is gone and I’ve started experiencing frequent emotional flashbacks and occasional visual flashbacks. I’ve been hyper vigilant my whole life, experienced hyper aggression at times and have had five or six intense suicidal periods throughout my life, starting when I was ten. I have severe trust issues, my shock response is to shut down my emotions and I don’t know how to respond to affection. 

I just want some support."
DAE else feel panicked when setting boundaries at work because you don't know if they're reasonable or actually asking for too much?,6,mhh01o,3,"I've been on disability from work for several weeks and am planning to return soon. My therapist and I went over boundaries/accommodations I need for my return to make sure I'm prioritizing my mental health. We set what I thought of as a reasonable request, but now my HR is pushing back a little saying ""it would be difficult to accommodate with the employer's needs,"" which is making me question if I'm really asking for too much. Now I'm just kind of spiraling into feeling like I'm faking my mental illness and questioning whether my job wants to let me go. This feeling really sucks."
How to deal with all-consuming anger after a trigger?,8,mhgpr4,4,"As a child, I was never allowed to express anger at home. If I did, I was physically abused or neglected. This caused me to become a people pleaser and avoid confrontation.

I am doing somatic psychotherapy and reviewing DBT so I am making real progress with stating my boundaries and asking for what I need. I did this with a very close friend recently, and was shocked when she demanded an apology because I stated how I felt and what I needed. I refused, and she told me how 'self-centred' I am, that she's 'done', and that she hoped 'it was worth it'. 

This triggered a lot for me as I have trauma from relentless bullying all throughout my childhood. I didn't respond in an aggressive way, but on the inside I am experiencing all-consuming anger. I think this is due to me repressing my anger as a child. Now, when I feel dismissed or that I am treated unfairly, my anger is very intense and I can't stop obsessing about it. I don't know what to do with all this anger... 

How do you deal with this?"
Does anyone get random attacks of anxiety? Especially in social situations.,8,mhgg1l,2,It happened to me today and I am so embarrassed. I don’t always know why I’m getting triggered by something. But when it happens in front of an audience I feel especially distressed by it. It can be very difficult for me to share my thoughts and feelings with people in an academic or social setting. This can be true even when I’m talking to people I know well. I’ll get this intense rush of anxiety. I feel detached from my body and almost like the words are tumbling out of my mouth. I start to feel like I’m not in control anymore and that other people are somehow aware I’ve been activated by something. I become very hypervigilant looking at people’s microexpressions and feeling as though I am falling apart in front of their eyes or not even a whole person anymore. Is this a common experience other people have as well?
My husband poured water on me,7,mhgeej,1,"I was having a CPTSD episode.  I suffered 7 long years in a sexual, emotional, and physically abusive marriage, I am now married to a Grandiose Narcist  , who in order to stop fights will try and trigger an episode. A couple of evenings ago he triggered me by telling me I would never get my kids in a divorce they were his, (something my previous ex said) i fell down my rabbit hole into a episode and he poured water on my head to get me to stop doing whatever I was doing \*regressing, repeating myself, self southing, crying, melting etc. Basically reliving a moment in time).  Tell me what your opinion is . I feel violated."
Does anyone use tabletop RPGs to try out new personalities?,1,mhg054,11,"This *just* occurred to me.

IRL, I want romance, but I'm very shy about approaching anyone. I assume that people are offended/threatened by the very idea that I feel attracted to them, and so it feels like the more respectful thing is to just never talk to anyone ever. (It doesn't help that I'm male, and men are often seen as dangerous/dishonest in these matters.)

But if I made a character in a tabletop RPG, she could be a *terminal flirt*. She could be fearlessly approaching NPCs all the time and we could just play out the consequences, good or bad. I could practice this other side of myself without worrying about actually offending people. (Also, you'll notice that I'm thinking of making the character female, because it makes me feel less guilty. The way I've been trained, it's ok for a girl to be interested in guys, but the reverse is dangerous/perverted.)

If I found the right group, I think this could be really helpful.

Has anyone tried this before? Did it help you?"
My therapist changed my appointment times to 2 weeks instead of 3. Does that mean Im getting worse? Anyone had this happen?,1,mhfv8e,3,She said it’s because I have too much anxiety at 3 weeks.
I have successfully kept my space spotless and organized for 4 days straight.,155,mhftyt,12,"I have no one to tell this to who would see it as a success and would rather see it as more of a ""big woop, come back in 3 months"" sort of thing. Many people in my life have seen me go through this roller coaster of massive cleaning, and it lasts for a day or two and just deteriorates after that; rinse and repeat.

&#x200B;

I feel myself coming out of a depressive state, and i felt a huge shift in myself when i chose to do my chores first thing on sunday instead of procrastinating until later in the day when i always lose energy to follow through with it. If i would've continued the pattern of procrastination my entire week would've been shot-- hectic, filled with overwhelming emotions and mess all around me. Instead of doing that, i cleaned my desk, got all the trash out of the room, got rid of all of the dishes that had piled up for weeks (small pile but i had been avoiding them) and vacuumed. I had the rest of the day to myself to live in the clean space! It took only a few hours but the effects of it are spreading into today and will continue to spread into the next weekend if i can keep it up, where i will have more time to do what i want instead of devoting it to catching up in my chores. I must remember that if i continue to bring down dishes as i use them, bring out trash as i use them and generally take things that are out of place and put them away that i will be less stressed and overwhelmed to complete other things that are more important than cleaning.

These are things i've told myself to do for as long as i remember. I know what i have to do, it's the following through that is hard, and i finally did it. I jumped back on the wagon after chasing it for months. Sharing it here will hopefully give me some accountability from others to continue this momentum. I even went and got my blood drawn (something i had been putting off for weeks) because of how good i felt for just being able to sit in a clean and organized space. Almost a year of therapy seems to be paying off. Feels good. Real good. I hope it continues."
Is it bad that I only feel comfortable around three friends only?,3,mhfqra,3,"So I have a lot, lot of friends that I talk to. I'm close to a lot of em but like, I only feel truly comfortable with three, those three are very laid back, non-judgemental, deal with some of the same issues I do and are really nice guys and I actively feel the want and need to check in and comfort them when i'm a lil worried or want to make the effort to message them a lot because they mean a lot. I still like a lot of my friends but I feel like I can't fully be my most authentic me around them, and get worried I anger them a lot. But with those three friends in particular I never really feel that way and they make me feel good. Is it bad that I don't tend to be comfortable fully around other people?"
disability and CPTSD,3,mhfdj4,1,"Hi,  
I wrote [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/m70bqf/anyone_else_just_continually_exhausted/) a couple of weeks ago and things haven't gotten better.  Does anyone have any advice for getting on disability payments (in the U.S.) with CPTSD/depression?  I prefer to work but I don't think I can do this much longer. On the other hand, I'm concerned that I won't qualify. Thanks."
the earthy smell and smell of crickets? triggers me because of a dream i kept having during a difficult time that i can’t actually identify but i know it’s when i was a kid,5,mhf9g3,5,"the dream was like my mum as a nurse along with other people i knew and we were in this derelict bug infested ‘hospital’ and they were taking care of us or at least supposed to 

i saw other kids in uncomfortable conditions and they didn’t say anything

it was also during the time where there was the ‘we will rock you’ kid band advert kept coming up and somehow i associated it with that 

this is one nightmare that always stuck with me and i hate the trigger and it gives me a feeling of like i’m disgusting and honestly it had a melancholic vibe along with it, like there was nothing i could do and i just accepted it in the moment"
Responsible parties,11,mhf735,3,"I had a long conversation with my brother last night, like 4 hours long. We live in different places so we talk every 3-6 months about random things, but it normally turns into a deep talk about our family history.

My niece is a preteen and I called to find out what she wanted for her birthday. My brother said she enjoys reading, and I thought back to when I was her age. At her age was the first time I was raped and I decided to tell my brother this and ask if he felt it was appropriate to get her a book(not about sexual assault) that has some kind of body positive, women centered theme or discussion.

My brother is religous(christianty) and he basically got into this deep theory that because our parents were religious, but weren't following god that their kids were cursed, which is why all this fucked up stuff happened. He reassured me that his daughter is free from that curse.

I DON'T want anything like I've experienced to happen to my niece. But it shifts responsibility from my parents and abusers to say it is some kind of spiritual curse. My parents should have taught me about sexuality, protected me from predators, and not deemed me as impure or shamed me for sexual assault I experienced. They were the adults. They were the responsible parties- curse or no curse. 

But I feel guilt for not believing the whole curse thing because that would mean that my niece, in a way, isn't safe from that.

I do think intergenerational trauma is something in my family so maybe that's what he means, but still, it makes me feel like I have to carry the responsibility, when adults should have been and still should own up to it."
“Stuck it up” and “get over it”. Everyone gets upset about people who say that and claims that “mental health doesn’t work that way”. Which hypocritically is exactly what therapists do.,57,mhf5qs,19,"They may pay lip service to guidance, insights and “teaching new skills” but the vast majority of their actions say otherwise. Their preferred method of mindfulness, CBT or DBT makes things worse?  Well then you just need to “work” and get over your resistance because nobody else has ever had negative side effects from it.  Very few therapists will even admit that they can do harm.  Paid wall stand in method and superficial empathy doesn’t do much other then acting as an expensive form of journaling.  

Ask for something else?  Well now you need a higher level of care as community mental health’s “trauma informed care” is just a dbt course and cbt counselling.  Oh but you’ll have to pay out of pocket at $200 per week?  Can’t afford it?  Well, why don’t you just work really hard and save up? You’re just being resistant and not taking those “options” that were given to you when you say that all your addition income is currently being spent on the physical illness you are fighting.   That is essentially saying “too bad” just get over it.  

Want another clinician because you got matched with another incompetent therapist?  Nope, apparently letting you see someone else is just a waste of resources.  Turns out the “ability to change therapists” that the front desk told you about really means “come back in three years and then we’ll see”. Day treatment?  Well no, the clinic is basically online and you need a private internet connection that can support 5+ hours of video conferencing so they just discharge you if you can’t afford that. 

Oh and when you run out of money and are now broke because you dropped a couple grand on therapy that did absolutely nothing?  Insurance only covers three sessions which are basically spent “getting to know you” or therapist shopping?  They then tell you to “maybe get a better job” or “read a self help book”.  Great, except apparently the dissociative disorder, c-ptsd and other general illnesses I have are hindering my career and life as well.  Why do they think I sought help in the first place?  

Bad therapy cause you trauma?  Well now you just have to “get over it” and seek help from another therapist in a field where therapeutic harm isn’t talked about, very few therapists know the negative effects of their methods and even fewer use any sort of feedback metrics to check their biases.  And hope that the next therapist who does the exact same thing will somehow be different.  Then repeat the cycle when you inevitably do get harmed.  

Suicidal because you have no other options left?  Well call the crisis line who will basically do nothing but suggest “DBT” and to distract yourself.  Which doesn’t work as a long-term strategy. They actually can’t refer you or anything because of previous reasons, but just give a pep talk on “how you need to stand up for yourself in the system” without any actual information on how to do that.  So basically, they expect you to magically get over issues.  Ironically, the police who came were more aware of the flaws in the mental health care system then actually paid mental health care professionals – at least said cops acknowledged that the system was broken and apologized to me.  It’s a new level of sad when members from a goddamn police force are more self aware and kind to a WOC then the people “helping”. 

Attempt suicide?  Well, they’ll basically put you in a hold and pump your stomach then discharge you.  They will just keep your body alive, you’re still expected to “get over” any mental health issues magically and actually live.

At least when the average layman says “get over your issues”, they are open about it. Some of those laymen became more helpful then the vast majority therapists as I started to ask them how they “got over it” and it turned into them at least hugging me and offering to come help me complete tasks.  Mental health professionals, however, hid behind a “I can help you”/”sucking it up doesn’t work” lip service yet in reality, they will essentially resort to that the moment you are not an ideal client or don’t actually have anymore money."
My mom still s a major trigger. It breaks my heart.,6,mhel1s,1,"My dad was bipolar schizophrenic and went untreated until he died. My mom has some major mental hangups but as far as I know she's only been diagnosed with ptsd. My whole life I watched my dad beat her and my siblings. I admit my mom and brother had it worse. My dad had a thing to where he thought all males on earth were evil. Prob bc he was evil.

My mom was the adult and as a child I already hated her and my dad. She could escape and take us with her. As adults I was LC until my dad had a stroke that slowly took his life. My mom exoierienced major burnout towards the end. My dad begged me to be his POA. By this time he was more a child than the man I'd known. I'd long forgiven him. How could I not. He was so helpless. My mom wouldn't allow me to take over. Said I'd have to prove her unfit. I tried after she purposely allowed him to aspirate on food he wasn't allowed and she fed him. By then it was too late. 

My mom is a major trigger. I can't even think about her without getting so angry. Not only about my childhood. But the way things went with my dad. He was on his way to getting better. But she was done taking care of him. She convinced herself she did it so he could finally die. That he was suffering. I feel sick.

She's in a position to where she relies in me pretty heavy for life. Every time I have to spend even a second of time with her. I have to spend the whole day in bed. My husband just doesn't get it. Hell I don't get it. I just want to not have these feelings. Therapy isn't in the cards atm. But when it is how do I even shop around in a town as small as mine? So much stress. I wonder if I'll ever be normal. Will I ever get over any of it? Enough to live a normal life?!"
Rambling about desiring intuition and care vs mind reading. Am I alone in this?,7,mhex6x,2,"I hear people talk about how you cant expect others to read your mind and know what you want/need/are thinking.

 I feel chronically unheard and have grown out of touch with fully understanding what i need and often it's the simplest things.

What I want is for someone to intuit me for a change. Is that really in such violation of the social contract to warrant that kind of cartoonish dismissal of these feelings?

I'm all for self responsibility, but nobody sees me."
"Is it even possible to be happy with CPTSD? Like really, truly happy?",10,mhevpa,10,"I was thinking about this today. I have technically been diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression for 9 years now. I feel no closer to my happiness than I did when I first got the diagnosis. I’ve been in inpatient care, I’ve had my current therapist for 2 years, I have tried meds, lifestyle changes.... the only time I ever felt something remotely close to happiness was when I had high functioning depression, and the only reason I was high functioning was because I was powerlifting and the endorphins every few days was enough to get me there. 

I’ve been taking an honest view at my life and today I realized all the things I constantly feel just make me unhappy.... it’s just me. It’s me. I think I can admit that to myself finally. I have a good life right now, and I SHOULD be happy. But I’m not, and I hang on so tightly to all the bad that happens, even if it’s the tiniest amount of bad, and literally can’t see the good. It’s like the good doesn’t exist in my head without constantly reminding myself of it to give myself perspective. Otherwise, only the bad exists, so then the bad is all around me all the time. Because I can’t see any good. And when I can, it’s like the unhappiness looms over it so closely that I can’t feel the full impact of it.

And I don’t know how to even stop doing that. I’ve tried for almost a decade now. I’ve done everything that everyone says to do. I even had a two year run with meditation. 

I’m just starting to think that everything that happened to me when I was a kid has made it impossible for me to really truly be happy. Like my brain structure can’t support genuine happiness anymore or something. 

Does anyone else relate to this? Do I sound nuts?"
EMDR,2,mheud9,1,Has anyone had a lot of improvement through emdr? I’ve been doing it for about a year now and have seen a little improvement. I was just wondering if there is something I should do prior to my sessions like meditating or grounding work so that I can easily access my trauma? Anything helps
"Anyone else's narc abusive EX now flaunting that they are a ""born again christian"" all over socials?!? 🤦🏼‍♀️",1,mhesyb,5,"It's ludicrous to me that someone can be so physically and mentally abusive to someone for 6 years straight and then a few years later put all this ""I'm a good christian"" garbage out there"". . ..

I'm an atheist so I don't believe in any of it but I don't care about the religious stuff, just the advertisement that someone thinks this can somehow show everyone they are now not an asshat.

 it still really angered me seeing the stupid baptized photos all over instagram, that a friend let me know about who's also in shock.. I wanna scream that ""NO, that doesn't absolve you of the damage you have caused me"". You can't just go to church and tell everyone you're a good person now. It doesn't work that way. 

Narcissist till the end I guess, gotta constantly advertise that they aren't a horrible human. 🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️🤦🏼‍♀️"
I Am Still The Person I Was Before The Trauma,8,mhejfo,1,"I discovered in therapy today more about who I am. My therapist pointed out parts of my inner self I didn't even know. She said a lot of my actions have shown that I am an advocate. On a scale that I personally think is small but as she noted, can be quite impactful to others. Even if its just among my own friend group or with my family. 

I always believed that the multiple layers of trauma I have experienced took everything from me. I believed that the only thing that survived was a small part of empathy, hope, and innocence. But my passion and drive to fight for social change has survived. 

Its amazing and now I have another tool when those bad days hit. When all the flashbacks hit and my panic attacks are so bad that during my recovery from them I lose a few days. It really is true, those asshats didn't take everything!!!! For now its enough to know. That even when I can still feel their marks upon my brain and body. Many parts of me survived. 

And it helps me to realize that I am more than what has happened to me. It will always be apart of me. But the person I was before all of the abuse is also here. I'm a 2.0 version of my previous self. And I see now, that everything I did to make it to this point was worth it. For so long, I didn't think it mattered. 

I mean what was the point with experiencing so much pain. Much of which will always be with me. So yeah, I hit a huge breakthrough. The importance probably won't last when I can't sleep because of the nightmares or to fearful to even leave my room. But right now in this moment it feels pretty damn good so I'll take it."
How do i avoid getting PTSD directly after incident?,8,mhehc3,11,"Hi! I'm sorry if it makes little to no sense, but i just had something very traumatic happen to me and already have a lot of other PTSD from childhood and teenage years, i can really see this also developing into it, but i would like to prevent it, if anyone knows how to ( Specific way of thinking or more? )it would be greatly appreciated since it is night where i live and I can't call a therapist or see anyone due to lockdown.

Urgent- please help I just remembered my trauma and I don’t know how to cope (TW:CSA),10,mhea5j,7,"If you don’t want to read the trigger part only read this: I‘m remembering terrible things and the memory is very visceral. Gut wrenching, my heart is racing, I feel sick. I feel like crying. I wanna stop remembering. But my body can’t stop screaming it at me. What do I do? 

TW- here comes the bad part:
Don’t read if this triggers you! 
I think I am remembering that I was abused by my own mother. I kinda hope that it’s a „fake“ memory but there have always been signs and I always kinda thought this happened... I had kind of a moment today where suddenly really terrifying feelings came crashing over me. As if a gate had been opened and now I am convinced that it happened, that she did this and that it happened during our vacation to Austria, where I was alone with her. 
I am not ready to remember this now and I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t want to focus on it and remember more. I’m not strong enough right now."
"DAE have *cough* ""Seasonal Affective Disorder""? (SAD)",8,mhe3y5,5,"Canadian here. Spent a number of years travelling to warmer places in my 20s (probably relevant to this point actually) so I missed a few winters in Canada. I've been back ""home"" for the last 3 years, and have definitely confirmed that as soon as the snow flies and it gets colder, the fight to maintain my mental health is a daily struggle...and come Feb/March, it can be a losing battle for me (just getting through about a 2-3 week dissociation right now).

Yesterday, I was making breakfast and looking out the window at what remained of a freak, March snowstorm (about 4cm of snow). For 2 days, the temperature went from 12 degrees Celsius to -5 degrees. I looked at my weather app that was forecasting a snap recovery with temperatures of 14-17 degrees all week. I became very excited. I almost took a screenshot to send to my buddies out of excitement (which I've done in the past).

And then it hit me. SAD? Maybe. Over the past few weeks I've really been piecing together *how much I sought safety as a child by running away.* I grew up on a small acreage with a few chickens, cows, and a dog. There was a river that ran through our property with some dense trees where we had a little firepit/campsite. During the summer, I would set up a tent and sleep down by the river as often as possible. I would spend many evenings and weekends as a 10 year old, by myself, walking up and down the riverbank skipping rocks, swimming, and just hanging out. I would set up a hammock or put bedding on the trampoline and sleep outside regularly. When I became a teenager, I was able to buy an old $600 motorbike that I would rip around our little farm on almost every day after I got home from school.

I genuinely have no interest in basketball - watching or playing (didn't know this until I became an adult). But we had a hoop on our driveway that I spent enough hours on as a child to make me captain of our junior varsity team (11th grade) and a starter when our senior high school team was playing provincials (aka. ""state""). Not a flex, I still hate basketball. Don't enjoy it now, and looking back, never *ever* enjoyed playing it. I hated games. I hated practice. But I did what everyone told me to do, which included, ""Hey, you should play basketball. You're pretty good!"" Asked every year to play in the alumni tourney and every year it's a flat no from me. I'm just trying to illustrate *how much I ran away as a child just to feel safe for a few moments.* A reluctant *provincial level athlete* for shit's sake.

SAD? Maybe. Or maybe cold and the winter meant that I would be forced to stay inside most of the time where I was often screamed at or physically abused. Winter meant covert tactics like sleeping/reading in my closet and being really quiet so I wouldn't be found (at least for another 10 minutes). Winter meant doing basketball dribbling ""drills"" in the garage. Or, basically, it just meant a lot of verbal abuse, stuck inside the house all day while it's -25 outside for weeks on end.

Seriously though, am I crazy or is it possible that 50-80% of people that report having Seasonal Affective Disorder are just experiencing flashbacks from having to stay inside with their abusers all winter long? DAE?

DAE want to talk about how it *feels* when they dissociate?,14,mhdhms,16,"Hewwo.

So I know that dissociation feels differently for everybody, but I only just learned that this horrible feeling I've been experiencing for as long as I can remember is dissociation.

-I stop being able to feel my fingers and toes and my heart feels like it's stopped beating. 

-My vision doesn't get ""blurry"" but everything I'm not focusing on (""tunnel vision"") sort of ceases to exist. 
My hearing gets incredibly acute and loud/high-pitched sounds fills me with fury or terror.

-If I close my eyes my sense of proprioception is greatly distorted: feels like my arms and legs are 50 feet long and wire-thin, literally as thin as a wire. The rest of my body feels like an amorphous mass, like a dead jellyfish drifting in the water. When I open my eyes, I'm always shocked that my body is the same.

-I find it very difficult to form sentences and get really clumsy.

This feeling while dissociating is pretty specific to me, I think, but I wanted to share and see if anybody else feels something similar or wants to share how it feels for them. It feels so awful and gives me so much anxiety. Understanding *what* this feeling is has helped me greatly.

I changed my last name today.,88,mhdfig,17,"I had been meaning to do it for a while, and eventually told myself I'd put it off until my grandmother (dad's mom) died. She's still alive, but I decided to do what I wanted to do and live for me. So today it got published and became official.

Resources for dealing with hyper-vigilance?,1,mhda4f,2,"Are there any youtube videos or self help books that deal specifically with the hypervigillance side of cptsd?

im physically tense every waking moment. my muscles make crunching sounds when i massage them. the only thing that relaxes my body is cannabis (but it numbs my emotions and therefore i cant engage in therapy) - so ive quit it for now.

I read most of jonnice webb - running on empty but what i read of it didn't deal with the physical side of trauma... 

ive started yoga and that seems to offer some relief through grounding and stretching ... but only partially, not every time and only while im doing it.
The moment i stop im braced as if someone or something is about to hit me. 
Right now typing this there isnt a single muscle in my body not at 60-70% contraction.
its painful and exaughsting and thats just the physical side. The emotional dread that goes with it is unbearable.

i want to meditate and just 'chill' but i dont know how to chill... i dont think ive once chilled (not exceptionally high) in my 30years alive. id like to listen to an audio book or feel comfortable sitting or lying down doing nothing.
but im so wound up and on alert that sitting down is an activity that i purposefully have to make myself do. and its like an endurance test as it is anything but relaxing and pleasurable. 

i know why relaxing is not deemed safe by my brain due to a toxic unsafe family dynamic. and i dont feel i deserve to relax nor do i believe i am worth the effort itd take to relax myself.

but those shameful beliefs i try to challenge when i feel strong enough...... but my body... no matter how much i get onboard psychologically with the idea that i do deserve to relax and wont be punished for it... ----- my body is always totally tense and ready for a tiger to stroll into the room.
How do i let go? know any resources that could teach me? thanks."

Difficulty trusting and approaching women,16,mhcs8o,4,"17 F
Ever since I was around 4-6 years old I never felt safe around women, despite being assaulted and abused by a man in my life at the time, my mother always denied and berated me for ""lying"" and ""wanting attention you don't deserve"". Since this man that had been sexually abusing me was her close friend. Even as my energy and emotional development essentially dropped from being abuse she turned a blind eye. Other older female family members refuse to believe it too, responding in the same ""you can't lie about things like that, you could get [sexual abuser] in big trouble if you keep lying"". 
I don't know why just because of that I distrust women as a whole, I get incredibly uncomfortable when they're too close or even try striking up casual conversations with me, I want to immediately hide if one approaches me at all. I really don't know if this is normal trauma response or not.
I don't know why I distrust women when it was a man abusing me"
I setup a tent indoors last night and had a magical childhood adventure.,796,mhcqfd,72,"This whole month I've been feeding my inner child. I have been fingerpainting, drinking from silly straws, eating tacos in bed and more.

Last night I fulfilled a childhood fantasy I always had, which was to setup a tent in my house and pretend I was camping in some exotic location.

The tent barely fit in my room, but it worked! I setup the sleeping bag, air mattress and sheet. Outside I setup a speaker on a timer to play ""Forest music at night"" for 2 hours. 

I got inside the tent, the sounds started playing and instantly I was transported!! I could almost smell the forest and feel the space around me. It felt nice to be somewhere else, and the nature sounds were relaxing. I felt so free and light and young,  I was so at peace and calm :)

It's interesting because I then had a vivid nightmare about being attacked by Nazis and then killing them....a bit intense after the calmness of the tent. 

I feel this nightmare was me fighting off and killing another toxic part of my past. Each childhood thing I have done has released a part of something and I feel lighter. Not sure what comes next but I'm excited to keep releasing more and more.

Thanks for reading and being here. It's very embarassing and shameful for me to have to hide these things from co-workers and some people. Can't wait until I don't have to hide anymore."
"(trigger warning) Rant About my Codependent Ex Girlfriend, and her smear campaign (I'm autistic and have CPTSD)",1,mhcens,1,"This is all the things I wish I could tell my codependant ex gf, who triggered me intentionally through reactive abuse. Emotionally she was a very manipulative person, she's no longer in my life, and I've set many boundaries between me and her.   I have autism and CPTSD, it's hard to explain the situation, mainly I'm posting this to share my story in some form anonymously, to warn others with autism about befriending their ex's, also the hidden warning signs of codependency. It's better to disengage then continue when you see these patterns.

She is a student studying to be a social worker, and she gaslighted me pretending to be my friend for several months before meeting up for a coffee and in and initiating reactive abuse.  She played the role of a therapist, and pushed my boundaries severely. I tried to get out of it, told her i was uncomfortable talking about fixing me. She pushed and pushed until she got all of my secrets out of me, gaslighting me in person also. 

 She then emotionally abused me, telling me i wasn't living a realistic life at all, and that some people live as their disability while others actually live life being more than their disability, which was severely dehumanizing for me as an autistic adult who is a survivor and a warrior.

 I lost my temper (shouted) at her outside of the coffeehouse because of my CPTSD/autism and she later started a smear campaign against me claiming I was a stalker and possibly a violent abuser. I had to move to a different community due to harassment and death threats I received  within the community.

NO WONDER YOU'VE NEVER LEARNED TO HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. YOU'RE A MANIPULATIVE PERSON WHO LOVES TO PLAY A PRETEND THERAPIST, HOWEVER YOU CAN, AND THEN SMEAR YOUR EX'S REPUTATION. IT'S BETTER TO HAVE NO CONTACT THAN TO PLAY MIND GAMES AND TRY TO FIX SOMEONE/INITIATE REACTIVE ABUSE

I WISH YOU NEVER TRIED TO GET IN MY HEAD THE WAY YOU DID, TRYING TO FIX ME, MOLD ME, SHAPE ME, BECAUSE IT WAS CRUEL, AND HAS ACTIVATED MY TRAUMA.  IT ONLY TOOK 30 MINUTES OF YOUR ABUSE TO MESS ME UP FOR MONTHS

IT ISN'T MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BROKEN FAMILY, FROM A BROKEN HISTORY OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, RAPE, COLONIALISM, SEVERE ALCOHOLISM  ETC.   I LIVED FAR AWAY FROM THEM TO WORK ON MYSELF, AND TO BETTER MY OWN COPING SKILLS.

 YOU'RE THE OBSESSED ONE, THE ONE OBSESSED WITH FIXING ME CODEPENDENTLY, STOP BEING CODEPENDENT, IT ONLY MANIFESTS MORE SITUATIONS LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN NOW. I WANTED TO BE YOUR FRIEND ON EQUAL TERMS, I DIDN'T NEED TO BE FIXED, CODEPENDENCY TO SUCH EXTREMES IS NOT BEING NICE

IF YOU DON'T ENJOY THE EXPERIENCES THAT YOU'VE HAD, THEN FIND NEW EXPERIENCES, STOP PLACING YOURSELF IN THESE SITUATIONS, TRYING TO FORCEFULLY FIX  YOUR EX BOYFRIENDS THROUGH SHAME, MANIPULATING THEM AND THEN ENJOYING PLAYING THE VICTIM.

I got the COVID vaccine yesterday and I’m stuck in bed with a 101 degree fever, chills, and a headache. I just want my mom. She died in February and was the source of a lot of trauma due to her drug addiction and mental illnesses. Here I am crying and just wishing for someone to care for me and make me some soup. 

I feel fucking pathetic. I feel vulnerable and anxious - remembering all the times I felt alone and had to care for my mom when she was high on drugs. She once lit the arm of the couch on fire when she dipped out on heroin and I had to put it out. Must have been 10. Then she lit herself on fire and I saw all of it. I was always caring for her and trying to make sure she didn’t burn our house down. I’m lucky I even had a house no matter how bad it was...

Like I experienced something I probably can’t even remember that sent 12-year-old kid me into fight or flight mode and I haven’t come out of it until a year ago...at 27. I feel so diminished by them because everyone treats me like “it’s not that bad,” partners, friends, family...and I want to be like - then why can’t I remember more than half my life up until 2018!!

DAE hear friends complaining about their parents and think “That’s it?”,3,mhb0u7,13,"I have this friend who complains about her parents a lot. She’s a nice girl, but is sensitive as hell. She seriously complains over the dumbest things and plays it up like it’s a big deal.

She talks about how awful her life is, but her life is actually very privileged. She has a loving, financially affluent family.

Once while we were at her place, her mother was pressuring her to do the dishes. Her mother didn’t even force her or yell at her; her mom literally just asked her to do it multiple times. She threw a fit over it and got all hissy, all because her mother asked her to wash some dishes? And she was 17 when that happened. Come on. 17 is too old to be acting like that.

Another time, a different friend of mine was off ranting because her parents were ‘playing favorites’. It was Black Friday, and they were both given money to spend. Her older sister got more spending money than she did. She whined over it and said her parents were being unfair and favoring her sister who was 7 years older than her.(Maybe it’s because older kids get more responsibilities?) I told her that, and she went off at me saying that I didn’t know what it’s like to be mistreated by my own parents.

I dropped the subject, but let me tell you, I know more about abuse than she could ever know. And she’s lucky she never had to go through it.

You want to know what mistreatment looks like? Mistreatment is when my father threatens death upon me. Mistreatment is when my father tells me to kill myself, or that I’m no longer his child, just because of small things like clogging a sink. Mistreatment is when my father does these awful things to me, then acts like it’s my fault for making him angry. 

I just think it’s hard to relate when I hear my friends complaining about their parents. They haven’t been through actual abuse before."
New work supervisor and I’m not sure if I should skirt the issue or be frank about it.,2,mhabqr,4,"Back story. I had some major issues with ptsd affecting my work 1.5 years ago. Ended up on a PIP about the time I was diagnosed. Started treatment. Disclosed to my boss the basic diagnosis. Survived the PIP. Supervisor was available and helpful as needed and that really set me up for success. I’m now doing well in my roll, but definitely still deal with triggers frequently. 

That supervisor moved to a different company earlier this year. New supervisor started a couple weeks ago. They seem decent enough. 

I suspect my boss has already given them a heads up about me. But now I’m like “how do I react now if something triggers me?” 

Before, I’d just message my supervisor if I needed to take a few minutes away from my desk or take an afternoon off, etc. It didn’t happen frequently and it was never an issue. Now I feel like I have to navigate building this foundation all over again.

I’m probably overthinking this. But it’s so very frustrating to deal the uncertainty and anxiety around navigating a new work relationship while dealing with ptsd."
Just: Thank You,84,mh9r26,7,"Thank you to all those who have made such positive contributions to this sub. I’ve been lurking for weeks and have learned and healed so much. Just from reading your postings and the compassionate responses. 

I’ve been in therapy for decades, have had more autoimmune and mental illness diagnoses than I’d care to admit, but I think it all boils down to early trauma and CPTSD. 

What really brought it home for me was when my mother dropped off something three weeks ago. After she left, I literally vomited. My blood pressure was 210/90, which is not good, even for someone with high blood pressure.

"Coping with the feeling of being ""in trouble""",17,mh9ir0,7,"I'm 40 years old; I've done quite a lot of healing; I'm on a medication combo that works well for me; I've found several grounding exercises and meditations that work pretty well for me. But all my life, knowing that someone is upset with me, or that I've done something that will be criticized or that I may face slightly unpleasant consequences for - being ""in trouble"" - leaves me with paralyzing anxiety. I know the psychology of why, and it doesn't help a bit. The grounding exercises barely help. There have been times when I've run away from problems making them a thousand times worse than if I had just dealt with them right away (you'd think I'd learn from that right?).

Today, I need to face up to a situation that I KNOW rationally really isn't that bad. I KNOW that I have the skills to handle it. I know that if I calmly explain things, I actually won't even have any unpleasant consequences because it's largely a misunderstanding. But right now, my avoidance is kicking in fiercely. 

Guess I'm just writing this all out in the hopes that it makes my brain see how silly it's being so that I can get past this. I've worked way way way too hard over the past two years to start running from my problems again, so I know I have no choice but to sit down and tend to this even if my body is telling me it's dangerous."
The amount of dismissal my mom uses on a daily basis,2,mh9i3u,2,"Tw: for firearms.

My mom tried to normalize gunshots in the city. 

My apartment complex has gone downhill since Covid, and apparently the area I live in has been going down in the past five years. I’ve lived next to drug dealers so I know any of these units may be shady af. Safe now and I only have a few more weeks before I move.

The other night I woke up to two gunshots. They were at a distance but close enough for me to role out of the bed and retreat into my bathroom in case a fire fight broke out. Luckily it was just the two.

I was telling my mom this and she just kept saying oh it’s normal!!! People just have guns and fire off round into the air for the joy of it.

It’s normal but not ok on New Years. It’s normal in the country (target shooting). It’s not normal where I live on a random Sunday night.

She normalizes it because her precious son committed so many threats of gun violence against us that she’s delusional.

At this point in my recovery it just makes me laugh and I can call her out. But it also just makes me sad for how much gaslighting my teenage self endured. Very glad I don’t live with her and that I am moving.

I know I shouldn’t compare but a part of my trauma is being told by everyone around me that I didn’t go through anything

"Does CPTSD have to come from household violence/abuse only or do outside abuses such as bullying also play a role? Can it come from a ""later"" life trauma (age 9-18) or does it have to be early childhood (age 0-8)?",9,mh8c5y,17,"The more and more I read about trauma, the more I realise what my life has been the past 10.. hell all my 20 years of life, and the more convinced I am I have this.

The one thing I'll ask though is does it have to come from parents only? I was emotionally neglected by both of my parents in crucial years of development such as around puberty and teenage years (I don't particularly remember before age 10 so I can't say for sure), mom was an alcoholic and had her own problems and forgot about me, dad forgot about me as well, of course with a job which I can definitely excuse but he also spent like 6 hours on the TV instead of looking after me, I've witnessed a lot of domestic violence all my life and quite frequently - breaking, yelling, dad crushing his head on the wall, wall and doors breaking, smashing objects, etc (which I've also read that someone witnessing it is just as bad as being the object of violence), and I've also been chronically bullied from middle school all the way to the end of high school, on and off for like 7 years.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, I'll talk to my therapist about it, but can a combination of these three things \[neglect, constantly witnessing violence in a toxic dysfunctional household and being under stress, and bullying\] culminate CPTSD?

I remember being left completely alone in a hopeless scenario - inside the house I was witnessing violence and I couldn't reach out for help, outside the house I was getting bullied and I've believed the world is a horrible place all this time, I've lived in hell all my teenage years.

And I wanted to ask about flashbacks.

I was walking outside and noticed broken dishes and I froze up, disassociated if you will. It reminded me of a time when my father broke dishes and shit.

I freeze up when someone's laughing cuz I think they are laughing about me and that they will bully me.

I was eating mashed potatoes and it reminded me of a time when my parents were arguing and my father picked up the pot of mashed potatoes and angrily threw it, there were lots of scenarios like this.

I always wanna cry when I remember and I always remember the way I felt. Would these be flashbacks?

I don't remember when the domestic violence was happening, I asked my mom and she said it has definitely been happening ever since I was born, so that's (at least 10) potentially 20 years of witnessing it, 7 years of bullying, and like 5-6 years of emotional neglect.

&#x200B;

Thank you.

**TL;DR:** Witnessing domestic violence for at least 10, potentially 20 years, emotionally neglected for 5-6 years, bullied for 7. Main question is can bullying lead to CPTSD?"
How do I tell my mom that I failed? What do I tell everyone else? How do I begin?,1,mh7dep,3,"TW: Family trauma, abuse, insomnia, social anxiety, may make you paranoid, suicidal ideation

\[ I'm sorry for the word vomit in advance. I just typed whatever is going inside my head so, somethings may not make sense. \]

I haven't told my mom about how I failed a big project which will equal my class grades. Haven't replied to my teacher either because I don't know what to say. I don't understand much either but I guess because this project stresses me the most and that it will be expose to many that it triggers my fear of failure and getting beaten for that failure. It's irrational, I know, and I accepted that at one point. But when I did, my mind clicked his tongue, and presented me with flashbacks instead. And that worked. I know I'm safe but it's still fucking me up inside. I'm still a scared little girl in the end. I'm still scared to sleep at night because I don't know where our abuser is, and I'm scared he might come. Or someone else might come. Our balcony can be climbed, and windows can shatter even if we lock our doors and gates.

I still wear my earphones even though one of my ears are aching from it, because I couldn't take the noise. I feel protected at least even a bit mentally with them. At least, it can possibly distract me from the ringing screaming, shouting, crying, and whipping in my head. I'm still scared of people because they said they are evil people out there. And if we're not staying away from someone who beats us, how evil could they be? Like that man in the ending of ""To My Sister""? Or that mafia boss in ""Banana Fish""? Worse than that? And what do I do with this fear of failure if their fists, belts, and words are not far from reach?

It's all irrational but the reason isn't. And if its grounding and roots are not irrational as the fear that stands and chases after me, doesn't that after all mean there could be some truth in what's been plaguing me all my life? And how exactly do I discern the truth? How would I know what's the lie in it better than when I believed that some of my family could change? If I can't discern what's in front of me, how can I know what's inside me that I can't see but only feel? And I don't know much about feelings? Heck, it took me so many years to know about anger, fear, and sadness, and still ongoing with the different types of love. So, how do I know? Where do I even begin to tell anyone about this?

What do I tell my teacher who said she won't hesitate to call the authorities if she figures about any toxic home environment, even when it's over? What do I tell my mother who is already struggling in work and having lost someone precious to her recently? Who do I turn to? It's not like someone would randomly rescue me from this situation, and solve my problems for me. I'd rather not. I really want to solve them myself and I honestly don't want any more people to get involved but I don't know if I can do it alone. I'm lost. I really did my best and I'm still trying to, and I'm trying to do my best to keep myself together from being done with it all. I don't know what to do anymore."
I hate myself for getting triggered with a lot. I feel like I give my boyfriend a headache,1,mh6aqv,4,"I can't tell if my triggers are triggers or valid to be upset about.  But I expressed to my bf that I didn't agree with the way he talked to a coworker and he expressed that this took him by surprise and hes been quiet via text all morning. He was assertive over a decision at work and borderline condescending to his coworker and that triggered me I guess.


We don't live together but will live a lot closer soon. I'm worried I annoy him with all my shit and now that I'm moving closer, what if he's doubting our relationship?"
Bruce lipton/psych k,3,mh6ao1,1,Have you guys heard about subconcious release technique and programming the subconcious mind with beliefs. is that some bs pseudoscience or what is your thoughts on that?
DAE get desensitized to things that bother others?,6,mh622g,4,"Abused by my father, an abusive ex that forced me out of the closet, and raped by my classmate. I’ve been through quite a bit of abuse, and nothing else really bothers me anymore.

This guy in my university made some misogynist jokes about abortion on social media. He got expelled from university and everyone hated him completely. Were his jokes appropriate? No. But are they worth expelling over? I don’t think so. People were SO angry at him. There were many people who spoke out on social media expressing disgust. I didn’t approve of his jokes, but I wasn’t that offended over it. As a female myself, I didn’t think it was that bad. Meanwhile, my girlfriends were all fuming angry.

Another time; in high school, we were discussing racism against Mexican people. There was a Mexican student in our class named Simon. Teacher turned to Simon and said “Simon, since you’re Mexican yourself, you should explain to the class what your opinion is on racist stereotypes”. In the moment, everyone was too scared to say anything, and I myself didn’t think much of it. When I told my friends about it later on, their jaws all dropped. They were in shock. I didn’t get why they were so surprised at first. When I told other people about it, the same reaction. Once again, everyone else was upset over it while I couldn’t see what was so bad.

A third story: There were these two girls in my friend group, named Lily and Wendy. Lily was trash talking Wendy, and she was kicked out of the friend group pretty swiftly. Like damn, teen girls talk trash all the time. I didn’t get why it was so terrible in their eyes. All my other friends unfollowed her. Lily went from being one of our best buds to being out of the group, just because she said some mean stuff behind Wendy’s back. Everyone was talking to Wendy and supporting her unconditionally(myself included). It was kind of a big deal, and I didn’t understand why. I still talk to Lily sometimes, we’re still on good terms. The rest of my friends don’t speak with her anymore.

To others, all three of those stories were shocking and messed up. To me, it was nothing. After the abuse I’ve been through, those things were more entertaining than anything else. It was pretty interesting to watch the drama unfold.

Is that weird?"
"I understand 100% why being aware of what's going on with your own body and mind is necessary for recovery, but why is it so goddamn draining?",38,mh5xr9,16,"I am so used to dissociating through life that it comes more naturally to me than being present. I have started to try and break that ""habit"" with mindfulness and all those kinds of techniques, but I can't be fully ""in the moment"" for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Afterwards I'm often exhausted. 

Feeling and recognizing what's happening inside of me takes all my attention. I can't do it on the fly. Is that normal? I feel like this kind of stuff is supposed to start taking less effort over time (I mean how else do other people get through life without dissociating all the time), but it doesn't. There has been progress for sure and it has improved my life, but I feel like I'm already hitting my ceiling and it's just not enough to be functional."
"Help with trauma, ADHD & crippling executive functioning",14,mh5grb,13,"Hi all

**TLDR is at the bottom, I'm sorry for this extremely long and unplanned post. I'm looking for support and advice for my situation.**

&#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a while but I figured I'd write up a post else I'd end up going down a rabbit hole binging solutions and threads. I've read hundreds of threads, tons of books, every video on Youtube, there isn't anymore information I can hoard so a curated post for my needs seemed like a better option and I'm hoping you beautiful souls can help me out.

VERY condensed background: 28 y/o male, CPTSD (childhood trauma, near-death experiences, heavily medicated child and teen due to health issues, two alchalcoholicolic parents, one dying, one wanting to die, and other stuff); diagnosed ADHD 18 months ago (although questionable given all the research I've done).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm extremely ambitious and have lots of goals and dreams in life, but dealing with executive dysfunction is fucking with my mind (which I've worked extremely hard to heal). And I think it's only JUST hit me how hard executive functioning problems have impacted my life. 

I've achieved a lot by ruthlessly fighting my way through life. The last 12 months during lockdown I've pretty much turned my entire life around from almost ending it to getting a university scholarship, tripling my salary, getting into the field I always wanted to and building an entire productivity system, all whilst working on healing my mind with psychedelics, meditation, diet etc. Tried Vyvanse but I completely lost my memory and it freaked me out so I was forced to stop (Concerta was even worse).

This is only the tip of the iceberg. I've done a LOT of work. Alone. All whilst living in the same house and with the same abusive alcoholic parent (who herself is extremely traumatised). I've done things that people would deem impossible/insane. I don't even know how I'm alive if I'm honest.

Whats kept me going, is me. I found worth in myself. And I refuse to die without slaying this life despite my challenges. I have a lot of talent. A lot of fucking grit. A lot of potential. Cultivating that within myself has taken years but I'm here and I want to absolutely take this life and do as much with it as I can.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I can't rationalise how I'm able to do such things. Maybe it is ADHD? Who knows. All I know is, I now know what I'm capable of and I'm trying to leverage this to succeed.

**The problem? Realizing just how much executive functioning is impacting my ability to do this. And therefore, to actualise myself.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I now realise that what once was self-doubt, immobalised by ""procrastination"" is the result of a traumatised mind and brain that is constantly in fight/flight and neurologically different, whether that be CPSTD, ADHD or both.

What I've used to overcome the executive functioning challenges so far has been using my adversity and pain as fuel and truth seeking and seeing what life and society are about. Using my knowledge and past, I was able to induce fear/worry about my mortality and lack of time to fuel urgency around the shortness of life to shock my brain into change whilst in lockdown. I didn't want to go back to that old life and I didn't know at the time but, I always need something to do. So in lockdown, I had all the time in the world (as my brain perceived it) to change my life. And it was the best thing I could think of to do during lockdown.

But this has come at huge costs - further traumatising my brain with fear, sacrifices like being completely socially isolated even digitally (I've had almost no loving or safe human contact for most of my life, never been in a real relationship), crippling anxiety about breaking the ""routine"" I've managed to build for myself when lockdown ends (I don't want it to, I operate best alone and inside with all the executive functioning deficits), overworking and doing too much everyday but also feeling the need to cause when I don't I feel COMPLETELY lost and paralysed by not knowing what to do, even if its something as simple as eat food. Theres a lot more but I wanna get to the point...

&#x200B;

Now, I'm trying to make huge life decisions. Or at least commitments. I'm basically on this planet alone. With no one to help me. No family. No nothing. And so, I've got to do all this by myself. I've come to accept my past (although therapy is needed but time and money are things I gotta work towards getting to do this). I've come to accept my life will never be ""normal"". I've come to accept so many things that were very hard pills to swallow. I've come to accept, I will never be able to fit into society. Not just from a neurological standpoint, but also, a psychological one too. I think and see the world differently.

&#x200B;

The one thing I can't accept, is my brain holding me back from what I know I can do to create a life that works for me. Objectively, removing emotion and feeling from my knowing - my brain is holding me back. Despite all the knowledge, strategies and the rest, it's fucking with me everyday. And thats messing with my mind because I HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE. I know whats going on. It makes it worse. And thats manifesting into apathy, depression, lack of motivation, and honestly? Suicidal ideation.

The thought of having to live my life, waking up everyday dealing with feeling held back, is killing me more than being alive some days. After everything I've been through, I deserve to have a good, successful, peaceful (and hopefully happy) life. I want to travel, I want to create things, I want to be independent.

But I'm sat here wondering, how on earth I can make any of this happen knowing that pretty much everything I do is impacted by my brain. It's soul crushing, terrifying, anxiety-inducing, and probably making the executive functioning worse, ontop of the depression. It's a vicious cycle.

I've been working remotely so my colleagues think shit is fine but the absolute insanity that goes on behind the scenes (the meltdowns, the crying, the burnout, the overworking) is what people don’t see and... yeah. It’s insane to be inside a body you feel is completely against you. That’s how it’s feels every minute of every day right now.

I'm working towards using my story to help others. Two life goals I have are travel (and nomadic working) and achieving financial freedom so I can get the external help (therapy, assistant, treatment) I need to thrive and leave all the pain, suffering and challenges behind me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The key to everything I want to do? My brain. My mind too but I've been working on that for years (and part of me wanting to do all this work on my brain is so I can continue doing that work).**

The biggest problem I have right now is feeling paralyzed by planning and my brain immobilising me using fear to not do the things I know I can and should do. This subsequently plays with my mind. I literally go into freeze because I realise that, 1, I have to even do the coping strategies to operate and 2, making the right decisions daily that will benefit me, not only to survive but to work towards success, feels very hard when in reality, I KNOW what I need to do. But spending hours hyperfocused on details and the exhaustion of doing things adds to that fear. 

I sit here, trying to figure out what to do, yet ironically, there's a million things I want and need to do. Its such a goddamn paradox and it hurts cause I lose more TIME to deciding and picking/breaking down things, instead of just getting on with it and having time for myself, which I rarely ever do. And this is all with having zero social life, zero obligations and still not being able to fully look after myself (tidying etc). My brain is costing me more time than I've already lost in life.

&#x200B;

I've taken this week off work. Its the first time in over 18 months I've stopped with nothing planned. And it's REALLY hit me how even with ""freedom""/downtime, I can't relax and I'm kind of terrified by having nothing planned that isn't working. My life before I got diagnosed was literally me doing nothing but surviving and I never want to go back to that. 

I have time this week for me, to do what I want and need to do, yet I feel completely lost and don't know where to start/what to do when I have so much to do. Realising how paralysing it is to always be ""on"" and have NOTHING planned.

&#x200B;

I can't describe it, its like an invisible wall, and I spend hours everyday planning and replanning my day. It destroys me. To be a fully independent as a person, I HAVE to be able to do things and look after myself. For much of my life, what I did was dictated by other people (work, family etc). I wonder if life will ever get better or if this is worth it. I don't care to even fit into the system of society. I want to create my own system to live in this world. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I need to master my brain so I can get things done. I've woken up half way into this week off work and realised I need to master executive functioning in a way that works for me so I can eventually work for myself and create a life that works for me. And that means money, time and treatment.**

I refuse to let this brain and my past hold me back. But living life this rigid to survive is killing my ambitions cause I can't see how with freeze/flight cycles of CPTSD/ADHD dominating my life.

I have the to do lists, I have the planners, I have the timers, I have the music playlists, I have the exercise, meditation and diet (rocky but consistent enough), I have exhausted almost every single strategy you can think of. I think at this point, I need to get to the root and treat the brain itself.

I have a list of things I identified I still need help with optimising. If anyone has any pointers for me on any of the following, and maybe even in the context of my specific situation, it would be a godsend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Executive Function & Productivity Stuff*** ***(if anyone has a system they use, it would be incredible to adopt and try out)***

\- How to plan without being paralysed/freezing and anxiety due to not knowing how long things will take (ways to overcome this cause I've become scared doing what i love and want to do from fear of fucking up, overdoing it, not having the time to finish it which impacts task initiation)

\- How to see past NOW/TODAY and realise there is the future to do things (e.g. I can do some of the things I want to do in the future and understanding that exists, I don't have to cram it all into one day/right now)

\- How to not spend 4 HOURS planning my week (too long)

\- How to not spend days, weeks and even MONTHS making a single decision (its crippling)

\- How to efficiently plan goals & dreams that have multiple steps (travelling, health etc)

\- Setting my own mini-deadlines (timers have worked but they do so less as the brain gets used to it)

\- Not excessively doing things due to time blindness (i.e. researching trauma without intent for 4 hours and spending an hour writing this thread)

\- Sequencing tasks so I do them in order (I get things done but its all over the place)

\- Sensory overload (I think this might be another condition though)

\- Estimating how long things take & prioritising tasks (this is halting my dreams)

\- Filtering out irrelevant data that isn't necessary to my intention (I always end up taking way longer to do things instead of just doing the thing, maybe hyperfocused related)

\- Batching tasks (this has worked in the past but picking the right thing is so key)

\- Testing out different routines and schedules to see what works for me (I'm very much a night owl but the older I get, the less energy I have)

\- Tips with processing/learning issues (inc reading, writing, I find it hard to learn new things and apply them, e.g. music I tested myself with, its like I'm hearing another language even though I understand the basics, still doesn't register well)

\- Planning for flexibility (a change in schedule completely throws me off into anxiety at this point)

\- How to induce internal accountability when you're alone (this was my circumstances in the past, but I think my brain has gotten used to it and cant be tricked anymore)

\- What kinds of outsourcing has helped others? (an assistant? a specific type of coach?)

&#x200B;

***Executive Function & Trauma (CPTSD/ADHD) Stuff***

\- Can executive dysfunction be reversed with treatments or medications? (apart from ADHD meds) 

\- Have you experienced using MDMA, Ketamine etc to heal and has that restored functioning? 

\- Learning to trust myself and teaching my brain that I'm safe?

\- Kinds of treatments should I start off exploring? EMDR? Somatic? IFS?

\- How have you managed to become independent and/or successful with the brain challenges?

&#x200B;

**TLDR: I need to master my brain so I can get things done. I've woken up half way into this week off work and realised I need to master executive functioning in a way that works for me so I can create a life that works for me and allows me to achieve my dreams and goals. The list above is stuff I need some pointers on. I need any and all the advice/help I can get.**

&#x200B;

**I realise this was very long. Sorry. (This is part of the problem, I overdo it with everything). I'm only 18 months into this journey of knowing about trauma and ADHD etc. I don't have a lot of time to research as I'm dealing with health and personal circumstances that make it hard to find time I need to research deeply. I'm EXTREMELY grateful if you read and can help me in anyway. Truly. I can't put it into words. Thank you so so much. I hope to be in a position of giving back one day.**"
My therapist is awesome!!,118,mh59wo,22,"I was kinda riding the struggle bus last night, and sent a message to my therapist. This is what I woke up to this morning lol. Formatted exactly as I received it.

How do you validate your own trauma?,27,mh4o1p,12,I just got my diagnosis a little ago and it feels weird. I feel like whenever i see other peoples trauma i find so much more reason for them to be struggling. I still feel like i am overreacting. Like i just make too big of a deal out of the things that happened to me. My siblings who where there with me throughout the experience dont seem to be carrying it around with them all that much and my friends who i share a traumatic experience with (all except for one) seem to have moved on and not be affected all that much. I know i am suffering. But i keep asking myself whether i just need to get my shit together and not be acting like it was that terrible. But i also know i would not have gotten the diagnosis if it wasn't serious and when i tell a professional they immediately recognize it as complex trauma. How have you guys dealt with overcoming that insecurity? What helped you to learn to validate your struggles?
DAE want to stay in state of deep chill far away from people?,1010,mh4niw,144,"I just want to lie in bed, in a cute cabin in a forrest with a beautiful lake view, watching funny videos, not having to talk to any humans or do any adulting. I just want to exist and feel a nice breeze and smell of the forrest, surrounded by couple of friendly deers, occasionally go and play board games with my far away neighbours. Is this so much to ask? Does anyone else feel the same?"
Lateral looking,35,mh4ihd,8,"Huge progress for me just using an exercise. 
I looked again at Vagus Nerve theory and that Dorsal Vagal would be related to my struggles. So freeze, shutdown and dissociation, social anxiety. Hyper vigilance. Other crap.
So I found an exercise that caused good shifts, on YouTube, an exercise where you hold your head straight ahead, just helping by cradling your head with your hands behind your head, then looking to the right or left for at least 30 seconds, until you have a shift, like a sigh or a yawn then you can look ahead again. And I believe this is what vagal toning is. Strengthening it. 

I’ve felt a lot better. Been more capable and present socially. I do it throughout the day, even if talking to someone I might subtly move my eyes around to different directions just to combat that freezing. 

On that subject video games, tv and phone scrolling especially seems to be activities that narrow that eye movement and cause that stress response hyper focus vigilance. Always glad to find something that helps with recovery and hope it will help others"
Re-traumatising myself,17,mh4b4v,8,"I want to keep it vague to avoid triggering anyone but I sometimes engage in behaviour that would retraumatize me, for example social media stalking. Does anyone have any insight as to why I would do this and how to understand how detrimental this is for my healing?"
My therapist said my brain works the same as the military veterans she treats,139,mh40e8,18,"She said I disconnect/ignore emotional stuff and am fully functional to complete tasks that need to get done.  I also go towards danger and accept physical pain if I have a reason to.  

Pretty interesting.  Hahaha. I have no military experience.  Just childhood torture.  The punishments I endured in childhood are classified as torture by our government, and the military actually trains special forces how to handle these things in case they are captured."
"Trauma just keeps compounding, sometimes indefinitely",5,mh3ypd,2,"I am lucky in that I've had an opportunity to break away and stop the cycle and heal. But some people aren't so lucky. I'm thinking about a couple I know from a meetup group. They are both deeply traumatized, they wear it on their sleeves, and their lives just get harder and harder.

For instance, the guy likes to be big and scary, intimidating people unnecessarily and then, of course, will deny that was his intent. But the thing is that his behavior has consequences. During the pandemic, he was let go from his job. That caused him and his now wife to lose their health insurance. Then they got into a car accident and had to figure out how to pay by themselves.

Lack of friends, unstable job, higher health risk. Trauma piled on top of trauma for them. I feel sorry for them. The thing is there's nothing I can do for them. Until someone has started healing, until they have asked for help, you can't just say ""Hey, have you considered the possibility that you have loads of unprocessed childhood trauma? Have you considered that you might be highly codependent?""

No, you can't ask people those things because they'll blow up. Their defenses are still in place. So I, and others, just kind of stand back and watch their train wreck unfold. And it hurts because I used to be in their shoes. I used to have no friends and bounce from job to job. I know they need to hit rock bottom and then ask for help before they are ready. Until then, their trauma will just compound in on itself."
DAE experience massive overwhelm from any academic assignment?,144,mh3v8p,63,"I have a few deadlines coming up shortly, but whenever I have to sit down to write, my freeze response kicks in, and I'm unable to put anything down on paper. Having a clear structure helps to some degree, but my brain seems to be quite aware of the difference between making some notes just for myself and actually producing something for others to see and this is where the self-doubt becomes unbearable and any structure or argumentative line I've had in mind before just fades away 🙁  


Would love to know I'm not alone in this and maybe get some tips on how to work through it, any help is appreciated 😞"
They call me strong. But they have never seen the side of me (TW: multiple),9,mh3e1b,6,"The side of me having a major meltdown and went hysterical. 

The side of me that's desperate for justification. Why am I the way that I am? Why did I deserve the treatment (abuse)? 

The side of me having flashbacks during bed time. They haunt me and I have to fight so hard to be able to fall asleep. 

The side of me that's constantly exhausted and have no will or motivation in life. 

The side of me that feel worthless, undeserving and unloved. 

The side of me hoping to numb all these feelings by taking drugs/alcohol. But because I don't, so they hit me so hard and real. 

The side of me that has no clue about my true self. Is it the stable, functioning mask I put on? Or am I just made up by a bunch of self defense mechanism? 

The side of me that splits when someone changes tone, or use a wrong choice of word.

The side of me that has suicidal thought.

The side of me that's constantly in fear, hypervigilant, and on high alert. 

They see me having a good life. Have a job, a house, a car, being high-functioning and productive. 

So they call me strong after knowing what I went through. Told me not to look back and start a new life.

But they will never see the other side of me, because I hide it so well. I isolate myself during episodes. How would they ever know? It's almost impossible for me to show vulnerability."
Breaking up with my abusive boyfriend,2,mh2lji,3,"For the past two years I’ve been with a man. He told me what to say, how to say it, when to say it. We fought physically. He blamed me. He told me I was shitty and worthless and crazy etc. 

I told him to do the dishes, he told me he was going out with friends, I got mad. He said “I’m shooting an arrow down the hall” as a “joke”. I was like “you’re gonna shoot me like you shot your mother?” (Suicide attempt gone wrong. She’s fine). He got mad and smashed my computer. I got mad and pushed him. Eventually we’re on the ground and he punches me in the face and I have a black eye (cliche). He left a note today after I told him I signed a lease that says “I’ll see you on the other side”. I freak out and go to his mom. She starts screaming her ex husbands name and being all crazy. I freak out and leave. I call the cops, but lie and change my story because if they saw the bruise and the note said “I know we fought”...  

His grandma calls me and is like “he’s fine but don’t break up with him”. He shows back up and he tells me how he should have appreciated me and how I’m great and the love of his life and blah blah. 

Fuck I’m so tired of this. I’m a mental health worker for Christ sake. This is literally textbook abuse. (No advice only validation pls)"
I guess I had a breakthrough?,13,mh22cr,2,"So,  if you've seen any of my comments - I realized about a year ago (right before I turned 39), that I probably need therapy to heal & move on from my childhood.  And also, I realized: I don't have to allow my parents:  to hurt me.  To be in my life.  To be in my kids' lives.  To hurt my kids.  To judge me.  To dictate to me.  To shut me down. To take space in my head.  To pull me or distract me from things that I find important.  

As I'm doubly blessed to have *TWO* narc parents /s, I'm sure you can imagine how that went.  

It sent my mom into a frenzy because I wouldn't meet her for my 39th birthday.  It's been threats of police,  text messages asking how therapy is going with laughing emojis after & a surprise visit on *her* birthday - when she knew (or thought,  at least), that my husband & I wouldn't be home.  *AND*, for an *added* bonus,  blaming our no contact on covid - not her behavior.  

My dad,  for my 39th, threw a card on the table, said happy birthday & made a snide comment about my wanting space (in my kitchen).  And couldn't understand why a card that starts ""who loves you"" and ends with something along the lines of ""we all feel that way sometimes""  wasn't appropriate after my declaration of not wanting to celebrate,  needing space & needing to heal from my childhood.  It ended with a lot of yelling and a period of no talking.  

So,  February was my 40th. A lot of emotion was tied to this one.  The *original* plan was to go to Mardi Gras. My mom *loves* New Orleans & has visited multiple times.  Once, with me.  So,  of course,  she had invited herself along for the birthday trip, when it was still a few years out.  Well,  with no contact,  and with Covid,  that trip didn't happen for anyone.  And,  I was off for my actual birthday & had a short week for the following few days.  My husband had said that he wanted to plan a gathering,  but I realized that all the people he was talking about inviting were *his* friends.   So,  I cited Covid & said that sounds great for *his* 40th. 

Being in this sub,  I'm assuming there's probably a few others like me,  with *ZERO* healthy coping mechanisms. Watching my parents,  I saw both turn to drugs & alcohol for escape when there were problems.  Or birthdays.  Or Fridays.  Or Tuesdays"
DAE feel way too attached to some small event?,3,mh1qsn,11,"My trauma comes from a few places, I've been working on identifying them recently. I've also been trying to listen to my feelings instead of just pushing them down when I think they're ""wrong"" and I've hit one I don't really understand. 

When I was young, maybe around 4-7, I brought a small stuffed bear to the fair. It was one of my favorite toys, when I was a kid I carried toys all the time. Well I lost it at the fair and it was heartbreaking, my parents even helped me look but no luck. The thing I don't understand is I'm still sad about this years later. Sometimes it hurts just as much as it did that day, to the point where I get choked up talking about it. I'm 22 years old. I've felt the emotional repercussions of this for years and I'm still shaking them off and I just can't understand why. As an example, I get this stress and deep sadness when anyone shares that they have a precious comfort object, because some part of me is positive they'll lose it. 

In terms of my confusion, there's the obvious ""it's just a toy"". Second, I wasn't treated poorly, my parents helped look for it and my mom took me to different stores to try and find a new one without my even asking. 

I want to make clear that this is by no means my biggest problem, it's just the most confusing one that is also very persistent. 

Does anyone else have any experiences like this, some small thing you can't let go of? Why do you think it's still bothering you (or me)?"
"Even you have accepted that you shouldn't have been born,what to do when you tell this to your parent and he agrees?",44,mh1bqx,29,"I have been crying for two days now,I can't focus on anything.
We had another huge fight and  gaslighting session but this time I blurted out everything I had in mind.
I told him if you aren't stable enough and have hated my mother you shouldn't have got married and had me and he bluntly agrees and says yes I shouldn't have.
It just shook my core,even though I have accepted it for a long time hearing it from them is just too heartbreaking.
I cried the whole day and drank so much at night I thought i was going to die.
On top of that I also told him that I'm sorry that such an emotional child was born in a house where emotions are not appreciated and he replies
Yeah you're so right.

What's the point of all the work and progress I thought I had been making when now I feel like an absolute waste of space.i am so close to ending everything."
Is it okay to live with your abusers?,3,mh0ytt,8,"Say my father abused me my whole life, if he is decent and normal now even if I feel uncomfortable around him, is it bad for my health and mental health to stay with them?"
"Everytime someone has the slightest go at me for doing some ""wrong"" I just get furious and defensive.",3,mh0qi3,2,"And I can't tell if my fury is justified and the other person is just being a petty asshole, or if I'm overreacting???

"DAE feel terrible for letting comparatively minor trauma effect them this badly? I feel like my abuse wasn't ""bad enough"" for my issues to be so severe and I take away from people who had it worse.",3,mh0dvz,9,"I (28m) was recently diagnosed when I had a bit of a breakthrough with my therapist. We had been getting  to the reason for some of the issues I have and I casually mentioned a time where my 8 year older brother dragged me around the house until it ripped my underwear off. My therapist kind of honed in amd asked me about other things he did growing up. I told her about the hitting, the threats of violence if I told, the physical intimidation into giving up pokemon cards or video games, the times he would force me to plastic sword fight when I didn't want to and he would hit me hard enough to bruise, etc. and she asked me if I knew I had been abused. It took me aback because I thought it was normal sibling stuff and she just told me it was abuse. Then I talked about how he would hold me down covered in a tightly wrapped blanket for a long time as I begged him to let me out, had a flashback of it, and cried over zoom.

Long story short she said I was abused and may have c-ptsd. I have a lot of trauma from my brother but part of my brain thinks of it as ""normal"" older sibling stuff and that it wasn't ""bad enough"" to really be abuse. I know that what he did is abusive and my partner has been supportive, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm blowing it out of proportion. 

Has anyone else had similar issues with accepting a diagnosis or that they were abused? Has anyone else dealt with sibling abuse? Am I weak for letting what is comparatively minor trauma affect me so much? I just feel like I'm spinning and don't know if this was abuse or normal sibling stuff that went a bit to far. I would really appreciate some input because now I'm wondering how much of all my symptoms stem from unresolved trauma relating to this.

Tl;dr At the age of 28 I realized that my 36 year old brother was very abusive growing up and my therapist thinks I have c-ptsd from it. Has anyone else had trouble accepting that they were abused and that it created a lot of problems later in life?"
Intermittent affection,4,mh0cjk,4,"I don't know what this is, but have you feel like certain person 's affection fluctuates randomly? That you don't know if they will overprotect you someday like you aren't a functioning adult and next they forget about your existence (implying they care about others more)?

I never experienced this before, other people in my life seems pretty stable (with moods, but they just don't forget about me).

Making you guessing what you did wrong this time, going crazy about that and anxious? But when you confront the person they make you feel guilty of asking? 

Is everyone like that??? Am I crazy? People that loves me all the time are lying to me?"
Adjusting to life with CPTSD,6,mh0ai3,3,"CW: alcoholism, reference to attacking “threats”, thought of suicide, I think that’s all

I’ve adjusted to life with cptsd for the first time. It’s weird. 

I have realized a number of things since I got stopped drinking and started focusing on my CPTSD:

- I have had CPTSD for a very long time and I didn’t know.

- I used to visit doctors all of the time with unexplainable conditions. I have extensive chronic pain. They said it’s trauma- related.

- I only drank to escape feelings, so I always drank to black out. I didn’t want reality. Reality is hard, and I’m having to feel the feelings I have been running from since I was young.

- I have experienced so much gaslighting for so long about my condition from manipulators and abusers, I was in denial about CPTSD, just believing I was “crazy”.

-  I have noticed that i now internalize everything and constantly people please. When I used to drink, it was to avoid negative emotions, thoughts, or feelings. When drinking, the desire to people please (edited for clarity)/ caring what others think were both gone, explosive anger surfaces, and impulsivity is at the max.

- the self- hate I constantly felt was CPTSD and not having a positive self- image whatsoever. I don’t even know who I am sometimes. I don’t know how to explain it. I feel lost.

- I worry about leaving my home, or when my husband goes out. Thinking the entire world is incredibly dangerous, and used to drink to be able to feel “okay” outside of my home. Since quarantine and adjusting, I never want to leave my home again. I can’t even watch the news without panicking, which makes me paranoid sometimes.

- I avoid anything that makes me think or feel a negative emotion. I have to work with a man that is not kind, but pretends to be. He’s been aggressive with me in texts, I’ve had my husband double check them, making sure I wasn’t taking something too harshly. He’s a trigger. I hate working with him, I avoid him at all costs, but he’s unavoidable. Situations where I feel trapped, like my current work and school situation, are too much for me. I feel unsafe, and as if people don’t like me. I never say anything, I just internalize it. Disliking myself more and more. I used to drink to be able to deal with people/ places/ things that triggered me to make it easier to deal with. The social anxiety alone is too much. I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere, I feel very different than everyone else. 

- I like to be at home with my animals and/ or husband. I don’t like people staying at my home, it makes me anxious, I realized it’s because I feel unsafe (edited for clarity) with people in my home. I’m content. I have extreme social anxiety. I only have a few people I have let in, and I don’t even tell them everything. I don’t trust people. While I want to have a child, I worry about them being out in the world. The world is just violent to me. I fear they will deal with violence and trauma.

- I have a lot of broken relationships. I push people away when they try to get close, friends and partners. I attracted friends with the behaviors of my abusers. Toxic and nasty people that I would stay around, not realizing my self- worth at all. They would do horrible things to me, and I would just let it slide. I’d trust people and they would slight me, and I couldn’t handle it. The toxicity issue has occurred especially with potential partners in the past. And I have had a couple of long term partners (years each), and they all treated me poorly. My husband held out when I wanted to be alone for a while. And I’m glad. I was definitely dating iterations of my abusers for years and years. He isn’t like them at all, he is nice, caring, understanding, etc. Feels weird to be married to someone that treats me well. I constantly worry that the toxic people that I have broken relationships with are going to harm me. I don’t know why. I also have damaged relationship with other people, mostly all alcohol- fueled, to be honest. But I do. 

- I have a detachment from my emotions sometime. I numb out and disassociate frequently, or feel things too intensely. Not emotional outbursts. Just up and down sometimes.

- I have thoughts of wanting to die or to not be alive frequently. I don’t have plans, I don’t attempt, I just have overwhelming shame and guilt. I always feel badly for everything I’ve ever done in my past, the things I can remember and the things I cannot. I think of a broken relationship and feel shame and emotional flashbacks, not even remembering what occurred to break to break the relationship, but flashing back to a feeling from another time. It was always in the midst of an awful episode, though. I haven’t broken relationships while in recovery, but I also don’t have episodes very frequently anymore. When I do, it’s just like the world is too much, or I am in intense fight/ flight mode.

-  i have been told that my CPTSD is severe by multiple mental healthcare professionals.

- I don’t want to do anything that I’m doing in my life. I have sought to people please for so long, I never asked myself what I wanted. By the time I did, I was at explosion level. I don’t know what I want to do, but I know I don’t want to do this.

- I have emotional flashbacks, but don’t know where from. I don’t have many flashbacks to my trauma anymore. But I have emotional flashbacks frequently. I used to have reoccurring dreams of things my therapist said I blocked out. I don’t know how I feel about this still. It doesn’t feel real. Most things don’t feel real and feel surreal.

Did I mentioned I hate myself? I’m told this is normal. I still don’t have much self- worth, clearly.


——

When I would drink, I would drink to black out. Every time. No matter the day of the week or responsibilities. I couldn’t cope with the world or stressors of the world. I would drink to escape.

My behaviors:

- I would bottle everything up from people pleasing, etc. and then explode when drinking. I saw drinking as “an emotional release”. The emotional regulation was very different. My husband could look me in the eyes, and tell I wasn’t there. It’s like all of my trauma would come out in rage. Sometime, engaging in violence with people that I deemed to be a threat to friends I was with or myself. While sober or even just not drunk, I would never in a million years. When drunk, my manifested rage would explode all over everyone around me. My therapist said I was acting out the anger of my (edited for clarity) traumatic youth and adulthood.

- I used to have to lie to cover- up what was happening at home. I don’t recall ever really lying before that. I also recall being told a lot of lies about myself and others when I was young by my abusers. In adulthood when blackout drunk on my meds, I would lie. I wouldn’t remember it. But my husband used to tell me that I did. I guess to cover- up that I was having an alcohol- induced CPTSD episode, put the distraction elsewhere on some other issue? I’m not sure. I don’t really lie otherwise. But apparently I really believed what I was saying. I don’t remember anything, some of the stories I’ve been told about myself when drinking are honestly shocking. They would be in the midst of a traumatic trigger or high stress situation (where I felt trapped), it would be multi- day bender, sometimes going on/ off for weeks, while also on my CPTSD med cocktail. My psychiatrist and therapist both said that this is what happens when drinking at the levels I was on medications. I couldn’t figure out why I told these lies. I was so confused, I was sure I had a misdiagnosed, and thought they were delusions. But the therapist and psychiatrist both said that they weren’t, and they’re a part of having an episode. I’ve broken so many relationships through this. With alcohol, the episodes of drunken erratic behavior would go on for days, sometimes for a week, with a break, and then another week. I don’t remember almost anything I did during those episodes.

I don’t drink anymore. It’s been a longtime. But it’s weird to remember these things, and to have constant emotional flashbacks to them. 

I don’t know why I wrote this. Maybe because I just wanted to talk to someone about how I felt about all of this, (edited for clarity) because no one I know understand. I understand myself so much more. I wish I would have figured this all out a long time ago. I people pleased myself into mental health crisis, reacted to my emotions for a long time, my emotional regulation was not great before, then I began bottling and exploding when drunk. But I wish I knew how to manage it all before now. Life is really hard. But I’m sort of making it through. Should be asleep. Everyday is a long day and is so draining. I don’t have energy for anything. I hate it. Did I mention extreme insomnia? Because that, too."
Does your brain freak out this badly and just stop working around people?,29,mgzyjo,6,"Cross-posted to /r/BPD, since I think it could be relevant to either

Sometimes during social situations, especially if I'm caught off guard, it's literally like my brain doesn't work. The world around me feels like it's closing in, or like I'm floating away, and my brain is falling to pieces. My brain can feel a million miles away, I'm not even processing what's in front of me for the most part thanks to overwhelm and dissociation I guess. Half of my brain is in a distant place trying to escape the anxiety, overwhelm, discomfort and pain, and the other half is fighting like hell trying to bring me back down to earth so I'm at least halfway present.

I literally, functionally, feel almost like a 5 year-old in that moment. Because I can't just think and talk like a normal person in their 20s. My brain stops working, the fear and anxious thoughts I'm having magnify and the parts of my brain that actually think about anything else are just gone. I don't look around at the world around me and have thoughts like I might when I'm alone or less anxious - 90% of my brain functioning is going toward anxiety, anxious thoughts about myself and what I look like or what the people around me are thinking, and trying to fight the anxiety. If you asked me to think about something that took much deep thinking or a little bit of intelligence, I either could barely do it or straight up couldn't, depending how bad things are. Or my brain goes wild, tears everything into a million little pieces and goes a million miles an hour trying to analyze everything. 

Sometimes I end up just giving up, give in to the dissociation and spend the whole time just trying to be what I think the other person wants me to be (I think that's probably kind of ""fawning""). For a few years a while back I thought it was getting a little better, but I think that's just because I was avoiding a lot. Kind of trying to figure out whether CPTSD/PDs/anxiety alone can cause this or not. I'm still not 100% sure if I'm autistic, have BPD or another PD, or both, + CPTSD.)


Does anyone else experience things this severe, or is this probably not just CPTSD/PDs?"
It’s not my fault,45,mgzwyv,3,"I’m not the one who failed them. They’re the ones who failed me. They should’ve kept me safe and treated me right, not make me feel not good enough or worthless. I am *not* worthless. I still don’t completely love myself, but that’s okay. Progress takes time. And I’m not okay, at all. But that’s okay, because having feelings is valid. And I can cut myself a break, I’ve been through a lot. It’s okay to feel sad and cry. I am not a bad person for not loving them. So yes, I think I will report them

How do I work out what I need after a breakdown?,6,mgzqi9,2,"Cw: incest, CSA, eating disorders, intrusive suicidal thoughts

I'm doing a law degree and last week's lecture on Thursday was about sexual offences. And it specifically included a discussion on the defence of coercion for incest. 

I could feel myself getting overwhelmed, with the feeling of a lump in my throat. But I just kept pushing forward since I had an online test to complete.

Unfortunately I didn't fully communicate all this to my partner and later in the night he made a sexual advance which I was unexpectedly triggered by. I tried to escape and accidentally hurt him in the process which of course made me feel so much worse. I could see it all happening in the third person.

I ended up just sitting on the floor hitting my head against the door and briefly screaming. I can't even believe I'm typing this. But I've been dissociating and repressing it all for 8 years so now it's like I'm feeling what I should have felt in the first place.

My partner and I calmed each other down and talked it out. I emailed my psychologist. I organised an appointment with the university counselling service but it won't be until mid next month.

I haven't done any course work since Friday and I keep trying to do my study schedule so I know what I need to work on but my brain is just defaulting to avoidance.

I don't know if I should try to force my way through to just do the course work, or take some time out. The anxiety just keeps screaming at me to do the course work but I don't know if I can handle it right now. And university doesn't have any accountability which I've struggled with before. I barely passed my first degree. I've been getting high marks for law at least.

Healing is so up and down.

Are there any specific things I should be doing to take care of myself? I'm also in recovery for an eating disorder so I'm not using food to dissociate. I've been eating okay and sleeping okay, but barely showering. I got myself some shiny new weights yesterday as shopping therapy because I've found that lifting kinda grounds me. 

I don't know. Maybe I just need to give myself permission to rest. But I'm stuck in that mindset of self-neglect where even though I'm not doing the course work I'm still pushing myself mentally. I've started having intrusive thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore as a burden and I am frightened of them.

I had my usual appointment with my psychologist yesterday and we just sort of discussed it in general.

I've been trying to meditate with body awareness, and doing grounding exercises. I don't know how much it's helping.

So that's where I'm unsure. I ask myself what I need and all I get is a want to go to sleep in the middle of the day. Are there any particular self-care behaviours that work well?"
"Trauma coming to a head. [Physical, emotional, infidelity]",1,mgzlej,4,"I am a 31 year old stay at home father of two young children and have been married for over 10 years. It feels lately like everything is coming to a head and I am drowning. I started having brain fog, joint pain, and other weird things in October that are possibly related to having Covid in June. To treat it my doctor decided to put me on an ssri, and upped my dose at the end of December. After the dose was upped i started acting progressively more and more crazy. It started getting bad when my wife and I let my best friend sleep in our bed with us after we had a couple friends over and their was nowhere else comfortable to sleep. After laying down I picked up on sexual tension between the two of them, got turned on and wound up having sex with my wife while he was in the bed and both of us kissed him (we were all very drunk). I asked my wife the next day what the fuck was going on and found out she had an affair with him for years stopping shortly before the conception of our first child. I knew about two instances of infidelity (making out) that i caught her doing while at parties, one with my prior best friend, one with a stranger. Throughout the next two weeks I slowly broke down, had dissociative episodes, one in which i scratched my wrist to bleeding without knowing, and one in which i punched holes in the wall and talked of suicide. The next day I went to the hospital and they determined i had serotonin syndrome due to the meds.

This has triggered abandonment issues worrying that my wife was leaving me, which has been triggering flashbacks of childhood trauma. I keep having this one set of flashbacks when i was 12 where my dad beat me (he had a belt studded with his name in raised steel lettering he liked to use because it left his name in bruises), and I threatened to call the police/cps. He told me to do it and see how i liked foster care where i would be abused even worse. I told him someone else would take me in, that my grandma and grandpa that I was really close to would. He said no they wouldn't. Then the flashback jumps to the next day whenever I was alone with my grandma and told her what had happened, showed her the bruises, and asked her for hep, asked if they would take me in. She told me that my parents love me very much and are doing their best, and she will not come between us or get involved at all. That is where the flashback ends, and usually at this point I am shaking uncontrollably. The prevalence of this has caused me to think more of my childhood trauma and has gone on to trigger more flashbacks about my childhood, and flashbacks about finding out about the original infidelity. On top of that I am having nightmares about the two of them together that keep me from sleeping. 

This has cost me that best friend, my next closest friend has since gone to jail and is facing 2-10 years in prison, and i don't really have any other friends. My emotions are a mess and bouncing all over the place, and I need to talk through this shit with my wife regularly, which is making it hard for my wife to keep up with work and gradschool. I have been waiting to get into talk therapy for like 6 weeks now but still haven't gotten there yet. My back pain is now worse than it has been since i had surgery 9 years ago, our finances are shit...and yet somehow most days still feel like good days other than short episodes. I feel overwhelmed to the point i feel like i can't handle it most of the time."

Yesterday, i saw pics of someone's LO and i was sad because i didnt click my LO's pics in same way.(i wasnt sure at that time but my husband wasnt much interested)

My husband thinks that im choosing things to be upset, im upset because i want to. I sad because im a negative person. 

Im not sure now, am i feeling all this only to play victim?

5 years of Survival,8,mgyx7g,2,"TW: Sexual Violence and Suicide 




So background, when I was 18 I did a gap year program and on the last day with the group a man in our group who was my friend waited until I was shit faced, manipulated me to let him stay at my hostel, and raped me in my bed. And throughout all of 18 I was being repeatedly assaulted by different men in different situations. 

As a lot of you know, you just aren’t the same after. For me my mental health went to absolute shit to the point where I had to drop out of college and couldn’t hold down a steady job. Because of these many challenges I attempted to kill myself 3 times, once in 2016 and twice in 2018. I call myself a survivor because living in the aftermath of rape was nearly deadly for me. The amount of shame I felt was so unbearable, death sounded better. 

After my third attempt, my parents and I began to realize I needed real help. In the summer of 2018 I went to a partial hospitalization program in Portland, OR for a month and then a residential treatment program for 45 days to finally get a handle on my PTSD and MDD. DBT therapy and medication completely changed the game. 

Fast forward less than a year later, I lived out one of my biggest dreams to celebrate my journey in recovery and I hiked 2,650 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. I didn’t get to graduate college like all the rest of my friends and peers, but I got to say that I walked from Canada to Mexico, which made me feel accomplished in another way. 

On this trip I did get revictimized. It’s going to sound fucked up, but it almost felt like a test in some way from the universe. One thing I remember telling myself during treatment was that I could never be assaulted again or I would not be able to handle it, and probably die. But then it happened again, and while obviously it was scary and confusing, I was able to handle it. Instead of keeping it a secret and letting myself live with it alone, I told my aunt and let myself ball my eyes out instead of living in denial and being numb. I let myself feel my pain. I let myself know it wasn’t my fault this happened again. And I was able to use the coping skills I learned in treatment. I had to get off of the trail because I was scared of seeing him again, but the next day I walked out with my backpack on and head held high and somehow hiked all the way to the border of Mexico. 

This has been a long ass journey that has felt like at least a decade, but I’m proud that I’m alive today, regardless of the horrible things in my past. I take three different psychiatric meds every morning to stay stable, and sometimes it feels like  a reminder of my past. I think to myself “I’m taking this hand full of pills because of what men did to me” But I’m just happy to be alive. Even these past few months I had detailed plans of attempting again, but I was again able to use my skills from therapy to make it through. 

So let’s celebrate! I have survived 5 years!"
I called my dad out over his abuse over text two weeks before my birthday and he never replied,3,mgydxy,3,"TW mentions of abuse, no explicit details but yeah. 

Actually, that’s partially a lie. After thanksgiving passed, he had messaged me and one other phone number in a group text asking what the “plans for christmas were”. I replied with “you’re a piece of shit”. That other person must have been so confused, I’m almost intrigued to know what excuse my dad told them. But at the same time, I know if I heard what he probably told them, I would probably be crushed. Anyway, it’s been almost 6 months now. I said I didn’t want to talk if he wasn’t willing to have a hard honest look at his life and an honest conversation about the abuse he inflicted on myself, my mom, and my sister. He didn’t say a single word. No sorry. No faked confusion.  Nothing. His girlfriend didn’t even reach out to me. So she just accepted his reason for no longer talking to his daughter and followed his lead? Not totally unfathomable. I did it for years and years growing up. Always thinking he was my savior from my mentally unstable mother, without ever realizing she was the way she was because of severe mental, emotional, and financial abuse. Peppered in with some physical and sexual. He did the same to all of us...and he has to know it. Narcissists still know what they’re doing is wrong, right? I was his only blood child. He loved me so much when I was young and moldable. Before I knew better. And that father has been gone for a long time. He never existed, is the worst part honestly. I had it in my head he was a good dad. Until I didn’t, and no matter what I did I couldn’t continue to fake this relationship with him that’s rooted in...a false sense of myself. I can’t be an authentic person around him, that person is stupid and doesn’t know what she’s talking about. I couldn’t pretend anymore. And I lost my dad. Well....he lost me. I gained my freedom. But it still hurts, a lot."
"Problem with ""angering""",16,mgxx42,7,"I'm a big fan of Pete Walker's work, but I get hung up on his advice to meet your Inner Critic with anger and self-defense.

Working on feelings of loneliness from mom and dad next week with therapist. I feel sad already,2,mgx7t9,2,
How do you open up to another person about what you've been through when it's just so much?,2,mgx0dd,2," 

Hello kind people,

I’m a little nervous to post on here, but I wanted a spot to voice a question that I’d love to hear some different thoughts on. Let me start by saying, I’ve been doing a lot of work on myself with a therapist over the past couple of years, and I’ve made a lot of progress. I feel like I can (almost) trust her, which is a huge success for me. She is the only one who has joined my life after the traumatic events I’ve been through that I've told about those traumatic events. I have a few friends that I’ve known for years at this point but that I’ve never told about any of the traumatic things. I’m going to talk to my therapist about this topic also, but I wanted to get some of your thoughts because I’ve seen how kind and helpful this community is, so here goes: I feel like I’m at a point where I want to take ownership of my story and choose a select few people in my life to let in. But now that I feel more ready, I just don’t understand how.

My story is kind of insane (which I know is true for many of us here), but without getting into too many details, basically the trauma I’ve been through started taking place after one specific event (my mom passing away suddenly when I was eleven), and then there was a horrible domino effect of trauma that followed (narcissistic and neglectful family, chronic injury, abusive school staff, among other things). I’d say from ages eleven to eighteen I was dealing with a constant bevy of varying traumas. A lot of people in my life know that my mom has passed away and that I’m dealing with a chronic injury that sometimes needs accommodations, but beyond that I haven’t mentioned anything else, and I honestly don’t know how to. In my brain it feels like it all needs to be said in one serious conversation that’s going to take an entire night. But I don’t know how to bring it up, how to phrase it, or how to keep from boring the other person since talking about my personal trauma feels like a one-sided thing to talk about. I also have a really difficult time talking about anything serious and often undercut my own problems with humor, so I just don’t know how to have a conversation like this without going full-on self-deprecating and depressing.  I’m also very fortunate because even though I deal with ptsd-related symptoms, I’m generally high-functioning and appear to my peers as though I’m put together and doing well (I’m especially fortunate financially after finding out about an inheritance that my mom’s side of the family had successfully hidden from me and my immediate family for several years). I feel a lot of guilt with that inheritance, especially when others around me are struggling and have to work so much harder than I do to earn money, and a lot of the time I feel like the fact that I’m currently blessed financially should eradicate any issues I’ve had previously in my life. I fear that when I talk about the things I’ve been through I’ll come across as just complaining. I also start to minimize my own experiences and think “oh it wasn’t that much, you’re really just complaining because you’re not strong enough to deal with life”. I also do want to be conscientious to the fact that living through this pandemic has been difficult for everyone, and for many of my friends it’s been a lot more stressful than it has been for me (both financially and also because not many people are accustomed to plans falling through and their lives changing drastically overnight). I don’t want to bog anyone down with my crap when they’re already trying their best to get through their own crap - if I do talk about things I’ve been through I want to make sure I leave them space to talk about anything they want, or at least make sure they know that I am open to talking about anything, and I don’t know how to do that either. I’m also just not sure how to even mention my trauma at all since it was so many different events that all added up - do I mention one specific trauma and go in depth on it? Do I list the traumas off like a bullet list? I also don’t want anybody to treat me differently than they do now, which is one of the things that scares me about opening up.  

Tl;dr: Basically, I feel that I am at a place where I can handle telling some of my closer friends about some of the trauma that I’ve been through, but I don’t know how to bring it up or talk about it since it's just so much.  

Sorry for a long and rambley post, and thank you guys in advance, even just for reading! :)  I appreciate anybody's input on this post regardless of if they have advice or not, but I'm especially curious if anyone has any success stories of how they shared their traumatic experiences with another human being?"
"If a 12 yr old & 50 yr old have a sexual relationship (verbal only), is that trauma?",8,mgwtqm,6,"Please help. For years I've let myself ignore this, and told myself it wasn't a big deal at all, and it didn't affect me. But I'm having weird feelings I can't really describe, and I'm wondering if this potential situation is even worth brining up with my therapist.

I'm in my 20s now, but I grew up in a very abusive home. Like a lot of younger people, I found solace and companionship with people, with strangers, on the internet. When I was 12, I began talking to a man in his late 50s. We talked every day for over 5 years. He was the first person I ever said ""I love you"" to, and for a long time I felt he was the only person who really understood me and knew the real me. Slowly but surely he turned the conversation more sexual. Until eventually I seriously considered moving in with him, marrying him, starting a life with him. He would ask personal questions and make uncomfortable comments related to sex and development. He would insinuate and...I don't want to say ""brainwash,"" but he made me seriously believe that sex and a future with him and only him was the only future in store for me. I never told anyone in my family about him, but this relationship with him was my entire life for many years. He was the only person I told very personal things about my traumatic and abusive upbringing. 

There was no touching or physical sexual interaction, which makes me think this wasn't a big deal. Please help. What do you think?"
My ex-bestie keeps using my therapist as if she is our friendship counselor,10,mgvr22,5,"Last fall my friend sent an essay long letter addressed to me to my therapist instead of me. It resulted in an entire session feeling hijacked and an overall awkward situation where I felt ambushed, undermined, and intruded upon. While we definitely needed to address the things she'd talked of in her letter, I still felt that going through my therapist is entirely inappropriate and that she please never do that again. 

Flash forward to February 1st. She comes at me out of the blue about how I'm a bad friend who doesn't reach out and always makes the conversation about me and my problems. To be fair, I'm sure it has felt that way in the past year. I've been going through intensive recovery for CPTSD, anxiety disorder, depression, and an eating disorder. The recovery causes me to relive trauma from childhood, to which there is a lot. I've needed a ton of support and for friends to kinda just sit with me while I recall the sadness. It always seemed to make her uncomfortable, so of course I withdrew somewhat. Anyway, it all bursts that day and I said a lot of things but I mean, i felt like a broken record at that point. I'd even offered that different relationships are for different purposes in our lives, perhaps her purpose is not to be someone I talk to about the struggle, and that's really really ok. But she said her therapist suggested we take a break and so she was going to do so. I was just waiting for her to come round, you know?

I took her off my social media because I was reeling enough over it that I didn't need her at the top of my feed every day as a constant reminder. I guess she took that as, don't talk to me. Because next thing I know she's emailing my therapist again, today. 

My therapist seems flustered and frustrated as well. I feel beyond violated. She says im the email (my therapist read some to me) that she doesn't feel comfortable reaching out to my partner or friends where I live because she doesn't know them but there are older friends she could have reached out to and it's not as if I blocked her on my phone or Gmail.

I'm just confused. Am I crazy or is this like..pretty messed up? What do I do? It feels petty? She also said her therapist suggested she contact my therapist again. That feels unreal to me? Like, either a bad therapist or something she's making up. 

I am they/them btw. Thanks for any advice."
Feeling guilty about being loved,6,mgvht8,3,"I originally posted this in an OCD sub but I think you guys might be able to relate better...

TW: suicidal ideation, self-hatred

My OCD and trauma history are very intertwined. A lot of my intrusive thoughts revolve around hating myself, feeling worthless, deserving abuse, and most of all wanting to die. A lot of my compulsions revolve around making myself seem a little less worthless.

I have a long-term partner who is wonderful, and despite the fact that I treat him well, I feel incredibly guilty about being in a relationship with him. It just feels really wrong of me to let someone plan their future with me in it when I don't want a future at all. I am not actively suicidal, I'm fairly confident that I won't ever commit suicide despite really not being into this whole ""living"" thing, but it still feels like I'm wasting my partner's time. He has a bright future ahead of him and I don't believe that I do. He has a will to live and all I have is an aversion to making my mother bury me. He knows about my traumas and PTSD, he knows about my battle with OCD, he has seen me at my worst and he still chooses to be with me. Despite this, I feel like he deserves better than me. Someone who wants to be here.

I guess I'm venting. I welcome solidarity, support, suggestions. Thanks for reading."
"Being Percieved by others triggers me, what do I do?",47,mgv8uv,13,"Whether I'm in the same room as someone, or they're in the house with me, even if they're out of the house but I'm imagining them judge me for whatever it is... I get triggered and knock out dissociate on the spot. 

I get it, I'm emotionally numb, but still functioning. This would protect me from others *cough* parents *cough*. 

I wanna know how to overcome this response. I feel myself use the False Self projection (?) --- that customer service voice 💁‍♀️. I hate this defense, even tho I know how it's protected me. I'd rather be my frank self with others. 

I'm coming out of a family of long standing abuse, so it's extremely difficult for me to feel At Ease near others. I can, and have been improving, but have a hard time trusting people won't suddenly hurt me, sabotage me, humiliate me, etc. 💔

“sToP aLwAyS lOoKiNg FoR tHe NeGaTiVe In ThInGs” and similar forms of toxic positivity drive me absolutely insane.,347,mgv5t0,47,"“you just have to stop always looking for the negative in things.”

“you’re taking everything too personal, it’s not that deep.”

“just give people a chance.”

“i’m sure it wasn’t that bad, just be grateful it wasn’t worse.”

“you’ll be much happier if you just forgive and forget.”

“have you tried___? i’m sure if you really put in effort, it would help.”



okay sure, maybe sometimes they really mean well and are really trying to help in the only way they know how. maybe these are said with good intentions and they’re just trying to be supportive. but i don’t think people realize how seriously ignorant they sound when they say something like this to people with a history of trauma. do you just not get it? like is it a problem of not understanding? do you need someone to explain what trauma does to the brain? or do you just not fucking care? because what this translates to, to me at least, is “just stop complaining already.”

it’s just frustrating because if you really cared about ME as a person, you’d let me heal on my own time without making me feel like i’m even more of a burden with comments like that. you’d be compassionate toward my struggles with myself and my past even when it’s not convenient for you. i don’t expect anyone to constantly be patient with me or to coddle me. i understand that caring for or being close to someone like me at times can be... intense. i’m not even understanding or patient toward myself 100% of the time. i don’t expect anyone to be a saint. but i have these walls up around me for a reason. i get defensive easily for a reason. i have trust issues for a reason. i obsess over my boundaries and independence for a reason. my behavior is the way it is FOR A REASON. and until i’m completely healed from all of this (which could take many, many years if it happens at all) i’ll still have moments where everything gets to be too much and i have a bad day or even a meltdown. even when i’m considered really far along in my treatment and have made miles and miles of progress, i could still have a bad day. and that’s okay, i’m allowed to show symptoms of this disorder that i’ve been diagnosed with, and so are the people who haven’t officially been diagnosed but are still struggling.

i just wish people would think about what their “innocent” comments sound like, especially considering they’re usually completely unwarranted. my struggles can’t be fixed with a positive attitude and just “letting it go.” and if i wanted everything i’m feeling to be invalidated by “loved ones” and “well-intentioned people,” then i really wouldn’t have had as bad of a childhood to begin with, and we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation."
Bone conduction headphones,49,mgv0vc,7,"I hike alone a lot. It’s part of my process and since I started going out into the woods with only myself for company I’ve made some real progress.

I often listen to audiobooks, podcasts, or music while I’m out there. Sometimes I just want to be alone with nature, but sometimes I want to distract myself with something. I used to use AirPod pros for headphones. I’d put one side in and leave the other open so I could hear any animals or people who come up behind me.

As I’m sure you all can understand, I don’t like having anything sneak up on me. Even with one side open I was often startled by other hikers. Even though I would quickly assess that I’m safe, the autonomic nervous system would still start up and I’d get panicky. It kept happening to the extent that I started checking behind me every ~30 seconds. Hiking became stressful rather than beneficial.

For Christmas my husband got me a pair of bone conduction headphones. The brand I have is called AfterShockz and they’re fantastic, but there are other options and I’m not trying to shill. They sit just in front of your ears and use vibration to conduct sound. Ambient noises easily override any sound coming from the headphones so since getting them I haven’t been startled once.

They don’t work well in city type environments because the noise from cars drowns out whatever I’m listening to, but they’re life-changing for hiking. I highly recommend for anyone with an overactive ANS."
Not sure if it is CPSTD or something else,4,mguzh4,9,Does anyone here with CPTSD experience hypersexuality? I am wondering if this is something even worth mentioning to my psychiatrist.
There were no hoofprints in the snow.,2,mguumy,2,"There was a little girl who loved horses. It's all she ever dreamed of, a horse of her own. She might have been 8 one snowy Christmas day, when she was told that she got a horse for Christmas, all she had to do was open the curtains and she could see for herself. 

Did she open them? Not immediately, no. She did know better and wasn't trusting of the source due to their sense of humor and that tricks like this had been played before.  (She did really want to open them tho, she did really want that horse).

Her Dad finally convinced her to open them, those crushed green velvet curtains, and lo and behold, there was no horse. She remembered that the snow was unblemished because she did intensely search it with her eyes just in case the horse may have moved off to the side.  Her Dad thought it was the funniest joke ever.  She spent the day as you would expect.

Later on friends of the family allowed her to ride their horse and she saved and bought a used Crosby close contact jumping saddle. It was $300.

When she finished riding each time, she would put the saddle on the hood of the John Deere riding lawnmower at home, to protect the tree. 

Her brother didn't like this. Without warning, he took the saddle and put it behind the tire of the family car.   Her mother got into the car, and when resistance was felt against the tire, acceleration was used.  This folded one flap of the saddle like a piece of paper, creased right in half and shredded the leather across the cantle.  As luck would have it, she lovingly cared for that saddle prior to this, and oiled and cleaned it dutifully. This prevented the flap leather from cracking in half. 

It took her about 5 years to find someone willing to attempt to fix the leather across the cantle. The job ended up being crude but there was no other way, and her beloved saddle was whole again. 

Her brother was not reprimanded because she was told, while she sobbed, that she should not have left her saddle on the hood of the lawnmower because this is what can happen. 

Not one of us can know what secrets are held in the hearts of others, that they are too ashamed to talk about because they believe these things happened because they let their guard down and let others know their vulnerabilities.  Or simply, that perhaps they deserved it. 

Try not to be so quick to judge their quirks and failings because they are trying as hard as they can, they were just not given the same starter pack as you.  

Due to their life, they've learned to read people like a book as a way of personal protection. You might say they're sensitive they might correctly say it's survival. 

One of their quirks is that to their true friends they are very loyal. 

This ends today's PSA.  If you made it this far, here's some eye bleach and have a wonderful day.

TL;DR the unvarnished me, because I'm changing meds and unfortunately I have no choice but to feel again while I clear one type before I can go on the other type and hope they work better at ridding me of emotions.  My anxiety is currently at DefCon 1.

Edit: omg I used too instead of to and that was understandably causing a high level of anxiety.  

Also, I wrote this because I have nowhere to go with the anxiety and maybe internet strangers are more my family than my family.  Who knows, but I gotta ask... do you give horses to people for Christmas?"
Struggling and don’t know where to go,1,mgus18,4,"I (27F) am struggling with a current situation triggering past sexual trauma. 
Just over a year ago I had a short (2 month) fling with someone from work (we will call him an Ex for the sake of clarity) I had hesitations because of the work affiliation but agreed to give it a shot. We work at a fairly large call center and it isn’t uncommon to see relationships start there. There were difficulties with respecting boundaries from the get go and I decided it was better for me to part ways. I had just finished EMDR therapy and was still trying to find my footing and I felt he was counter productive to me healing from childhood abuse. 

We went into lock down and thankfully working from home and I have not had contact with him since. I have now found a relationship that I feel is quite healthy and I am incredibly proud of!  

A few days ago a mutual friend, that knows both my bf and I, was apart of a team building exercise at work with the ex and he confronted her about my relationship. He provided details about our sexual interactions and made accusations that I was a cheater, and a liar. He is under the impression I began flirting with this new guy while the fling was happening when there was actually about 6 months between the two. The mutual friend shared this information with both my bf and I and now I’m terrified that my bf will view me differently (he says not the case but I can’t get my brain to believe it). 

At this point, I am struggling to ground myself and am having major symptom flare ups that have been well controlled for awhile now. The physical sensations and feeling “unclean” is overwhelming. I know I am safe but I can’t help feeling violated still. I have the ex blocked on everything I can think of and don’t wish to confront him at all. I just don’t know how to negate the fears, shame, and ultimately all the symptoms that go along with it. Any help or advice is appreciated."
"""Reparenting to Heal the Wounded Inner-Child."" Very insightful and inspiring.",3,mguntd,1,
"DAE have a hard time finding their ""people""?",177,mgukik,36,"I always hear stories about people who work on projects together or build things together, whether it be a website, a podcast, a music recording, etc.  Where are the people who want to do these things?  How do you find them?

I don't think I've ever met anyone who was moving in the same direction as me, mentally or spiritually.  I don't think I've ever had anyone genuinely encouraging in my life before who wanted to build things or create things together.  I've never met anyone who shares my excitement or curiosity.  Any time I have any sort of goal or idea, I'm met with either direct opposition or complete apathy.  Family, friends, colleagues, it doesn't matter.  I can't figure out why these are the only sorts of people I attract, or who stick around.  Even my current boyfriend can't be bothered to work on a simple project with me.  Everything I do or make only comes to fruition when its made completely or entirely alone.  

I'm in my mid-30's now and I'm on the cusp of no longer looking for ""my people,"" because every encounter with others has left me more lonely than before I reached out, even in groups where one would expect to find like-minded people.  Fortunately or unfortunately, I've found far greater comfort in the presence of my own company.

Still, ""two-heads-are-better-than-one"" and all that.  It would just be nice to find people to bounce ideas off of or collaborate with, but I've largely given up.  I feel like I'm probably going to become a hermit at some point, but maybe that's okay."
Why are my symptoms getting worse when I’m trying to get better? Please help,3,mgujby,11,"I’m getting therapy for years and now my life only began to be a *little* more stable, and now all these traumatic core wound and pain are coming up and I’m processing them and my symptoms are the worst I’ve ever had in years. I’m learning a lot on how traumas are affecting me and trying my best to rewire my brain to a healthier way. However the amount of emotional pain I’m in is unbearable. The past haunts me. I always feel like my body is stuck back 10 years ago, I feel like I’m right there, with my abusive family. The flashbacks are relentless. I feel all these painful, negative emotions everyday coming out of nowhere. I can’t sleep. I can barely function. I kinda lose faith in therapy. Unlike general anxiety or depression, there’s structure for therapy with CBT, my therapist says trauma is organic and she’s going for that “go with the flow” thing, which I don’t really know if there’s actual a goal or an end or if I’m ACTUALLY getting better? I feel like I’m getting worse!!! And going crazy! This is relentless!! This is torture!!

I can only see my therapist every fortnight but that’s not enough for my symptom. I’m a migrant living alone and I don’t have a sense of community or much human interactions. All these people having Easter holiday with the family is triggering me so badly. If only I can get that warmth. I’m running on empty. 

The scary thing is there is so little I can do to change my current situation and it’s gonna be this shitty for a long time. I’m gonna have CPTSD symptoms for years to be realistic. And same with my economic situation. I don’t wanna do this anymore. I am losing hope. I have put 150% effort everyday to get by and just to survive and it’s so tiring. Most people can be lazy and stay afloat where my life is a daily struggle. And it’s all these traumatic memories and feelings I cannot shake off. I can be sitting on a desk and suddenly the flashbacks pull me in another dimension. They just visit me daily. I can’t do this anymore. 

I need a CPTSD buddy I can talk to. It’s so difficult. At least I wanna know I’m not going crazy. I feel like most people can’t understand me. Help!"
"At 22, I have started to accept that I am a lesbian",142,mguj3s,20,"I knew I wasn't straight when I was 13. I learned about being queer from a girl I was hospitalized with and instantly knew that I was not straight. For 9 years I identified as bisexual.

My father sexually abused me as a child, up until I was 15. And then I cut contact and never spoke to him again. At 16, I had my first serious relationship with an 18 year old boy and have had a running 7 years of nonstop abusive relationships with men.

I have never been attracted to men. I was only trying to replace my father. And now I am beginning to accept that I am a lesbian.

For being openly queer for the entirety of my formative years, it is surprisingly difficult to accept that I am a lesbian. I would have never thought I would be the last person to have trouble accepting this, but no longer will I try to force myself to be a feminine bisexual. I am an androgynous lesbian. I always have been. No longer will I try to change who I am. I refuse to continue living my life for male attention."
Progress!,31,mgubjn,3,"So, yesterday I was taking a hit from my pipe and wasn't paying attention to where the lighter was. I singed my thumb a little and I started going down the downward spiral of my inner critic beating myself up as usual. Then I stopped myself. I told myself *It's ok. You didn't deserve that. You just weren't paying attention.* And that's was it. I'm so proud of myself! Here's to breaking the cycle!!"
Can't stop eavesdropping.,2,mguaa3,1,"So I've always been an eavesdropper, which has in my childhood led to me overhearing things I shouldn'tve (in particular, that's how I found out Santa wasn't real, and somewhat more traumatically I remember my mom calling me too needy). Nowadays I am TERRIFIED of my roommates complaining about me or making fun of me.

Whenever I'm alone and my roommates are hanging out I'll overhear a laugh from the other room or something that could theoretically be about me and my stomach will drop and anxiety takes over. Then I feel like I HAVE to get up and eavesdrop a bit so I can reassure myself that they aren't talking about me (which, as a friend put it when it first became an issue last year: they never are). Like, if I don't get up I'll sit there with a stomachache trying and also not trying to overhear until I either successfully distract myself (which is a crapshoot) or I go check. At first this only happened when I was high but recently it's been an issue when I'm fully sober, too. And I'm having worry stomachaches throughout the day when I'm reminded of whatever my brain has decided that they're upset at me for (based on the snippet of conversation I heard).

I've been working with my therapist about it but I'm seriously struggling. She gave me worksheets and stuff, and I know it's just a thought, which will come and go, and I choose to believe it (as she reiterated many times today) but it really feels like the worry is so sudden and overwhelming that it controls me almost. She also wants me to talk to my roommates and establish that if there's any issues we talk to eachother first instead of talking about it but I'm worried theyll take that the wrong way, or if they have actually been complaining about me the whole time they'll finally drop the ruse of liking me. 

The whole thing is really making it hard for me to maintain a regular relationship with my roommates, since I think they hate me whenever we aren't actively having a pleasant conversation. I've been fantasizing about moving into my own apartment, so I don't have to worry about them, but I can't afford it and my roommates are literally the only people I talk to outside of my work (where I'm alone for the majority of my shift). The only other solution my broken brain has is to kill myself, and obviously that's a no-go.

Anyway. Advice from anyone who has similar issues would be appreciated."
Vaccination and medical anxiety,2,mgu67f,5,"I’m a survivor of ongoing medical trauma (honestly too complex and paranoid to explain further, sorry)

I was wondering if anyone similar has gotten vaccinated and how you coped with it. I’m scheduled for my first dose, it’s at a hospital I’ve got a history with. I really want to get vaccinated, despite my severe medical avoidance, but these people terrify me.

I live in a rural area so there aren’t many options unfortunately. I’m so stressed I’m worried I will cancel and be stuck at home even longer than I already have been, which is really triggering to agoraphobic tendencies creeping back that I’ve worked hard on.

It feels like a trap no matter what I choose :("
I grow Up terrified of my Dad,3,mgu0w1,1,"I remember that deep feeling of being completely powerless on regard of his colossal rage. I remember being a Kid and wanting to kill my dad from the age of 5. I was terrified of him. Everytime I heard the sound of the car in the park I remember that I have always rushed to my mom or to my bed under my blanket. He used to be extremely angry after he came back from work, If he had found me playing with few toys that family friends had gifted me, he would often time take them and smash them. The worst part about it is that I have always I have always been jelous of other kids who were often time excited to see their dad come back from work, and I have always wondered what is wrong with me, why does my dad treat me like this, why am I the kid that had always been mistreated. I will never forget his gaze, his dead cold eyes looking in to my soul like he was going to kill me anytime soon, his shouts that used to make the home tremble. He used to be violent with me, using hands  and trowing me things but after I have blackmailed him by telling him that I am going to call the police, he used to make me do cold showers everytime I showed any sing of activity that he found bothersome or everytime I had answered him back. I had been closed inside of me now for so long, the cold or cold water in general partly triggers me and reminds me of how powerless I was. Nothing have ever given me any deep consolation."
I have a weird inner child “fantasy” of sorts,42,mgtiz9,15,"I feel like the word fantasy implies a lot of unintentional things, but I think to myself a lot about what it would feel like for this to happen. 

It’s nothing too specific - I think I just want to be able to cry and be openly upset and have a meltdown like a very small child, and for some type of caregiver/safe person to respond to that in a comforting way I guess. I think I wish someone else would step in to do the soothing besides myself. But in this fantasy I don’t have any hang-ups about feeling guilty for accepting that kind of help. 

Certainly not something I would ever admit to anyone in real life"
DAE feel like they're made up of a million different pieces put together?,8,mgtaq5,2,"I don't know what this may be, but I'm curious whether other people have it too. I have dreams or imagery or feelings oftentimes like I am made up of every face I've ever seen. My brother who wasn't as abused as I was, but still abused, also has dreams like this. Where he is being hunted down by a monster who is made up of his own face, and the face is every face he's ever seen. We both have different times of feeling like pieces from other people or from media and things we've seen before."
Can anyone explain this strange compulsive behaviour?,6,mgt9ot,10,"I've had this weird behaviour for as long as I can remember, age 3 or so. I think it is related to my childhood trauma (emotional neglect from both parents and always-yelling father) and would like to understand it better.

When I was a kid, I would spend a lot of time spinning my hands around each other with closed fists in front of myself, and making sound effects to go along with whatever I was fantasizing about. I think it started off pretending I was driving motorcycles.

This behaviour never stopped, and there have been a handful of times when family members have walked in while I was doing it which resulted in incredible embarrassment. 

As I became an adult, I suppressed the movement a lot but there is still an urge to kind of shake my fists and make a slight sound at certain times. 

I only ever get the urge when I am at home by myself, and there are some common patterns to my thoughts that accompany the behaviour. It is usually fantasizing about future scenarios (realistic or not), in a sequential, numeric way. Some examples:

\- Fantasizing about the weekly medication amounts changing as a family member tapers off their drug regimen.

\- Fantasizing about the progression of skills or abilities learned (like university education achieved) over the course of months, years, decades.

\- Creating imaginary products, like a line of car speakers, and thinking about how they would progress in specifications and price along the product line. 

When I go into this compulsive behaviour, it is quite sudden and I might not realize I'm doing it until during/after. I once accidentally recorded myself with my webcam (I didn't know it was on) and it was quite shocking how quickly, briefly ""possessed"" I looked as this behaviour came on while I was doing other things.

I can sometimes catch myself before I engage (for some reason going to the bathroom and sitting on the toilet is often a trigger), and I could choose not to do it, but it feels satisfying to some part of my mind to let it happen. It seems like a catalyst to creativity & fantasy, except it's often the same useless scenarios over and over again.

I asked my friend, who is an occupational therapist that works with children, if this or other parts of my personality led her to think it might be autism-related, and she didn't think so, but she also hasn't ever seen me do it. 

Is this a form of dissociation? A sign of autism (which I don't really understand and haven't looked into), something else? I'm open to hearing any input that might help me understand what is happening. Thanks."
"Yesterday I felt soooo good, today I wish I was dead",113,mgt69p,10,"The swings in this healing process are so hard. Sometimes it was easier just to feel awful all the time. Because the moments of feeling good and like I'm going somewhere make the crashes that much harder. I guess the moments of feeling like I'm becoming are more frequent and deeper.

"Too dissociated to live alone, too hyper vigilant to live with roommates",30,mgt3oe,7,"Has anyone been else in a situation like this? I’m a college student who can’t go home (abusive family), and I’m struggling to find summer housing. On one hand, if I live alone for too long, my suicidal ideation and dissociative disorder will likely get much worse. I don’t really trust myself to live alone for three months with my dissociative disorder (I feel like I’m much too likely to just leave the gas on and walk away by accident, etc.) But I‘m so terrified of other people that I can’t imagine living with anyone else. I feel like I’m really stuck between two equally terrible choices here. 

I keep putting off making the decision because my symptoms are so intense nowadays, and both options seem so awful. But I know I can’t put this decision off forever. My housing situation is preoccupying my mind to the point where I can’t even think about anything else.

I am just writing this because Ive been laying in bed for the past few days starving myself. I feel like a piece of shit human being. My birthday is on Saturday and Im turning 28. Despite that, I still pretty much get fully supported by my parents and have been on unemployment since I was laid off from covid stuff. I never ever celebrate my birthday and the one year I decide to throw a small get together, no one can make it. And I invited over 20 people. I am realizing that I dont really have any real friends, which makes sense because Im a shitty person. 

I totaled my Dads car a few days ago by running over a rock at the park that tore out my radiator. The security guard threatened to call the cops on me for an honest mistake because it was “federal property.” I am a small black woman, so this was extremely triggering. 

My dads super pissed at me and told me to “get a job” and started comparing me to my cousin whos a successful lawyer at 27. I started self harming again and accidentally put a hole in my wall. Ive been starving myself and not leaving my room and all I can think about is punishing myself and how much I wish I was someone different or didnt exist. I dont know what to do.

It is my fault because I am too insecure, to them I am just a way to make a lot of money without having to think/work. This isnt my first lawyer, Ive tried several lawfirms and the result is always the same . *I am the problem*

Anyway, I desperately need them to do what I am paying them for - but my cptsd still has me in freeze-mode, I cant seem to get the message accross. Any ideas on how to tackle this?"
Not sure what I’m looking for,7,mgrw3y,9,"I am not well, and I want to get better. I’ve spent a long time believing a combination of a) there’s nothing really wrong with me (and I’m making a big deal out of nothing/seeking attention), b) if there is something wrong with me, I need to just get over it and stop being a baby, and c) there is something wrong with me but I’m *handling* it.     
I don’t think any of those are really true, but they feel true.     
I am doing alright, all things considered - I went to university, and I have a job, and I pay my bills, and I have friends and a loving, supportive partner, and I can drive and do my taxes and go to the grocery store by myself. On paper, I am a functional adult.     
But I am currently coming to terms with the fact that I am not as functional as I have been pretending to be. That it is not normal or fine to be afraid of everyone and everything. That it is not sustainable to only feel good or secure when I’m around my partner. That my ‘coping skills’ are maladaptive and I can’t just do the bare minimum and then lie in bed watching Netflix for the rest of the day. That I dissociate, that I get triggered, that I am not fine.     
I want help, but I don’t know how to ask for help, because I’m not allowed to need help. If I can’t do it myself, it’s because I’m not trying hard enough. I have an appointment with a psychologist in two weeks, which is great, except that I’ve seen therapist after psychologist after doctor, and no one has ever really helped me except my current psychiatrist. And there’s no medication she can prescribe that will heal my trauma.    
I need real, concrete steps I can take to get better. I can follow directions - I’m good at that. If someone would just tell me what to do, how to heal, I think I could do it. But talking and breathing and grounding have never changed anything for me. And I don’t know what else to try.     
So I’m not sure what I’m asking for, but I want to get better."
I am starting to feel like a whole person again,9,mgrscm,2,"I am feeling the healthiest I ever have in my entire life. Physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. 

The happiest I had ever been prior to this was in college, years ago, when I was regularly exercising and surrounded by friends I adored and who adored me back, living on campus, around May 2009.

August 2019, I was living in Michigan. I was horribly depressed, to a degree I could not recognize. My fibromyalgia was still completely unmanageable, although I was JUST starting to realize how helpful Full Spectrum Oil is for my body. I was drinking so much I was officially a functioning alcoholic, my relationship with alcohol was wildly unhealthy. I barely had any physical activity, I couldn’t, I was in too much pain. I was at my peak weight, the heaviest I had been my whole life, and it exacerbated my fibromyalgia to a degree I didn’t understand at the time. Depression, drinking, never moving, I was starting to become pretty unrecognizable to myself. My relationship with my parents at the time was at its very worst in my entire life, and I was finally starting to recognize the signs of childhood trauma manifesting in an adult body. It is so fucking clear to me now that my chronic illness is a direct result of my childhood trauma. And I’m pretty sure the trauma I experienced in college kind of... finished the job? I don’t think my body stood a chance, knowing what I know about the connections between chronic illness and childhood trauma. 

September 2019 Nick and I fell in love. We were mutual friends who stayed connected over Facebook, but he lived in California. I started pushing myself to use the treadmill, a quarter mile at a time, to build some stamina for all the sight seeing we were going to attempt when I visited him (with the plan to keep me loaded on edibles). For the first time in a long time, I had a kernel of hope that life was going to get better.

October 2019 I moved to California. Permanently. (Yes after only a month, when you know you know!) Everything started to change. I could move better. I WANTED to move. I took long walks, on purpose. I still drank a lot, but already so much less. And after about a month, even less. As time went on, I realized I was barely drinking compared to the way I had been, and I pointed it out to Nick. He said something to the degree of, “Yeah I totally recognized that, as soon as you got here. I noticed when you started cutting back too, and I’m happy for you.” And essentially we puzzled out... I was using alcohol as pain management back in Michigan. Not just depression management! But physical pain management. In California, that’s when I started exclusively using cannabis to treat my fibromyalgia pain. And falling in love was definitely helping my depression pain. Oh, and going no contact with my parents. Cutting my toxic mother out of my life was the very best medicine. It’s pretty clear that in Michigan I had been drinking myself into an early grave, but in California I have a healthy relationship with alcohol, the way I always hoped I would. Socially, not constantly. Because of cannabis. I noticed I was dropping weight like crazy. (DESPITE the cannabis, haha). In fact, I’ve lost fifty pounds. Between the walks, the lack of booze, the increase in water, THERAPY, and most importantly: an unconditionally loving environment with Nick and Cal (my bonus son), my body finally was able to start to heal itself. I’m finally starting to feel like the old me. I’m finally living in a space where I feel safe enough to be vulnerable. My partner helps me feel secure enough in our relationship, so I feel comfortable breaking decades-long codependent habits I’ve built up. 

Do you know what’s crazy? I just found out at the doctor today that I’m the exact weight I was when I was my happiest in college."

Struggle to connect with people even via the internet? Any advice please.,6,mgqao6,8,"I’ve spent most of this year alone, estranged from family for the last 4 1/2 years (sister the exception ) no friends and living in a new city for 7 months. I can count on one hand the times I’ve talked to someone outside of my sister ( doesn’t live near me)  and therapist. I’ve had 7 months off work due to previously spending 4 years working everyday except for 3 weeks when I went to visit my sister 2 years ago aka was a workaholic to distance myself from the reality of my life. 

I’ve spent the past 7 months convinced I would ‘make friends’ I haven’t or ‘try dating’ I haven’t and have even for the past 3 weeks thought I would try to make friends online via twitter or forums for bands / tv / films I like..:.i haven’t. Even posting on Reddit with all its anonymous-ness has to be a valid reason rather than ‘because I want to’. 

I’m worried this is who I am now, someone with no one &amp;amp; slowly getting comfortable with the thought I’ll always be alone and not good enough, some people are not meant to be happy and I’m one of them.

I’ve had 7 months off work. I’m still physically and emotionally alone, except now it’s evident and not because of ‘work’ or being ‘busy’ but because I cannot put myself out there, sad, scared and waiting for the sky to fall on top of me, even though I know, the smallest interaction would change my life significantly. 

My sister and therapist make it sound so easy, every night I have the best intentions before attempting to sleep, telling myself I cannot bare to live like this and every day I spend it convincing myself I’ll never be good enough for anyone or thing other than working. I spend most of my day watching daytime tv, watching the same 5 tv series / films , sleeping, crying , trying not to think about the past and waiting till the next therapy session  or when my sister will call. Feels pathetic typing it out. 

Contemplating going back to work, just to have something to do and not feel like the waste of space I feel I am, so I don’t spiral into sucideal ideation I’ve been flirting with for the past 3 months. Even though I’m financially ok for the next couple of months.

Have been in therapy for the past 5 months, I don’t know what I expected ? A new personality? Wake up trauma free ? Less sad? Less sucideal? Less me ?  Just something that isn’t this constant hollow dread feeling. 

Anyone have any tips on how to help myself outside of therapy which I’m already attending?  People with cptsd, have friends and partners. I’ve never had either, unworthy to mean anything to anyone, other than a sister who is a burden &amp; a pay check to my therapist. Nothing more. If I died tonight no one would know for weeks, what’s the point of being alive. What’s the point of my existence. Nothing. 

Don’t know how long I can do this for. Thank you in advance for any help."
I‘m scared that i‘ll never be able to truly love someone or live a normal life,6,mgq4pu,11,"i‘m in therapy for 10 years now yet they found out i suffer from CPTSD about 1 year ago. my dad‘s mom killed herself when he was like 14 years old and he never had a dad. his adoptive father abused him and i think he also suffered from PTSD/CPTSD. this is for sure the reason he wasn‘t able to be a „good father“ which caused my childhood trauma. anyways CPTSD as diagnosis helped me a lot with understanding why i function this way and reacting to things the way i am doing it and so on. 

i got a pretty bad taste in my relationship partners since they‘ve all been emotionally unavailable and if not i didn‘t want them. i think i‘m responsible for the heartbreaks they caused me. reflecting on those past years i don‘t think that i‘ve ever been truly in love and that these people were just obsessions. i‘m not sure if i‘ll ever be able to truly love someone and it scares me. on the other hand i don‘t want anyone to fall in love with me because i think i‘m just gonna hurt them. 

lately i‘m so powerless of the constant fight against cptsd. healing is so so so exhausting. i know it affected my whole development and i always thought i‘mma be fine someday but i actually don‘t think that this day is gonna come... i feel like that i have to struggle for my whole life in every aspect of it which doesn‘t make it worth living. i‘m not suicidal and i still find enjoyment in some things there‘s always good and bad episodes but i‘m not sure how long i‘ll be able to handle the bad ones. 

i feel guilty for everyone around me. i‘m isolating and pushing people away not talking to anyone except for my best friend about it because i‘m scared to hurt anyone.

DAE struggle with forming attachments?,3,mgpqoh,2,"TW: Death

I realized recently why I'm able to move on from loss in the blink of an eye.

When my dad died when I was young, I didn't even blink. I remember moving on immediately, being normal at school (to my school-assigned therapist's surprise; I told her I didn't need her, and they shouldn't have assigned her to me after my dad died). I remember being annoyed that everyone around me was always sad about it.

When I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years, I moved on the next day. I could have fallen in love with someone else immediately, but I was also in no rush to find someone else. I was normal, happy, well adjusted.

When one of my friendships ended, I shrugged it off and moved on with my life. I can make more friends if I want to, no big deal. I didn't get upset over it.

I've been thinking about these situations recently and I thought to myself: ""why can I discard people so easily? Is there something wrong with me?"" Because I feel nothing when they leave my life. 

I think it's because part of me can't form an attachment to people. One of the connections is broken, but I don't know what it is. From a young, young, young age (probably too young to remember, because I never remember NOT being like this), I learned that there was no family I could trust. I couldn't form attachments to any of my family members because they constantly abandoned me, so as a survival mechanism I learned that it was unsafe to form attachments...but now I don't even know what an attachment looks like.

Anyone else feel this way? Have any of you finally learned how to form healthy attachments?"

I'm feeling the same sensations I would get right before I had to restrain a patient. I always felt dread, and a rush of adrenaline because I hated doing restraints.

I reach back with the sword and with a mighty, rageful, radical blow of fucking liberation I shatter the entire fucking bridge right behind me. I take a breath and turn forward. And there it is: the horizon. 

A gentle, beautiful sky with picturesque clouds. The tender, light evening sun gently strokes my face and dips the scene into the softest, most gentle and divine colors.

My T asks me what I see. I tell him the above scene. I see the horizon. I see endless possibilities. I see ease. I see a future that gently invites me to come explore the opportunities it has in store. I look beautiful in this scene. I'm handsome and powerful, but also tender and gentle and wise. I'm at complete peace. I'm full of love and peaceful anticipation and my body feels light like a feather. I see heaven on earth and I'm right there. I see LIFE.

Question about the role of self-esteem in CPTSD,3,mgou26,2,"TW: Death of parent

My overall question (in case you don't want to read the following wall of text) - is damage to one's self-esteem and/or feelings of shame a fundamental part of CPTSD? Could CPTSD still develop from long-term adverse circumstances even if everyone around you is fundamentally kind?

&#x200B;

Context:

I lost my father when I was fourteen, and my mother's ensuing depression/PTSD meant I had to take over his role as confidant during her daily emotional breakdowns. They were never directed toward me, but she always looked to me specifically to vent her pain, and I couldn't leave until I could figure out how to calm her down. She affectionately called me her ""little therapist"" when I was in high school, and still repeatedly tells me I am her only real source of emotional support.

My therapist referred to this as parentification, which I understand is a form of abuse. It's been 10 years now since my dad died, two years since I moved out, and I still feel like I'm not quite a full person anymore. Descriptions of emotional flashbacks have been the best way I've found to explain the episodes I get now.

But I haven't seen any literature, articles, etc. about CPTSD that don't include the assumption that someone was openly treated as unworthy of love/protection. My mom has never made me feel like filling my dad's role was my ""duty"" to her, or that I was a bad person if I didn't; I stayed because she was dangerously depressed, crying, and/or screaming every night for years, I felt obligated as her daughter to help, and I was horrified by how much pain she was in (we were living in the same house, so that part I truly couldn't escape). Aside from this, we're actually very close (though I still feel on edge around her).

So I just wondered if a sense of shame/unworthiness is inherent to CPTSD; I certainly don't want to take for granted the significance of this aspect to others' experience."

DAE have brainzaps (my only name for it) that gets worse when in stressful situations and/or feeling CPTSD-symptoms?,4,mgo1oo,5,"basically the title because i’ve been having this problem where i get so so cold inside and it spreads through all my nerve endings and bones and i just get goosebumps all over. i’ve never been able to identify it besides it being associated with antidepressants and withdrawals and that did make it worse but i’ve been having them since i was a child. the cold also makes it worse and even feeling too hot.

when it gets really bad i feel it all in my head and brain and it would lead to migraines and i’ve noticed when i’m more stable and able to handle myself and my surroundings they’re just there and not so overwhelming but it’s still there 

it’s one of the only symptoms i can “easily” identify that started around the time things would start to happen that affected me, i thought it was normal until i was able to be in an environment where i felt as safe as i ever felt and saw it wasn’t happening except when i felt negative emotions, experiencing flashbacks or was in the cold"
Reaction to termination,6,mgnuq0,12,"Anyone have any ideas what's going on? Long read, apologies.

My therapist whom I was simultaneously attached to but trying desperately to not be attached to, terminated me abruptly in November. 

It has been extremely difficult for me to process. It really hit at my core beliefs about myself. My other therapist and then my psychiatrist have both told me it was not right, not fair, not something they would have done, and not something I deserved. I did not want to hear that, at all.  Talking to other therapists about it, instead of making me feel better about it and the confusion lifted, has just made me so much more confused about things and hurt by former therapist's actions.  Rather than there being a good, ethical, therapeutic reason for it, that a lay person just could not understand, but that a therapist could explain, I can only conclude that she could not tolerate me, could not feel even basic positive regard. We don't ask much of our therapists, 50 minutes every other week, and that was too much for her. I guess that's the ethical thing to do when you get to the point where you hate a client.

I really don't get why this hurts me so much. I guess I feel very exposed and deeply ashamed. It is a confirmation of my core beliefs.  I sat there, month after month, being vulnerable, all the while she dreaded my presence? I really liked her as a person, and she couldn't stand me. Why did she take me on as a client in the first place? 

The anger is coming in now when I look back at the last 5 months, the effect this has had on me. Current therapist has been trying to get me to not take on the blame, and she's ""happy"" that I'm starting to feel some anger around it now. 
The inability to work, the random crying spells, the constant reminders, the need to cancel social interaction because I could not predict when this shit was going to hit me again, the pushing people away, the drinking I started again, the lack of sleep, the fact that meditation which used to help me now only serves as a reminder of what has happened. 

I paid thousands of dollars to walk away from this experience quite effed up. Now I've spent months in new therapy trying to figure this shit out. 

Why did she have to do this at this time? I was newly living alone, we were going into lockdown, nothing to distract you like in normal times. She knew my history of attachment trauma, of my sore spots of ostracization and bullying, the relational betrayal, she knew the hate I have for myself and she knew that I had been trying to trust her and had in fact just told her something that demonstrated an incredible amount of trust. I  can only conclude that knowing all those things, knowing how this would hurt me, that on balance she literally could not tolerate my presence any longer. Did I make her skin crawl? I must have. 

I know that most people would not think this to be such a big deal, and that fact just makes this so much worse. I feel utterly defective and ashamed. Why can I not be normal with this kind of thing?

My therapist was also my former co-worker's therapist. This co-worker and I have not texted since before the termination. Sometimes we would discuss therapy with eachother. Well out of the blue she texted me today and I almost shit my pants when I saw her name, started shaking, almost started hyperventilating. The first thing I had to say to her was not to mention anything to do with therapy. Talk about embarrassing, who the fuck has to say shit like that to someone?  Now I haven't gotten any work done since then.

I just don't understand why I have had such a strong reaction to this. Is it my untreated depression? Is it a trauma flashback being activated? Is it both?  

I never even had this long of a reaction to a breakup with someone I loved. I know I didn't love my therapist. What the hell is going on here? 

I guess it's huge huge progress that I'm now able to make a post about it. Who knows, I might take this down later."
"This weekend my sister is visiting. And no, I will not fawn for her.",11,mgnm8u,1,"I have come to the conclusion that my eldest sister is toxic/abusive. I am so unused to healthy relationships that I thought her behaviour was normal. I also believe that family member's unkind behaviour must be tolerated (I have this belief due to abuse.) I realised that when someone on here said ""If you feel fear around a person, it is your body communicating that they are not a safe person""

I would extend that to feeling fear, self-loathing, worry, and a desire to ass kiss (fawn) when she is near. I also have to hide my interests, true feelings, hobbies, personality, and such when she is around, as I've experienced victim-blaming, criticism, gaslighting, and more when I am open with her.

I will not bend to abusive people, even if she may not know any better, or be uneducated about how to be kind or healthy in relationships, and even if she is uneducated about my mental illnesses.

My mom also feels afraid around her, so I'm clearly not alone. My mom says things like ""She'll be visiting in a week I'm so nervous. She's going to criticise my house."" I told my mom that being afraid of someone is not normal.

So. She will come and I will say 'no hugs - virus' and she will say her piece (I have no idea why she's coming for several hours after 100 mile drive... I assume she has news of some kind) and she can get fucked :)"
Has anyone found a good medication for nightmares/night terrors?,10,mgnlm0,11,I’ve had intermittent nightmares/terrors with varied intensity for years that have increasingly gotten more consistent worse over the past 3 years. I pretty much can’t get through a night without one these days. I’ve been on cyclobenzaprine for a few months for anxiety/spams and I found it helps get me to sleep but still really doesn’t help with the dreams. My doc put me on prazosin to try to help stop the dreams which I tried for a week but had horrible side effects and it didn’t really stop the dreams either. Any suggestions?
Am I right to feel awful about something I barely remember?,5,mgnl8y,3,"(Repost because I think it got a little lost)
I’ve posted here before, but basically long story short I have CPTSD from a multitude of experiences, including abuse from my family in particular my mother. I also am traumatised from an event where I was groomed sexually by an older girl (17) when I was 11.

What I want to ask/talk about right now is a completely different event entirely, it’s something I’ve always acknowledged/remembered happened to me, but I only just realised that this was potentially awful and it made me breakdown crying the other day.

My mother’s step father raised her from a young age, and I’ve always acknowledged him to be my grandpa as much as I have her birth father. I’ve never known him as any different and I was raised calling him Opa (grandad in German, my family is from Germany.) He works as a gynaecologist.

The reason I mention this is because it’s related to the memory I mentioned in the title- I think I must have been 4 or 5, and I remember my mother taking me to my grandfather for him to look at my private parts. I remember lying on my back in his practice, completely alone in the building apart from the three of us, and my mum standing next to me. I remember him seeing me naked and him looking between my legs, but then the memory completely blacks out, I remember nothing else.

I do not recall ever having any gynaecological issues, especially not at that age that would have needed looking at. I’ve always remembered this experience and memory, but it was just the other day when I really thought about the implications of it and I broke down in distress and tears. I was in the shower and I just remember holding myself and my whole body shaking, I felt ashamed and uncomfortable and terrified- terrified of why my mum thought it was okay for my grandparent to see/touch me like that, and terrified of what I don’t remember. 

It could have just been harmless, and I acknowledge that completely, but at the same time I feel this deep genuine disgust about the situation. I don’t know what happened to me, I was never able to consent to my grandad seeing me like that. I feel horrible, even typing this my stomach is just churning. 

I’m genuinely asking for advice, is this something I have a right to feel this way over? Is that normal behaviour for a parent/family to do? I’m terrified. Thank you for reading."
DAE have flashbacks OF their flashbacks???,34,mgn865,10,"OMG. This has been happening to me for 10+ years!!! So I've been having flashbacks of my flashbacks. As in, if I have an emotional flashback I will then associate everything I was eating, doing, wearing, listening to etc. with the flashback and if I go near these things again, they trigger a visual, sensory, somatic, and/or emotional flashback of the flashback.... crazy. It's like a cyclical thing... or Dante's circle of hell. I am having crazy flashback inception I suppose. And let's not mention the flashbacks of the flashbacks of the flashbacks etc. etc. 

So am I the only one? It makes my home, personal possessions, fave music, clothing, fave food, tv shows etc. become emotionally 'tainted' as they become triggers so easily (as I might have a flashback in their mere vicinity)

Love this forum, love you guys x thanks so much!"
Does Guanfacine Help You With Anxiety?,2,mgn1fd,1," Hey there,

I am curious about experience reports with guanfacine for (social) anxiety....Or even sensory overload? I have major problems with too much stimulation when I am out in public. Every loud noise makes me startle very hard. This in return makes me extremly anxious and uncomfortable.

If you have experience with guanfacine please feel free to share your results..."
I feel like a failure,5,mgmud1,5,"You know i just realized this might be my yearly birthday depression. It's at the end of April and I'll turn 38... It's so close to 40 and i still feel like a young adult most of the time. 

I feel like i haven't accomplished anything. I don't work and have been on disability for thirteen years, maybe even longer. My apartment's a mess. I just stepped on my glasses last night and they're broken. I have no money to get them fixed. I have a second pair but i haven't been able to find them since last night because... my apartment's a mess. 

I feel like i should have a better handle on my life than i do. 

I was going to go get my psych meds from my gp yesterday but couldn't manage. Just went for a five hour nap instead. I call them today to realize they are on vacation. The doc filling in is not open today. I don't have time tomorrow. Which means, because i always wait till the last second, i do not have meds to take tomorrow night. 

I feel like I'm just failing at everything. I currently cannot deal. So i just sleep. And sleep. 

I hate myself today. I am trying to be compassionate towards myself and all that but i feel so lost and so much like I'm just failing at life. 

Also my therapist has been gone four weeks and i won't see her again till next week Thursday. She had surgery. I cannot even reach out to her because she's probably in a lot of pain. 

Ugh. I could reach out to my psychiatrist and tell her I failed to get my meds from my gp in time. But i feel embarrassed. So i won't. 

Everything is so chaotic. Ugh."
I hate that I doubt my experiences,4,mgmqzf,3,"TW: mentions family trauma, emotional abuse, emotional neglect

CPTSD is so difficult to deal with and the doubt that comes with it (for me at least) does not make it any easier. Sometimes I doubt the severity of my experiences because ""others have it worse"". I was emotionally neglected and had to look after my family's feelings over my own throughout my teens (I'm only 18 now though and still have to) and I've been made to feel like an absolute failure of a human, of course that's a serious issue. I wish I didn't gaslight myself because my parents did the ""best they could"" and because they gave me lots physically. My family makes it clear that my views are wrong, my choices are wrong, everything about me is wrong. I've always been the black sheep but sometimes it just HITS me. I had an argument with my mom last night that triggered me so so badly and I have not been able to do anything today except watch lighthearted youtube videos. Moments like this make me realize that my experiences are valid even if no one around me understands how much suffering I've been through. Most people don't completely fall apart after an argument. Most people don't need days to recover after an argument. Something inside of me got triggered and I don't know what to do about it. My mom loves me but it's like we are in different universes. She has no idea how much emotional damage my family has caused me, she has no idea how much pain I've been through, she has no idea what she has put me through. I could never explain to her how intrinsically flawed I feel because of my childhood experiences. I could never explain how much my conservative Christian town has made me feel like I have some fatal flaw. It's just so confusing to me how she loves me and says she loves me and thinks she gave me a wonderful childhood and did everything she could yet at the same time crushed my individuality, crushed my creativity, tried to stop my critical thinking, and basically made me feel like shit for years. I know this is all over the place, sorry. I'm struggling and wanted to rant. Thanks for reading."
Major Dissociation During EMDR,2,mgmm1b,4,"Sooo after a crazy therapy journey, I finally found an awesome therapist who does emdr. I've been working with her for five months or so. And I could really feel myself changing. As part of this, my flashbacks have turned into full body flashbacks. And today we decided to work on the main events (same thing several times in my childhood) that power those. We'd done it before at a cognitive level but I felt ready to do it at a body level. This is a series of memories that I've tried to work on in previous therapy before. THe first time I even talked about it at a high level ten years ago, I got blackout drunk after, for the first and only time ever. And when I tried again last year with a therapist who turned out to be harmful (see previous posts), I almost lost it. This time, I felt ready if nervous. Well, we got into it today. I felt like it was moving on. Then the last 20 minutes I like majorly dissociated. I ended up leaving while still very out of it. She was aware and I think concerned, but none of what she suggested was helping because I was so gone. I am like a teeny bit back but mostly gone. And now I'm paranoid she's going to quit working with me, which has happened to me twice before (not in emdr, regular therapists with no trauma expertise). I am also like terrrrrrified of this memory and what it means. Anyhow, not really looking for any response in particular but needed to get this out. Thank you."
Im not sure what this post is about so i think im just going to ramble. Hope thats okay. If not feel free to ignore the post.,1,mgmju2,2,"Im 45, ill be turning 46 in about a week. I just celebrated my 22nd anniversary. I love my wife im relatively happy but theres always this NEED to connect to other people. Even when folks are nice to me i feel like i dont really have friends. Because people come and go so much. Ive been stuck on disability for the past 11 years. No real human contact outside the house due to anxiety/depression etc. except for online. I recently lost my online gaming group due to not wanting to deal with a person who was constantly rude to me so i left their discord. Now they dont really talk to me. Wed been friends since 2007 but its like oh well hes gone and it dont matter. I feel like im an invisible throw away person. Im not and i dont need them but i really wish people werent so complicated and like that. It seems so needless and silly tome. If you dont walk or talk a certain way, look a certain way, do this do that. Annunciate your words a certain way you dont belong. So many stupid rules people have. Theyre unspoken too so not like you can read them. Or you can but why would you even want to? So dumb.

&#x200B;

My therapist told me i have some form of PTSD the last time i seen her I dont get flashbacks or anything like that and i dont know much about this. Id quit seeing her because at the time i was feeling better and it kind of felt like a waste of money. But besides the PTSD i may or may not have, i definitely have avoidant personality disorder, social anxiety and some kind of depression, not sure on that one whether its bi polar or unipolar.Anyway ive been alone a really long time besides my wife. I dont leave the house anymore hardly at all. Occasionally a few times a month to get food or stuff from town. I can do that fairly okay.

But I have such a hard time when it comes to people. I obsess over it and worry if im gonna say or do something to push them away. That inevitably does, because then youre coming across as neurotic im sure.  I dont really know how to dress or talk or be a ""normal"" human. Dont even think i want to be. Dont get me wrong im at peace with who i am for the most part. I like who i am. Im a loving caring hopefully fun to be around guy. But   I just feel so disconnected from life and the world.  Im also a highly sensitive person. Ive learned to control that over the years to sort of harden my heart. But at the same time thats part of who i am and i dont really want to have to do that.  I dont know. Like i said just rambling.

I try to find people to talk to here on reddit and thats fine i guess but generally due to my age thats a no go or if i do find people they dont stick around past a few weeks. Ill get really depressed due to that feel like ive failed again. Then its time to move on and try it again. I read about people talking about dont get validation from other people. I get that. But sometimes the loneliness will kick in and its like some sort of disease /soul cancer or something always in the back of my mind waiting to strike.

I wish i could find a group, online or off where i could hangout, have some friends, some fun. Just enjoy life. But I really don't see that happening anytime soon. I really feel like this song ,

[kinda sums it all up pretty well.](https://youtu.be/9zCKMgfOMPo)

Thanks for listening to me ramble. Hope ya'll have a good rest of the day/week.

**Amazon Prime Lyrics**  
\[Verse 1\]  
Kate went to Vegas and she never came back  
Warner Brothers lost the love and gave me the shaft  
Well I'm okay I found a new lifeline  
Now I feel the hole in my heart with Amazon Prime  


\[Chorus\]  
So come wait outside my door  
Give me something to come home for  
'Cause my whole life is one big mess  
But when you come around it's a little bit less  


\[Verse 2\]  
Fluorescent condoms and DVDs  
Six wife-beaters and a plain white tee  
Well it ain't just me, it's my neighbours too  
Waiting on some love from China  
Just to get us through  


\[Chorus\]  
So come wait outside my door  
Give me something to come home for'Cause my whole life is one big mess  
But when you come around it's a little bit less  


\[Verse 3\]  
Uh I pull that tape and my face goes flush  
The anticipation is way too much  
There's a little piece, a little part me  
That thinks I might God in a box of teas  


\[Chorus\]  
So come wait outside my door  
Give me something to come home for  
'Cause my whole life is one big mess  
But when you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less "
Homeless/Trying to move and need access to healthcare information,5,mgm534,2,"guys it's hopeless in the DMV area for me, my insurance doesn't offer trauma therapy and I don't qualify for Medicaid because of an error in the system. I gotta get out of here. I just have no idea where to even start to look into learning about transferring medical services and finding good ones especialy for something so specialized as CPTSD. Really struggling. Always seems like the options are simply redirects into the system of hospitals which IME are strictly damaging and compound the trauma. No idea what to do ."
I created a boundary- and it went well!,50,mgm0mu,3,"Hello! I thought I'd share a story of a little victory I had this week!

Some background: my workplace is casual, almost familial at times, which has both its joys and pitfalls. Although maintaining boundaries sometimes is very necessary, I love my coworkers. One of my coworkers in particular has always been especially kind to me, ensuring that I eat (I have hang-ups about food and compulsively skip meals as a result).

We frequently exchange phone numbers at my workplace for various reasons, both work-related and otherwise, and this person asked for mine. In general, I don't feel comfortable texting or calling older people, even if their intentions are innocent, so I gently refused, telling them I didn't feel safe giving my phone number out yet.

And it was well-received! They said, ""It's okay, I understand. It's important to be safe."" We worked together amiably yesterday. It's like the conversation never happened.

It probably sounds strange, but creating boundaries is terrifying for me. Now, I'm not certain of what I was afraid of. I'm very glad to have a coworker who respects my boundaries, and I'm proud of myself for taking, what is for me, a gigantic leap in my healing."
Where are the spaces for people with CPTSD that didn't primarily come from their parents but from abusive relationships?,13,mgley8,17,"So I've known of my CPTSD issues for a few months now and been reading Pete Walker's From Surviving to Thriving and I read a LOT of posts on here, but sometimes I don't feel like I truly fit because the majority of my CPTSD symptoms didn't come from my parents. They came from abusive partners and friends. 

Yes, my father was emotionally incestuous with me, yes my mother verbally and emotionally abused me, and yes it was painful to live at home for a good chunk of my childhood. But the *deep wounds*, the *severe emotional pain that leaves me paralyzed* came more so from **other people.**

I was continually and painfully socially ostracized in *every single* social space I existed in for the ENTIRETY of my childhood and adolescence. The only reason it got better was when I started drinking and then I felt people could actually tolerate me. The bullying I endured from kids at school wounded me way more than what my parents did. I can't even bring myself to explain the type of emotional torture the girls I went to school with put me through.

And then there are my romantic relationships. My first partner was 21 when I was 16 and every part of our relationship was severely toxic and abusive. The abuse I endured from him was worse than anything I had already experienced. When we would get in fights he would often threaten to leave me stranded somewhere, and once when I thought he did and I called someone to pick me up, he became furious with me and told me to never call my family for that sort of thing ever again. He used self-harm as a manipulation tactic when we fought, which was daily. I lived through that for a year and have seriously dissociated from that year of my life and done the most I can to heal from it.

Then came OTHER abusive relationships after, partners who mimicked his behaviors. But the absolute worst, **the worst of ALL OF THESE THINGS**, was in a relationship I had 4 years ago. In addition to all the other types of abuse, for the first time I was sexually abused by someone who claimed to love me. I partook in using psychedelic drugs often with him. I was cheated on and given an STI by this man. The emotional torture he put me through put the rest of all of these other experiences to shame. As I am typing this I feel my face get hot and my heart pound because it was so traumatizing and I still don't know how to process it. 

Did my parents play a role in why I chose to be around such toxic and abusive people? Absolutely. Did my core issues of codependency start with my relationships with my parents? Yep, definitely. But did they *continuous abuse me* while I was being abused by all of these other people? **No.** They actually were the only place I felt I could turn to because *they were still safer than the other people outside of my family who abused me.*

So where do I go when all I read about are parents being the awful ones that caused CPTSD? Where do I go when I have a much more adult and healthy relationship with my parents today? That because I've been able to implement healthy boundaries with them and they respect me as an adult and don't continue to abuse me, I don't feel like I belong here.

The worst of my CPTSD symptoms, especially the emotional flashbacks, come from all these other people, especially my abusive relationships. My current issues with self-worth and invalidation came primarily from these toxic people **outside** of my family. My fawn/flight responses fully developed from my abusive relationships, and not because of my parents. 

Where are the spaces that I can be in where I can feel fully heard and accepted because my CPTSD isn't completely tied to my parents? Is there a place for me? I'm in CoDA and AA and do a lot of work there to feel connected to others. But I just want to know who else on here feels this way because I have to imagine I cannot be the only one."
I'm tired of being tired all the time...,1,mgl3bs,2,"I have trouble sleeping a LOT of the time, and even more trouble sleeping ""well."" Sometimes I have nightmares, sometimes they're about things that happened, sometimes they're entirely dream based, sometimes I'm not sure if they're real or not. 

This past week or so I managed to sleep when the sun was still down once, and that was last night. The day before I didn't sleep at all, and i had intended to stay awake the whole day to hard reset my sleep schedule. But I wound up passing out around one in the afternoon for several hours. What's worse is I had plans that day and I totally missed them because I just couldn't stay awake. 

But even with that, I managed to fall asleep around two or three in the morning and slept until around seven. But it's a quarter after ten and I'm struggling to stay awake again. 

It's like I have this deep, existential tiredness that permeates my entire life, and no matter how much I sleep, it won't go away. The fact that it's also just one of the ""smaller"" symptoms I experience on a daily basis makes it that much worse..."
Does it get better?,3,mgjfo2,2,"Hi!!
I am 20 years old and have now freshly been diagnosed. I have spent a long time trying to figure out whats wrong with me or whether im insane and it feels good to have a diagnosis now to help me validate the ways i have been struggling. I am starting therapy in a few weeks and i am really happy about that. Still i am a little scared. These events ive experienced and situations i have lived in long term have such a big grip on my brain most of the time and I guess I am just a little worried as to whether you can even move past something like that. I want to be a functioning person and I am quite looking forward to my life especially now that I have some distance from most of those traumatic events and circumstances, but its so hard to imagine being healthy and coping fine. I guess what I am asking is: can anybody who has worked through at least a bit of their trauma and seen what comes after that process tell me about that? And do you get to a point where you feel healed or do you always stay scarred and broken? I like to think I will be okay someday and I am quite hopeful, but I have never heard the perspective of somebody who has already started or finished that process. Thank you for reading!"
"DAE find that reparenting their inner child feels ""wrong"" because it feels like an act of ignoring and bulldozing over ""how the world works""?",48,mgk0wo,15,"Some point along the way trauma became equal to ""how the world is."" My mind's playing games because: 

* The og parenting behind the trauma was the brush that painted the way the world works. 

* In replacing the og parenting with my own parenting, my nervous system still thinks my og parenting perception of the world is true and fixed even though I changed the ""brush"" I'm painting with now, so to speak. 

Whew the explanation was the most unclear lol. In other words: 

As a child, OG parenting determined perception of world. So logically, new parenting now should change my perception of world. Not the case. My nervous system's convinced my perception of the world is divine truth. The cause-effect relationship's reversed with my existing perception deciding my parenting instead of what it was before. 

The answer is challenging beliefs and changing the way I feel about things. I think? No one told me it would be this hard. :("

It's not hard to understand if you're able to have at least a little empathy, and a basic understanding of mental health topics like depression."
DAE Not Know Their Triggers?,2,mgjyeu,11,I have no idea what my triggers are or could be and I don't know how to find out what they are. If anyone else knows about this I would appreciate some advice.
"Hey guys, this week sucks. You guys sharing makes me feel less lonely about my problems so here goes:",32,mgjqv6,14,"It’s 4 days before my partners birthday, and 12 before mine. Except we won’t be spending it together because I kicked him out of my life for the millionth time. He started to make fun of my tears again, saying I “Cry on the drop of a hat”, telling my dog “Why don’t you tell your depressed mom to take you on a walk??”, and just 20 min ago... “I’m so sick of hearing about your depression all the time!”. I don’t understand why I can still love people that treat me like this. Trying to be strong and only allow people that want what’s best for me in my life but I feel like I struggle at every corner. 

I’m going to stay single for a while and I’ve personally decided that maybe trying EMDR for my CPTSD symptoms might help me out. I’ll post in a few months after the sessions if I try it. I’m just tired of feeling so unstable all the time. The 17th was the 1yr anniversary of my younger brothers suicide and its just been a shit month. 

I’ve decided to try to break away from self-medicating with weed after I run out and I am terrified. Any advice on that front would be appreciated. 

Anyways.. just wanted to let you guys know that your posts make me feel better on a daily basis. I feel like we’re one big family kind of. In the sense that we all have very specific types of pain and trauma that’s hard for the rest of the world to understand it seems. Everyone I’ve ever disclosed to that my bio dad raped me for 8mo of my teenage life has made me feel disgusting, like I should’ve tried harder to leave, or that I was making it up. Seeing your stories makes mine feel validated. Bc some of the stuff I’ve read on here is too horrible to make up and I just wanted to let you guys know that your story is valid! The pain was real. The trauma and suffering was real too and if people in your life don’t understand/respect that then they don’t need to be there. 

Stay strong friends, healing and better days is possible for all of us💚.

CPTSD was well-designed for a different era of human life,825,mghpwa,99,"I am sure that some of you must have had the same thought process as me, as we have learned about CPTSD, attachment disorder, etc: ""Why the hell would I have learned these behaviors that are SO counterproductive to a happy life?? Surely there must be a smarter way to adapt that doesn't leave me afraid of other people, attracted to abusive folks, unable to do daily life tasks..."" My therapist tells me repeatedly that they protected me as a child from an unsafe environment. But something else clicked for me as I've been reading Pete Walker's Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving (great book btw).

**CPTSD was designed for an era of human life that was VERY different from the modern world.** Given we've only been living this way (single-generation families in a home, highly mobile, highly independent in adulthood) for a few dozen to a hundred years - less in many countries - the reality is that we are adapted for a totally different social configuration. And humans are EXTREMELY social creatures, we regulate each other emotionally, we fit into a greater social machine, because even in the modern era, you literally cannot survive without someone taking care of you into adulthood. And a hundred, thousand, 10,000 years ago that was infinitely more true: to be rejected from the tribe, family, or village was tantamount to death.

Today, you are raised by one or two parents, sometimes with no other familial or friendly adults around. Pete Walker talks about ""safe enough"" or ""good enough"" relationships: many children these days are raised with zero of these, a guaranteed path to CPTSD. Historically, you would be raised by a group: aunts, uncles, grandparents, parents, cousins, neighbors, older siblings, etc. You would have daily exposure to a wide range of adults who cared about you, so even if your parents weren't great, you had the opportunity to healthily connect elsewhere. Nowadays with our isolated nuclear families and hyper-mobile tendency to move away from extended family, you get ONE shot for solid upbringing - your parent(s), with some lucky enough to have engaged grandparents or extended family or teachers - which are sometimes enough to prevent CPTSD from occurring or reduce the severity. And for as much as we malign parents for leaning on schools to help raise kids, human children were *never* meant to be raised by only one or two individual people, especially not people working 40+hrs a weeks. This is a great recipe for neglect at the very minimum.

Okay, so that explains why CPTSD is more prevalent these days. But what makes it well-designed? When I think about 500, 1000, 10000 years ago, and ask what kind of situation would a child have to be in to be as severely neglected and/or abused as many are in these modern isolated, stressful ""families"", they were very different from what is apparently just normal in modern times. If you were born a slave, member of a low caste, or servant in a village or society that treated such people as sub-human citizens, being surrounded by fearful, emotionally distant adults and having a life punctuated by abuse would have been the appropriate context because as an adult that wouldn't change: you would need to be fearful, subservient, and self-critical in order to survive and thrive. To be confident, secure, and willing to speak your mind or protect yourself from abuse could have gotten you killed or severely punished. If you were born a female in a society that had (has...) very deferent, subservient roles for women, it's the same issue: CPTSD is actually the ""correct"" model of upbringing to prevent you from being disowned or ostracized, which would have been the most dangerous thing possible. To embrace abusers, to dissociate from your true self and the pain you experience, and to people-please would actually be the safest form of personality in these kinds of scenarios. Human evolution favors that which helps you survive to reproduce. These would be ""adaptations"" needed to survive the life you were born into, not ""maladaptations"" as they are in the modern world where you can just *move away* from your abusive family and never talk to them again, and start a new life without their influence. Such a thing was never so easy until the last few decades, and has completely changed the script of a typical human life.  These adaptations would have even helped you be more comfortable in your situation, as dissociation and leaning into your bad circumstances can be less painful than internally flailing against them your whole life.

The loss of the ""village"" to raise children has been critically damaging to modern society, leaving children adrift to gamble solely on the suitability of their direct parent(s) to model healthy attachment and behavior. CPTSD, while infinitely frustrating to those of us trying to work through it now as adults in *completely* different contexts than we were prepared for as children, made much more sense in the historical context that we evolved in, when childhood and adulthood would likely see a very similar treatment of the same person, unlikely to move away from their birthplace.

These are just my musings as I work through my own journey and try to make sense of my own conditioning. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
CPTSD education for loves ones,7,mghi9x,4,"So, I was having a discussion with my therapist about how much the discovery of CPTSD has changed my life -- finally there's a word for 'whats wrong with me?' and that word is 'trauma.' I've been plugging through the Pete Walker book, and sometimes I find it a little dry and disorganized, but that's due to the nature that most of this book began as independent articles. I find the book a little dry even when the subject matter pertains to me and my situation, I cannot imagine asking him to read the entire thing just so he can help understand -- it's just too much for the support person upon introduction to CPTSD.


Recently my husband and I were talking and he said something along the lines of being aware when I'm disregulated because I'm ""not quit yourself"" and my logic tends to be pretty ridiculous. He said ""I can see you struggling, but I don't even know what's happening to you or what happened to you (because nobody is really themselves when they're in the throws) and I feel helpless because I don't know what to do or how to help."" 


And so, I was wondering if any of you have been able to find materials to help with a ""crash course to the wonky traumatized brain"" that might be easier to understand for an outsider. 

Regardless of what critics and voices tell us, we are loveable. We are doing a good job. We're worthy. And there are supportive people who want to help us feel better. Every day is a good day."
I held a man as he died exactly 1 year after my dad died,88,mggo2o,5,"When I was 12 my father died in tragic circumstances. He was stabbed to death. It was 2010. I'll make up a date. 26th August for instance

When I was 13, on the 26th of August I was walking to school when I saw a man collapse. I was alone, I ran to him and uses the raised road blocks as leverage to get him on his back. I put my arms around his shoulders. He'd cut his head. He tried to speak to me, he looked me In the eye and died.

I fainted, then called an ambulance. I found a man jogging who helped me and put his arm around me and walked me to school. I was in shock.

I was never explicitly traumatised by that mans death. I don't believe in destiny, but it was a very weird coincidence. 

I felt it was comforting. I couldn't be there for my fathers final moments, but I was there for this man."
First time In months I actually feel something positive without alcohol or drugs.,16,mgg75g,2,"After years of suppressing and neglecting my trauma, I am facing it. Honesty, I either felt anxiety, depression or numb for months since starting to face my trauma.

That was until I setup a vision board. I put on it Goals. I put on it some details on how trauma has shaped me and what I need to do to try reverse unhealthy behaviour. I have taken action to set boundaries and cut people off who were causing me to relive trauma. I also became open with those close to me that I am going through this. It took some time for me to process all that, but tonight I am finally feeling good, like I am moving forward and making progress. To feel relaxed and quite content while working hard on my trauma, that’s a big deal to me and I wanted to share.

I would really recommend a vision board for anyone."
Has anyone read Coping with Trauma Related Dissociation and The Body Keeps Score?,3,mgg6w4,4,"I struggle with dissociation quite a bit. It definitely interferes with my ability to focus and enjoy the good things in life.

Ugh...

Just as background, I've tried going NC because she's been emotionally abusive(although I'm still trying to accept that's what it was) and neglectful my whole life. I pretty much blame her for practically every reason I have CPTSD because if it wasn't for her stupid actions and decisions I wouldn't have ever had to deal with any of those things... Basically, I've paid the ultimate consequences for her decisions. And I've also never told her this altogether... I'm not really sure how to, but I also know that I'm sick of her being in the dark and being so oblivious.

NSFW!!

It's a long story, but the main points are;

*that my son had some sort of emotional breakdown, unbeknownst to me.

*he was suicidal, and became violent with me. 

* after (physically) fighting with me over trying to prevent him from hurting himself...

*he committed suicide last Thursday.

Arrangements have been made after the M.E. released his body, and plans are underway for a service. It's overwhelming, and my daughters and others close to him are beyond traumatized. There are so many moving pieces, so many emotions and I'm numb. I took a hot soaking bath last night after realizing I hadn't bathed since before his suicide. I didn't realized how tense and knotted up I was. I'm still sore after trying to fight for his life, and losing. 

He had never been violent towards me in all the years he struggled emotionally and with addiction. Not once, not ever. That's what is so incongruous. He wasn't high, he had finished rehab a week earlier. He had just started working again after being unemployed for a couple of years. He looked great, with a bit of a tan from working outside for a week. He was dropped off by the rest of the crew he had worked with in another part of the state, and hours later he was dead. 

I realized he had hidden my phone, and drove to my neighbors and they called 911. Then three or four law enforcement agencies showed up. The SWAT team, a huge RV with negotiators, an armored vehicle, bullhorns, state police, town police, sheriffs department, the road blocked off at both ends... Finally ending when they decided to enter the house after 4 or 5 hours, and found him dead. It was the middle of the night by the time I was allowed back into my house. I spent the rest of the night and most of Friday mopping up, literally.

it feels incomprehensible. My wife (his Mama) committed suicide two years ago. He never recovered from it, and blamed himself. My other children are traumatized, inconsolable... bereft, and I know I must be too. I just cant feel anything, except responsible for failing to protect him from himself."
Exercise makes Symptoms Worse?,20,mgf2jb,17,"5 years ago I was attacking the gym 5-6x a week and eating a ton and was generally happy.  

Then I began long distance training, lost weight, casually smoked marijuana, and then got slammed with a stalking incident that caused PTSD and compounded my CPTSD from childhood (shock and attachment traumas). 

I developed brain fog, GERD, insomnia, fatigue, etc.  I was trying to lift 4-6x a week to get my strength back that I lost prior to distance training and it seemed to make it worse. 

So I stopped training for a year.  The past month I began training again and made the bone head move of lifting 5x a week. The catch is my strength was coming back but knee pain and a ton of body aches most in legs and it’s seemed to cause insomnia and anxiety spikes again with some fun added in the form of hopeless despair. 

Has anyone been an athlete and experienced this? Any science to what’s happening and how to remedy ? Seems similar to overtraining syndrome but caused by mental stress as well."
"My family is moving across the country and although I’ve wanted nothing more than to move out, I cannot seem to handle this",3,mgewam,2,"** Trigger Warning: Suicidal Idealization **

I’ve always planned on moving out of my parents house as soon as possible. I graduated college during Covid so staying home was the most viable option. When everything was over, I planned on moving out to my own place, even a state away. However I never wanted to be more than an hour or two away. 

My parents just retired and moved yesterday across the country. I’m talking a 20 hour drive. They took my little sister with them and although we are years apart, she’s my rock. I’ve been crying since yesterday. 

When I was thinking of moving it was fine, but now I feel abandoned. I can’t stand to read other posts that say “mommy and daddy won’t be here forever”. I have nothing tying me down here, except a mediocre-at-best relationship with someone who has told me they “couldn’t handle it” when I cried about my parents relocating. (I’ve always attracted the emotionally unavailable types). 

I guess I don’t really know what I’m asking. I want to move down near them, again about an hour away at most. But I’m afraid I’ll be stuck in this cycle. I’ve always figured I’d off myself when my parents pass away. Now is a great time to learn to be an independent person but I never had that foundation.

I just got back into therapy and my therapist sucks so I can’t even look to her for support. I feel like the rock and the hard place is always *needing* my family and being my own person."
Advice wanted: supporting someone.,22,mgelvh,10,"Hi all, hope everyone is coping okay.

Recently my girlfriend has been diagnosed with C-PTSD. She’s currently an inpatient in a psychiatric unit, she’s been there about 4 weeks now. She should be coming home some time next week.

Things that she struggles with is SH urges, suicidal thoughts, nightmares, dissociation, trouble regulating emotions and lately some pretty big panic attacks. I think the road ahead is going to be really difficult for her, this stay has uncovered a lot of trauma that needs addressing so I understand it’s not going to be easy. 

Her family that she lives with most of the time aren’t very supportive and have caused some of said trauma. I’m unsure how to support her while she is there, I can’t be there 24/7, I know she is safe while I’m there but I’m unsure if she will be safe when I’m not. We spend a fair amount of time at my home too and there’s never been any issues. It gives me a lot of anxiety her being at her home. 

She’s currently starting a few new medications as well which I hope starts to help a little because the past 2 weeks or so have been really really rough for her.

I’m also curious as to what therapies people have found helpful in addressing trauma related stuff? Just so I can see if I can find any therapists near me that might be able to help. 

Thanks in advance anyone who gets back to me."

There's always a scream bubbling up just under the surface,29,mgd0qn,9,"I need to yell. Just, yell. I need to drive somewhere where no one can hear me, be it in a soundproof room or an empty mountain forest or in the middle of the desert at midnight, and lose my mind for a couple minutes. I need to just go until my lungs don't have any more air and my vocal cords give out. Every day I can feel it caught in my throat, the mother of all screams, just itching to come free. It's been building up in there for years now, curing, ripening, aging like milk. Every time I discover some new breed of bullshit it gets harder to contain. The way I'm writing this probably sounds a bit tongue-in-cheek but I'm dead serious. And late at night, when I'm all alone, when nobody sensible should be awake, it gets even worse. Maybe it sounds weird or childish, but I crave that kind of release like you wouldn't believe. To just expel it - the pain, the anger, the frustration, the confusion, the whatever else, all of it - in a primal screech that would probably get the police called if I did it anywhere within a 10-mile radius of somewhere populated. Which is why I can't do it now, because I haven't been able to properly get away and I don't want the neighbors to think someone's being eviscerated with a spoon.

There's so much on my mind. Just so, so much. So much shit. Every day I wake up and think thoughts. I can't even properly articulate the way I feel, as much as I wish I could, but standing in the middle of the desert and roaring like a feral ape-man ought to do. You know? You feel me? At this point I don't think there's any more accurate way to vocalize the burnt spaghetti mess clogging up my skull other than ***""AAAAAAAAAA-""***. I am at my limit, hanging by a thread, burning at both ends if you will, and I've been there for a *while.*

Being there for a struggling partner when you’re still recovering yourself,4,mgcyg1,1,"My boyfriend and I both have CPTSD, but I am in a better place right now than he is. He has gotten by through distractions such as work and socializing, and he has had periods of being in a seemingly okay place. The problem is his coping mechanisms aren’t sustainable, especially since he hasn’t been able to socialize and his work situation has been more stressful. 

Because I’m interested in learning about different treatments and general ways to improve things I struggle with, I read books on trauma treatment and things related to the brain. His experience with treatment has just been CBT awhile ago (which didn’t work and possibly made things worse for him) and anxiety medication. I know there are lots of things left for him to try that could be helpful and we do occasionally chat about things I read, but he is possibly at a place where anything other than his normal routine is too much and therefore reluctant to try things. 

I don’t try to push it, because it’s his decision, but I’m worried about him, and, unfortunately, it’s also impacting my mental well being. The neglect I experienced as a child was partially due to my dad not ever doing anything about his mental health problems, and so the echoes of this can be triggering at times. It’s particularly disruptive because it triggers the irritation and resentment I have felt towards my dad, rather than the compassion or patience I would hope to feel. 

People need to recover in their own time, but does anyone have advice on how to be there for them without it taking its toll on your own health, particularly when you’re in recovery yourself?"
Finally I know what I have. Some questions for you,3,mgcujb,9,"I’m so glad I found this sub and the book ‘From surviving to thriving’. I’ve suffered for years, and tried like everything.

- My body is 24/7 in some sort of flight or fight mode, even though my thoughts are calm most of the time. Any advice to heal the body?

I think my mother may be in some kind of cult? It's weird.,8,mgc921,7,"I do not know where to ask this, and I hope this is okay to post on here. I have CPTSD and this is probably related to that, as it deals with my mother and upbringing, but it's not focused on the CPTSD aspect of things. 

Basically, I explained YouTube to my Mom 5 years ago and she managed to join a Cult and become racist. 

Trigger warning for

Religion/Cult/Christianity, Homophobia, Sexism, Racism, Drugs, Qanon content 


This has been very confusing to deal with. 

Before I moved out of my mother's house 5 years ago, I introduced her to the Internet. I was hoping she might find a new hobby or some friends, and gurl did not disappoint. 

She's always been a very religious person, and carries alot of unaddressed trauma herself. So she is very anti-everyone, feels 'out of this world' and has a hard time connecting to people even though she is (usually) a very kind person. She is a widow. Throughout my childhood my family was politically leaning very, very far left. Though my Sister and mother are very much 'conservative' now. We live in Germany. 

For those past years I've gone low contact with her. But I just became a mother myself, and met her to set some boundaries around her seeing her grandchild. Since then she has been sober and clean, and started going to therapy for her depression. It's been going very Allright. 
But every now and then she would tell me about her new religious beliefs. I wasn't opposed to listen, though my cult senses kept tingling because they have a 'prophet' lady and keep talking about Armageddon. I told her so, but she disagreed. 
Shortly before covid got to our country she started frequently talking about the world ending, which spiraled into Qanon territory. And, whelp. 

[trigger territory] 

Her phrophets Youtube channel was banned for homophobic content, and she angrily complained to me about the lack of freedom of speech. 
Now she's telling me that being Gay is not allowed, but God forgives me for being bi/confused (she doesn't really believe I'm bi), as I am engaged to a man and have already fulfilled my duty on earth, aka breeding. Women are biologically inferior to men and do right by obeying them, and obviously jews are bad and pedophiles. Also, her therapist works for the medical industry, so she's just telling him what he wants to hear and doesn't actually do therapy. 
I'm sure you can imagine that this was a terrible car ride. 

[end] 

I'm pretty set on this being a cult. They tick most boxes on what a cult is, luckily only online and no money (yet) attached. She might be spiraling into some psychotic territory, though I feel that is speculation. But, most importantly, I don't want racist/homophobic/anti feminist talk around my daughter. Especially from someone she will grow very close to if we keep seeing her as frequently as we do rn, which is at least once a week. We had an agreement on her seeking out therapy, which she isn't actually doing. And I don't want my kid to be scared that grandma might be right about us all dying and demons coming to earth, or mom and dad not being allowed in heaven and so on. I don't trust her to hold that back around my child. 

Now I'm torn on how to deal with this. I will probably just talk to her openly and tell her what I think. But I am scared to pull the ""if you don't do [x] you can't see your grandchild on a frequent basis"" again. It feels like I am blackmailing her, but I also feel very valid on wanting to protect my family from this.
I'm also scared that she might decide that we are not worth it, aka my abandonment wound is flaming up.

Any advice is appreciated."

After graduating everyone will go their way, live in a way which resonates with their parents and family and they will simply all have a sense of self.

Who will I be afterwards? I’m so afraid to even become someone right now, because afterwards a different lifestyle and attitude will be expected from me. I will graduate and then be completely lost and alone again.

Not talking in therapy,21,mgaav5,23,"Is it ok to hand my therapist a note instead of talking directly about something? There is a huge, very difficult subject I’d like to discuss in therapy, but I don’t know how to share that. There seems to be a built-in mechanism in me that keeps me from taking about it, there is quite a lot of shame too. I thought that maybe if my therapist new the basic problem, she could help me talk about it. But since I can’t say it out loud I thought I could write it down and hand it to her. Is it a good idea? Is it going to be therapeutic? Or is it only valid if I can say it out loud? But then again I fear I will never talk about it, and it’s something that is rotting in me. And I think that maybe if she learns the basic truth of what happened and it’s no longer my best kept secret maybe I’ll be able to talk about it? Do any of you have a similar experience?"

TW: emotional abuse, verbal abuse, bad grammar ( I cheated my way to graduating pls be gently) 

 I told my mom how I felt about her and how she made me feel. And the whole truth this time. It was so much I thought I was going to throw up multiple times on my drive back home. I was sobbing and emotional and it was undoubtedly the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. These last five years practically my whole childhood that I can faintly remember bc I’m 19. My mother has built me up just break me down and do it all over again. 

 It went over Surprisingly well it’s most likely due to having multiple break through (exhaustive traumatic arguments) before laying everything out. The last 2 years we’ve had arguments  about small things but it was getting to be a bit much after beating around it too long. I just had to tell her everything she put me through. Although to be fair I have tried to call her out many many times before but she shut me down really quickly. It’s just now recently she’s even been letting me talk 20-30 seconds at a time. Which is really big progress compared to relentlessly cutting me off and telling me how I feel.

She was being genuinely motherly and apologetic. Towards the end of the conversation she starting falling into old patterns but I’ll take what I can get. The true test is in the next argument does she defend herself or trust my feelings and recognize them as valid.  It all felt so unreal as if an alien possessed my mother or something.

After that conversation I felt so deeply disturbed and uncomfortable. Do I just forget the trauma and move on? Do I treat her like she’s a perfect mom now? I thought I would feel better than this. I thought I would be healed. This doesn’t feel like happiness though..

Fast forward to now

She just got into a whole argument outside my door with my step dad about the car keys. He couldn’t find them and he told her. Although she doesn’t drive anymore it’s only me and him. 

So instead of communicating that him asking her that irritates her because she feel the better option would to be to ask me the other driver. She goes on a rant about how irresponsible we are with the keys and how he should just be a man and look. He needs to go to the source. To use his brain and use common sense because he’s lazy and not a real man. All this is in a grated angry yelling  tone. All while telling him how he feels. 

She says he needs to communicate with me. (Very mockingly) surprisingly he doesn’t fly off the handle probably due to the incessant 4 hour no exaggeration rants where she breaks you down and doesn’t let you leave or walk away until she’s convinced you and herself she’s right. And if you’d do your disrespectful and you just added another hour and she won’t let it go for at least a year. 

Seeing her argue in a conversation that I wasn’t in gave me so much clarity on how skewed her perception of information she’s given is viewed. 

Even in a everyday example you say something, she gets defensive, and repeats it back in a condescending mocking tone as if you said it exactly like that. Now your wondering did I say it like that?? Then tells you how you feel? And your like is that is that  how I feel??? 

And I have to sit back and listen to the arguing as per usual outside my door because if I mention it. I’m taking his side and “intervening on her marriage”. And to top it all off with a cherry on top she forces him to apologize to her 

I would describe a relationship with my mother as walking on a tightrope or essentially waiting for the other shoe to drop. I’m really really tired. I feel like I’m in a relationship with a awful boyfriend. He swears ups and down he’s going to change and ultimately you see a little progress but that person is still that person at their core. And they don’t even know they are.

Maybe she’ll never change ? Or maybe I just need to be more patient. Idk I just feel kind of stupid. Like I was conned or something. Why did I even try!!!????"
DAE get paranoid that you are the abusive one?,125,mg91ja,39,"Met with a new therapist and she described one of my experiences as being “stalked.” I described what happened and she said, “You were stalked.” And then later in the evening I had a panic attack about whether or not I am actually a stalker because I have a former flame I text/email about once a year or so. If i can’t recognize it when it’s happening to me, maybe I’m doing it too? 

I’ve noticed this also happens with abuse stuff. Whenever I talk about my trauma, and either call it abuse or if someone else does, I’ll later get paranoid that I am actually the abusive one. 

Does anyone else do this?"

Were they ever a friend?,2,mg8ly5,3,"TW; Emotional abuse, emotional harm, mental breakdown 

I recently have had some major “can of worms” reopened due a friend’s partner. A little backstory. This friend was my best friend, was my confidant, was someone I generally trusted. I can’t say I feel the same today. They’re partner gas-lighted me for almost 2 months before I realized the signs. This person dragged my character down, ripped my voice out, and swayed any and all they could that knew me. They even went so far as to comment on things like my sleeping schedule, who I was playing with, and so on. I felt trapped all over again, like I couldn’t go or do anything without this person ripping me apart. 

I was having to take anxiety meds just to even deal with this person. I was breaking down daily and I was losing my sanity. My friend ended up breaking a trust by telling their partner all that I confided in her. This person then proceeded to rip me apart even more by telling me I shouldn’t be telling or stressing out my friend. That all I was doing was stirring up drama by confiding in her. In a sense I stopped calling this friend my best friend and now I can’t trust her at all. 

This person caused several friends to abandon me and one straight up lied to me and stole from me yesterday and I was so full of rage and anguish that I was in and out of tears. They have said so much and caused so much damage that I have this feeling this person wants me dead. Why else would they continue to stir up all this drama when I haven’t responded anymore. I’ve done everything I can to be far far away from this person."
[ TW COVID] I’m reaching out to see if anyone can share information (personal or medical) about getting the Covid vaccine if I’m still sick with long haul.,2,mg7v0r,1,"Hi, to start off, I am not an anti vaxxer, but I’m posting this question here because you’ve all been amazing with support when I’ve posted in the past. I’m feeling uncertain about getting the vaccine for long haul reasons, for mental illness and the benzo/antipsychotics I take, and because I have childhood trauma related to being given medications from someone I don’t trust based on information that is still being studied. 

Two reasons:
1. I have long haul, still sick and have been reading (reputable) articles with mixed answers. And also answers that “no” professionals really don’t know about the vaccine and long haulers. Everyone is still learning about this world pandemic. 

2. I have a mental illness that requires me to take benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and antidepressants. I’ve done as much research as I can and the meds I take have not been used in trials. I know it’s unlikely there would be an interaction, but when I start hallucinations and a voice speaks to me through my headphones... I’m not willing to risk it. 

If anyone has the same questions, gotten answers, or done your own research it would be great if you could share!

Stay healthy 😘"
Does that feeling ever go away of wanting to contact your past abuser and ask them to apologize or aknowledge the damage they have caused in your life?!,20,mg7pmy,12,"Soo from 17 to around 23 I was in an abusive relationship with a narc.. he was either the best man I knew who took excellent care of me when I was sick with chronic illness issues, or the worst person I'd ever met.. this wasn't easy for me to realize at the time because I had grown up in an abusive household.

Its been 8 or so years I just realized, and it still feels very raw sometimes.. the flashbacks, the nightmares.. and random days of sadness, it all still hits me.

Why does this still make me want to contact this person to let them know just how much they have hurt me. ( I know this will only probably make them happy from what I've learned now) so it's obviously not going to help me but it just pisses me off that someone can cause so much havock in someone's life and then go on about theirs and be just fine. 

I know I'm not alone here, any tips?!"
Medical neglect,6,mg7net,7,"Just a big fat trigger warning. 
Self harm. Medical neglect  

So forget the fact that my mom neglected my mental health for years. Cancelled therapy appointments that my school forced her to make after the school threatened to baker act me. And cancel therapy appointments I begged for after telling her I wanted to die on multiple occasions. Or her ignoring all my attempts to make her care about me. Or when I overdosed on Tylenol all the time and when I eventually confessed to her she responded with ""I know""  
Yeah forget all that. 
Let's start on a fresh slate and say she's been forgiven of all that for some wonderful (sarcasm here) reason. 

I've been gaining weight like crazy for several years now. I've always been sensitive to tempatures. Always been crazy depressed or anxious. I always suspected my thyroid was slow. And told my mom I needed to get it checked. She never took me to the doctor. Well I also have memory problems. I went to the doctor today. O have thyroid problems. 

So quest diagnostics has this cool thing where you can look at your test results. Including past ones. Including ones from when I was 15. I checked the blood work. The only blood work ever taken of me, I might add. I have a slow thyroid. But did we ever follow up. Nope. Did I ever get treatment. Nope. 

I'm so angry and hurt. And I cant say anything because it's pointless. There will be some reason why we never went back Or she will deflect it. Or even somehow blame it on me. Or she will get upset and call my dad saying I'm attacking her. So he will just call me and yell at me for yelling at her. 

I'm at a losing battle. Not only did she ignore my mental health which most of the world ignores. She also ignored my physical health. But she didn't ignore my siblings. They went to the doctor regularly. I didn't. I always got cancelled. 

I'm just hurt."
How can I stand up for myself without getting into emotional fight?,3,mg7gox,3,"I had my roommate who confront me about text message I sent her the other day. She had a problem with my pan being laid around the stove and counter top before so I put my used pan in the cabinet where all the pans and pots are at. I wasn't done with my pan so I didn't want to put it in the sink and I wanted to put it in reachable space. She got angry at me and texted me saying ""please do not put your pan in cabin and dont let it happen again. it is disgusting"" I thought she was being hateful for no reason when I didn't think it was a such a big deal. I didn't know what her expectation was about having clean space when I was literally complying her request by putting it somewhere else. so me thinking it wasn't such a big deal I thought she was being unreasonable hateful towards me and taking her stress out on me because of her school. I shoot her back and said ""maybe if you stop taking your stress out on people, not everything is as detrimental as It seems. just an advice."" And she got FLIPPED OUT and started attacking me verbally over text and said i'm not in the place to give her advice when I mixed dirty pans are with clean ones. I mean I get she didnt like the fact that she found dirty pan in cabinet but it seemed overly critical of her to send aggressive text message when I put pan in cabinet for her because she complained about it being in her sight?? She asked me to have a. talk with me today because she was pissed about how ""disrespectful"" my text was.

When she started complaining about how offended and angry she was, (even though I never intend to to upset her that much and just wanted her to back off and stop texting me about small issue around kitchen.), I couldn't stand up for myself and say she shouldn't be so aggressively sending messages about pan being in the certain place when  she never set a clear expectation of how things are supposed to be in the kitchen in the first place. it was very confusing for me when she started to get mad at me for things not being in the right place and then get mad at me for defending myself on her negative text. I just stood there when she kept on yapping about how annoyed she was and how unacceptable it was to put pan in cabinet and what I said to her in the text. my brain kinda froze in the moment when she was spitting out her words and I didn't know how to respond to her. now that im looking back at it she said a lot of things that aren't even relevant to our issue and she had a very strong opinions about how she interpreted the situation SOLEY based on her perspective and needs. She said what I sent her was unacceptable and people. aren't going to be nice to me if I talk that way. UMMM maybe because I was mad at your insensitive text and you sent me rude text first?  When I told her how insensitive her text sounded like when she said it was disgusting, she practically yelled at me and said it was disgusting. I didn't know how to react or what to say and got immediently quite after she raised her voice. I don't know why I couldn't just take control of the situation and tell her my opinion in an assertive manner. (And tell her to keep her tone down.) I always regret and beat myself up for not saying things that I needed to say in the moment after the interaction. Now I feel like I am falsely accused and im angry at myself for letting her  walking all over me without trying to understand from my perspective. I was basically going along with whatever she was saying and could not express any form of emotions when I had different opinion. It was extremely hard to find a right moment to speak my mind when she was talking without a break. I didn't want to come off rude or cut her off so I just kept quite and listened until she finished talking, but I feel like I should have been more assertive and expressing what I actually think  when she pushing her point of view on what happened. I didn't know how to oppose to her opinions when she had such a strong opinion about me and what I did. Most of all I was afraid of possible conflict that could arise if she got upset with me. I hate dealing with people who want to complain to me.  Why can't I be confident in expressing my emotions and needs? I need to figure out how to validate myself while I'm finding a common ground with people in situations."
What do your weekly therapy appointments look like for you?,2,mg7dcj,7,"I've been in therapy a little over a year now, we started doing emdr around Mayish of 2020. We've done mostly emdr since but we've also done some other exercises that required bilateral stimulation such as resetting emotional circuits. I go every week for an hour and a half and my current appointments are almost always emdr, it feels like when we meet up my therapist basically asks ""what do you want to do emdr for today?"". I don't like doing emdr tbh, but I look at is as a chore that I have to do to get better. Still, I wonder if there's something that's missing. I love just traditional talk therapy but at the start of my appointments my therapist will let me kind of vent and then after a bit she'll steer us back to emdr, either recommending doing emdr for what I was talking about or letting me choose what I want to do emdr for. What do your therapy appointments looks like? How long are they? How often are you doing emdr? Just curious to hear others perspectives and experiences :)"
Realizations,2,mg6x4i,2,"I recently started seeing a new therapist and this is honestly the first time in my life I have really fully thought about how much my past trauma still effects me today. One example of this is the other day I realized for the first time that the reason I get so angry when my husband stands really close to me in a tight space is because my abuser would do the same thing and use that time to touch me inappropriately. I had literally never put two and two together. Something I also realized is that I’ve truly just been in survival mode the past 13 years of my life. The abuse I face started when I was 12 and continued till I was 18, but I still fear that it will start again. I suppose I’m just writing this so that If you’re going through this you’re not alone!"
Giving EMDR Therapy to Your Partner,2,mg6m9o,10,"Until just recently I was dating an LCSW specializing in trauma treatment. Early in our relationship there were conflicts that began abruptly and quickly became highly emotionally charged for both of us. After the second of such events my partner told me I exhibited a trauma-response (anxiety, emotional distress) and suggested she do EMDR on me. I didn't want to upset the apple cart so I went along with it to the point I had her EMDR light thing at my apartment. I was ultimately able to get out of it by saying I didn't want to do anything that may interfere with the work I'm doing with my own therapist. That was it; she agreed with me and it wasn't spoken of again. I think I know the answer to my question but this relationship had me doubting my feelings and intuition. I'm still trying to parse through it all. Was my intuition correct?

Should I just suck it up?,3,mg658z,5,"CW: suicide, maybe child abuse?

TLDR: Is it my fault for not being a good child to my parents because I feel like they traumatised me as a kid.

At 5/6 years old, I remember my father was so angry at me that he lifted me above the railings of a spiral staircase, threatening to throw me. I was crying, looking down on the maybe 5 or more floors below me, I was a toddler who thought he really wanted to kill me. He did this for reasons I no longer remember. For the rest of my life until 2 years ago, he would come home after a year working abroad, very little to no communication in between, demanding that I be a sweet, loving kid to him. Take care of him, be a submissive girl who cooks, cleans for him. And every time he will have outbursts of rage towards me since I do not meet this standard of him. This is my idea of him growing up, someone so angry at me for not being what he expects me to be.

I am depressed, anxiety ridden, almost 30, struggling to pick myself up because it’s hard to find a job during a pandemic, so I’m stuck here living with my parents. Everyday feels like a battle, I struggle to do anything, to pick up for myself, to clean, to eat. My thoughts are over run by suicidal ideation. This is a trigger to my father, who expects me not be lazy.

He had another outburst of anger last night. Telling me he spent all his life providing for me and that it was wasted. I tell him it’s just not natural for me to be what he expects me to be. This angered him more, telling me(roughly translated) ‘If you don’t change, you’ll go through me. You’ll see.’ He was smashing plates and glasses, pacing as if wanting to punch someone. This made me walk out of the conversation. My mother tried to pacify, but was barely even there. Like always.

On the other hand, I can understand why he hates me so much. They wanted me to be someone successful, they threw money at me when I needed it. He worked his but off working alone abroad. They provided food, shelter, despite being retiree age. Maybe I should have been more grateful, suck it up and fake being another person? But if I do, it feels fake and icky to me. They will sometimes try to reach out to me, but my father always ends up saying something insensitive to me that he says are jokes, and me walking away angrily.

I struggle looking them in the eye, talking to them, showing I care. It makes me feel disgusted at myself if I try to push myself to be a ‘sweet, loving girl’ when I feel like all my life I’ve been forced to. Maybe I still have resentment towards him for all the times he never apologized to me for making me feel like garbage. Reduced to an invested where he feels like he’s been scammed. 

I feel so pressured in my own life, struggling to function everyday, and I’m too weak willed to tell them this to their face lest he throws a plate directly at me this time; it’s so hard to talk to them. They are highly religious and don’t believe in mental health. They are stubborn and narrow-minded. Or am I just being whiny? But I plan to finally tell this all to him in a long letter, but I need to know before I do, am I just being over dramatic?"
Can't get excited about my baby shower,7,mg69jc,6,"Last year, I finally cut ties with my abusive father who gave me cptsd.  It was a good decision, but I've been waiting for him to finally stop ""playing along"" and confront me.  This anxiety went up ten fold when I announced I was pregnant.  I heard through the grape vine that he was posting on facebook about how much he was going to love this grandkid and how he couldn't wait to hold them.  

  
He's a pedophile, so this made me want to vomit, but it also confirmed my fears that he thinks this is just a phase that I'm going through and that I'll clearly break so my kid can have a grandfather.  


My dad loves to push boundaries in front of a crowd, because he knows I hate public drama. So I'm pretty sure if he confronts me, it's going to be at my baby shower.  This time I won't be silent, and I'll announce to however many people we can have with COVID restrictions that he's a pedophile. 

The frustrating thing is that I don't want this to be about him. I want it to be about my new family that is growing. I want it to be a happy day.  But I know even if I'm wrong, I will be tense the entire time, waiting for that damn shoe to drop."
"How harsh was it? (TW: Physical, Emotional, Verbal Abuse)",6,mg66fe,14,"It took me a while to understand how bad the abuse was at home. I’ll try to not make it too long, please bear with me...


When I was younger, my parents (mainly my dad) used to beat the mess out of me and my siblings for the smallest things, like if I made a mess at home, didn’t clean up the room, forgot to do our chores, etc. I even remember when my dad would help me do my homework, he would beat me if I kept getting the answer wrong, and at one point having bad handwriting. 


And some of these weren’t just a few beatings, some would go on for a minute and beyond. There was this one time when my younger brother stole ice cream from school, and when my dad found out from the school, he beat him for 3 cycles (beating, rest, resume beating, etc). He was covered in bruises and my mom almost called the cops on him (dad laughed at this btw).


He’d also yell at us too before the beatings (sometimes during the beatings). Like literally every time he would come to our room or come back from work, we were either shaking or frozen, and every time we talked to him we would stammer or fumble our words, then he’d yell at us for not speaking up, or would accuse us for lying (which yes, would lead to an unnecessary beating). Even as an adult now, I still find it hard to talk to my dad because of all the things he did.


The crazy and confusing thing about all this is after all that, my dad would say things like “We’re only doing this cause we love you son” or “I don’t want to see you end up like those bad kids out there.” He would even say “When you don’t do what I tell you to do, that’s why I spank you. There’s so much more examples I can put here, but I don’t want to make this too long.


I never saw these things as “wrong” growing up. In fact, I felt I deserved all that for disappointing my dad (of course my mom too, who wasn’t as intense as my dad, but still abusive nonetheless). It was hard to see him as a bad dad because he still fed us, bought us gifts and things we needed, praised us for our endeavors (good grades, graduating, getting a job, etc.) Still, these are vivid examples of abuse and gaslighting, but a part of me still thinks “it wasn’t that bad” or “others had it worse.” I just wanted to see from all your opinions of “how harsh” the abuse was, since I grew up minimizing the severity of what my parents did to me and my siblings.



Tl;dr: Physical, emotional, and verbal abuse from parents, sprinkled with acts of kindness, is making it hard for me to see “how harsh” the abuse was in my family.

Seeking the excitement of abandonment by hunting for images of my ex,44,mg5xkl,11,"Anyone else get those weird cravings to feel shitty feelings that come with excited feelings? Sometimes after 4 years of divorce I want to find my way into my wife's Instagram and look back to when we were getting divorced and see what she was writing and saying.

Why?!! Why the fuck?!! That's insane. It would bring up so much pain and feelings of abandonment. It would get my blood pumping and I'd feel like puking.

In other words it would feel like my childhood all over again. How wild is it that my brain wants to binge on that shit?

Pretty interesting to think that some part of my brain wants to do this believing it's going to get me something it needs.

I am gonna need to spend some time with my parts and work on this one. I'm glad my ex (who I get along with great now) has doesn't follow me and I don't follow her. I'm not even on IG anymore because of what a dopamine junkie I can be there.

Memory Dump [Trigger Warning],1,mg5vqt,1,"*CW: death of a loved one, alcoholism* 

Hi, long-time lurker, first-time poster. Apologies for any mistakes, and I hope this post is appropriate for this thread. 

I just got a call from my father that a really close family friend passed away. The wife of my father's best friend. I knew it would be bad news because he didn't text first to ask if I was free to talk, he just called. I don't have many childhood memories without her in them. It sucks, though, because many of those memories are actually tied to some intense traumas. My parents had me pretty young, my mom 21 and my dad 23. They weren't ready to give up their party lifestyles, especially after separating from the catholic church. M and T were their best friends; we saw them almost every weekend, but it was mostly them partying along with my aunt and uncle. Loud music, jagger shots, games, and us kids (my younger brothers and cousins) were told to stay away. Probably one of the most traumatic events I've lived through happened at M and T's wedding when I was 8. Then M got pregnant, and we stopped seeing them as much. Only at birthdays and graduations. I thought they grew up, got sober, were there for their son, giving him a wonderful life. 

Despite them partying just as much as my parents, I really idolized them. T was there when I was born, and M followed soon after. I thought they were just the coolest. I felt safer with them than I did my parents most of the time, especially M. There was just something about her. She was so beautiful, so joyful, so supportive. My hypervigilance started after their wedding, and I refused to leave the room they were partying in because I was so afraid something would happen to my parents and T and M. She would always keep me company (although in hindsight, why the f did these adults let me stay and party w them lol). But she made me feel so secure, and I knew she would keep my family and me safe. We went to their house to celebrate their son's birthday. I was playing with him in his bedroom, reading a book on his chair, and got my period and bled all over it, lol. I was so embarrassed, but she made me feel totally okay about it. I couldn't wait to have her and their family at my upcoming wedding. Although, I am only allowing enough alcohol at my wedding for people to have one beer or one glass of wine with dinner because I don't want to be triggered on my wedding day. Stems from the trauma of T and M's wedding. And my cousin's recent wedding. 

But now M is dead. From cirrhosis of the liver and kidney failure. I was jealous for so long, thinking if they could sober up and be there for their son, why couldn't my parents do the same for my brothers and me? It turns out they didn't, though. The pandemic was hard on her; she had been a heavy drinker, but this pushed her over the edge, working from home and not being able to go anywhere. Nobody knew how bad it had gotten.  It's tough because my mom almost died in November because of the same thing, but she survived and has been sober since, has healed almost miraculously, and doctors are almost shocked by how well she is doing. She will never be quite the same, of course, but she will survive. I can't believe we have now lost M to this disease. It is heartbreaking watching the effects of long-term drinking hit all my family members and loved ones. 

I will be okay. I have grown a lot, and I know I will heal from this as I have healed from other traumas. But this one has blind-sighted me. Thank you to those who read this. I feel better just by getting these thoughts out of my head. This subreddit has been so helpful to know I am not alone in what I've been through."
DAE feel like they're untying smaller knots in their web of trauma but the heavy emotional trauma mass at their core won't budge even after years of working on yourself?,364,mg5hr2,41,"This isn't something I think I can explain coherently in words. I've been in the healing game for several years and incredible changes have happened in me without a doubt. People from years ago would hardly recognize me. 

It's just...I still feel the same deep down? Fundamentally I'm this densely packed, immovable sphere of fear and shame that doesn't loosen. After hours of introspection and investigation, what that tightly packed mass really fears and how it operates eludes me still. The core feels made of poison and rottenness. I crave a cleansing light to shine through and clear it all up. I want that simplicity, lightness and purity some people seem to have naturally. That simplicity that remains clear and cohesive rather than murky and shattered into pieces. I know on a level I'm making the choice to consistently tear myself apart when I could keep myself intact but the emotional barrier to changing is so high.

I don't know how to change this mass."

My education is being impacted,8,mg4x0p,1,"I am currently in school for massage therapy, I worked extensively in the field and also worked extensively with a psychologist prior to and continue to do so while I am in school. However, I had an instructor who has proven many times that they are unfit to conduct themselves as an instructor due to their lack of trauma-informed and evidence-based research approach to therapy... I have worked very hard on what  I have been through in order to prepare myself for a very touch-based therapy. I decided to enter this profession in order to work on safe touch therapy and creating a safe space to work with those where touch has created a negative space and allow them to feel a sense of control and respect for themselves. I want more resources available to those with negative touch experiences to be able to get back in touch with their nervous systems and learn how to stabilize it when trauma responses take over. However, through that I had an instructor perform a very unnecessary and invasive technique on me without any consent. I was on the table in a paralyzed state, my trauma response is to freeze and I really did freeze when they did that. They claim themselves to be an experienced practitioner and yet they were unable to pick up on my complete rigor to my body in response to their touch. They reached between my thighs to perform the technique without informing me and asking consent. I was not only mortified, horrified, and completely terrified, but I felt so broken and put right back in my trauma experience... I was also so sad for the profession as we still had practitioners like this, not only with the general population but also educating future therapists. I also work in the bar and pub industry and a mere day later had a customer start shouting about her trauma experience, to the point that I heard my own voice coming out of their mouth in response to my trauma response... I have stopped attending this instructor's classes as of now. I also reported their conduct to the administration department and will continue to go up the chain until this is properly addressed. I am making myself so vulnerable and feel so insanely exposed, however, in no way was what this instructor demonstrating appropriate or even necessary for what we were being taught... this technique is something we breach in our 5th semester, I am only in my second... they made a very poor move and continuously show a disregard for student and patient safety... I am done letting things like this slide... I want to be an advocate for those who do not feel they have a voice and I refuse to let a therapy such as massage therapy be sullied by therapists who do not deserve the title... we won't change unless we demand change... however... I am terrified to return to their class and engaging in homework to any extent is exhausting... I am reaching out to this community for support and guidance and also just a huge hope that you are all safe and that we come together to make this world safer for those who follow us. I wish you the best and thank you for the support and I find my voice and my strength in speaking out for a safer future... much love. - Pineapplemilkshake."
Vent about my childhood abuse,5,mg4tsc,1,"When I was 3-4 years old my father was an alcoholic and so was my mother. My mom would work late at night and my dad worked day shifts so he’d take care of me during the day. 

Now one day this past year I started to become aware of the trauma I had made myself forget due to being in similar settings to where it took place. I noticed when I would be in a basement with the lights off (because my friends would mess with me as we all messed with eachother) I would start to freak out and and my stomach would drop and I’d become hysterical. 

 I brought it up to my mom and describe the dreams I was having reliving my trauma. I was tied to a pole in the basement by my dad and left down there in the dark for what I can only guess was maybe 30 minutes. I have been able to forgive since then and heal but I wanted to share my story. Turns out I was correct because I confronted my dad about it and he admitted to it. He told me he was drunk and he did that to “show me the danger of the world and all the messed up people in the world” I know it was just classic manipulation from him but I am bigger than him.

My experiences with trauma and growing up in an alcoholic household is what made me into the man I am today. I know I am strong and you are too! Thank you for listening and feel free to open up discussion or ask questions. I hope me sharing this can help in someway."
"I need help, but I don't know where to go to except here",3,mg4so0,3,"Yes, I should have started therapy, but more than that I need a support system really, really desperately. I've been prone to addiction my whole life and have also been diagnosed with two different types of eating disorders before. In terms of CPTSD, most of my friends have no idea what I'm going through. Some have, but we've grown apart. My 'closest' friend is someone who had ZERO reaction why I told her my diagnosis, and every time I bring it up she never responds in part. I think its one of those things that 'I have enough shit on my plate, don't give me yours', even though I try to listen to her every single time, and I respond to her messages she sends me every single day :((.

Recently, (I'm sure everyone has) I've been having a really tough time. On the outside, I seem to be doing well, but I'm falling behind on my studies and my work performance is lagging behind though I just began the job (there is a risk of getting fired). As said, I've always had a problem with addiction through my entire life (bad habits, escapism), but every year around high stress seasons, I default to sexual behavior. I spent 7-8 hours today sexting people (not even enjoying it, just doing to numb myself), and in between I  took a nap 'in the sunlight' on the kitchen floor, just laying there for over an hour. I have three deadlines tomorrow, none of which I have worked on today. Yesterday, I had a bit of a freeze-panic episode and when I woke up from my nap my grandma came over to me to see how I was doing randomly, and I started silently crying in front of her.

I feel like there is no one I can turn to except this group of online people that may truly understand how difficult it is to cope. Even after 'getting over the trauma', as soon as there is a daily stressor, there is no capacity for healthy stress management whatsoever. Plus, my trauma is sexual in nature, so the things I feel/think when I go through these episodes aren't only involving horniness, but guilt and inadequacy, to say the least.

I live with my Mum aside from my grandma, my dad left a while ago. My mum's hyper-religious, so I don't think I can turn to her either (not to mention I'm a closeted LGBTQ+ in my family, on top of all this difficult shit). I feel that as soon as I confide in her she will break down, and then I will break down and believe everything about God that I don't completely believe in, and go insane and start to rely on Bible verses to get through my day. I moved back home because of corona, and none of my friends are within bodily reach. I also messed up by missing one of my best friends' life changing events recently, and have been neglecting my friendships in general. Even work wise, I used to be able to stay up late into the night diligently working away, and I was a top achiever. Now? I can't even work during the day.

If anyone is interested in starting a support group or something please message me. Or anything. I feel so lost and I definitely can't be the only one."
"""You're too quiet.""",595,mg4m4v,64,"People keep commenting that I am too quiet, too shy, too passive and uninitiative. It hurts me when they say that. I don't trust people. I have the right for that, I have been abused all my life. I only got out of my abusive household almost two months ago. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Nothing excites me. I sometimes feel like I'm disabled. I can't get anything done. Everything is draining and I don't have any resources for help. I don't know what to do.  

I've been planning on making a elaborate post about my experience, but I can't seem to get it done. So this a small rant.

Emotional numbness with zoloft/sertraline,2,mg4eiu,9,"I recently started on Sertraline after having a few days where I was unable to calm myself and flipped between crying, being unable to get up, and highly frightened over nothing. I started on the 25mg and gradually made it to 75mg which seems to help me be a little clearer and assists me on not feeding on the strong emotions of my coworkers and students. I'm still connected with them of course, just not falling into a draining cycle. While talking with my doctor last visit she told me she didn't want me to become numb while taking Sertraline. After hearing that I started to look up what she meant and saw that it can create emotional numbness. I had experienced that to an extent when I had to take tylenol every day for years to manage arthritic pains (stopped daily usage because I realized I was so disconnected from my emotions). Has anyone experienced emotional numbness? Has it made you pull away from people you care(d) about?"
DAE Struggle with understanding health insurance?,8,mg49c7,8,"At 25 I'm expiring off of my parents insurance therefore I just started signing up for my own.

"Found out my uncle and his wife wanted to adopt me when I was a kid, now I can't stop thinking about the ""what if""",44,mg3qdn,7,"I had dinner with my uncle (mom's younger brother) and his wife a couple days ago. I've never been very close to anyone in my family but over the last few years I've felt a better connection with him than anyone else. I moved out of state two years ago and this is the fist time we've seen each other since then, they in town for a work conference. We started talking about our family history and a lot about my mom, which we'd never talked about in depth before. I knew she had issues, most likely borderline personality and issues because of heavy drug use before she had kids. During the conversation they told me that when I was young, around 2 or 3 years old, they wanted to adopt me and my older brother (a year and a half older) because they knew our home life was so toxic. Since my mom is they way she is, she refused any kind of help and took it as an insult. They knew we weren't being fed properly or being taken care of so my aunt would bring a cooked meal to our house, trying to be nice, and mom would start screaming and swearing at her and telling her leave. Any kind gesture from them was met this way. My dad was an alcoholic and no help at all with us kids (he also had 3 other kids and a previous marriage he abandoned in his home state when they were toddlers). My parents fought constantly, both verbally and physically, and I watched them both get arrested multiple times it would get so bad. We were very poor to the point that my mom would collect aluminum cans to cash in to buy me and my brother a happy meal at mcdonald's. My uncle and aunt knew there was no way to safely talk to my mom about letting them take care of us. She had already threatened suicide multiple times and put her brother through hell his entire life because she's always been this way and abused him growing up. Even when I was young she would tell me that if she didn't have kids to take care of she'd just kill herself. My uncle and his wife already had three boys of their own so I can only imagine the stress it would have put on them taking care of us and it kills me just knowing they wanted to try. My uncle is an amazing person who has overcome difficult times himself, but my mom has always had a jealous resentment towards him. He is doing great things for his family business and is passionate about helping kids who have troubled lives like me to get their lives on track.

I moved out of my parents house at 15 while starting to work full time at 15 as well, barely graduated high school, and worked a handful of different jobs before I eventually went through a tech school. I'm 28 now and 13 years after leaving I'm doing pretty good in life. I have a great job and an amazing girlfriend and I'm happier than ever. I still can't help thinking about the ""what if"" part of it all. How would my life had been different if they took me in and where would I be in life now if I hadn't had to fight so hard to be where I am now? Would I be better off mentally or even worse knowing that my parents gave me up because they weren't fit to take care of us? Would I have rebelled while living with them because they're more strict or been happier living in a home being taken care of? How different of a person would I have become? I now have just a close enough relationship with both parents that I can casually talk and joke with them, but not close enough where we can talk about anything serious or even have arguments. Would I have had any contact with them if I had been raised by my uncle? I don't hate either of my parents, I just know they weren't fit to raise kids and I keep a certain amount of distance. I can't help but feel this sudden resentment towards my mom because of this. She had the opportunity to give us a better life, but because she has too much pride and jealousy we had to suffer through her mental instability and an angry alcoholic father. Part of me wishes they wouldn't have told me but at the same time I'm really glad they did. It feels so fucked up to think about all this, like there's two different timelines or something. There was a chance everything could have been completely different if they had pursued it and for some reason that scares me."
Over-diagnosed or good coping strategies?,1,mg3e3h,3,"26, only really now coming to terms with some of the abuse I experienced as a kid.   
I'm starting to wonder whether I have developed really healthy coping mechanisms or whether I'm just over diagnosed.

  
Mum was generally not very responsive to my emotional needs and wants. She was also quite physically abusive on occasion. There were a few instances where she beat me (not bad enough to leave any real damage) and screamed at me.  
For some examples, when I was 8, I tackled a kid. She hates any shame being brought on the family so she beat me in the bathroom with a broomstick handle and left me a bawling mess on the floor for an hour before I saw myself to bed.  
When I was 10 I tried to run away from home, getting as far as two streets down.  
As I got older I started to really lash out at her (swearing, cussing back at her) in response and eventually ended up having a 3 month long dissociative event. I ended up in a mental health ward (I was 13).  
To top it all off, I was bullied (probably of my own making in part) and didn't have particularly many friends until 15.  
I got kicked out at 18 and had general counselling up until around 22.  
Cut to now. I have managed to graduate with three separate tertiary qualifications and have a well paying career as a secondary teacher which I absolutely love.   
I sometimes feel overwhelmingly sad (not depressed) and worthless for no real reason. I feel a constant unease buried in my chest that comes and gos.   
In the past I have struggled with intense feelings of rejection when I used to go out to parties where people are hooking up. I still get intense anxiety whenever it comes time to indicate any sort of interest to a potential partner.  
Sometimes I just get the urge to go somewhere quiet and dark and just be really sad. A few times in the past week I've just broken down and cried at home.  


Yet, the feedback I get from my colleagues and students is that I am excellent at my job. Most of the time I feel like I'm presenting as really well put together but underneath I'm struggling.  
My exercise and self-care routines (cooking, cleaning house) have gone out the window I'm starting to get anxiety around leaving the house again.  


Is there any way to really tell if C-PTSD is the right diagnosis as indicated by my online counselor and I have generally good coping mechanisms? I'm just worried that I may be getting over diagnosed."
Hey all. How does everyone self-soothe when they are triggered? Looking for suggestions.,2,mg3c0u,5,"Someone commented on my last post that I can self soothe if I'm triggered by my partner. I tend to overanalyze so when he's in a bad mood or is having normal human emotions, I get internally scared and feel distant from him.

i don't know how to give them peace without stripping my own *tw generational trauma*,5,mg3b34,1,"the issues in my family go way back, probably before either side immigrated here in the mid 1800s and early 1900s. sometimes i think we were cursed but i know that's not the truth. 

it often feels like the worst two people in the room had a kid, and then that kid grew up and was 1/2 of the worst people in a room someday and the cycle just kept going. i know thats cruel, harsh, mean, etc. but its how i feel sometimes. i'm working on it. 

its just hard. there were so many layers of manipulation that my empathy, trust, and respect in/for them were constantly being stripped and hastily reapplied and now that i'm 'free' my brain is just a puddle. 

i want to give them peace. i'm angry of course, and sometimes its targeted at them but overall i know they were just another cog in the machine. i'll always love them, but its a hollow kind of love that i'm not sure i trust - do i really love them or am i just supposed to love them. and then reality starts to drip away because if i can't trust my own feelings than what can be trusted, yknow?

anyways. i don't want vengeance. i'm not giving them the silent treatment to get back at them. at this point i just don't feel any type of desire to have any kind of relationship with them. it sucks because this is clearly having some negative effect on them (apparently they're very sad) and i feel bad for making them sad but going over there isn't going to fix it. every time i try to see them i shut down or implode and leave things worse than they were. 

idk. i guess maybe they are responsible for generating some of their own peace. idk."
Help with husband whose wife suffers C-PTSD.,9,mg39hw,7,"DAE experience this??


I suffer from C-PTSD. My husband used to go to see my therapist individually off and on for help with some of the issues he may be experiencing. Not only being a husband of a person diagnosed with C-PTSD, but I'm also disabled and he is my caretaker. He also suffers from PTSD and ADHD. So it was a great stress reliever for him to have someone to talk to. Right now he is not seeing my therapist but is encouraged to.


Recently? Like in times past? His office (which is actually supposed to be shared space) has been turned into a refuge for him. It is so full of trash and other things that it is difficult to traverse. It is hazardous.   


I know he is doing this because he is having issues with his own PTSD. He has been discussing his trauma issues with me lately. Telling me things I never knew. Even though I've been his wife 20 plus years. So I think the reason he's covering his office with trash and making it insurmountable to enter is because he's hiding what his real issues are and he wants to make sure no one can touch him so that he can be protected. I'm not a therapist. I'm just guessing this because of prior behavior and  therapeutic sessions with other therapists.

I need things to be clean and organized. I want things to be. Today I told him I was going to go in there and clean everything up. He basically told me to shut up. I have discussed this with my therapist but sometimes it is just too much for me. 


He refuses to get help for his PTSD or ADHD or other things that he has going on with him. As his wife I can love him and try to learn how to help him with the help of my therapist.


I'm dealing with my trauma and a weakening  body.



Sometimes I go in the bathroom and cry into a towel.   


I just don't know what to do.  I'm sure Covid-19 isolation makes everything worse.

Medication vs. Therapy,5,mg2arm,7,"Hey friends,

A little stuck on making a decision to try an SSRI/SNRI etc for a mix of anxiety/hopelessness of future. 

When I spoke tot he psychiatrist we agreed to try sleep meds but they didn’t really work well and had grogginess and headaches as side effects.  

I have begun trauma therapy for the first time in my life (tried CBT DBT and IFS but not trauma therapists). 

I like the therapy but it’s a slow process.  

At night I’m hyper vigilant at times and other times I awake due to habit. It sucks. 

During the day I have had GERD/IBS type of issues and when my stomach is bloated, constipated, or the urge to go immediately it’s accompanied with anxiety and hopelessness of thought about my life and future.  

Not sure if anyone’s been in the same position debating therapy or adding meds too.  The psychiatrist was patient and kept reinforcing that I have clear reasons to be anxious/depressed (lack of social network as friends age and move or have kids while also being single and feeling lonely and hopeless a lot)

Perspectives?"
Really frustrated with 'being the better person',14,mg252k,2,"I'm venting because I can't vent. My parents are to me, horrible and irredeemable people. But I have tried so hard to be fair for my younger siblings. My parents don't have custody of them anymore and I live with my siblings so even though I'm no contact with my parents, I will occasionally have to hear/deal with them. I try to be as honest and fair as possible so my siblings understand the weird position we are all in without making it unnecessarily harder on them. When I have to explain some things I don't go into detail, I just say that our parents weren't good to us, that their problems were serious enough to remove custody and I hope that they will take this time to learn how to be good for them. 

I have never expected my parents to be fair or kind back and they really haven't. Everything that my siblings do that they don't approve of is because of me. I'm always making the wrong choices when it comes to them. And they constantly lie about everything or tell them things about me that isn't their business to share. 

I tend to have the hardest time with the lies. I can't stand it. Especially when the lies are about me, for those I'll usually try to correct. Everything else I do my best to not make things worse with a lot of finger pointing. I know that it'll just divide and hurt my siblings more.

But I just feel like venting today because I heard another lie from my parents today and it's so unfair that they can say, ""Oh I was so nice to (relative) back then."" when the truth is so fucked up.  And the absolute kicker is that if I say, ""Oh that's not true."" then I'm being the bad guy and hurting my siblings. And it's not like I can just open that door and not back it up with facts which would clearly be inappropriate to tell them. So instead I have to shrug it off and not say anything. It's so hard to do that though when they don't deserve to repaint the past like that and force me into that position.

I know that they can't admit to being a bad person, but it just feels like they found another way to dig at me. Living with them, they did no wrong and everything was all my fault. I just thought that once my siblings and I were finally away, that I was free from being dragged into this crap."

What is it with parents projecting their insecurities onto their kids?,18,mg1sdg,4,"For as long as I can remember, I've been worrying about my weight, and so has my mom.

Besides that, she's also constantly saying that she looks fat and whatnot, yet judges others for their bodies. I also noticed she often tries to hide whenever she eats something, meaning she's clearly ashamed of it. //Obviously not a good message to convey to a child. 
She's not once told me that I look pretty either, or even just that I'm fine the way I am, but has made dozens of comments about my eating habits, back when I was still a child (on top of my father body-shaming me on a daily basis but that's another story..).

I feel a kinship with tin masked WWI Veteran Richard Harrow in Boardwalk Empire,3,mg1nw8,1,"AFAIK the man is extremely lonely/traumatized/virginal/treated like a freak due to his horrid scarring from WWI.

He has a close friend with Jimmy. I gather Jimmy is running his own bootlegging operation (I haven't started watching the series yet, just watching clips here and there...I'm gonna purchase the DVD set probably soon).

He's a very tragic character but I just feel him so much. He was probably a friendly/kind/naive young man...then sent off to war and is a tragic shell of a man. His mental scarring is just as bad as his physical scarring, wears a tin mask. Gets treated like a freak. But his friend Jimmy understands him, fellow WWI veteran who also went over the top at times. Has a beautiful wife, kids, is set economically for life, and running a bootleg operation.

Richard is overwhelmed with emotion to be allowed in his house and mentions ""What's it like to have...everything?"" Everything Richard always wanted in life. And has an intense loyalty to Jimmy.

I find that character alone makes me want to watch the entire series because he is very relatable for  me in regards to my CPTSD, minus the horrible physical scarring. My CPTSD racks my brain...the memories just attack me. And I don't know a fix for it, minus ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" where maybe we could DELETE those memories from existing...which is a fiction."
DAE never go to the doctor until it's too late?,60,mg1lu8,21,"Example: last year my glass french press with freshly brewed coffee shattered and covered me in boiling coffee. I got 2nd and 3rd degree burns all over my abdomen and leg but I didn't go to the doctor until a week later when I realized I couldn't fix my skin by myself and I was in so much pain I could not breathe.

I'm really struggling and this is the only place with people who might understand. This is just letting it out and will be unorganized because that is my brain. Sorry...


I really need to go to the doctor because I've had some very scary episodes (like heart attack feeling/thought I was gonna die episodes) over the past few months and I can't bring myself to make call/wait on hold/make appt/explain everything to a new dr.


These weren't panic attacks, as I've had plenty of those and am quite familiar, unless it's a new development of super panic attack. I've struggled with chronic autoimmune disease and POTSyndrome, endo and CPTSD for a very long time (I'm in my 30s) and at this point I just can't. Deal. 


This past summer an event triggered old childhood traumas and because of my POTS I already dish out 10x the amount of cortisol than a person is supposed to make, so all of my chronic issues have been really bad. I'm even more hyper vigilant and in fight or flight all the time.


Here's the thing, all my health conditions are not well known in the medical community... Dysautonomia (when you're autonomic nervous system just gives you the middle finger all the time) in general is just becoming ""seen"" in society because a lot of people who get Covid-19 are coming down with viral induced POTS. So it requires a lot of explaining and self advocating, a lot of doctors turning up their nose at my diagnoses because they haven't heard of it. Haven't found one willing to investigate the cause (apart from traumas, this is a chicken or egg type of deal). I moved to another coast a few years ago with my number 1 and I haven't found a new dr. I don't have any energy or will to do any of this. It's too much.


The thought of having to explain everything AGAIN, to be not taken seriously AGAIN, to be dismissed when I'm really scared I could die is so overwhelming that I am in constant freeze mode. There is only 1 POTS specialist in this state and he isn't taking new patients.

The event this summer was that my ancient, beautiful friend cat, who I had gotten when I was 14, was attacked by a cougar. I woke up to him screaming outside my window and I flew out of bed and ran outside barefoot to see my cat in the cougar's mouth. Without thinking, full fight mode, I charged at the cougar screaming like a wild animal and scared it enough that it dropped my cat and we both were able to run inside. He lived 4 more excruciating days after a vet visit and then we had to let him go. On my birthday. Since he was the last remnant of my childhood, and one of the only beings I could trust as a kid, I just. Broke. Alllllll my old traumas are hounding me all the time. I can't sleep because my mind is racing all the time, bringing up shit that I don't want to see anymore.

I don't have friends in this new place. I can't make friends I'm too fucking awkward and can't trust anyone, especially in a world where it seems like no one actually tries to get to know one another and genuine connection is my only setting. I'm completely isolated in a new side of the country, in the woods, which is extra hard as I spent the majority of my childhood in solitude while my mom locked herself in her room for hours a day and I wasn't allowed to get her unless I was bleeding. I was homeschooled, it was truly isolating, so I made animals my friends and confidants.

I have a loving husband but he has no concept of how to deal with this. I don't want to drive him away with my insanity, despite him saying that's impossible (he is a nice person) and so I know I need a therapist and a doctor to help me figure out my physical problems. It is literally my only drive. For him, not for me.

"Hiding abuse is itself abuse, my family will never understand",36,mg0pie,2,"My father was extremely abusive to the extent that my younger brother was handicapped by him

Abuse was so normalized in my family that other family members hid it. 
Lying to police to protect my mom,  who was being abused but was also doing illegal things herself.

Example 
Few  Months after my brother was born severely disabled, both of my parents were arrested for prostitution and being a pimp.

Instead of us kids going into the system, my grandmother took me, dads grandparents took older sister,  and aunt took disabled brother till our parents where released and we where sent right back home to them.

They had no reason to change when another family member would step in between us kids and ANYONE trying to separate us and save us.

 The abuse didn't end until my father committed suicide in front of everybody.
And now the family says I should be thankful they helped so much.

Thankful?
Sure , thanks for letting people abuse me because those people where family. 
Thanks a ton 

They insist they aren't abusive and just wanted to help and I'm just too spoiled to see that. 

I've been homeless for 5 years, I published a book. 
My aunt claims her grandchildren need therapy from my book, but still insists I never needed therapy or help for living the book.

I just want them out of my life forever and they stalk me like obsessive lovers."

[Trigger Warning: implied family trauma] Does anyone have advice for managing anxiety spikes in a setting you can't leave? Requesting Emotional Support.,3,mg0gjm,2,"Hi! I hope everyone's doing okay. I wanted to request advice or emotional support. 

I recently experienced something that reminded me of one of the biggest traumas I faced in my life when I was younger (that I have been working through for a couple years) and have been struggling with big anxiety/panic ever since being badly triggered. I am distancing myself from the stressor as best as I can but due to the pandemic and unemployment, I am unable to completely cut myself off from the stressor right now.

I have been trying to find a trauma-informed therapist but at the moment I've been trying to do DBT Progressive Muscle Relaxation, strategies from a previous therapist, and using PTSD Coach, though it doesn't help as much as I want it to. I'm just really overwhelmed and it's really difficult slipping into hyperventilation and freezing when my stressor comes back, especially since I still have schoolwork. It is hard to keep a level head when I am so anxious. I do have an outside support system and am trying to get more professional help but I would like to see if anyone has any insight in the meantime. 

Any advice or emotional support would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time."

"Hey guys, I’m new here and could use support (MULTIPLE TW)",14,mfztfe,2,"I’ve been on so many meds and misdiagnosed so many times it’s ridiculous. I was MDD, bipolar 2, BPD, back to bipolar 2 and now CPTSD. It makes sense to me but at the same time I’m scared and feel alone. I have a close friend who has PTSD due to a horrifying event she endured and I feel like I don’t “deserve” the CPTSD diagnosis, even though they’re different disorders. 

I want to share a small portion of my story to see if anyone can relate. My mom was physically ill and in the hospital a lot when I was a young child. She also developed stage 3 cancer when I was 18. I have Heath anxiety because of this and my loved ones tease me for always assuming the worst when I’m sick or others are sick. 

My mom also suffers from a mental illness and an eating disorder and verbally hurt me on several occasions, but most of the time we had a good relationship. Same thing with my dad, as in she would get into horrible fights with him as well. I know she self harmed but she didn’t do it in front of me. I got bullied (verbally) a lot in middle school which I know is a common occurrence but it didn’t help. 

My brother also suffered from a mental illness and he took his own life when I was 17. This destroyed me even though it was 7 years ago. I have no other siblings.

I never feel safe, I harass my boyfriend multiple times a day to drive safe because I’m always convinced something will happen. I have a lot of BPD type behaviors which was why I was misdiagnosed, like identity problems, deep shame, explosive anger etc. 

I’m worried that this is another misdiagnosis but it does seem to fit. The fact that it fits makes it scarier to me. I could use some support right now if it’s ok to ask for that"
"Struggling with parental relationships. Having a hard time knowing how to title this. Feeling a mix of pity/guilt, when I want to feel entitled to be mad.",1,mfzkyg,1,"CW: Passing mentions of drug and alcohol abuse.

Hi all. So I'm really struggling at the moment in my relationship with my mother. She was never intentionally abusive, but had no self-awareness about the patterns she was allowing to repeat. I wish I could be mad at her, but I feel so much guilt. My brain is doing that thing where it's making words hard because I'm trying to talk about something triggering, so this is probably going to be long and inarticulate, sorry. 

My mom was one of four kids, in a poor Midwestern family in the 50s-60s, with a deadbeat dad who left to start another family, and a single mother of her own who was generally a miserable person. Alcoholism and mental illness both ran rampant through the family. She was diagnosed a couple of years ago with PTSD, something I only found out after sharing my diagnosis with her. For at least as long as I've been alive, her life has always been limited by a sense of learned helplessness that I think she picked up to survive her family. Our family. 

She's a good person at heart, who did the best she could with a bad hand of cards, but unfortunately the best she could was not very good.

When my brother was born, she decided to move back in with my grandmother. In part because she was struggling as a single mom of 2, and in part because my grandmother was getting older and she wanted to be nearby. Two of my uncles, her brothers, still lived there. 

I don't think she really thought about the environment she was bringing us into. This was her family, and family is fine. Never mind that these same people traumatized her growing up, and here she was bringing back a little hypersensitive mini-me of her into that exact same environment. Maybe she did think about this, but just didn't have any other options financially. I don't know. But I know she naively thought it would be fine, and somehow never saw it coming that it would all repeat. 

I guess this is one of the things that's consuming me so much recently. She really tried. I get mad thinking about how naive she was, how she just assumed her family would be nicer to us than they ever were to her. But at the same time, she was doing her best, and she made sure we knew we were loved. And then I feel guilty for being mad. I don't know how to communicate with her nowadays, because I have all these nasty feelings about what she indirectly put me through, and fights when I was a teenager, but it's not like she doesn't already feel terrible about it. And her life is bad now. So what is the point of kicking her while she is already down? 

We are both so sensitive. We are extremely similar people, or have extremely similar learned trauma responses. I'm not sure which, or if the difference matters. But it gives me insight into why she does what she does. She also has chronic pain issues -- I would not be shocked if she had fibromyalgia or another similar chronic pain condition, but unfortunately her ability to get regular healthcare is lacking, and the doctors she does see are not great. 

My mom got laid off in 2009, and didn't get another job because my grandmother needed a lot of care. My grandmother died in 2015, and my mom still hasn't worked since. Grandma left the house to her youngest son. Mom still lives there with him. He is an extremely erratic person, an alcoholic and a meth user. She won't get a job now. She tells me she can't, that she is too sick. So this is just how it's going to be forever until she dies. 

She calls me and wants to dump all of her sadness on me. She has no friends, so my brother and I are her only outlets, and he's less tolerant of her emotion-dumping than I am, so I don't think they talk often. It's incredibly triggering -- hearing about how terrible everything is for her takes me right back to being a scared child in that home. 

She has explained to me that she really just wants to be able to vent, since she doesn't have anyone else to vent to. I've made her cry by reacting uncomfortably in the past -- by begging her to do something about it, because she's the only one with any power in the situation. 

(Is she though? She never would have left her own mother, who was awful, to suffer alone like this. And I ran off states away, and abandoned her to them. I am living comfortably in terms of physical comforts, while she is not. I could be sending her more money. I already bail her out here and there. But she is my mother, and I can't escape the feeling that I abandoned her.)

So I try to just... take it. Last time we talked was bad. She kept venting, and I just kept responding ""I'm sorry"". ""Oh, don't be, this is just how bad it always is, how bad it will always be."" I wanted to shout, to hang up. I didn't ask to be her parent. I didn't want to become a parent. I don't even want my own kids. I just want a mom. She failed me in so many ways, but even now I just want to have a normal mother-adult daughter relationship, but we never will. I will never be able to rely on her again -- in fact, she will need me to continue to be strong, forever, until she dies. 

It's just so much. Whenever we hang up, I spiral for hours about what an inadequate daughter I am. And my emotions just ping-pong around -- I shouldn't be in this position (anger) but neither should she (guilt), and I'm the only one she has (different guilt), and it's the same terrible uncle (anger) but she just won't leave! (anger/guilt) Forever.

Is anyone else stuck in a similar position? Of having to take care of your parents, to some degree or another, due to their own trauma issues? And managing your feelings around that? How are you making it work? Any tips you can share? I'm so exhausted, and just want to find a way I can comfort her without hurting myself."

Been made aware of a serious symptom of my illness...,18,mfz8gn,3,"Does anybody else deal with this?

For years I've dealt with anger and the occasional fit of rage (blow up) \[maybe every 6 months or so\]. But I'm noticing a pattern that I can't let go of now. I take things very personally, that maybe even aren't meant to be about me, but I perceive it that way. Once this happens I enter a hyper-aware, vigilant, anxious state, and I try to confirm my own bias. Once I do (because I always can) it results in what feels like righteous anger, where I then berate a loved one, or belittle them for speaking to me in what I perceived to be condescending.

I'm working on this now, but I'm looking for patterns anyone has found in themselves similar to this, and maybe if someone has more insight into what's happening in the brain.

"DAE have a hard time going through old text messages, pictures and videos?",16,mfz6eo,6,"This is always rough for me because I knew what place I was in as I'm reviewing it especially due to trauma. As I'm reviewing them, I can't help but think ""pre-trauma"", ""during trauma"" and ""post trauma"".  It's mostly ""post trauma"" though. Going through old text messages, I saw that majority of the texts that I sent were out of fear or anxiety, a cry for help or desperation. As for pictures and videos, it's also hard because I tried to look happy on the outside but on the inside, I felt so much loneliness and emotional pain. I remember during those times I felt dead inside. It's just all triggering for me and makes me feel very sad, even though I'm healing right now.

Constantly on the brink of losing sanity. [TW: mentions of self-harm],3,mfz0am,4,"I know the title and this post sound a bit edgy and maybe a bit cringy, but it's genuinely how I feel. Over time I feel like I lose myself a little bit every single time. I always felt this slow downhill process.


Over time I've gotten more aggressive and less capable of feeling positive emotions. My fantasies and nightmare on a daily basis get more and more extreme and I bear a lot of hatred for people around me and for being forced into living in a world where I feel like an outsider. A world where I can't keep up financially. A world where taking care of myself is almost impossible. A world where I constantly get rejected for issues that aren't even my fault. I don't understand other people at all, never have. It's like they speak another language. I get more frustrated every single time. I hit myself out of aggression, because I can't get rid of those feelings.


I hate working, I hate school, I hate people. I despise everyone. I get rejected by everyone, even therapists. It disgusts me. People disgust me.


Every day is survival to me. I don't want to participate in a world where everything is upside down. 


Recently a friend of mine told me to watch the Joker (2019). I never watched it, because I don't particularly follow super hero movies. He said that I remind him a lot of the Joker in that specific movie and I can say why he says that. I've been rejected by almost everyone in my life, desperately reaching out my hand and calling for help, just to see everyone walk right past me. Then inevitably blaming me for what I'm like and ostracizing me. 


So as I got older, I tried to calm down a lot. I keep my thoughts to myself or try to bring them in a constructive way. I had some anger management along the way. I thought I had it figured out, but it feels like I'm always boiling over. I have inappropriate emotional reactions and they're becoming more frequent, I genuinely despise the world and every time I get rejected or forced into some societal bullshit, I fantasize about screaming in faces and hurting people. Nobody listens to me. I try so hard to make the change I want to see, but I'm always left there.


I'm so angry and I'm getting angrier by the second. Why do I have to be scared that school kicks me out for the so manyth time, because I don't fit in their fucking bullshit for ""normal"" people. This is my 6th school. I've been trying to get a degree 9 years. Schools have kicked me out, jobs have, therapists have told me they can't help me. I try so fucking hard every single day. I get up, do what I have to, but just because I need more time or need some days off I'm suddenly ""making excuses"", "" seeking attention"" or ""too complex issues to get immediate help"" ""too functional to get immediate help"". People mistake my ability to survive as an absence of my issues. And it's not like I don't talk about it, I do. Nobody listens. 


And there he is. My piece of shit father, walking around this planet. Money in his pocket, abusing women and kids freely because nobody is stopping him. Not even the police. But everyone tries to stop me in my tracks, despite doing my very best every day.

Why choose  MDMA over ketaime or LSD/ psilocybin? Anything that someone considering  this should watch out for? The traditional treatments just aren't  working and really I'm really fucking tired.

DAE get more triggered by unfounded criticism than by well-founded criticism?,6,mfyzbd,4,"Recently I got into a few situations where somebody would accuse me of things that simply could not be true, things that were most likely projections of the other’s insecurities or trauma on things i said or did. For example a girl was accusing me of keeping people around just for sex, while in reality my sexual energy is quite low and I just need some support while confronting my trauma.

But instead of just brushing that off because it had very little to do with me, I got quite triggered. Normally I can take criticism well and can think about it and adapt my behavior, but in this case I felt a strong angry reaction. So I’m trying to understand where this comes from. My trauma probably stems from my mother not mirroring my emotions, playing with me or cuddling me, and in general not responding to what I was expressing. That gives me the feeling I don’t really exist sometimes, and it seems that if somebody creates an idea of me that has little to do with the actual me I get into a flashback. My mother also actually did that when I was older and I could get super mad in those situations. Could there be a link?

Christian with CPTSD (TW abuse),2,mfwy8o,3,"I wanted to post my story and ask if there are others with the same problems that I faced. I went to therapy for this, and was diagnosed with CPTSD, anxiety, and depression. Even if this could help one person or connect me with someone else that feels the same way that would be enough for me.

My mother is a narcissist undiagnosed, but that is the conclusion that my therapist and I came to. I had lived with my parents for 20 years. I feel that I fell into the scapegoat role, I took the blame for everything. My mother had divorced my biological father when she was 19 and I was 3 months old. After marrying my step father, anything I did was not good enough. My first step sibling was born when I was 7 years old, which made me feel outcasted only for that feeling to be seconded by my mother and step fathers behavior. My sister was treated much differently and I realized that nothing I could do would match the superiority that my step sister had. As I grew up my parents had 2 more children. All three of my step siblings were treated very well, new clothes, toys, experiences, etc. and I was not. This treatment however didn’t really cause a divide in relationship with my siblings because I was expected to take care of them. I would take them to school, bottle feed them, clothe them, take them to doctor appointments, clean up after them, everything. My siblings still look up to me as a caretaker and someone that they can fully trust. The issues I faced growing up was that I couldn’t have friends, and I was the problem in everything that happened. If my mother and step father fought, it ultimately was my fault. If my siblings were failing, it was because I wasn’t taking care of them. If the house was dirty, it was because I was lacking. Getting yelled at for my brother losing his shoes seemed normal which is crazy to think about now. When I graduated high school, I earned scholarships to go to a college 4 hours away from my parents. I immediately jumped on that opportunity but still held the grief of knowing that no matter how good my grades were and how I acted, my mother would be disappointed. I got a boyfriend in college, and I was terrified to tell my parents. They met him and immediately disliked him because he spoke very positively about me and spoke up when they were “picking on me”. A few weeks after my 20th birthday, my boyfriend (now husband) moved me in the middle of the night to live with him, which caused my mother to lash out very violently. I was scared to leave my house, I was scared to check my phone, the anxiety that I have from just seeing images of her causes life to be difficult. My biggest issue that I am currently facing is my faith. Christianity tells us to respect our mothers and fathers, but I am absolutely terrified of mine. The amount of emotional and physical abuse that I had endured throughout my childhood and young adult years has made the forgiveness and respect aspect of Christianity very difficult. I still live 4 hours away, and my siblings call me crying that they miss me, but I can’t bring myself to ever go back there. I am traumatized by my family. I got married quietly without them knowing and they still don’t know. It’s difficult to watch others in my community have this relationship with their families my husband included. I have a “fake family” in my head that I wish and pray was the reality. I plan on having a wedding in the church soon, but my heart sinks knowing I will be walking down the aisle by myself, and that my side of the church will be empty simply because I exist and my mother regrets it. The symptoms I have faced is anxiety triggers in loud noises, white cars, yelling, and failing/making mistakes. I personally am still figuring out the scope of my diagnosis and how it fully affects me. If there is anyone out there that could talk with me and make me not feel so alone, it would be appreciated. I am also always open to talk with someone that needs a person to listen because that is all I ever wanted. I wanted to be validated. I am in no way a medical professional but I am someone who will be a caring friend."
"DAE over exert and feel burned out the next day, but you don't realize you're over exerting at the time?",75,mfwnup,17,"Basically the title. Last week I was pretty tired and overwhelmed and hadn't had the weekend before to rest, so I vowed to take last weekend off to rest mentally and physically. Saturday I mostly relaxed all day, but also hung out with some new people over Discord/Among Us and very quickly got overwhelmed so I left after a few rounds. I also played Mario Kart (no voice) with a Twitch community, which I do frequently and enjoy, and it was really fun. Sunday I had some energy for once so I cleaned a bit and took my dog to a new park we've never been to before. I got groceries delivered the day before so I prepped simple meals for the week. Then I played Among Us and was on voice chat with my group of friends. After about an hour of that I recognized I needed some alone time, so I got off the call and relaxed.

Today I'm exhausted and burnt out. I'm at work and can't concentrate. I made a mistake which caused a flashback and I cried for over an hour and was unable to work. This happens when I over exert myself but the thing is is that I didn't feel like I was doing too much this weekend. I definitely was more active than I usually am (usually I would only do one or not any of the above things I listed), but I was listening to myself and my emotions and what I needed. I gave myself rests when I thought I needed one and was gentle with myself all weekend - leaving the park when I felt tired, hopping off the voice calls, even pulling up a chair while I was finishing cooking.

It's frustrating because I don't know how to tell when I've over exerted. I'm having a REALLY bad day today because I can't gauge my own boundaries/limits and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else experienced this?"
Always feel like being touched,5,mfwfai,9,"Hi there, first I would like to say I am really glad that there's a Reddit that's common to all of us that have been through a tough time in our life it's actually my first time posting something on Reddit. The biggest issue I am facing with my trauma issues, always feels that I was touched without my knowledge. Let's say I go to take an order from the delivery guy, my mind sometimes goes into this state of oh shit he assaulted me, he touched my private parts. I had been through 3 sexual assault traumas in my life, so I think that's the reason. Though I am wondering if someone experiences the same thing or similar to what I describe, and any advice on how to manage it."
Stuck in freeze mode,3,mfwdmo,6,"Reposted this because a presumably transphobic person downvoted me immediately. I ask that if you hold certain beliefs on trans lives that doesn't match with mine, you choose to disregard my post rather than downvoting me and limiting my ability to receive the emotional support I am requesting.

I am a queer, trans non binary parent of a toddler. It's already difficult to find parent friends you actually mesh with, and is made that much more difficult as a big ol gay parent.

So over the past 2.5 years I've been hanging out with this mom friend on and off, but found that I can only really muster up the energy to hang with her about once every two weeks and I couldn't figure out why. As I began my trauma healing journey, slowly but surely I began to realize spending time with her and her kiddo was quite triggering to me. The way she talks to and about her kiddo and her parenting style reminds me of how my mom was - a combo of emotional abuse and neglect paired with excessive love bombing, amongst other things.

In the past I have attempted to open up to her about my trauma and its residual effects and have been met with indifference, minimization and invalidation. Because our kiddos are friends, and because in some ways I do enjoy her company I kind of continued to push through my discomfort in order to see her more regularly, as she texts me at least once a week to hang out.

I took about 3 months away from our friendship during the winter after I told her my grandma was in hospice and I was swallowed up in grief and she didn't respond for days, then told me I was letting my depression get the best of me and I should just try to have fun with her. I was incredibly hurt and at that time felt like maybe I was just done with our friendship.

As the weather has gotten a bit more bearable lately we have reconnected a bit, meeting at playgrounds for play dates and I began to think that maybe we could just be like base level friends. Like I mean I dont only ever want to talk about my trauma and I suppose its a good idea to practice spending time with people I have varying levels of closeness with, right?

So last weekend we met and took a long walk around a local island trail, and while hanging out on the beach she started expressing ideas about bodies and gender that felt deeply invalidating to me a d my experience as a living, breathing trans human being. This honestly felt like a slap to the face. We have been friends for over two years, the whole time she has known that I am trans. Later she began asking me my opinion of trans athletes being able to compete in events within their gender group in a way that felt really transphobic and was deeply upsetting to me. I let her know it's honestly a really triggering thing to talk about, and she kind of just dropped the convo. It felt so weird and upsetting, invalidating and antagonistic... right after that I let her know I was gonna head home.

I think I have finally once and for all decided I'm done giving more chances to see if this friendship is worth the triggering aspects of our interactions. The problem is I feel totally frozen and unable to communicate with her in any way rn. She texted me about hand me downs and if I wanted them, which I didn't respond to so then the next day she texted me again saying 'hey??' And I still haven't been able to even respond at all. I dont want to lambaste her, I think she's human and not a monster for having some ignorant ideas around gender. I just also dont want to continue being close for my mental health and wellbeing as I cant keep up with the energetic output being around her causes me.

How do I proceed? How does one break up amiably with a friend?"
Have any of you ever considered cosmetic surgery so you wouldn’t look like your abusers?,5,mfwawo,4,"For years and years I have wanted a new face, or at least some tweaks so I dkn’t see my rapists every single tkme I look in the mirror. 

I hate my face and I just can’t get it over with, not even in therapy, I just hate it so much! 

I just wanna be able to look into the mirror or look at a picture of myself and not get flashbacks and see my rapists faces. 

I just wanna feel free..."
DAE get scared by job opportunities because of triggers related to past trauma?,6,mfw9dk,2,"I feel like I have so much difficulty embracing new job opportunities. I have so much difficulty to trust.

I have a diversified background but a good overall profile nevertheless. That being said, I did a lot of short term work experiences that I had to take on regardless of the type of people it would involve (for financial reasons).

The result was disastrous: I was bullied, challenged left and right for nothing, basically being surrounded by narcissistic co-workers and bosses, etc. It was a lot. I never had a workplace where I felt good with the people or with I was doing. At best it was OK. 

Now, each time a new opportunity comes up I feel so scared. I don't feel I am able to endure more challenging environments. In the meantime, I have to work too and I am not getting offers every other day either so it's not that I can say no each time.

Last potential position: working at a rather good place in a great industry but the HR person has already been implying that the CEO was going to be difficult (""temperamental"" was the word). And to me it feels like a giant red flag, when for other candidates I am sure it wouldn't bother them and they would do what's best for them, like that wouldn't impact them negatively. 

Due to past trauma at work, I don't feel I process things the same way when looking for work. I should be happy and confident, and yet I am fearful. Any advice on this? (aside from sucking it up) 

Ps: I am not particularly insecure, I am good at what I do, and I stand my ground when needed. But in high-level narcissistic environments, I am out. I cannot."
Persistent lack of motivation for something particular can be due to not wanting to feel thoughts or feelings associated with that activity,46,mfvlkj,2,"Lately I've focused a lot on trying to analyze mental phenomena. This was prompted by how the mental health system tells my mother to do stuff like take a shower, and then when she doesn't do stuff says the problem is her behaviour. It seems what they tell her to do fails to help motivate her, and only makes her feel bad about not doing it.

I've experienced a lot of this in my own life. Though with me both the idea that I ""should"" do something and the feeling bad for not doing it were almost always all in my mind. I practically never talk about it with others.

It seems that behind this persistent lack of motivation, which should maybe be labelled as persistent avoidance, I can find thoughts and feelings which I don't want to experience.

One thought is the idea that by doing something I'm working towards a terrible future I don't want. Another is that although I'm improving something, other far more important factors make the resulting quality of life improvement negligible. For some things I get the sense that it would lead me to painfully compare myself to others. There are more patterns, and I'm not going to try to list them all.

It seems avoidance of doing some things now can also be linked to past events. Apparently anger i dissociated in the past can be channelled into persistent refusal to do some things. Maybe as long as the refusal is present i don't have to feel the anger.

Often various factors like this weren't experienced clearly, and I instead felt a vague but powerfully painful ""Nooo!"" feeling about the idea of doing something.

Psychological addiction seems to work in a similar way. It's a seeking of something instead of an avoidance of something, but the desirable end result is also not feeling some thoughts or feelings."
One Way Enmeshment & separation from narc mom & dad,1,mfvg87,2,"Has anyone experienced one way enmeshment ? Your parents are enmeshed with you, but you have never felt the same way. Even at a really young age I remember having arguments telling them they had trouble dealing with the fact that I was a separate person. This caused so many issues as a kid. I would constantly try to make my own decisions because that’s fucking normal and I always knew myself and what I wanted really well. I’ve heard someone describe this concept as like...so you’re emotionally independent but still enmeshed so what that means is like a “blurred lines” between like the who you actually are and your “alien self”. Which means, living with a disordered parent and being talked to or treated as something you’re not. Basically being a scapegoat. And you can feel like phantom, alien self, which is a version of you that never existed in the first place. I was low-key a really smart kid. I always knew what I deserved and I wasn’t afraid to ask for it. 
Now that I’ve been moved out for a while & I’m moving into a new place with my boyfriend , moving on, and working on being in a place where I can financially take over my cell phone plan and health insurance. And then a separate bank account. While I am making the transition how do I navigate this transition? My parents seem to be capable of some degree of empathy or maybe it’s sympathy or just awareness of social norms and expectations, either way, I know if I work with them a little bit they’ll work with me. If I go about this in a right way I think we can have an amicable relationship at the very least during this transition in my life. However they have a looottt of trouble with boundaries and I was a victim of severe emotional and verbal abuse, as I was the designated “scapegoat” for most of my childhood. I really just want to be happy. I don’t want to deal with this crap at all anymore. They are seriously toxic. Now that I’m aware of my trauma I look back and realize how sick they are as people. I do not even want them in my life at all but at the moment I feel like I have no choice. I do not want to deal with the constant degradation. I am happy with myself let me live like fuck. 
I know this is kind of all over the place but that’s just how I feel to be real with you haha

Any advice is very much appreciated :)"
Addicted to dating apps - trying to find a parent. Can you relate?,2,mfvaza,8,"I am truly addicted to going on dates - and most of them (97%) never end up in a second date. Why? I am out here looking for someone to love me and parent me.

You know - when I went NC from my abusive parents- it was so difficult and it felt like the hardest thing ever. But the hardest part is now - the chapter after NC. Being reborn and really learning how to live - learning who I am. What I think. What I need.

I thought all this time that I was doing a great job parenting myself and loving myself. But the truth is, I have no idea how. I swipe on these apps consistently looking for someone to help me feel whole. Any attention or affection - I fall HARD. and then when they do not speak with me again, I feel very badly. Very depressed.

I want to break this cycle - but it is so difficult.

I just wanted to write here and share. NC is the first step. It gets way harder after."
"Sometimes I wonder if something should even ""count""",9,mfvaah,4,"I know that it's never really okay, but a small part of my brain goes, ""but is it really that bad?"" All he did was playfully touch my chest area. All he did was snap my bra. All he did was make little jokes about my hips. Like I keep invalidating myself because it doesn't feel bad enough.

I'm saying this because where I go to school, we always have sexual assault awareness week, and i feel so invalidated because the speeches we're given are about women who were raped, who had horrible things done to them. And mine feelings like nothing in comparison, when in reality I cried so much whenever he did it. And that he never stopped, saying it was ""just a joke"" even though I told him I didn't like it at all."
"How to go about getting a ""brain test""?",3,mfuucx,3,"In reading posts here, I've seen some people mention something about a ""brain test"", where the therapist looks at your brain waves in different states and it tells you something about your experience with trauma. There's was also something about white matter in the brain (MRI I believe). 

I want to get some sort of physical test for my cPTSD (even though the disorder is not currently diagonised if I remember correctly, I still want something physical validated). I feel a lot of tension in my body and jaw and I have trouble sleeping, so I was wondering if my cPTSD was manifesting physically or something, I don't know...

Anyhoo, what is this test called? Neuro-something? Neurotransmitter something? How do I go about getting one? Do I have to ask my doctor and get recommended? How much does it cost (preferably if you got it done in Canada)?

Any help is appreciated!"
struggling with self-judgment in grad school,2,mfuu7c,5,"This past semester I've had to email my profs a few times to let them know that I'm behind and that I'm dealing with mental health issues. The first time I was good at being proactive about it, letting my professor know from the outset that I was dealing with mental health issues and that it might result in me lagging behind. She was super understanding. I was behind for a couple of weeks, but I managed to catch up and do well in the class. 

This week I was already a week behind in a class that just started 2 weeks ago, and I finally emailed my new prof last night when I realized I wouldn't be finishing an assignment on time. She also seemed understanding about it (she said okay thanks I'll take note of that) but I still feel shitty about myself. 

I feel paranoid like maybe it's not my mental health, maybe it's just me being lazy and shitty and having bad habits like procrastination and I don't even deserve to be in a graduate program. I've been doing really well and getting 98% in all my classes until this semester, but these past few months I've just been feeling like I'm falling apart. 

I know I'm probably being too hard on myself but it's so hard not to judge myself and put myself down and compare myself to others. The problem is it's a vicious cycle where I just get more and more avoidant of my schoolwork and then judge myself more. 

I'm also so scared because starting tomorrow we have a group project and I'm really nervous about it. Also this is all online, which makes doing a group project so much more anxiety-provoking for me."
Just keep swimming...,14,mfuqgd,5,"There are days i can't. Literally. Days my body shakes so badly that washing dishes or doing art or even standing is a a bad idea. Broken enough dishes, taken enough tumbles... sometimes i just can't.  And ideas like ""just keep swimming"" bothered me for so long... but not so much anymore. Because really... that saying isn't about the times you can't. It's about the hard days, where you can but you have to do it on purpose.

Today i can. I don't feel great. I don't feel strong or solid. I want to be still and quiet and nothing after a lot of EVERYTHING. And i will take time to let myself let go of everything. Let it out here and there. Acknowledge that i'm not okay. But also acknowledge that i don't have to be okay to keep moving. I just have to know when to stop.

Today i can. I can wash some dishes. I can fold some cloths. Brush my teeth. I can, and i am. I am up and moving, even if it's slow and uncertain. I can dangle the string for the cats. I can talk. I can smile, even if it doesn't reach my eyes. Today i can just keep swimming. I can remember that even though just standing up feels so hard, like my guts are caving in, and my body feels like i'm crumbling to bits, they aren't caving in, i am not crumbling. I can stand. I can breathe. 

Today i can remember that I never regret doing the things life needs. That a clean spoon, an empty sink, those always feel better than the alternative. I can  resist the nasty old idea that the days i can't do much define me. 

Accepting the times that i can't opened the door for me to be able to see when i can more clearly. It tore the shroud of shame that keeps me in cycles of being overwhelmed, hating myself for being overwhelmed, and being more overwhelmed. Instead of wasting energy punishing myself for ""weakness"" i have that energy to use. 

Today i can. And that is what matters right now. And if tomorrow i can't, well, there will be clean clothes and at least a cereal bowl. And i can appreciate that when i could, i did what I needed to do and it was good for me. 

When you're going in exhausted circles, stacking little mistakes and accidents, accept that you are expecting too much from yourself right then. Allow it. No judgement. Let yourself stop. Find a safe place. Slow down. Regroup. Release. Rest. Whatever you need. So that when you can, you can keep swimming."
Ya'll I need some support,12,mfumhi,8,"Normally my cptsd looks like depression, anxiety, etc. Once in a very very very blue moon I just scream, not words, just scream and then cry. Today I did that. My dad died recently, I literally took my mom,and brothers numbers out of my phone yesterday after saying no more to a lifetime of being the scapegoat. My sister I didnt care about anyway....but so much stress for months. Today, my fiance (who I love very much and literally is the kindest person I know, decided he was just going to stay up all lastnight and drink when I made very clear I wanted him to do things w me today, one being get whatever few things I have left in my moms house so I can just start to heal) so please no one think he's a bad guy, hes the best guy, just going through something too.....but it was too much. I just went to my room and screamed and felt crazy.......im ok now, just sad....just hope some of you relate. I dont like when the emotions build up so bad"
Please help me find useful coping mechanisms...How do I stop having intense emotional reactions to older men,3,mfu64l,3,"I hate already asking this because I know in a way there's other people cant do that for me and then I have to do it for myself. But I am at a really low point in my mind right now that I think I've been avoiding. \[Trigger warning child sexual assault\] my dad left me when I was 4 years old and I didn't think it would hold a big impact on me since I didn't know him very well and the little things that I did know about him where on the negative side. I had a couple of other men in my mother's life after that were equally abusive, and three other men in my life who would go on to sexually harass me. It fucked me up badly, and I'm still getting used to just telling the story normally. Anyway it makes my I guess connection with myself a little bit blurry and growing up I often used to look for relationships with other older men to fulfill myself, they were meant to be non-sexual I think a connection with somebody who I would mistakingly place in a father role. And while I've become more aware of it how much has lead to my actions today it's still very difficult to stop doing that. The most recent case I've had, that I've been very angry about, is I had a ""friendship"" with one of my professors in college, again meant to be non-sexual and well there were definite red flags I've always had a hard time saying no, I ask myself now why I put myself in that situation or what I was looking for, and I wish I could go and at least anonymously tip the school about him, but he knows where I live and that makes me fearful. (he even mentioned that I wasn't the first student I had been talking to in the sort of manner). Eventually, I broke things off and I told him I felt uncomfortable and that he should probably stop trying to friends with his students, he actually ended up crying in front of me which felt like a total guilt trip but I stuck to it and I told him that I didn't want to have any more contact - later he messaged me and said that I apparently was in love with him and that's why I'm running away, but i ignored it, but i wish so badly I could of told him how much i hated his guts, and how gross he is for thinking that. I'm angry about it, and I want to hurt him in some way - to put it bluntly. 

&#x200B;

Anyway after that It triggered my cptsd with men and how they were only close to me because they want to use me for my body or for sexual reasons, and I've become increasingly fearful. I don't like being touched and yet I can't seem to find the response to say no when people ask for hugs or go ahead and do it without my permission. I have this very conflicting mindset because there's a part of me that is still trying to fulfill this father role through other people, a part of me who is fawning without any reason towards older men, and the part of me that's just straight-up scared and doesn't want to be in the same room as them. I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I want to stop having a strong emotional reaction, I want to be able to love myself fully and be my own father, and say no or even determine when I'm actually feeling uncomfortable because even figuring out when I want to say no - is so difficult.

"Feeling defeated in terms of psych meds, has anyone else gone through this type of thing?",2,mftwq7,14,"I’m about to turn 25 and I’ve been in and out of therapy & psychiatry since I was probably 12 years old. I didn’t trust doctors when I was young (sometimes don’t now lol, but do see the value in healthcare obviously and have a wonderful therapist) so I have been to a lot of different mental health professionals. All very aware of my state and past prescription attempts at getting better. I started taking meds for the first time around 15 years old. I have tried every antidepressant available to me over the years that I am not allergic to and even some antipsychotics. 

Every single medication caused some type of negative response from me either a severe allergic reaction where I absolutely could not continue them, teeth grinding, profuse sweating, being unable to sleep, worsened symptoms where there was just no point in continuing, extreme intrusive/suicidal thoughts which make everything much worse, or a laundry list of physical side effects I couldn’t tolerate. I have yet to find any medication that has a positive impact on my situation to a point where a part of me really questions psych meds and doctors competence/effectiveness. 

I have tried medications for “armoring” to try and relax me as doctors thought that they would help with my anxiety and physical pains (thus improving my mood), medications they give to stop nightmares/sleep paralysis which had 0 effect, you name it and I’ve tried it. I am just about to start Seroquel to see if that will help me due to the tiny window of time in which Latuda helped me before causing serious weight gain, acne, sudden facial hair growth (I’m a female and have never had this before it is a rare side effect of Latuda) and causing worsened suicidal thoughts out of nowhere. Both medications are antipsychotics and my psychiatrist thinks it could potentially work like Latuda did - hopefully longer and better and be beneficial in stopping sleep paralysis and nightmares by causing a deeper sleep. 

This sounded like a great idea and I wanted to inform myself about it more and read up on it and it looks like the risks of Seroquel outweigh any benefits it could even potentially give me. Serious weight gain was a side effect, inability to sleep less than 15 hours, lack of personality etc. I am already struggling with my physical health and can’t afford to gain any more weight. I sleep entirely way too much as it is despite never getting restful sleep but I am always exhausted. I’m not sure how a medication that is known to cause all of this stuff is supposed to help me. 

I’m wondering if medication simply will never help me at all. Right now the only benefit I’ve ever experienced was with Alprazolam at a low dosage taken when I am having a panic attack that causes hyperventilating. The erratic breathing calms down and I am usually left pretty tired and can transition out of such a panicked state. This is obviously not an ideal solution but whenever I do have one of these terrific panic attacks my life is derailed significantly and any help is worth it. This is also clearly not sustainable long term in life at least I don’t think it is and that does absolutely nothing for my other issues brought on by my Complex PTSD. 

My doctor says this is pretty much the last thing we can try. I am kind of scared for myself and wondering if I will ever be able to improve or progress in life because of my sleeping problems, unregulated thoughts, severe depression and lack of focus if no medication can so much as touch any of that stuff. Has anyone been through this where everything they tried to use to help caused bigger issues? What did you turn to for help in your symptoms? Does it ever get better? 

My psychiatrist mentioned that the antipsychotics are usually used to treat bipolar disorder and brought up that I could be bipolar. This actually really annoyed me because I don’t have any bipolar attributes whatsoever. I am always extremely low, down and tired. I have never felt manic before in my life and my mood shifts are more like minute to minute and shifting from depressed to anxious rather than the time periods of depression and mania described as being bipolar 1 or 2. It felt invalidating to my C-PTSD and also as if she was just saying something with no factual basis. I am worried she is giving up on me at this point but what else is there to try if I have tried it all? Therapy can only do so much."

When I talk to people I think that I’m an embarrassing and weird person. My therapist laughed at me in a moment when I was so damn open and honest with her. That fucked me up so much but I try to overplay it.

I hate myself and I hate my live. I won’t ever be able to be confident or self-loving if not even my family loves me. I’m afraid to even form an identity because then someone will not like me for it. So I’m stuck here being a nobody.

 They're not perfect, but they're trying so hard to understand me rn and get me the help I need and it's almost harder this way than when I was younger and trying on my own, before I even heard of CPTSD and thought my dirt childhood was just how things were.

 I feel caught between trying to meet my needs, being triggered for having to explain my needs, fighting the instincts to cater to my moms every need every time she sighs, being triggered for having to draw a boundary and being terrified that instead of it being respected they will abandon me. Every time one of my parents says something wrong I feel resentful and when they say something right I feel this huge wave of guilt.

 It feels so wrong almost trying to talk to professionals about my relationship with them from childhood and then say ""yeah, my insurance doesn't cover you so my parents are paying out of pocket"" (I'm 28 and live with my husband)"
Cracks in childhood memories (sexual and emotional trauma trigger). LONG,4,mfrz9i,3,"I will preface this with this: 
I am 36 years old, female from the U.S. born to a single mother with no idea who my father is and really no extended family. I have a mother and grandmother only.  I have two children and a husband, who I met when I was 19 and we’ve been together since. 


I have been  NC with my mom May 2020 and my Grandmother September 2020. This was a large downward spiral that I recognized that was coming leading up as my family hasn’t been the most ideal and perfect and comparing stories to other people in my adulthood.


My grandmother and grandfather and mother basically had 50/50 custody of me without being on the books for it on the court. When I was in roughly 3rd grade my mom met someone and things were O.K. But I also suffered by this person too, emotionally. 

My earliest memory as a child was when I was in 1st grade and this was the first time and only time before the “big move” as I call it to be. It was very short lived for less 3 months as my mon ended up getting evicted I found out In 2019.  My mom would drop me off early for school and I’d wait and then I would promptly take the bus home. 

My mom was either A) late b) forgot about me. I stood there for a while and couldn’t figure out what was happening so I walked probably a mile back to our house as we lived off a country dirt road. I couldn’t get inside the house as it was locked up so any child whose been instructed with some common sense walked to a neighbors house and off I went with my lace on top socks with keds and my backpack.  My
Neighbor met my mother but this was back in the day and no cells existed.  She gave me a snack after school and let me watch tv. She was an elderly woman and we sat there together and we talked about my day and myself.  It was getting dark and my mother wasn’t home yet as she drove us to the house and we waited for a few minutes and then we went back. Well, I went back. She drove me back and I sat inside and watched tv as she waited for my mom. No idea what happened during that time but eventually my mom came for me. 


Between the few months my mother lived there it was a common thing she wouldn’t just pick me up so I went home alone after that after the bus dropped me off. I watched other kids get hugged and picked up by their parents but I was alone. 

During this time I was sexually assaulted in my “sleep” by my moms best friends husband and so we’re her two girls. No one really knew about this and it’s been repressed for many years. One of those two girls went to go on and do great things and the other one isn’t and struggled and still is with addiction. 


I can’t really remember any thing much about my childhood with my mother involved. I remember some of the good moments like one or two things but most things are overshadowed by all the bad things I’ve experienced as a child. 


I was always alone. I felt alone for the longest time. My grandparents always got into it with my mother and begged for them to have custody over me as my grandfather was my rock, he made money and my grandma was home when school was done. My grandfather was my ultimate protector. He loved me, and I never struggled with him around emotionally, physically and everything was always met. By this time I was going to be picked up by then Friday’s and they’d take me to school Monday mornings and then my mother would be there. 


I was never eating a proper meal and if I was lucky to eat something other than take out pizza or Chinese I wouldn’t eat probably till 9-10pm. 


I was locked out of the house with just having to go to my best friends house to spend the night, and frequently left to eat over there after school while my mom locked me out. She would lock the doors on me and told me to go, “to ** house.” It was like this between the ages 7 to 14. 

I was sparked a lot by her, hit with spoons and belts if I spoke out of turn and questioned, left alone majority of my childhood, yelled at (and now even in arguments I totally disassociate and completely block out everything happening and freeze). I have issues with self worth but it has been getting better 


I never gave any reason to worry - I was the ugly duckling. I was “chubby” according to my mother growing up.  I was told not to wear tank tops or too short of shorts, and that I was a tom boy and I should be more girly. (In the photos I do have a few I look average weight and normal).  None the less, I do have a complex about my body now.  I never did drugs as a teenager. I never snuck out. I never did any thing bad. I was the good girl and only had two friends. I felt alienated and alone most of my childhood and into my teenage years and many of my early adult years. I always felt like if I am not good enough for my mother to spend time with me why would any one want to be friends with me?  Between 6th grade and 7th grade things changes drastically for me but because of a move to a different city. It was very hard for me, as I lost my only best friend I’ve known for the longest I’ve ever been friends with someone. I felt lost and had to make a new friend all over again. 

I eventually did Make 1 friend. I made mediocre grades growing up and struggled with a lot of foundation math and language arts only due to the fact between K and 3rd grade we moved a lot and I never stayed in a school more than a half a year to a year and an absent mother.

This all set the stage for where I am now as an adult. 
There’s more what happened as a teenager but it’s been a major struggle to recognize what I experienced as a child has formed me as an adult.  


I made it a goal when my husband and I had children no one would have them except us and one of us would always be home and no one else would watch them and they’d always always always have someone there no matter what. 


My mom doesn’t recognize the issues that she has caused growing up and how it was basically her fault. We say adults like this don’t have the proper tools in their tool belt and my grandma definitely didn’t but my grandpa did. Together they were incredible. But when he died when I was 20 the cracks in her started showing and she wasn’t a great mother to my grandma as her ex, my biological grandfather was an alcoholic and abandoned them when my mother was 1 so she had 3 kids all together alone for the first 6years of my mothers life.  She was raised by narcissist also, and majority spent her childhood and teenage years alone too and she has recognized my mothers issues and what she had experienced but says,”let bygones be bygones because your children deserve their grandmother in their life so she can make what she did wrong up to them”. 
I tried  doing that but she kept repeating the same
Stuff with them as she did with me but way more off hands, and way less attentive. She’s been known to leave games, concerts, ensembles, state and local level, tournaments midway. Cancel last minute or show up late to leave early. 

My grandma tried to do her best but she stands no matter what behind my mother no matter how awful she is and even one night I cried to her and asked her if what my mom felt was more important than how I felt and I was the child being left and abused? And her feelings being validated were more important than mine? 

She couldn’t answer me. So, here we are.

I do feel happier without them but I mourn for an actual family outside of my own. Memories and stuff to talk about it to my kids about what I did growing up and what fun stuff we did and the memories I have from my own childhood but I have very limited memories."
Hope this is helpful to some of you,78,mfrt65,18,"I don't have CPTSD myself, but I appreciate this sub a lot and like to learn about trauma and mental health for the sake of broadening my compassion. A few days ago there was a post about how people without severe trauma can judge other people with trauma because they haven't achieved very much in relation to their standards, which stem from living a life that wasn't very difficult in a lot of ways.

It reminded me of a quote from Sylvia Plath that I would like to share with you. Sylvia Plath was a famous 20th century poet, and many of you probably know her or are a fan of hers. She was a known perfectionist, got straight As at school, got a scholarship to study at the university of Cambridge, was published in many literary magazines and journals since she was 8, won a scholastic art and writing award for her art aged 15, wrote a novel, released anthologies and raised two children. She was a very accomplished woman in so many ways but unfortunately, she struggled a lot with her mental health. This is what she had to say, in relation to personal achievement, in 1957:

>**""If I get through this year, no matter how badly, It will be the greatest victory I've ever done.""**

That's it, no accolades, no awards, no new book, or anthology. Simply, if I get through, no matter how badly, then it will be the greatest achievement of them all.

The same can be said for all of you.

Honestly? I'm straight up not having a good time right now and I haven't told anyone,30,mfrot5,4,"My dissociation is running absolutely crazy to the point where I'm wondering if I'm even real or if life's just a simulation. I exist in a terrifying, confusing fog. I get random spikes in my flight response, seemingly out of nowhere. I struggle to even keep myself fed and presentable. My sleep is terrible and I can't remember the last time I got a good nights rest.
School is completely overwhelming and I haven't learned anything since october, I'm completely checked out and unable to concentrate but I can't take a leave of abscense because then I'll be without money. I get random pangs of horryfying death anxiety and panic attacks. I feel so fucking lonely and broken and I have no access to therapy or any help really. I self-medicate with alcohol even though I have it under control and know that I shouldn't but it's the only time I can relax. I try to psycho educate myself whenever I have the energy but most of the time I'm just waiting for something to change. I'm carrying around so.much.shit but still I can't seem to process it, it just gets more and more."
Does anyone else feel emotionally younger than their actual age?,167,mfrn0t,42,"This might just be me, but I grew up with an engulfing mother and so I didn't have to make too many real ""adult"" decisions until much later in life. I didn't live totally alone until I was almost 30, I didn't have my own bank account until I was older than that. My bank account was a hold over from an attached account I had as a teen that she could see activity on. Everything I've ever done involved her in some capacity.

I have always feel emotionally like 5-10 years younger than my real age. I have friends in their late 20's who are settling down and getting married and I feel like I'm JUST NOW at that place in my late 30's. I feel mad that I'm just now starting to undo the bad habits I learned from her - things like using guilt to get what I want, or trying to be enmeshed with a partner. I'm proud of the person I'm becoming, but I'm sad that I didn't see the signs sooner."

emergency contact for isolated abused person,18,mfrdml,4,What do you do in the event that a job application or something else asks for an emergency contact number but you have no one in your life you can depend on? I am trying to move away from home and I live with abusers so I’m very isolated.

DAE instant regret after leaving a therapy session?,1,mfr9f3,2,"I’m extremely socially anxious, and saying personal things out loud to my therapist is very overwhelming. 


I always feel stupid and wrong and like I said too much after a therapy session. And then regret saying certain things at all. I’m scared that she is  secretly judging me and that she hates me. It’s all I can think about for the rest of the day. 


Am I the only one?"
I feel so gaslighted by the constant societal messaging of: “you need to learn how to validate yourself and not rely on others”,1003,mfqtlm,161,"I really do get where people are coming from but come on. This whole concept makes me angrier than I can explain. As much as it is partly in truth, how could it actually be possible to embody a feeling you’ve never even experienced before? 
I just read an article that said, “If we want to connect with a person, we do it because we genuinely want to connect with him or her. Not because we want something back, or we’re afraid of being alone.”

Honestly, I would do anything to be able to exist this way in the world. Of course I genuinely want to connect with people authentically. But when I grew up in a “family” that makes me feel no sense of worth, belonging, or love, how could I seriously NOT be afraid of being alone or wanting a certain outcome, like a healthy version of love being given back to me? Is that seriously too much to want out of life? 

What about all the studies that prove a greater feeling of well-being in people who feel a sense of community and support by those around them?  

Ugh I just feel so frustrated and stuck about how to overcome this I can’t even think straight sometimes. As much as I hate this concept I actually wish it was true so I could stop feeling so controlled by my trauma...

psychiatrist deines mistreating me,15,mfqqgk,3,"2019 I was at a psychiatrist. One year she tried to blackmail me and treated me very badly. When she went behind my back trying to harm me, my mother realised the danger she was and we never went there again. She also misdiagnosed me and admitted she never had the intention to do therapy. 

We didn't sue them because we had too much problems at the time. 

About a year later I got the courage to write a Google review. I wanted to save other children from going through that. 

I tried deleting my review since I was really scared but I couldn't find how. 

Now I got an email that I have to prove that it really happened or google will remove my review. The email came from Google and was partly written by the lawyer of the psychiatrist. 

I wrote back that my name is ...... and I was there in 2019. They should have my files. 

I so wish I had sued them back then. But I wasn't 18 back then. 

I live in Germany so you can't give me legal advise and I don't really want that anyways. I hope they just stop annoying me. 

Part of me thinks it is funny that they want my review gone. I suppose business isn't going well."
I got out,20,mfqpyp,1,I got out of an abusive relationship 3 years ago and lately I've been feeling really anxious lately. I'm in a healthy relationship now for the past year and a half and I've been healing. Over the last couple weeks I've been seeing glimpses of him in crowded areas and mistaking people for him. I don't know why suddenly it's affecting me. I haven't had many issues with it as of late up until recently. I think it has something to do with my depression acting up as well. Maybe it has something to do with my abusive parents being around more lately since im off work earlier. I just really needed to get this out. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about it. I'm sorry if I used the wrong flair I wasn't sure what to choose.
Book gave me an epiphany (Anyone else read this?),2,mfqama,5,"So I recently had a trauma specialist tell me I probably have CPTSD (lots of low-grade trauma, won't get into it). I started reading the book ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" and lowkey felt like I had an epiphany. Obviously, not everything in the book applied to my situation, but it was wild reading it because some parts felt like I was reading an exact description of my childhood. Also, the part about ""internalizers"" and ""externalizers"" felt like a weirdly accurate description of my dad and my mom (respectively), and gave me a new understanding of my parents' divorce.

Anyone read this book? What are your thoughts on it? Did it help, and do you feel it was accurate? I recognize that ""Popular Psychology"" books are not always the best or super accurate, but because this was written by a therapist I felt good about reading it, but then again I'm by no means in a position to judge the accuracy of a psych book because I have zero training in psychology."
''It's not okay to be too functional or happy'',64,mfpq7y,13,"I've been taking care of myself probably more than ever. From going to the dentist to finally figuring out why my skin always hurts, from yoga and meditation in the morning to booking a (safely distanced) vacation. And covid/this last year has been about breathing, taking breaks, slowing down. Which has been the biggest change. When I'm early for an appointment, I don't runwalk around the block stressing myself out more – I sit on a bench and watch life go by, close my eyes in the sun, take a sip of water. 

I'm getting emotional typing that – because taking up that space, I can't remember ever doing that. Wherever I am, I always expect someone to say: can you leave? can you move? can you get me a drink? And for years, my automatic fawn response meant that I would be standing up before they'd even finished their sentence. 

It hurts that my (pretty shitty) therapist never understood what I meant. If you're happy, that's good! Yes, but the moment I'm enjoying myself, it's also triggering. I'm on edge, to say the least. A wave of shame and guilt hits me. I feel selfish. I get paranoid, think someone must be watching me. I project my inner critic, my mother, onto the world. And I'm aware of it, but can't stop it. 

If she could hear me breathe, she'd yell at me. Sighing was out of the question. I would stare at something and she would follow my eye line, draw conclusions, then attack. I wasn't allowed to sit on the couch anymore because it sagged – so she drank her coffee on it, while I sat on the floor during a visit. In hindsight, that was probably another weight comment. It's not normal, I know that – but it's all I've ever known. 

I do smile when I see how my own couch has sagged. How friends have spilled stuff and panicked, and I didn't care. After a lot of healing, I can breathe. Looking at whatever I want – that one I still struggle with. Some people do follow your eye line, not meaning anything by it, but it's been too triggering. There's progress, albeit slow, and that's important to remember. 

&#x200B;

A week ago or so I was really happy. And I had worked for it. Exercised, then did my yoga and meditation, got some stuff done, did some therapy exercises, cleaned my apartment. I kept saying out loud: it makes no sense for me to be this happy! Pandemic, loneliness, zero people in my life, no career goal I'm working towards, just doing some simple self care – and yet. I was so happy. 

And then it all came crashing down a lot harder than it has in a while. I mostly felt so, so selfish. Immediately there was depression. And fear of abandonment, most of all. 

Of course anger wasn't okay either. But sadness was definitely more accepted – at least I was easy to control that way, she didn't have to envy me, I wasn't a threat. And it was all black sheep gossip material, of course. It makes so much sense that to be safe, I become depressed. I make myself small and miserable. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to let go of what she taught me, because it's in my body. The moment I'm happy, I feel unsafe. Sometimes, thank god, I get so angry. That doing well is something to be punished. She rolled her eyes when someone was happy, called it being lucky, showing off, self obsessed. People work for it. I work so hard for it. Maybe a rare few are just very lucky – but the rest of us work. Why on earth would you make someone feel bad about it. 

I'm trying not to obsess about it, be curious instead. Have hope. One day I'll figure this out. Bird by bird. But it can be very disheartening, when simple things are made extremely difficult by CPTSD. When no therapist was ever properly educated on it. When a bunch of them retraumatized me. When taking care of yourself is followed by an emotional flashback. I am still being punished for being happy. And I don't know how to unlearn what she taught me – the stumbling in the dark is so frustrating. Because I feel like I'm just experiencing the same thing over and over. Self care > happines > emotional flashback > depression. 

How am I learning? Am I not just still stuck in the same vicious cycle? How do I let go of this fear? Kind of rhetorical question, but also kind of not – if anyone has any wisdom, experience, resources to share, please do.

(Oh, and the quote is an enneagram type 4 childhood message – one I didn't really understand five years ago. I've been thinking about it a lot, lately.)"
"How can I support my partner, who has childhood trauma?",12,mfpo3r,3,"My SO has childhood trauma - I dont know more ... she told me that its very hard for her to talk about it (she only told 1 person more about it).
What are ways in that I can support her? Or what are some DOEs and DON'Ts?"
I feel like I'm the only one who can't speak clearly/with my own voice anymore.,9,mfpiv1,2,"After I dissociated my voice completely changed and it has never returned to normal. It feels like I am forcing sounds to come out of my mouth. It is my most annoying symptom. Like the emotions behind the voice aren't there and I'm just making my voice do things to get through the day. The only time I don't have trouble with my voice is when I get angry, then I just get swept away in the anger and I don't have to think about my voice, I can just talk. But usually, my voice is quiet, mumbly, raspy, non-existent. It makes socializing so hard because my voice sounds like garbage, then I feel shitty over how it sounds and get frustrated, and people pick up on that frustration and it kills the vibe.

Does anyone else struggle with their voice? It used to be smooth and I never had issues with it before but now I have to clear my throat before I speak every time. Like what the fuck? I just hate this man. Does anyone else know what is going on and has dealt with this? Your voice and how it sounds is a huge part of your personality and I feel like I don't even have one and it really sucks and I'm tired of it."
Life is going relatively well,2,mfoqsd,1,"Since about 14-15 I have had some pretty bad mental problems.   I didn't live a very good lifestyle and my household was loving but they had some serious shortcomings.   I believe I learned violence at a young age from many different sources.  Parent's, Media, School.  I have done some things many people would find heinous,  I find them to be pretty abhorrent at least.  I am doing really well mentally.   Around the age of 17 I reflected on my life and that led to auditory hallucinations I am sure off of a self shame.  

Probably related to parents and family but everyone has that to an extend.  I am doing much better now and I have really high hopes for life.   I just need to get away from my mother.   As much as I love her to try to this bitch drives me nuts.   Constantly bitching about something or someone.  Just a negative person.  

I am sure she has ptsd,  I am certain she will never get help or go to recieve any.  I see her future and I don't see much happiness in it. I find not treating mental illness is like having a benign medical condition like stage 1b skin cancer.   The doctor tells you if you deal with this now you will be fine.   When you don't acknowledge it,  It will just keep growing and growing.   After several years or a good bit of time goes by you are a shell of your former self.  

It spreads all throughout your soul and you become a shell.   People visit you but you are not the same person anymore.   In this instance people will talk shit and say,  ""They should have gotten it treated sooner."" And they would be right.   You can't really feel bad for that person and they can't feel bad for themselves.  That's the way I look at it.  

The past few years I have been trying so fucking hard to help myself.   I've taken every major antipsychotic,  ADHD medication.  I've taken entire pharmacys of medications to better my thoughts and to change.   I couldn't live with the hallucinations and I was going to kill myself if I didn't get better.   So no,  I don't feel bad for people who don't help themselves,  To an extent I pity them but I don't feel too bad.   

I am sorry this is the route my mother chose and I will eventually have to leave her and probably have nothing to do with her,  She isn't a bad person though I do think of her as an idiot of sorts.   She's just broken to the extent I cannot fix because she will not do anything about it.  I am currently living on her couch and I am renting a room which I cannot wait to do.  I am getting a car in a few days and my sister will be going off to college soon which I will be adamant about. 

I don't want to leave my mother alone but she cannot drag us down with her,   I will not allow that.   I do wish her the best though.   It's a bullshit situation,  Of course I wouldn't be coming out smelling like flowers but hey,  I'll be fine.   I came this far,  Might as well keep going....

No Options.. Just Surviving.. Lost..,2,mfoo35,2,"**Childhood Background:**

* Borderline PD, ADHD, CPTSD, GAD, &  MDD
* Chronic Sciatica due to L5 herniated disk
* History of alcoholism and drug abuse

**What I've Tried:**

* Talk therapy; therapist does not understand and likely sees me as a lost cause (moved us from weekly to biweekly)
* CBT/DBT, both are simple concepts, yet when I apply them to myself, they do not help.
* Medication; 
   * anti-depressants -> unfeeling psychopath & irritable panic attacks increase

   * anti-convulsant (current) -> nothing?
* Physical therapy; no improvements in sciatica

&#x200B;

**Why I'm Here:**

No family, no friends, no job, and now about to fail out of school as I have 30 days to do all the coursework for two classes from the last week of January until April 29th.

I lost my job as my physical and mental health deteriorated over the course of 2020, and I gave 2,000 (my savings) to a ""friend"" because he was behind in bills from catching covid and not being able to work for two weeks. He promised I'd get it back this tax season, when he would have student loan reimbursements and tax returns (he'd also have the stimulus check), and I even reminded him that I'm short on money for rent because I lost my job and cannot work, but I haven't received shit and he posted on social media a picture with his brand new car. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Needless to say, I'm done fucking with people and I deleted my social media altogether. 

My last source of income is school loans, but even if I do manage to complete this coursework in time, I don't have enough money to hold me over until next Fall (just enough to get me to June). Even though one could argue I am disabled, the government is not going to give a 25 year old with a college degree and a work history disability without a very long and drawn out fight. Even the though of the process exhausts me, and I have no were to stay or get food from until however many years that process would take.

No one can help me, no one understands me (""just be happy"", ""have you tried therapy"", ""here's a hotline to call"", ""Jesus loves you"", ""you just have to do it"", and so on), and I'm not getting better, only worse. I can't do physical therapy and buy/cook food to have a healthy diet so that my spine can heal (if it'll ever actually heal) because I am constantly grinding and behind on college no matter how many Ibuprofens, Adderall, and Caffeine pills I take, and I have to eat fast/comfort food to keep from being engulfed in depression and to save time. And because my physical health is bad, and my mental health consists of me ruminating on all my failures, how no one loves me, how I'll die alone, how people betray me, how no one will ever understand me, how I want to just die, how I don't want to die, and what it's like to die, I struggle to even focus and get anything done. 

So why do I even bother, why am I so determined to do this schoolwork? I feel lost and forgotten, and like I'm just fighting to survive as that is what I have been programmed to do from birth? I don't know, maybe it does not even matter. I don't know what there exists in this life for me, but I figured I'd try one last thing posting here to see if anyone else out of the 7 billion people in the world gets it or will even bother with this long fucking post."
Will leaving my home City far away from bad experiences/trauma help at all with me moving on and leaving the past in the past?

Does anyone else feel like they always have to open to sex with their partner?,10,mfodla,5,"I have a hard time saying no to people generally, but it's worse when it comes to sex. I feel like I always have to be open to having sex with my partner because he so often rejects me when I really do want him. So I feel like I have to be ready for when he wants me. It often leads to me forcing myself to do things I don't want to and it's making me feel very anxious. He thinks that I have a higher sex drive than him and that I'm always horny. I don't know how to tell him that's not true. Any advice would be appreciated."

Short term memory loss/confusion episode after triggering experience?,2,mlpsuf,2,"Ugh This is a bit long....sorry!  I could use some hot takes and support/advice on this.  *deep breath because this is hard to admit*

Last week I had a triggering gyno exam to investigate a problem I am having and found out I need some follow up procedures that are particularly problematic for me due to some past traumas.  I was upset but doing ok I thought.... I worked, did normal stuff for a week.  Then yesterday afternoon I had a period of about 6 hours at home where my husband says I was making sense when I talked, but was lost/confused, kept asking the same questions over and over, and appeared to have no short term memory.  I apparently acted like a person with a bad concussion or dementia.  I cannot remember any of it today - the whole thing just completely blank even when he describes our conversations and stuff we did it rings no bells at all.  Also things that happened the day before that I do remember fine feel like they happened a week ago, like time dilated or something.  

Pretty sure this episode was psychological in origin based on prior experiences.  The other time I had this sort of severe reaction (plus severe depressive symptoms not currently on my menu) I was hospitalized in a mental ward and the docs agreed it was definitely psychological that time.  That was 5 or 6 years ago.  This episode was a little different but similar enough to convince me it is my mind not my body doing this.  If it happens again I have agreed to see a medical doctor to make sure, since as a middle aged lady I know some things can get wacky with thyroid, hormones, etc.  Doctors are one of my triggers so I really hate to go down that road unless it is super urgent.

I do have a history of dissociation, time loss, and cognitive impairment when super triggered, but consider myself recovered for a few years now (25 years of therapy/meds before that recovery and I thought it was solid) and this episode took me completely by surprise.  I am physically a little shaky/panicky today but my mind is working though I am still kinda weirdly distracted.   I am having some crying jags today that start and stop abruptly, but have been able to talk with my spouse about the underlying traumas so I think I am getting through it without too much walling off....dunno.  

I called in sick to work out of caution (I have a somewhat tricky/hazardous job and cannot forget/lose focus at it) but feel like I can probably go back in a day or two assuming I stay on track.  I am going to try to journal/cry it out for awhile each day to try to discharge the emotion.  I graduated from therapy and meds last year and was hoping to still do some EMDR for some landmines like this that I know still hide in my mind, but unfortunately every therapist I checked is booked solid because everyone is struggling these days due to *gestures at everything going on in the world this year*.

Anyway, looking for some advice, reassurance, or commiseration from any others who may have this sort of experience in their journey.  I feel like I am losing my mind....again.

Unfortunately I still need to have this super triggering gyn test and biopsy procedure and am unsure how to handle it.  I told them I have a couple of flavors of PTSD and needed a little time to prepare myself before scheduling it but I really can’t put it off much longer.  Advice on navigating this in particular is welcome."
Round of applause for the high functioning folk with heavy dissociation & fragmenting thinking,826,mlip58,115,"How the f\*ck have we navigated life with our 'headlights off' aka the prefrontal cortex?

I’m only ‘such a nice guy’ because of trauma.,214,mle7se,39,"Due to childhood trauma I literally can’t upset people. I was taught that everything was my fault and that I was responsible for my parents moods etc. 

So If I get the tiniest whisp of a hint that someone is upset with me I feel sick to my stomach with guilt. I just can’t cope with it. 

Because of all of this I’m constantly told that I’m ‘such a nice guy’, but to be honest it never gets me anywhere except a bunch of responsibilities and co-dependant relationships. 

I wish I could learn to put some of my own needs first. I don’t mean going too far the opposite and becoming “a nice guy” selfish type. But I wish I could stand up for myself. Just a little."

I have memories of physically shrinking my body and slinking away quiet, scared and sad. The kind of fear where a cold wave washes over you (the trauma). I'd go to a corner of the house and pee my pants because I was afraid to ask them for help going to the bathroom. They'd do this to me for being too loud, speaking like an ""idiot"", being a crybaby. My trauma response was fawn to my parents and all adults.

* My second inner child is my primary school self. I had no shred of self-esteem and lived in a haze of humiliation. My parents were malicious with their comments and followed up with hour-long beating episodes (the trauma). They were paranoid every little thing I did meant I'd become a delinquent etc. etc. and violently stopped literally anything I tried or did until I did nothing. The cold-wave fear of being beat loomed over my head all the time. Looking back, most of my behaviors were normal for kids. It would be concerning if I *didn't* do those things. Bonus: My parents would say I need to be ""tough"", ""smart"", ""popular"" to be a worthy person, then they'd strip me of any dignity, so I felt like they didn't think I was none of those things (and therefore that I wasn't). I felt ashamed trying to curry approval from them, so I'd go to school trying to convince kids I was tough, smart, popular and get them to tell me I really was all that. 

* My ""last"" inner child was my middle school and high school self that lived in a state of perceived social rejection (the trauma). I couldn't connect with my peers because I was horribly insecure and used all social interaction as a way to flex on others to feel good about myself (characteristic of people who feel a strong sense of humiliation). My trauma response was fight at this time. I had to control people into giving me validation and if they didn't, I exploded. I had a strangely strong need to try forcing the reality I wanted to believe myself onto others for validation. People brushed me off and it was painful. My peers were my last resort at getting love and I thought I had to ""prove"" how awesome I was to get it. When I failed, I hit rock bottom and forced myself to fold into a pretzel as my second effort to get love. To my present day self, I ""am"" this kid back then who couldn't level with others. Who was weird. Who no one wanted to be around. Who has control issues.  

* My present day self has issues with freeze and fawn response (people pleasing and approval-seeking).

How far back am I supposed to go? If I ""am"" my last inner child, how do I keep unraveling that? God, at least if you're going to give me a puzzle of trauma, give me the brainpower to solve it."
How to stop getting suicidal when I have flashbacks if my trigger is racism and I can’t escape it?,75,mlg3zn,20,"Every time I have a flashback, I get suddenly and intensely suicidal. I can’t see the point in living at all if all I’m staying alive to do is constantly be reminded of all the horrific things I’ve experienced. And being black in America, I can’t escape racism triggers at all unless I sit in my house and do absolutely nothing. 

Since racism and racist bias and microaggressions are literally everywhere, all the time. I can’t go for a drive without seeing Trump and blue lives matter signs on cars, billboards, people’s houses. Shit I even passed a farm today that had a huge sign of Trump’s name in their crops. 

I can’t go into a diner without having the white waitress give me a weird look, I can’t turn on the TV without being reminded that people like me are automatically so hated we’re excluded from even having a normal amount of black people in a TV show, or they have subtle racist jokes, I can’t even chat with my white friends without them showing some level of white fragility. Or I get gaslighted. I can’t just come home from work without being reminded that I’m different because my white neighbors lock their car doors the minute they hear me get home. I can’t get a tattoo without the tattoo artist going off into some rant victim blaming black people for getting killed by the cops as if I’m gonna agree with him. I can’t go into the comment section of the Chauvin trial without seeing people call him a HERO for killing a black man that did nothing wrong. Or even the folks that probably deep down don’t have bad intentions but are performative and tokenizing. 

I guarantee even sitting here begging for some help on this subreddit, I won’t be able to escape it. 

I literally can’t do anything without it being right in my face, even from people that I love and care about and thought cared about me too. 

This is ON TOP of the horrific things that happened to me when I was little, that I’m also triggered on almost daily. There’s no where I can go where I’m not being reminded that I’m not wanted because of what I was born as, ON TOP of being triggered into remembering all my other biggest traumas from childhood

I just want to feel okay, but it’s like I can’t get away from triggers no matter how hard I try. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m always just “hanging on” but barely even doing that."
DAE have troubles with forcing themselves to do things no matter how urgent they are?,151,mlaxyf,18,"I'm experiencing this sooo hard right now. I really, really have to study but no matter how hard I try I can't force myself, it's almost like there's something invisible stopping me. 


Studying generally triggers me into flight or freeze and it doesn't help that my teacher is an unpedagogical, unreasonable ass hat that expect us to understand things on our own and sets too high expectations of us. Another reason is probably that my life depends on me studying right now because if I didn't I would be homeless without any money...
There's just so much toxic shame and panic buried within this."
"When I was 21, I had the police pull a gun on me because I was suicidal",27,mlmrah,7,"I've never told anyone the whole story before. I had a friend call 911 on me because I was suicidal and alone. He told me he had done it, so I was waiting for emergency services come. I was expecting paramedics. But when I opened the door it was the police. They told me to step outside, and I did, but when I closed the door behind me and turned back to face them, I realized the officer closest to me had his gun drawn and pointed right at me. I was 21, 5'8, 115lbs of weeping mess. I didn't have a weapon or anything in my hands. Just a young woman in pajamas and sandals who wasn't sure how to keep being alive when she was in so much pain.

All that was going through my head was, they're going to shoot me and the newspaper won't say my name. It will say, mentally ill woman, but it won't say my name. And no one will care because I have a history of psychosis and therefore I'm not a real person. He shouted hands up, and I put my hands up. He told me to turn around. I did, and then he told me hands behind my back and then they cuffed me and told me to sit on the steps. And after a short while of sitting there, they picked me up and threw me in the back of their car and when I couldn't cry quietly enough they yelled at me to shut up and then I'm pretty sure I just froze, all the way to the ER.

I never told anyone because I thought I deserved it because I was suicidal. I never told anyone because I thought they would judge me for being afraid. But ever since I've always been so frighrened of the police. Every time I see another mentally ill person has been killed during a wellness check, I'm thinking, it could have been me. It could have been me so easily."
DAE find it difficult to self soothe until you’ve said what needs to be said in anger?,76,mlbhve,17,Otherwise you’ll never be able to assert yourself?
Here is a list of things that has helped me - I hope someone can find this helpful!,93,mla01h,19,"I have found this extremely useful with getting my life back from an extremely dark place. I hope this can help someone. 

* Stop seeing people who caused you trauma and or trigger more flashbacks while you work to heal. For me, this meant stopping seeing my family and it was really hard to do. 

* Come to a realisation about who you are. You need to accept the bad and how it has shaped you. There is good in who are are. Consider taking the Myers briggs personality test and printing out the good things about your personality. Also research how trauma can effect your personality type. The information is out there.

* Knowing what happened to you and how it shaped you is very important. It can help you stop focusing on the bad and your trauma. Find out what happened and how you were effected. Knowing and accepting what happened and how it effected you can help you move forward. 


* Setup a vision board. Buy a cork board. Setup your goals for the next 5 years and your short term focus. Setup your budget. Research and write a list of activities that you would like to do - Eg, specific places you would like to visit in your area. Find some truths that really hit home with you. One for me was: “Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die” Print it all out and put it on your vision board.

* Read Pete walker from surviving to thriving and the body keeps the score. Check out neuroscientist scientists Andrew huberman podcasts or YouTube. I learnt from Andrew useful insights regarding habit forming and insights into the mindset of highly successful people.

* Fight against the victim mindset. It’s an easy trap you can fall into. I struggle with it myself because hell, most of us are victims of horrible trauma. But the victim mindset places the responsibility for your happiness and progress elsewhere. It’s a dangerous trap that can hurt your progress. The mindset I want to strive for is a nobody can hurt me mindset. 

* Microdosing shrooms. This helped me due to anti depressants robbing me of almost all feelings. Shrooms helped me feel again amongst other things such as feeling of well-being and increased energy. I’m not recommending this for everyone but it did help me.

* Reconnect to body, listen to it. Exercise more and make diet changes. Consider cutting caffeine and reducing sugar.

* Reconnect with feelings and trauma that is being suppressed. Accept your feelings and process the trauma. Easier said then done I know. It’s likely the toughest thing on this list by far. Microdosing helped me with this a lot. EMDR and other methods may help others. 

* Reduce weed, alcohol and anti depressants. I personally find it all helps suppress feelings and sometimes can reduce motivation. Weed is a bit different sometimes but ultimately I don’t think it’s very healthy for the mind unless it’s CBD based. Please don’t reduce anti depressants until you are ready, and see a doc first."
"If childhood trauma is so common, why do only some of us develop CPTSD?",20,mlktd6,13,"I was thinking about this lately after talking with a friend about his childhood. He had a horrible childhood too, his father was an alcoholic and his mom was mean and dismissive. He confessed it all to me while he was drunk one night. But he’s doing well for himself. He struggles with certain things like addiction and whatnot, but he’s overall doing really well for himself. 

I had a horrible childhood and developed C-PTSD. He had a horrible childhood, and managed to stereotypically flourish outside of a few things. Why does this happen? What’s the difference?

Edit: to clarify, HE was the one that told me he’s doing well for himself. He told me he has addiction but doesn’t make a big deal of it because he’s had so many successes in his life"
I turn 23 today,10,mlobi6,2,"It’s just after midnight where I am, and I turn 23 today. The last year has honestly been the hardest year of my life, and I can’t believe I made it. Just wanted to share"
What are good environments for CPTSD folks?,29,mlg59e,24,"I live in Philadelphia and it's killing me.  I'm going to do what's right for me and find a new, better paying job in a healthier environment where hopefully more folks share my hobbies and values.  This is a big step in my recovery I believe.

So that got me thinking, what are good environments with folks with CPTSD?  I am a nature boy, so my mind automatically wants to move to a cabin a hundred miles away from the nearest town, but the more practical, mature part of me knows that I need access to resources and good people.  The suburbs kinda freak me out because I grew up there and the competitive lifestyle really isolated me.  I found the urban thing to be so rewarding for so long, but people are just dying every single day.  This place is a post industrial hell hole and I gotta get out.  I love to bike, so maybe living in a less toxic City with a good bike culture might be perfect?  I dunno.

What do you think?  Where do you live?  Is it good?  Is it toxic?  What do you like or dislike about it?  What should those of us with really active and aggressive triggers aim for in finding and building a home and community?"
I wish I could go back to high-functioning me,9,mlof8i,1,"That’s all. Life was easier when I put everything in a box and hid it. Now I see that box before me every day. Sometimes I look into it, but not much. I wish I could hide that box again but it keeps coming back. It was so easy to forget about it before, why can’t I do that any more. It’s annoying."
"Hello people with comlex ptsd, I have a question - How does somebody who has been marked by other abusers as a victim - deal with people who seem to smell/somehow quickly realize that I am an easy victim and have been abused, because I can't avoid such people?",92,ml8hv2,14,"For whatever reason it is easy for people to corner me, gang up on me, hate me for no reason and trigger me. This is why I hated group projects ever since I was the age of 12. It seems that everyone else is usually an asshole who can't work in a team and puts all of the responsibility on me. While I have had positive groups where different members take their part, it was usually more rare. I don't know how do I give my self away, is it that clear that I am emotional, am weak due to certain symptoms of ADHD that make me vulnerable, hyper emotional, sensitive to rejection and I am also an ex people pleaser and am codependent. I really really really struggle standing up for my self and putting boundaries. If I don't put a overly serious and cold demeanor people just start taking advantage of me. I don't know how dumb people find each other and start to bully me, but it always happens. I am afraid of going out because of it, because the outside world isn't safe, there is always going to be either a group of 12 year olds who imitate and smirk at me, or a group of drunk men who harass me. I don't know why the abuse doesnt' stop and how this dynamic forms. I don't understand social dynamics well and I don't understand how my friendly kind persona somehow screams - I AM WEAK, COME BULLY ME, I WON'T DEFEND MY SELF ANYWAY, FEEL FREE TO RAPE ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

&#x200B;

 I want to understand what gives me away and how to stop this cycle before it even begins. How does befriedning a group of new people somehow transforms into 6 or more people starting to bully me for no reason when they barely know me and I didn't hurt or provoked them, I  have always wondered what makes an easy victim and even read many articles and unfortunetly easy victims are intelligent people like me who are not dumb and agressive and don't scream or fight with other people which people see as - standing up for them selves. Jesus Christ, how can I stop this madness where people out of nowhere who barely know me create group and start bullying. I am tired of this mob mentality because I haven't done anything to deserve behavior where people gaslight me, can't apologize and don't care what they do and want to project their insecurities onto me"
A thank you to people over here,16,mlknv7,2,"Thank you for sharing your stories over here. The last few months have been terrible for me. Knowing that other people are struggling through something similar gives me a strange sense of community, a result of our tribalistic mindset perhaps."
What's the snarky remark you heard most as a kid from your caregiver(s)? [TW for verbal abuse],39,mle5w9,54,"(Prompted by [u/Flaky\_Web\_2439](https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaky_Web_2439/) 's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/mk0cjy/ask_a_stupid_question_get_a_stupid_answer/)  “Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer”)

You know, that 'default' insult that was likely passed down from earlier generations. Said in a dismissively snarky or sarcastic tone that was completely inappropriate in a parent-child relationship.

For me, it was ""Don't be ridiculous."" Not helpful for a kid who took everything literally, seriously, and personally."
Peeling the layers,10,mlnelz,1,"First I've realized that I can say no.

Then,

I've realized that I can want things.

I've realized that I decide.

I've realized that I deserve respect.

I've realized that people can lie.

I've realized that I was betrayed, that I was abused.

Then,

I've realized that I don't know who I am.

I've realized that I don't know what I want.

I've realized that I've never lived, that I was abused to be a mere Pavlovian doormat obeying puppy.

I've realized that my time is limited.

I've realized that I'll never get it back, and now I need to face the paradoxical consequences of it.

I've realized that I have feelings - ""I am sad"", ""I am happy"", not sure how it works yet.

I've realized that what people say I am, isn't necessarily true.

I've realized that I can enforce boundaries, that if I say no, it is A no.

I feel like it's too late to live my life, soon, in a blink of an eye, I'll be 30, the same way, without noticing, I turned 20.

It's depressing, I'm a mess, I'm trying to make it, but it's hard and I don't want to give up on my dreams, if, they're even MY damn dreams.

J'accuse! I blame! I blame my parents, my family, the bullies, the useless therapists, I BLAME.

They were all either straight abusive, lazy, blinded by their own disbelief, I blame them for messing it up.

Now, I've got to repair this broken man.

There's a saying - ""It's easier to build strong children than repair broken man"" and oh how true it is.

Because this broken man, and yes, I am broken, needs to repair himself, take of his inner child and prepare for his future self, and it's daunting, tiring and I'm on pits of despair.

The thoughts of what if, should've, could've terrorize my serenity.

This is my life unfortunately, this is it.

And fuck it, I am a victim. I'm not victimizing myself. That's what fate has given me - To be a victim of never being truly loved by your parents. To never know what true love is (except from Grandma). To never have a happy fulfilling childhood and teenage years.

This is my hand, but I'll play it well, hopefully.

I'm sad, as being realistic, I'll want to have children, but how can I have children, or even think about children, when there's this child here, this poor child who wanted love, warmth, recognition, inclusivity, a comforting shoulder and a listening ear which he never truly got?"
Compulsive picking,10,mln3zs,15,"I've always compulsively picked. My skin, hair, nails, anything. I've recently been compulsively combing my dog to get his dandruff out. I'll literally ignore the rest of my life to give into this compulsion. Anyone else?"
Don’t take Benadryl and SSRIs together,30,mlenxb,13,"This is more of a lighthearted subject for this subreddit. With the pollen count so high, my allergies have my eyes burning and I can’t stop sneezing. I started taking some Benadryl to get rid of the symptoms. Well, uh-oh! Turns out drowsiness is a side effect in both medications, and I can’t seem to stay awake after taking them both in the morning. Oopsie! Gotta get some non-drowsy Claritin instead, since I don’t normally take Benadryl for my allergies. Haha! Time to chug some green tea."
Does anyone else find job hunting incredibly triggering?,30,mle6h5,4,"My current boss is nightmare incarnate, down to shoving blame onto others and stealing credit. I need a new job, because day by day this is wearing me down to a shell.

However, looking for one has resulted in frequent panic attacks, breaking down into tears, and put me in a constant state of hyper vigilant fear. I’m trying to find a situation to improve my mental health, but all it seems to be doing is making it actively worse. Interviews where I feel I’m judged for everything, unfair deadlines they refuse to negotiate, a crippling fear of both change and failure... I don’t know how to do this.

Is this just me? How does anyone deal with this?"
"I have this intense need to make absolutely sure that the things I do are truly mine, not forced by somebody else, not influenced by somebody else. But that it's me.",9,mlmfvm,2,"I feel a bit dumb writing this, but I have this intense need to make things my own way. I feel like I've lacked an identity for so long and I fawned a lot during my teens especially that it became weird to even hear somebody say my name out loud. I couldn't connect that to me. 

Honestly I still quite struggle with who I am, I can't for the life of me say who I am if somebody asks me what I like or who are you. I get so confused and I try to really intensely research everything and rationalise (which I think is more of a flight response) to try and decide on very simple things. 

So here's where I'm at. I will literally spend hours just deciding on a product, whatever it is, is this the right match for me, is it truly me, was I influenced by somebody to get this. I need to truly feel that a clothing is mine, the food I eat is my choosing, the book I read is my choosing, the activities I do are my choosing. It's truly tiresome way of living. And maybe linked to my OCD, but I just don't feel good about things if I feel at all that they're not my choosing. Is it part of hypervigilamce or what, but I feel almost infantile trying to protect whatever small pieces of identity I've gathered together."
Buying myself flowers for the first time,44,mlb7bq,4,"I'm turning 23 this week, and have decided to buy myself flowers, took a step further and customized it!

This whole self appreciation thing seems too foreign for someone from my household - I can count by one hand the number of times we'd get 'gifts' from either one of our parents or the times we'd see them gift each other. Only time we'd get them were when we excelled academically, which didn't happen often btw (My siblings and I were well above average, just not by the standards of our Asian parents). Interestingly, in some occasions we would be asked about what we'd want, but get something completely different?? 

One time, my dad gifted me a set of books he chose and decided to add a personalized note, writing about how proud he was of me and how much he 'loved' me. Later that day, I walked into his room and found the exaact same set of books with the same note. Turns out he borrowed a friend's gift to his daughter, and copied out everything word for word bc he couldn't really bother coming up with anything himself. I didn't feel anything at the time, probably because it was the first time I felt 'appreciated'. Now I'm just mad, and it adds to the resentment I already have for him. 

Idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but I've started expressing to people beforehand about what I'd like to be gifted with, and if I got something I couldn't use/wear, I'd donate it. My family does give me shiiiiit for it lol"
Anyone feel like they need a slower pace of life because of all the trauma? Or wonders who they’d be instead without it?,8,mlm67j,1,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m not trying to discredit myself at all. I have suffered a lot of abuse in my life at the hands of both parents and ex partners and am surprised I can even get up and face the day sometimes.

I was very high functioning when I was younger, very academic, sociable, outgoing. 

A girl I work with is the same age and I just marvel at her, she works 7 days a week right now (4 in a lab and 3 with me in our retail job) runs a finance insta and is so educated about money, has solid friends, and is in her third year studying medicine.

I try not to compare myself but I look at her and think that if I had a better upbringing, that could have been me. 

Instead I am working just to keep my head above water, I don’t have any passions or career path and I feel like I’m not getting ahead. I almost feel frozen and not able to live my life as effectively as I should be"

A statement on the targeted killings of Asian women in Georgia,203,m8uqwu,10,"On March 16th, a shooting took place that ended with eight people dead in Atlanta, and six of those people were Asian women. This tragedy worsens an already precarious time for Asian-American communities, which have faced trauma evoked by a rise in hate incidents over the past year.

With the increase in COVID-19 cases across the U.S., racism against Asian-Americans also increased. Due to racially loaded language and misinformation promoted by the past administration, Asian-Americans have had to deal with a steep rise in harmful stereotypes and perceptions, stigmatization, and hate crimes. All of this on top of the stress of just being alive during the COVID-19 pandemic.

We want to acknowledge the pain and trauma that Asian-American communities have been facing for the past year and state plainly that we stand against the racial discrimination they've faced. Also, we would like to emphasize that Asian-Americans have always been victims of systemic racism and alienation within America--the past administration's response to COVID-19 just emboldened people to commit horrific crimes and spread anti-Asian rhetoric without fear of repercussions.

Our stance on Rule #3 remains unchanged from our response to the Black Lives Matter movement: racism, misogyny, and all kinds of various bigotries are a form of abuse. We do not tolerate comments or posts that perpetuate abuse against different communities in this community--including unintentional bigotry.

To our BIPOC members: please reach out if you need to because we genuinely care about your experience in this community, and we want this to be a space where you always feel welcomed and empowered to participate.

To our white members: remember to be careful when encountering posts about race-related trauma and consider whether it is appropriate and beneficial for you to participate in these conversations. Be a supportive peer and support your fellow BIPOC members when they express their thoughts and feelings here. If you see comments or posts containing hate speech, please report them--do not leave this burden to BIPOC. It gets very exhausting and disheartening very fast to shoulder the burden of tackling hate speech and prejudice as BIPOC.

Round of applause for the high functioning folk with heavy dissociation & fragmenting thinking,827,mlip58,115,"How the f\*ck have we navigated life with our 'headlights off' aka the prefrontal cortex?  So many times I have been 'offline', just drifting. Life has been tough . I am literally winging this sh\*t."
I’m only ‘such a nice guy’ because of trauma.,211,mle7se,39,"Due to childhood trauma I literally can’t upset people. I was taught that everything was my fault and that I was responsible for my parents moods etc. 

So If I get the tiniest whisp of a hint that someone is upset with me I feel sick to my stomach with guilt. I just can’t cope with it. 

Because of all of this I’m constantly told that I’m ‘such a nice guy’, but to be honest it never gets me anywhere except a bunch of responsibilities and co-dependant relationships. 

I wish I could learn to put some of my own needs first. I don’t mean going too far the opposite and becoming “a nice guy” selfish type. But I wish I could stand up for myself. Just a little."
Has anyone legally changed their name as a way to heal/cope/move on from the past?,371,ml7pbi,184,
DAE feel like they have multiple layers of wounded inner childs like a Russian doll?,82,mlfqnw,7,"Each inner layer contributed to the creation of the next outer layer.

* My first inner child was me at toddler age. I felt a prevailing sense of humiliation even then. My parents grabbed me gruffly and screamed while forcing my face to look straight at their terrifyingly angry eyes. I have memories of physically shrinking my body and slinking away quiet, scared and sad. The kind of fear where a cold wave washes over you (the trauma). I'd go to a corner of the house and pee my pants because I was afraid to ask them for help going to the bathroom. They'd do this to me for being too loud, speaking like an ""idiot"", being a crybaby. My trauma response was fawn to my parents and all adults.

* My second inner child is my primary school self. I had no shred of self-esteem and lived in a haze of humiliation. My parents were malicious with their comments and followed up with hour-long beating episodes (the trauma). They were paranoid every little thing I did meant I'd become a delinquent etc. etc. and violently stopped literally anything I tried or did until I did nothing. The cold-wave fear of being beat loomed over my head all the time. Looking back, most of my behaviors were normal for kids. It would be concerning if I *didn't* do those things. Bonus: My parents would say I need to be ""tough"", ""smart"", ""popular"" to be a worthy person, then they'd strip me of any dignity, so I felt like they didn't think I was none of those things (and therefore that I wasn't). I felt ashamed trying to curry approval from them, so I'd go to school trying to convince kids I was tough, smart, popular and get them to tell me I really was all that. 

* My ""last"" inner child was my middle school and high school self that lived in a state of perceived social rejection (the trauma). I couldn't connect with my peers because I was horribly insecure and used all social interaction as a way to flex on others to feel good about myself (characteristic of people who feel a strong sense of humiliation). My trauma response was fight at this time. I had to control people into giving me validation and if they didn't, I exploded. I had a strangely strong need to try forcing the reality I wanted to believe myself onto others for validation. People brushed me off and it was painful. My peers were my last resort at getting love and I thought I had to ""prove"" how awesome I was to get it. When I failed, I hit rock bottom and forced myself to fold into a pretzel as my second effort to get love. To my present day self, I ""am"" this kid back then who couldn't level with others. Who was weird. Who no one wanted to be around. Who has control issues.  

* My present day self has issues with freeze and fawn response (people pleasing and approval-seeking).

How far back am I supposed to go? If I ""am"" my last inner child, how do I keep unraveling that? God, at least if you're going to give me a puzzle of trauma, give me the brainpower to solve it."
How to stop getting suicidal when I have flashbacks if my trigger is racism and I can’t escape it?,79,mlg3zn,20,"Every time I have a flashback, I get suddenly and intensely suicidal. I can’t see the point in living at all if all I’m staying alive to do is constantly be reminded of all the horrific things I’ve experienced. And being black in America, I can’t escape racism triggers at all unless I sit in my house and do absolutely nothing. 

Since racism and racist bias and microaggressions are literally everywhere, all the time. I can’t go for a drive without seeing Trump and blue lives matter signs on cars, billboards, people’s houses. Shit I even passed a farm today that had a huge sign of Trump’s name in their crops. 

I can’t go into a diner without having the white waitress give me a weird look, I can’t turn on the TV without being reminded that people like me are automatically so hated we’re excluded from even having a normal amount of black people in a TV show, or they have subtle racist jokes, I can’t even chat with my white friends without them showing some level of white fragility. Or I get gaslighted. I can’t just come home from work without being reminded that I’m different because my white neighbors lock their car doors the minute they hear me get home. I can’t get a tattoo without the tattoo artist going off into some rant victim blaming black people for getting killed by the cops as if I’m gonna agree with him. I can’t go into the comment section of the Chauvin trial without seeing people call him a HERO for killing a black man that did nothing wrong. Or even the folks that probably deep down don’t have bad intentions but are performative and tokenizing. 

I guarantee even sitting here begging for some help on this subreddit, I won’t be able to escape it. 

I literally can’t do anything without it being right in my face, even from people that I love and care about and thought cared about me too. 

This is ON TOP of the horrific things that happened to me when I was little, that I’m also triggered on almost daily. There’s no where I can go where I’m not being reminded that I’m not wanted because of what I was born as, ON TOP of being triggered into remembering all my other biggest traumas from childhood

I just want to feel okay, but it’s like I can’t get away from triggers no matter how hard I try. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like I’m always just “hanging on” but barely even doing that."
DAE have troubles with forcing themselves to do things no matter how urgent they are?,150,mlaxyf,18,"I'm experiencing this sooo hard right now. I really, really have to study but no matter how hard I try I can't force myself, it's almost like there's something invisible stopping me. 


Studying generally triggers me into flight or freeze and it doesn't help that my teacher is an unpedagogical, unreasonable ass hat that expect us to understand things on our own and sets too high expectations of us. Another reason is probably that my life depends on me studying right now because if I didn't I would be homeless without any money...
There's just so much toxic shame and panic buried within this."
"When I was 21, I had the police pull a gun on me because I was suicidal",26,mlmrah,7,"I've never told anyone the whole story before. I had a friend call 911 on me because I was suicidal and alone. He told me he had done it, so I was waiting for emergency services come. I was expecting paramedics. But when I opened the door it was the police. They told me to step outside, and I did, but when I closed the door behind me and turned back to face them, I realized the officer closest to me had his gun drawn and pointed right at me. I was 21, 5'8, 115lbs of weeping mess. I didn't have a weapon or anything in my hands. Just a young woman in pajamas and sandals who wasn't sure how to keep being alive when she was in so much pain.

All that was going through my head was, they're going to shoot me and the newspaper won't say my name. It will say, mentally ill woman, but it won't say my name. And no one will care because I have a history of psychosis and therefore I'm not a real person. He shouted hands up, and I put my hands up. He told me to turn around. I did, and then he told me hands behind my back and then they cuffed me and told me to sit on the steps. And after a short while of sitting there, they picked me up and threw me in the back of their car and when I couldn't cry quietly enough they yelled at me to shut up and then I'm pretty sure I just froze, all the way to the ER.

I never told anyone because I thought I deserved it because I was suicidal. I never told anyone because I thought they would judge me for being afraid. But ever since I've always been so frighrened of the police. Every time I see another mentally ill person has been killed during a wellness check, I'm thinking, it could have been me. It could have been me so easily."
DAE find it difficult to self soothe until you’ve said what needs to be said in anger?,78,mlbhve,17,Otherwise you’ll never be able to assert yourself?
Here is a list of things that has helped me - I hope someone can find this helpful!,89,mla01h,19,"I have found this extremely useful with getting my life back from an extremely dark place. I hope this can help someone. 

* Stop seeing people who caused you trauma and or trigger more flashbacks while you work to heal. For me, this meant stopping seeing my family and it was really hard to do. 

* Come to a realisation about who you are. You need to accept the bad and how it has shaped you. There is good in who are are. Consider taking the Myers briggs personality test and printing out the good things about your personality. Also research how trauma can effect your personality type. The information is out there.

* Knowing what happened to you and how it shaped you is very important. It can help you stop focusing on the bad and your trauma. Find out what happened and how you were effected. Knowing and accepting what happened and how it effected you can help you move forward. 


* Setup a vision board. Buy a cork board. Setup your goals for the next 5 years and your short term focus. Setup your budget. Research and write a list of activities that you would like to do - Eg, specific places you would like to visit in your area. Find some truths that really hit home with you. One for me was: “Holding onto anger is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die” Print it all out and put it on your vision board.

* Read Pete walker from surviving to thriving and the body keeps the score. Check out neuroscientist scientists Andrew huberman podcasts or YouTube. I learnt from Andrew useful insights regarding habit forming and insights into the mindset of highly successful people.

* Fight against the victim mindset. It’s an easy trap you can fall into. I struggle with it myself because hell, most of us are victims of horrible trauma. But the victim mindset places the responsibility for your happiness and progress elsewhere. It’s a dangerous trap that can hurt your progress. The mindset I want to strive for is a nobody can hurt me mindset. 

* Microdosing shrooms. This helped me due to anti depressants robbing me of almost all feelings. Shrooms helped me feel again amongst other things such as feeling of well-being and increased energy. I’m not recommending this for everyone but it did help me.

* Reconnect to body, listen to it. Exercise more and make diet changes. Consider cutting caffeine and reducing sugar.

* Reconnect with feelings and trauma that is being suppressed. Accept your feelings and process the trauma. Easier said then done I know. It’s likely the toughest thing on this list by far. Microdosing helped me with this a lot. EMDR and other methods may help others. 

* Reduce weed, alcohol and anti depressants. I personally find it all helps suppress feelings and sometimes can reduce motivation. Weed is a bit different sometimes but ultimately I don’t think it’s very healthy for the mind unless it’s CBD based. Please don’t reduce anti depressants until you are ready, and see a doc first."
"If childhood trauma is so common, why do only some of us develop CPTSD?",18,mlktd6,13,"I was thinking about this lately after talking with a friend about his childhood. He had a horrible childhood too, his father was an alcoholic and his mom was mean and dismissive. He confessed it all to me while he was drunk one night. But he’s doing well for himself. He struggles with certain things like addiction and whatnot, but he’s overall doing really well for himself. 

I had a horrible childhood and developed C-PTSD. He had a horrible childhood, and managed to stereotypically flourish outside of a few things. Why does this happen? What’s the difference?

Edit: to clarify, HE was the one that told me he’s doing well for himself. He told me he has addiction but doesn’t make a big deal of it because he’s had so many successes in his life"
I turn 23 today,10,mlobi6,2,"It’s just after midnight where I am, and I turn 23 today. The last year has honestly been the hardest year of my life, and I can’t believe I made it. Just wanted to share"
What are good environments for CPTSD folks?,31,mlg59e,24,"I live in Philadelphia and it's killing me.  I'm going to do what's right for me and find a new, better paying job in a healthier environment where hopefully more folks share my hobbies and values.  This is a big step in my recovery I believe.

So that got me thinking, what are good environments with folks with CPTSD?  I am a nature boy, so my mind automatically wants to move to a cabin a hundred miles away from the nearest town, but the more practical, mature part of me knows that I need access to resources and good people.  The suburbs kinda freak me out because I grew up there and the competitive lifestyle really isolated me.  I found the urban thing to be so rewarding for so long, but people are just dying every single day.  This place is a post industrial hell hole and I gotta get out.  I love to bike, so maybe living in a less toxic City with a good bike culture might be perfect?  I dunno.

What do you think?  Where do you live?  Is it good?  Is it toxic?  What do you like or dislike about it?  What should those of us with really active and aggressive triggers aim for in finding and building a home and community?"
I wish I could go back to high-functioning me,9,mlof8i,1,"That’s all. Life was easier when I put everything in a box and hid it. Now I see that box before me every day. Sometimes I look into it, but not much. I wish I could hide that box again but it keeps coming back. It was so easy to forget about it before, why can’t I do that any more. It’s annoying."
"Hello people with comlex ptsd, I have a question - How does somebody who has been marked by other abusers as a victim - deal with people who seem to smell/somehow quickly realize that I am an easy victim and have been abused, because I can't avoid such people?",93,ml8hv2,14,"For whatever reason it is easy for people to corner me, gang up on me, hate me for no reason and trigger me. This is why I hated group projects ever since I was the age of 12. It seems that everyone else is usually an asshole who can't work in a team and puts all of the responsibility on me. While I have had positive groups where different members take their part, it was usually more rare. I don't know how do I give my self away, is it that clear that I am emotional, am weak due to certain symptoms of ADHD that make me vulnerable, hyper emotional, sensitive to rejection and I am also an ex people pleaser and am codependent. I really really really struggle standing up for my self and putting boundaries. If I don't put a overly serious and cold demeanor people just start taking advantage of me. I don't know how dumb people find each other and start to bully me, but it always happens. I am afraid of going out because of it, because the outside world isn't safe, there is always going to be either a group of 12 year olds who imitate and smirk at me, or a group of drunk men who harass me. I don't know why the abuse doesnt' stop and how this dynamic forms. I don't understand social dynamics well and I don't understand how my friendly kind persona somehow screams - I AM WEAK, COME BULLY ME, I WON'T DEFEND MY SELF ANYWAY, FEEL FREE TO RAPE ME PSYCHOLOGICALLY.

&#x200B;

 I want to understand what gives me away and how to stop this cycle before it even begins. How does befriedning a group of new people somehow transforms into 6 or more people starting to bully me for no reason when they barely know me and I didn't hurt or provoked them, I  have always wondered what makes an easy victim and even read many articles and unfortunetly easy victims are intelligent people like me who are not dumb and agressive and don't scream or fight with other people which people see as - standing up for them selves. Jesus Christ, how can I stop this madness where people out of nowhere who barely know me create group and start bullying. I am tired of this mob mentality because I haven't done anything to deserve behavior where people gaslight me, can't apologize and don't care what they do and want to project their insecurities onto me"
A thank you to people over here,15,mlknv7,2,"Thank you for sharing your stories over here. The last few months have been terrible for me. Knowing that other people are struggling through something similar gives me a strange sense of community, a result of our tribalistic mindset perhaps."
What's the snarky remark you heard most as a kid from your caregiver(s)? [TW for verbal abuse],36,mle5w9,54,"(Prompted by [u/Flaky\_Web\_2439](https://www.reddit.com/user/Flaky_Web_2439/) 's [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/mk0cjy/ask_a_stupid_question_get_a_stupid_answer/)  “Ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer”)

You know, that 'default' insult that was likely passed down from earlier generations. Said in a dismissively snarky or sarcastic tone that was completely inappropriate in a parent-child relationship.

For me, it was ""Don't be ridiculous."" Not helpful for a kid who took everything literally, seriously, and personally."
Peeling the layers,10,mlnelz,1,"First I've realized that I can say no.

Then,

I've realized that I can want things.

I've realized that I decide.

I've realized that I deserve respect.

I've realized that people can lie.

I've realized that I was betrayed, that I was abused.

Then,

I've realized that I don't know who I am.

I've realized that I don't know what I want.

I've realized that I've never lived, that I was abused to be a mere Pavlovian doormat obeying puppy.

I've realized that my time is limited.

I've realized that I'll never get it back, and now I need to face the paradoxical consequences of it.

I've realized that I have feelings - ""I am sad"", ""I am happy"", not sure how it works yet.

I've realized that what people say I am, isn't necessarily true.

I've realized that I can enforce boundaries, that if I say no, it is A no.

I feel like it's too late to live my life, soon, in a blink of an eye, I'll be 30, the same way, without noticing, I turned 20.

It's depressing, I'm a mess, I'm trying to make it, but it's hard and I don't want to give up on my dreams, if, they're even MY damn dreams.

J'accuse! I blame! I blame my parents, my family, the bullies, the useless therapists, I BLAME.

They were all either straight abusive, lazy, blinded by their own disbelief, I blame them for messing it up.

Now, I've got to repair this broken man.

There's a saying - ""It's easier to build strong children than repair broken man"" and oh how true it is.

Because this broken man, and yes, I am broken, needs to repair himself, take of his inner child and prepare for his future self, and it's daunting, tiring and I'm on pits of despair.

The thoughts of what if, should've, could've terrorize my serenity.

This is my life unfortunately, this is it.

And fuck it, I am a victim. I'm not victimizing myself. That's what fate has given me - To be a victim of never being truly loved by your parents. To never know what true love is (except from Grandma). To never have a happy fulfilling childhood and teenage years.

This is my hand, but I'll play it well, hopefully.

I'm sad, as being realistic, I'll want to have children, but how can I have children, or even think about children, when there's this child here, this poor child who wanted love, warmth, recognition, inclusivity, a comforting shoulder and a listening ear which he never truly got?"
Compulsive picking,10,mln3zs,15,"I've always compulsively picked. My skin, hair, nails, anything. I've recently been compulsively combing my dog to get his dandruff out. I'll literally ignore the rest of my life to give into this compulsion. Anyone else?"
Don’t take Benadryl and SSRIs together,29,mlenxb,13,"This is more of a lighthearted subject for this subreddit. With the pollen count so high, my allergies have my eyes burning and I can’t stop sneezing. I started taking some Benadryl to get rid of the symptoms. Well, uh-oh! Turns out drowsiness is a side effect in both medications, and I can’t seem to stay awake after taking them both in the morning. Oopsie! Gotta get some non-drowsy Claritin instead, since I don’t normally take Benadryl for my allergies. Haha! Time to chug some green tea."
Does anyone else find job hunting incredibly triggering?,31,mle6h5,4,"My current boss is nightmare incarnate, down to shoving blame onto others and stealing credit. I need a new job, because day by day this is wearing me down to a shell.

However, looking for one has resulted in frequent panic attacks, breaking down into tears, and put me in a constant state of hyper vigilant fear. I’m trying to find a situation to improve my mental health, but all it seems to be doing is making it actively worse. Interviews where I feel I’m judged for everything, unfair deadlines they refuse to negotiate, a crippling fear of both change and failure... I don’t know how to do this.

Is this just me? How does anyone deal with this?"
"I have this intense need to make absolutely sure that the things I do are truly mine, not forced by somebody else, not influenced by somebody else. But that it's me.",9,mlmfvm,2,"I feel a bit dumb writing this, but I have this intense need to make things my own way. I feel like I've lacked an identity for so long and I fawned a lot during my teens especially that it became weird to even hear somebody say my name out loud. I couldn't connect that to me. 

Honestly I still quite struggle with who I am, I can't for the life of me say who I am if somebody asks me what I like or who are you. I get so confused and I try to really intensely research everything and rationalise (which I think is more of a flight response) to try and decide on very simple things. 

So here's where I'm at. I will literally spend hours just deciding on a product, whatever it is, is this the right match for me, is it truly me, was I influenced by somebody to get this. I need to truly feel that a clothing is mine, the food I eat is my choosing, the book I read is my choosing, the activities I do are my choosing. It's truly tiresome way of living. And maybe linked to my OCD, but I just don't feel good about things if I feel at all that they're not my choosing. Is it part of hypervigilamce or what, but I feel almost infantile trying to protect whatever small pieces of identity I've gathered together."
Buying myself flowers for the first time,42,mlb7bq,4,"I'm turning 23 this week, and have decided to buy myself flowers, took a step further and customized it!

This whole self appreciation thing seems too foreign for someone from my household - I can count by one hand the number of times we'd get 'gifts' from either one of our parents or the times we'd see them gift each other. Only time we'd get them were when we excelled academically, which didn't happen often btw (My siblings and I were well above average, just not by the standards of our Asian parents). Interestingly, in some occasions we would be asked about what we'd want, but get something completely different?? 

One time, my dad gifted me a set of books he chose and decided to add a personalized note, writing about how proud he was of me and how much he 'loved' me. Later that day, I walked into his room and found the exaact same set of books with the same note. Turns out he borrowed a friend's gift to his daughter, and copied out everything word for word bc he couldn't really bother coming up with anything himself. I didn't feel anything at the time, probably because it was the first time I felt 'appreciated'. Now I'm just mad, and it adds to the resentment I already have for him. 

Idk if this is an unpopular opinion, but I've started expressing to people beforehand about what I'd like to be gifted with, and if I got something I couldn't use/wear, I'd donate it. My family does give me shiiiiit for it lol"
Anyone feel like they need a slower pace of life because of all the trauma? Or wonders who they’d be instead without it?,9,mlm67j,1,"I’ll preface this by saying I’m not trying to discredit myself at all. I have suffered a lot of abuse in my life at the hands of both parents and ex partners and am surprised I can even get up and face the day sometimes.

I was very high functioning when I was younger, very academic, sociable, outgoing. 

A girl I work with is the same age and I just marvel at her, she works 7 days a week right now (4 in a lab and 3 with me in our retail job) runs a finance insta and is so educated about money, has solid friends, and is in her third year studying medicine.

I try not to compare myself but I look at her and think that if I had a better upbringing, that could have been me. 

Instead I am working just to keep my head above water, I don’t have any passions or career path and I feel like I’m not getting ahead. I almost feel frozen and not able to live my life as effectively as I should be"
Crave for physical contact but flinch at it,6,mlmjut,2,"I hate this. today i had an awful experience at hospital. i had to have a biopsy done with about 5 minutes notice (didn't go to hospital for a biopsy)

so that was pretty traumatic - 2 stitches.
but what i wanted to talk about; The nurse touched me on my back.. bare skin and i flinched like she was a hot flame.
Then... she stuck a large needle into my back that i was forewarned would really hurt! and i was totally accepting and willing to endure it. if theres anything im good at its tolerating pain... i think i thought maybe at some point

no emotional response merely physical 'nerve ending' response.
But her touch terrified me. it was like being electrocuted. she said sorry my hands are cold.... but that was just a convenient excuse for me. she was really nice so i think she may have been helping me out there.
i had an emotional freak out from her merely touching me but a metalic needle causing me pain feels safe somehow.
Im feeling pretty damn alone right now after that feels like i have a literal bubble around me- im not personable!!!!"
the tough it up mindset,12,mlj56c,7,"my dad just tried to get me to read a book that he hasnt read yet, says ""its a true story about a guy who had a horrific childhood and got through it through just sheer mental toughness and discipline""

for some reason, this short interaction has made me incredibly drained and sad. for someone to overcome such tragedy and abuse and still ""get through it"" whereas i can hardly order at starbucks without freaking out is...humiliating. something along those lines. my dads values are along those lines of discipline, that if someone has a mental illness theyre just not trying hard enough to not have it. the type of person who didnt want my sister on medication for depression. somehow so smart, yet so in denial of science, and yet i still care that he would be disappointed if he knew how broken i am from him. i would be seen as lazy and manipulative, just as he saw my sister. i hate this ""suck it up, push through it with discipline"" mindset. its led me to extreme isolation and my mental health issues worsening. im disappointed that there are self help books like this, but then again, i guess anyone can write a book about anything. it doesnt mean its correct just because its in a book.

it also saddens me because its pretty hypocritical for him to advocate for ""mental toughness"" and ""discipline"" when he so often goes against his own values, yet getting angry at others when they dont follow them. im realizing the greatest thing i struggle with is validating my own pain. im so tired."
"I'm sorry I'm just in real pain now, I'm so sorry",29,mlbxwq,7,"I know probably no one will really read this, and that's okay, I'm just I'm sorry. I just maybe need some support rn because I'm so tired of being broken down all over again and it's all because of me. I just ended another therapy relationship, the one before that really didn't end well and I'm still struggling to heal from it and the one now, after everything that happened with the last one, and money issues I just couldn't go on with it, I told her beforehand that I'm not coming and we knew it meant goodbye and I've been crying about it for the last few days on and off between work, school and general house chores. I just got a text from her, today was our last appointment and she left me the option to come or not, I'm not gonna pay to say what I already said and hear what I already heard so I didn't go, she sent me a text thanking me for putting my trust in her and still trying, and that this is goodbye. It's all my fault, I know it is, I know I chose to end it and all the reasons behind it still stand but it really is all my fault, and everything that happened with the last t, and he was nice too but still I am so so hurt, I'm tired of myself, I'm tired of not healing, I'm tired of being blamed for my suffering and just go to therapy and just why are you so suicidal, so unstable, as if this pain I'm carrying is nothing but air, so why aren't you normal yet?? And I'm tired of having no memories at all and the depersonalisation that makes me want to slit my wrists almost on the daily just because it's too much, and I'm tired of being hurt by people who claim they just want to help and I'm tired of supporting myself and having no one in my life who can understand and code switch just so I can function, and failing to kill myself because I actually maybe care about myself and think I deserve so much more and can offer so much but also know I have no why of achieving it and why do I still get hurt by those people and systems, the only conclusion I can draw is that it's me and it's my fault but I can't fix it, and please please please I tried killing myself so many times these past two years but I keep actively or passively (by dissociation) stop it, so now according to my psychiatrist and the way doctors and therapists look at me I'm just unstable, insane, maybe I'm (god forbid /s) borderline. I'm just so tired of fighting this world.

i tried really hard, but pleasing you makes me miserable, for i want to love you, and my heart is bleeding but a relationship for me, just feels like a ceiling. it traps me, squashes me down, an anxious feeling. breathing? meaning? find one, find both. i cant fit your relationship box, maybe i’m poly, or maybe i’m just broken. take her out the box, brush off the dust, hidden at the back of the shelf. open the engraved golden clasp, let the ballerina dance, smiling in bliss, none of this confusing romance. but this dolly is broken, someone damaged her in the night. stole her batteries, crossed her wires, convinced her he was right. before i met you, my only experiences were hollowing. love wasnt something worth swallowing, for sadly in this lady’s life, teachers touched school kids, abuse takes a life. tell someone you said? cut me open with a knife. see how my heart is mouldy and brown, lie me on the police station table, examine me for evidence, who cares if i’m mentally unstable? at worst he’ll get a few years and a mark by his name, sadly the victims too caught up in her own self indulgent blame. he still teaches, i checked, facebooks got that sorted! after that, your profile, i finally reported. because i don’t want my fucking abuser, to like my shiny new profile picture, notifications are off now, blocked in a flicker. and no matter how many instagram posts on self growth, feminist tweet or sexual assault statistic, no one will understand the way i miss you, it’s sadistic, ballistic, i’m screaming, but only silence echoes out. drowning, still just praying my parents don’t find out. they’d kill you, then me, at age seven? or age nine? see i can drag a straight line, from your hands up my school skirt, to the dirty living room floor, where i got fucked like a whore. it’s like sexual trauma makes you hot, the male gaze isn’t clandestine, it’s not wrapped in fine wine and sunshine, it’ll rip out your insides. devour your soul, keep your relationship, i’m doing just fine."
Selfishness vs. Self Care,4,mlpxg7,1,"I was trying to explain my thoughts to my therapist a few weeks ago about how I needed to figure out how to put myself first in my life but without going to the point of being completely selfish. Then the other day while reflecting on one of my dad's stupid rants I realized that I need to remember that sacrificing my comfort for the wellbeing of others is OK but sacrificing my wellbeing for the comfort of others is not.
Do things that are a little bit annoying but keep someone else safer, healthier, etc.
DON'T do things that are a detriment to your own mental or physical health to prevent someone else's annoyance.
Really just a long-winded version of don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm but I wanted to share."
Does anyone here have messy handwriting?,14,mlhhs5,3,"I think my only symptom when I was a primary school kid was super ugly handwriting+a tendency to write so forcefully I would sometimes create holes in the paper+a tendency to chew on pens(like I would destroy some of them, not only leave tooth marks). 

I actually really enjoyed school and had amazing grades(and perfect spelling), which makes this weird and makes me think my disordered family must have been the cause."
How does someone who neglects and hates them selves learn how to love them selves?,9,mlk2yx,4,I feel like I have never loved my self. How can I start? What is a good way start? I tried affirmations but they don't really seem to work. Can you please give tips?
So sick of feeling miserable,5,mln2av,1,"Not even just the mental and emotional aspect anymore. My body is usually tense. Past three days though it's been extra tense and rigid combined with almost anxiety shaking. I'm already sore from an injury, but I thought I was getting better. The past three days though it's just been constant rigid shaking and I feel choppy. It feels like the aftereffect of a crash, but without the crash. 

It doesn't go away and stuck in the environment that damaged me and their snide comments are just icing on the cake. I can't even cry it just turns to uncontrollable laughter. So sick of bullshit and misery and shit stacking. I hate feeling it all just shut down. I try to heal and do what I'm supposed to do and something else waves over to drown me or stacks. 

Over and over and over and over and over until I just don't know. So many cravings and needs not being met and getting burned and now I'm physically getting screwed.

And nsfwish, but it's been rough and been lonely, but terrified of people so I tried just soloing myself a bit to try to relax and I couldn't even do that. I tensed up so much I couldn't even move. Just ended up crying and frustrated. 

Now I need to eat and I want actually food and there is just unhealthy crap they got and I can't afford to get anything better and just so stressed and irriated about so much pent up shit. There's no one to go to. No comfort physically or mentally here. I'm beyond my limits just irratable and hurt so much I'm angry and I don't want to be."
I really love how people will just get up in your face unprompted like that's a perfectly ok thing to do,64,ml7ea9,15,"I don't even have much to say other than people need to learn some boundaries. No, it's not okay to wave your hands around inches away from my nose to demonstrate a point. No, it's not okay to shove things at my face in the middle of a loud conversation. No, it's ***not okay*** to get up all close to me and yell (or speak loudly at all), even though it's just supposed to be for the sake of humor. And it's not okay to just fucking grab me! Honestly? I never say it to them, of course, but when people do that I'm about an inch away from shoving them to the ground and/or knocking their teeth in. Not because I consciously want to, not because I'm a violent person, but because the first instinct that my CPTSD monkey brain comes up with is ""Get threat away ***now.***"" People do NOT understand the massive anxiety spike it gives me and I don't know if I'm just around inconsiderate people or what, but it drives me insane. 

'Personal space.' Learn what it means. I feel like a perpetually irritable housecat. One of these days, somebody's going to spook me because they think it's funny and they're *going* to get clawed."
I hate how paranoid/hypervigilant I am when outside just trying to enjoy the fresh air,720,mktdk2,56,"I was out for a walk with my mom and these two guys came up behind and were talking, and I completely was unable to pay attention to what my mom was saying and started involuntarily trying to hear what they were saying in case they were making fun of us. My heart raced and I felt agitated and really anxious and shaking. This is just a normal thing that casually hits me every time I go out and there's people around. I hate this disorder. Wish I could relax like other people.

Edit: I feel the need to add we were not in a crowded area and had masks. I feel bad if I don't mention that detail. "
can anyone else not hold a job due to fear of rejection/criticism?,5,mlo2k0,2,"I’m 21, and have had three jobs before — I walked out of all of them.

For example, when I was 16 at my second job, I walked out mid-shift after only four days, because the coworker training me told me in front of a customer, “You should know how to do this by now!”

I was flooded with so much panic. That black dread that always comes with rejection/criticism. They were both staring at me and it felt like I was collapsing in on myself. I literally ran out and never went back.

Looking back I know my response was totally disproportionate to the situation but it really felt like I was going to die. It’s been like this every other job since, too. I know it comes with the territory, but I’m really terrified of criticism.

Does anyone relate? Have advice?"
The thing with boundaries,5,mlnh19,2,"They’re putting A LOT of perspective on how badly I was mistreated. I set boundaries with the people around me and they’re usually like “okay thanks for letting me know. I respect it.” But when I did that with people who used to be in my life, ex friends, ex therapists, my biological family. They’d get passive aggressive and do war campaigns on me. Like wow... 🤯"
How do I get my heart rate down?,7,mljllr,13,"I am overwhelmed in the amount of triggering information I got a few days ago. I am not okay. I think I have been stuck in an emotional flashback to a time when I was 7 and I was abused horrifically the entire night. I just found out my sisters are all going through the same thing and my heart just keeps pounding and pounding.

I went to the doctor and he didn't seem to take me seriously. Gave me all of 60 seconds to explain my symptoms. Gave me hydroxyzine, 25mg tablets. They aren't helping.

Meditation has helped a little but I have work and cannot meditate for most of the day.

Does anyone else know of a medicine that helped or how they can get themselves out of the emotional flashback?"
Does anyone find physical intimacy expressed through text to be extremely uncomfortable?,13,mlfkxf,3,"I'm dating someone I love and we're starting to build a life together. 
At the moment we aren't living in the same place so we rely heavily on texting to stay in touch. 

They love words of affirmation. They like compliments and hearing what and when I'm thinking about them. I'm mistrustful of words and I look primarily to action to see the truth of a situation. 

I have noticed that every time that our texts turn in any way physically intimate / sexual in nature, I feel ill. 

I find it so cringey and upsetting. I freeze up. I can't reciprocate. I get immediately suspicious and just want it to be over. I get this urge to crawl out of my skin and leave my body entirely. 

I've told them about it and they've stopped bringing it up, and/if they bring up something mild then they don't expect me to reciprocate at all. 

I really appreciate all this, but I don't know what to do and how to/ if to get past this. I don't know if I should just accept this about myself or if I should actively be working to retrain my brain. 

Does anyone else relate?"
I am tired. I am scared. I am angry. But I will never hate. I wish I could. It would be easier that hope.,5,mlniyf,5,"Some explanation: I am diagnosed with CPSTD, depression, and anxiety. I wrote this to help me articulate my feelings. To help people understand that they are not the only ones who are feeling this way. To release these feelings, to help me process and understand them more. I’m trying to convince myself that I’m not doing this for attention, or validation, but I am still and feeling guilty over this. Maybe one day I won’t be.

I thought life was supposed to be enjoyable. It’s not. The only thing keeping me going is the hope that one day it might be. That I won’t feel hatred for myself. That I wont feel guilt for eating food people give me. That my car will have working ac and windshield wipers, and up to date registration. That my shoes won't have holes in them. That I’ll be able to stop sewing patches in my pants. That I’ll be able to sleep at night without waking up not knowing where I am. That I won't have to rely on anyone ever again. I’ll be able to afford my medications. I haven’t bought myself shoes in two years. That I’ll have more than -40 dollars in my bank account. I won’t feel guilt for telling people I’m not okay. I hope that one day I’ll be able to tell people that I’m not okay. The hope that one day I won’t flinch when people try to hug me. That I can look up and know where I am and what year it is at all times. That I won’t feel abandoned. That I won’t feel crushing guilt for every kind word someone tells me. That I won’t feel like an imposter in my own life. That I won’t feel like I have to be happy around everyone. That people realize that my normal personality isn’t joyful. That my joy is a mask to make everyone else feel comfortable around me. 

I used to believe that if you worked hard, that if you made all the sacrifices, you would be happy. But I’m afraid that I can never be happy. 

Yet through all of this, I don’t really feel hateful. I feel tired. I feel suicidal. I feel guilt towards myself and disappointment at others. I’m angry at God. Because of the sense of justice he gave me. I’m angry that he lets people do terrible things in his name. I’m angry at Christians for not being loving. I don’t understand. How can people hate? I’ve had trials and tribulations that have broken me. I hate my life, but I will never hate people. It would be easier if I could. It would be easier if I didn’t care. I could walk away from it all. But I love. I feel too deeply. I’m angry at God because of that. Why did he have to do this to me. Why did he have to make me feel this much. I don’t want to. I want it to end. 

I want to make others feel love. I never want others to feel the way I do. I guess that’s how come I don’t share. Because its easier to keep it inside. I guess its kind of selfish. I don’t want to deal with the pity. I don’t want to deal with the sympathetic pats on the shoulder. I don’t want to explain myself to people. I don’t want to defend my feelings. I’m comfortable here in misery. It’s all I know now. Life isn’t enjoyable, but I hope that one day it may be."
Forming habits is so difficult.,11,mlg4zh,5,"My Therapist and friends are recommending all the time that i should form positive habits, especially taking care of my flat and taking more care of my personal well-being, but all this does, is making me feel left drained and not very positive at all. It's exhausting just to think about it."
I'm losing friends.,6,mlkhak,4,I've never had many friends. Just one or two friends who I am losing because of my fight with my trauma and insecurity. I used to trust them enough to confide my problems (not all). They've become judgemental and easily irritable. I do not talk to them everyday but whenever I do they make me feel like a burden. It's come to a point where we have stopped talking. I feel absolutely alone with no one to turn to.
I'm so tired of being tired,5,mlldo4,2,"I've been in trauma-specific therapy for almost two months now, and I know it's vital that I get treatment. I avoided my trauma for years using alcohol, and I've been more or less sober for about four months. I knew that trauma therapy would be hard, but I had no idea how hard. Some days I just want to give up because the world seems so much darker, so colorless. My therapist and my boyfriend both tell me how much work I'm doing, and that I'm doing great, and that I'll get through this, it just takes time. I get that. But I'm so tired all the time now. I quit my part time job because I was having constant panic attacks and suicidal thoughts, and some days I just can't find the motivation to do much more than get out of bed. I feel worse than I can remember feeling. It just sucks that even though I'm doing everything I can, or maybe because I am, I still feel like shit all the time, and I still want to die every day. I know I'm moving forward, but it feels like I'm going backwards. I feel like I'm swimming with all my might against a much stronger current, and I'm doing good if I can stay in place."
I think I have CPTSD,3,mln32g,4,"I have ADHD and an onslaught of physical health issues. I also grew up in a very abusive home. 

I get into these anxious feedback loops when something triggers me but I always thought it was my ADHD brain causing this to happen. I dissociate but I thought that was ADHD too because of how inattentive I can be.

Yesterday my landlord spoke to me extremely aggressively. It reminded me of how my father used to scream at me. I cried for hours and I dissociated for the entire day. I barely felt connected to reality at all. It has never been that bad but what I realize is the few episodes that came close to being that bad have always been instances where someones behavior reminded me of my father. Every time.

I brought up CPTSD to my therapist this morning and she said that it seems very probable to her and she’s thought so for some time now. 

Tbh it makes a lot of sense as about 4 years ago I started zoning out and losing chunks of time. My perception of time was way off. My previously sharp memory got so foggy I could barely remember the names of people I’d met multiple times or knew back in high school. I thought it was my ADHD so I went back on meds, but I didn’t see much of an improvement. Now I think I might know why. 

This is ruining my life. I think I’m going to have a productive day, I get triggered, and it’s all over. I spend the day in bed. I can’t go on like this anymore. Has anyone here found treatment that helps? Was it hard getting diagnosed?"
Fearing psychosis,6,mllahs,2,"For a long time I've had an ever present fear that I'm going crazy. That I'm losing it and I'm going through psychotic episodes. But at the same time I don't think I am. I just think I'm really afraid. 
Is this common?"
Why do people dislike us?,158,ml0pmc,15,"TL;DR:
Half of the reasons for you getting rejected often is that you aren’t, you are just extremely sensitive to anything that could ever be perceived as rejection. The other half consists of us being shy and avoiding people, looking unapproachable, focusing too much on ourselves and being awkward because of it, as well as being overly friendly and needy. 

My CPTSD has been affecting my behaviour ever since I can remember myself, however it has only started severely affecting my socialisation since I was 12. There’s a lot of stuff I did to turn people away from me. I was very insecure, I lied, I expected the worst from everybody, suspected my peers would ridicule me and saw ridicule in any interaction I had with anyone. I was clingy with people I wanted to befriend. Made jokes all the time and just wanted to be close to people so desperately, but I never managed to. I criticised everyone i knew, I got mean. I didn’t check up on people that used to be my friends. I was very emotional when it came to negativity. I stopped wanting to listen to people, I only ever wanted for people to listen to me. I let people be mean to me because I believed I deserved it. I lost my sense of self. I never felt wanted. And it was all so painful because I couldn’t handle rejection either. 

I stopped talking to people for a few years and only started slowly coming back into the social life this year. My social anxiety was crippling at first. Only things I could do was shakily answer basic questions about myself and smile all the time. If I ever was at a social gathering or if I ever was hanging out with someone, that means I was invited there, because I never initiated anything, so I always felt wanted, even though I never connected with anyone. Now that I’ve gotten more confident in myself, I started talking more, initiating conversations and get togethers. The price I pay for this however is getting triggered many times a day. I fear humiliation, I fear criticism, I fear being left out, I fear being weird, or boring, or worst of all - needy.

I experience a lot of rejection and even more perceived rejection that I don’t know how to handle yet. I feel pain mentally and physically when that happens. People usually don’t gravitate towards me and sometimes it feels like I am just a broken, needy, stupid person with an ugly soul. But I think it’s probably 50% in my head, and people actually like me or are neutral; 15% they feel that I appear mean and unapproachable through my body language, my facial expression and my closed off nature when I first speak to someone, 15% they are turned off with me being overly friendly (which is exhausting for myself, although I can’t just easily stop) and needy as we start communicating; 10% is me being insecure and awkward and not knowing how to develop a friendship and the other 10% is them rejecting me for the same reason they would reject any other person (they don’t like my interests/my politics/my values/my humour, any reason really). 

It really fucks with my head sometimes when I have just met somebody and they already are talking to everyone else in the group and ignoring me, but I really think that the reason for that is I’m either imagining it and being jealous because of a trigger, or it’s one of the reasons from the other 50% of my breakdown, although it’s usually both. 

It’s really hard for us to socialise, because we raised ourselves while everyone else had parents. No one taught us how to be around normal people. It’s okay to need more time and mindfulness to get good at talking to people. However, we all also have the inner child that hasn’t grown up yet, because it didn’t get it’s needs met. The child inside desperately needs attention and affection, more attention and affection than most people need, so it becomes very sensitive when someone ignores us, talks to our friend instead, when two of our friends are just talking, but are not talking to us, when no one has asked us about our opinion or our day, or worst of all when some of our friends hang out without us. 

So in conclusion, half of the reasons for you getting rejected often is that you aren’t, you are just extremely sensitive to anything that could ever be perceived as rejection. The other half consists of us being shy and avoiding people, looking unapproachable, focusing too much on ourselves and being awkward because of it, as well as being overly friendly and needy. (Yeah that’s the tldr, L if you read it twice)"
What makes me so untreatable???,9,mlg2jy,7,"I spent a whole day with a psychologist and all that we were able to conclude was I have dependent personality disorder and adhd.

I did a long questionnaire (maybe 250 questions?) and the results inconclusive...apparently my entire world and inner view can literally change by the time I’m asked the same question (worded differently) a little later on.

So on the plus side I don’t have an issue changing my thoughts or beliefs based on new information. Downside I have 0 attachment to my own views...

I am so tired of surviving and having to literally teach myself in order to actually make progress...
Thankfully my psychiatrist diagnosed me with CPTSD so I read some clinical books.

I see a therapist once a week (3 months now). This therapist has over a decade of experience, is trauma specialized. And told me “I don’t know how to treat you.” (Not the first time I heard this.)
I am glad she was honest and is working hard to help me make progress.

I do not have an inner critic. Like at all. I literally push myself to be better and pull myself up instead of down.

I am fully aware of all my major traumas. I can talk in great detail about them. 


I think the problem is I still live with the people who abused me (parents) and when I leave (realistically 3-5 years) I will be in a much better place mentally. 

Also I have saved their actual lives multiple times. And took care of my dad for over a decade by myself. I raised myself, took care of them since I was a child, and they kept me financially dependent on them to keep me from leaving. 


Just want to say shit fucking sucks...But it is what it is. I’m doing my best and that’s all I can ask for. Little by little I am on the road to becoming a better version of myself"
"“Tapping the Healer Within: Using Thought-Field Therapy to Instantly Conquer Your Fears, Anxieties, and Emotional Distress” by Roger J. Callahan Phd",3,mlomvb,1,"The techniques I have learned from this book have been extremely helpful with emotional flashbacks/panic attacks that put me in a fight or flight panic state (or freak state.) It will bring me down to a grounded, calm state after several rounds when nothing else is working. I highly suggest it!"
Obsessed with Revenge,6,mljb6n,3,"What's the link between C-PTSD and obsession with revenge? I have this A LOT and don't understand it.

* I am watching the documentary from Louis Theroux on the follow-up from Tiger King (that went out last night in the UK)
* I believe Joe is a victim of complex trauma but would love to know the link between trauma and obsession with revenge as he's the perfect example."
How do abusers realize who has been abused in the past? Do they have a natural radar for such things or do victims give them selves away by their body language and (naive?) behavior?,29,ml8kan,10,"I just want to learn how to mask my self and stop being a prey for abusers, it is like they can see through me. I don't know if it is my low self esteem, or my quietness that they assume is low self esteem but abusers are usually dumb people that are used to agression, conflicts and loud places and if you don't scream or act like them they for whatever reason start getting agressive and taking out their shit on you, making you physically sick from their mental,psychological,emotional abuse and gaslighting. They are not fucking safe and you live in constant anxiety, never feeling safe for you life because any new potential friend could be your new abuser so you are left like a living corpse, barely living day to day just waiting for the days to pass, living in misery and just wanting to die because no matter how much you hide it is like you have been cursed, it is like you have been marked by other abusers and you don't know why they choose always you and not someone else, the more abuse you experience, the more self hatred, people hatred, self isolation you do. Even though self isolation is not healthy, getting out there, meeting new people hurts extremely more"
DAE find themselves re-enacting their trauma through video games?,5,mlid4f,4,
My birthday is tomorrow. I wish I could just skip it.,2,mlpuor,1,"Tomorrow is my birthday, and it is just bringing up a whole bunch of things that I'd rather not think about or feel. My parents want to video call with me for dinner, but I don't want to spend that time with them. I also know that if I don't video call with them tomorrow, their feelings will be hurt. It just feels like they are performing the ""good parent"" role, aka ""good parents spend time with their kids on their birthdays."" And to be honest, it is so much emotional work to talk with my mom for extended periods of time that it seems like a terrible way to spend my birthday. 

I just keep going back to being a little kid and having to make decisions for my birthday that I didn't want to make (Where do you want to go to dinner? What specific present do you want? Where can I buy the specific present? Send me the Amazon link. What kind of cake do you want?). I always felt SO MUCH anxiety about picking a place for dinner that everyone would like or choosing a present that my parents would actually buy for me instead of telling me ""oh, you don't really want THAT."" 

My dream birthday would be for someone to plan a fun day/ dinner for me and not make me make any decisions, but my birthdays have always had to revolve around me making ALL the decisions for the day because that is easiest for them. They never cared about what I actually wanted (to have someone thoughtfully plan something they think I might like and take the burden of planning off of me), and have always just done the minimum to show everyone else that they're doing what parents are supposed to do. If they really knew me, they'd know that the way they ""celebrate"" my birthday doesn't actually make me feel thought of or cared about, and feeling thought of and cared about are the only things I really want for my birthday. 

I feel sad and lonely, and I'm grieving for the little kid who just wanted to feel seen and loved."
Short term memory loss/confusion episode after triggering experience?,2,mlpsuf,2,"Ugh This is a bit long....sorry!  I could use some hot takes and support/advice on this.  *deep breath because this is hard to admit*

Last week I had a triggering gyno exam to investigate a problem I am having and found out I need some follow up procedures that are particularly problematic for me due to some past traumas.  I was upset but doing ok I thought.... I worked, did normal stuff for a week.  Then yesterday afternoon I had a period of about 6 hours at home where my husband says I was making sense when I talked, but was lost/confused, kept asking the same questions over and over, and appeared to have no short term memory.  I apparently acted like a person with a bad concussion or dementia.  I cannot remember any of it today - the whole thing just completely blank even when he describes our conversations and stuff we did it rings no bells at all.  Also things that happened the day before that I do remember fine feel like they happened a week ago, like time dilated or something.  

Pretty sure this episode was psychological in origin based on prior experiences.  The other time I had this sort of severe reaction (plus severe depressive symptoms not currently on my menu) I was hospitalized in a mental ward and the docs agreed it was definitely psychological that time.  That was 5 or 6 years ago.  This episode was a little different but similar enough to convince me it is my mind not my body doing this.  If it happens again I have agreed to see a medical doctor to make sure, since as a middle aged lady I know some things can get wacky with thyroid, hormones, etc.  Doctors are one of my triggers so I really hate to go down that road unless it is super urgent.

I do have a history of dissociation, time loss, and cognitive impairment when super triggered, but consider myself recovered for a few years now (25 years of therapy/meds before that recovery and I thought it was solid) and this episode took me completely by surprise.  I am physically a little shaky/panicky today but my mind is working though I am still kinda weirdly distracted.   I am having some crying jags today that start and stop abruptly, but have been able to talk with my spouse about the underlying traumas so I think I am getting through it without too much walling off....dunno.  

I called in sick to work out of caution (I have a somewhat tricky/hazardous job and cannot forget/lose focus at it) but feel like I can probably go back in a day or two assuming I stay on track.  I am going to try to journal/cry it out for awhile each day to try to discharge the emotion.  I graduated from therapy and meds last year and was hoping to still do some EMDR for some landmines like this that I know still hide in my mind, but unfortunately every therapist I checked is booked solid because everyone is struggling these days due to *gestures at everything going on in the world this year*.

Anyway, looking for some advice, reassurance, or commiseration from any others who may have this sort of experience in their journey.  I feel like I am losing my mind....again.

Unfortunately I still need to have this super triggering gyn test and biopsy procedure and am unsure how to handle it.  I told them I have a couple of flavors of PTSD and needed a little time to prepare myself before scheduling it but I really can’t put it off much longer.  Advice on navigating this in particular is welcome."
My parents have given me the gift of eternal loneliness,12,mlc5fp,8,"As I was waking up today I felt a pain in my chest, and it occurred to me, I’ve always felt this pain. My entire life. As a child, as a teenager, as an adult. On top of the deprivation and neglect, I had this realization that I’ve been grieving the metaphorical death of my parents for the past 5 years and it isn’t fair.

5 years ago they bought tombstones for themselves and in the past 5 years they’ve only called me and never visited me. Every time we talk, the topic of their death comes up. It’s always talking about their deaths and regrets and they refuse to just live. They refuse to believe things can change. It forced me to want to rush milestones in my life so that they could experience it. I tried to rush getting married and having a kid but then realized deep down, I’m doing it because I feel responsible for their choices and I’m still trying to create this happy life and family that we’ve never had.

It all feels like a messed up joke. They ruined my childhood which was filled with neglect and abuse. And I still want to please them and now it’s just death plaguing every single interaction. And it makes me so angry. Even as an adult, they can’t even spare my emotions and want to make me feel bad. Bad that it was my fault that as a child, I didn’t talk to them often enough. Always reminding me about death around the corner. 

They never gave me any meaning or plan for life. My purpose, as they’ve beat into me, was to take care of them when they’re older. So they deprived me of all experiences they believe would not make me successful. I was locked in the house for a decade and every summer, I’d sit at home alone while I knew my friends were outside having fun. I’d be screamed at for doing poorly in school and when I would ask them if they could get me to a doctor because I think something is wrong with my head because I’m struggling academically, they’d scream at me that if there’s something wrong with my head that I should just drop out of school. An impossible double bind because they expected me to finish school and take care of them. 

Now I’m an adult and they realize that their neglect and abuse has caused me to not care about them. I don’t even care about myself either. And I don’t have the luxury of death being right around the corner. If I live til 100, I get to live with this for the next 75 years. It feels like one big and cruel joke."

[Trigger Warning] Domestic violence survivor 8 years later...still hiding and living in fear,3,mlmlet,1,"Hi there. I was in an abusive (physical, mental, sexual) relationship for 7 years. From age 15-22 years old. My abuser (ex bf) physically isolated me from the world. I was imprisoned in my bedroom for many years and was told he would kill me if I left the house. When I finally decided to leave him, he stalked me every day and threatened my life 100x per day for almost a year after.  I am now 30 years old. I have worked hard to get my driver's license, put myself through college, and now I am in grad school after a lot of trial-and-error, dropping, enrolling, depression, etc.

People are often so proud of me when they hear my story and what I am doing now. However, I still live in fear every day of my life. Although I have moved to a new city to create distance between myself and my abuser, I still stay up at night wondering if he has found me or if I will wake up to him in my home, or in a parking lot, etc. Because of this, I have always stayed anonymous online. I don't even write my name on packages I order. I just use my initials or a fake name. I have one social media account and I don't even use my real name on it (it's private, as well). I also ask family to not post photos of me.

My current problem is that I am getting close to graduating with my Master's degree and entering the professional world. With that comes LinkedIn pages and other online portfolios. Also, the profession I am going into requires that I have my name, photo, degrees, etc. on a webpage. I am afraid of making waves and refusing to do it if I land a job.  This would mean that my abuse could easily google my name and find the location I work at.

I've considered changing my name but I am so attached to my name and it would break my family's heart. Plus, in my education, degrees, and internships- I am known by my real name. If I get hired at my internship, I feel like they would be confused by a name change.

Friends and family get annoyed with me when I bring this up and tell me to stop being so egocentric and that my abuser had moved on and so should I. They don't understand that I am always in survival mode and it won't go away.

Any advice on this topic would be so helpful. Or anyone that has been in a similar situation?"
on bad unproductive days,2,mlp7nf,1,What's something we should tell ourselves on the days where we accomplish mostly nothing? Today I was filled with anxiety. Spent most of the day in bed on my phone/watching TV. My brain just goes over all the negatives. Everything feels so heavy and I get so tired of fighting this battle....usually all I can do is remind myself every day won't feel like this. What about you guys?
The only time i feel alive and like myself is when i am high on weed. (obvious triggers inside),4,mlmb80,1,"Preface: I am male, i am in my 40s, am drunk, i am angry and frustrated. Continue reading at your own peril. But thank you if you do!   
Trigger warning for sexual things.  

The title pretty much says it all.  
I do not really feel by body, i do not really feel emotions. I do not ""feel"" most of my body parts.  
I do not notice when i need to pee or need to poo in a reasonable time.  

When i feel like i need to pee, my bladder is about to burst.  
When i gotta poo, it is either, be on the toilet in 30 minutes or you shit your pants.  

I have a active sexual desire but i can not stand being touched. I do not enjoy being touched.  
But i still have this intense longing for some human connection.  
Most of my time among humans is spend calculating ""what would someone normal do"" and come up with a appropriate response.  
There are parts of my body that are not ""there"" for 95% of the days i spend awake.

The only time i feel connected to other humans is when i am high on weed.   

I spend 3 months as out patient and after that, a full 12 months living full time in a psychiatric facility.   
That means i slept maybe 5 days out of 365 of a year *not* in the loony bin.  
For 360 days i slept, ate, worked and lived in that place.  
Because i wanted to get myself together.  

But it did not help. They did not listen. After i talked about this, once, they just labeled me as a ""self medicating addict"" and just stopped caring beyond that.  
And this is not something my head made up, i got it in print, 30 pages worth of discharge papers saying just that. Despite me only talking about drugs like 2 or 3 times.  

I know why i distrust people, plenty of them have abused of tortured me.  
But this is beyond that, they ruined the connection between me and my body.  
When i am alone, in the dark, at home, in my bedroom, under the covers... i still do not feel good, safe and fulfilled.  

For the past year i could not even spend 60 bucks (i do not have) for a hooker just to get a hug and some comfort.  
Because corona has shut down every last brothel in my entire country.  

I am 40 and the only thing i want from live is to just once, just once, wake up next to someone who does not want to get away as soon as they open their eyes...  

I CANT EVEN GET A HUG I PAYED FOR! FOR FUCKS SAKE!  

FUCK YOU ALL WHO THINK CORONA IS NOT ALL THAT BAD!  

And fuck you with a rusty rake to everyone who is married or in a relationship who told me ""we all got it bad"".  
NO ASSHOLE! You do not. I talked 20 words to another human being in the last week.  
All talking to the person at the register when buying groceries."
Have absolutely no memories of the traumatic events,4,mlka1s,2,"When I was a kid I had no memory of my childhood before the age of 5 but I was riddled with anxiety and nightmares of events I had no idea about. I had no recollection of what happened in those early years and nobody in my life would tell me until earlier this year when I finally reconnected with my half sister who proceeded to recount all of those events, and having the blanks filled in finally was both enlightening and terrifying. It’s scary that such a important moment of my life just got erased like that. Did anyone else have this happen to them?"
So It Seems Going Out in Public Gives Me Immense Anxiety,2,mlp3h0,5,"I wrote a post a few days ago, and it briefly mentioned me going for a walk in the park. I’ve been trying to go on some exercises to get myself moving.

I went for a walk today and I came back home feeling horrible. I was exhausted. My mind has been foggy since. I feel so awful. As I was walking I felt like I was going to die. I still feel like this.

I’ve always been anxious going out in public. But it’s gotten much more difficult to manage the past few months.

I know I’m not the only person who struggles with this. I’ve read about other people feeling similar things, just different scenarios.

But… fuck man. I never realized my anxiety has been this bad. I don’t have anyone to talk to about this either. I don’t see my therapist until next Monday. We’re doing EMDR, but my visits with him are so spaced out that waiting becomes agonizing. I’m thinking of finding another therapist on an online service like BetterHelp. Someone to supplement my other therapist. I get so tired of waiting. And I need a professional I can keep in touch with.

If anyone has any advice, I’m willing to listen. For now I’m just spending the rest of my day in bed or taking it easy. I’m so tired."
Feelings after a traumatic event,2,mlojzg,5,"TW: CSA, FT, EA
Sorry, this is going to be a bit of a long read

So a bit of backstory about what brought me here. A little while back I had a pretty bad nervous breakdown in response to CT scan that told me I had mild brain atrophy for age. I had a follow up MRI that disproved it but the damage was done and I had convinced myself in that time period I had dementia. Now I still struggle with that thought, and every day I’m scared because I’ve been struggling with memory issues and some word retrieval stuff that was sudden onset after this traumatic event. Everyone keeps telling me I’m healthy physically but mentally I’m pretty unwell. In the past I was diagnosed with ADHD, MDD, and GAD but here recently my therapist and I have been talking about my extremely traumatic past. Here begins the TW: Essentially I was molested for a good portion of my childhood from about 3-11, parents divorced at 9, I was then forced to act normal around my abuser after the abuse was discovered and my family effectively covered it up for several years, my parents remarried, then divorced again two years later following my mother’s infidelity to my father, she then forced me to lie to the rest of my family about that which put further strain on everything, i then moved in with my mother and stepfather making things really bad, mom got pregnant and lost my only brother and then six months later I lost my grandmother, a year later I had to report my sexual abuse because I went to counseling at 17 which caused a huge case and family problems galore, all of my friends turned against me over the course of a summer then proceeded to drive me out of the college I was in during this time I lost my great grandmother, fast forward a couple years later my stepfather who ironically cheats on my mother decided to leave and make me have to care for my mother and little sister for a time before he came back. My life gets constantly uprooted and turned upside down. He told me to look into CPTSD and turns out I have a lot more in common here than I thought I did. I honestly wish I didn’t feel like I had dementia as being 22 it’s extremely unlikely but fear has really taken ahold of me."
I'm done.,4,mljmaq,1,"Called it quits today with someone who works with me to try and find, well, work. I live alone and am only able to afford this because of receiving some type of disability. Started drinking again so that the bad thoughts stop since meds never help and just make me gain weight when I'm already huge and disgusting and I can hardly afford them. Not looking forward to therapy tomorrow.

I'm avoiding certain people so that I don't have to answer any more of their questions, as I never know how to respond, their questions frustrate me, and because I just give up for now. Maybe forever. I'm not open to talking to anyone about this in depth because no one understands, or it's not their problem. I feel guilty trying to talk to them when they're busy/already stressed with their own problems. Most of all, ultimately, I feel like no one actually cares about me that much. That could very well be false, but it's just how I feel, especially when I get like this, and no one's here.

Then again, I pretend to be okay, and like I said, I avoid talking about it. However, it's hard to open up when you feel this way. And any comfort received will feel superficial. I'll also feel pathetic since I feel like they're pitying me and that makes me even less open to talking about this to anyone."
Thoughts on learning a musical instrument as a way to help rewire your brain?,3,mlljlq,5,"I don't know much about this topic at all, so I'm on a lil bit of a limb here. 

I've had CPTSD since I was a toddler (31 now) and have tried many forms of therapy, including neurofeedback and EMDR, to help my situation. Haven't made much progress with any of them. About a year and a half ago I tried a session of Accelerated Resolution Therapy that basically short-circuited me and escalated my situation into a full-blown panic disorder in which I felt panicked at everything my body did and was constantly convinced that I was actively dying. So I guess that session stirred something up. 

Since then I've gotten my B12 and D deficiencies tended to -- which helped significantly! Take your supplements, people! -- and started exercising and sleeping with a weighted blanket. I keep wanting to try meditating but having to stay still for anything is a major trigger for me. 

I keep hearing about how specifically learning music helps with neuroplasticity and adaptability, and in theory it makes sense. I was just wondering if anyone here had experience with that. If I take up an instrument it'll be a bit of a financial investment and I want it to be worthwhile."

The only time I've felt that life is even worth living is when I've been in a relationship.,2,mlnwo6,1,"I seriously cannot understand how anyone can be happy single.  When I'm in a relationship, I take so much better care of myself and I just feel more alive in general.

Advice for Dealing with NIght Terrors and Sleep Anxiety TW: incest mention,12,mlb0ts,11,"I’m looking for advice dealing with sleep avoidance due to severe night terrors, panic attacks during sleep, and nightly sleep paralysis. I practice good sleep hygiene...and am able to maintain a good sleep schedule for a week or two at a time, but when I sleep at night the night terrors get worse and escalate until my anxiety about sleeping doesn’t let me sleep while it’s still dark out.

Any advice on:

Dealing with night terrors (I’ve been on prazosin and it did nothing, I’m on meds that help mitigate physical symptoms of anxiety and panic, but they have failed to reduce symptoms in my sleep) I have them whenever I sleep and I keep all my senses in them. Any tips that help reduce how often they occur would be amazing. Any tips on decreasing the number of dreams I have about rape or assaults...I’ve had the night terrors for basically my entire life...and have gotten used to a lot of the content...but reliving...what my parents did...it’s a lot...just figuring out how to shift them...from the most traumatic of content would be hugely beneficial. (please no recommendations on lucid dreaming...I tried for several years...and it’s not something I can do.) 

Dealing with the aftermath of night terrors (the wake up part and calming down...I’m really stuck on how to do this at night especially...I wake up screaming or crying and shaking...and I...really just don’t want to go back to sleep because they start up again...whenever I sleep. Tips for calming down and feeling safe would be amazing.

Dealing with sleep anxiety (calming down before bed, putting paranoia to rest, dealing with anxiety brought on by it being night, things beyond the general advice (journal, to-do-list, mindfulness) especially.

Any tips, or descriptions of what’s worked for you would be really useful. I’ve done a lot of research and tried a lot of things but nothing I’ve done has really improved things.

Thanks in advance!"
DAE get homicidal thoughts and fantasies?,6,mlfup1,4,Yes I am seeing a therapist and no I’m not going to act on these thoughts. But sometimes I daydream and fantasise on getting revenge or killing people that are abusing others for their own personal gain. I’m finding it really hard to get these thoughts out of my head but I know I’m too empathetic to actually hurt someone.
My wonderful marriage of bullying and physical abuse,6,mlgzy8,1,"I’m 41. When I was 12, one of my frequent bullies hit me square in the forehead with a rock. I passed out and had a few stitches in my head. There is still residual tissue under my skin from the initial swelling. 

I was thinking about this incident, and I remembered that for quite awhile afterwards, the whole world would shake and I’d loose my balance.  I know realize this was the result of a concussion. 

The long-lasting effects of a concussion?  Irritability, concentration and memory problems, and depression. 

So combine those with the anxiety that comes from my job, and it sets me up for all kinds of fun. After periods of prolonged stress, the part of my brain that can regulate my irritability starts to get overwhelmed and it fails. 

I’m in a period like this right now. I’m trying to do work but I wind up in full shut down mode almost weekly.  My manager is supportive, but all I want to do is quit so I can curl up in a ball and not move."
Need someone to relate to,19,ml87df,5,"Hey guys 18F here, I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 12 which got corrected to CPTSD at 17. My life has been really rocky. I was born to my crack addict mother, she locked me in a room for days and wouldnt feed me until I stopped crying, she had a gang ready to molly toff the house me and my nana were as a kid (decided against it last minute), at the age of around 4 got taken off me because of crack, abuse and apparantly she tried to drown me. My dad never wanted me,  I loved him and I always tried to live with him but he just simply didnt want me. He wasnt really there but enough to tease me about being in his care. I mostly grew up with my grandma which was good, she spoiled me. Just she was very depressed and her husband (my granddad) and son (my uncle who was really like my brother) both committed suicide and I'd come home from school and she would tell me she tried to drown herself in the lake today. It was all too much. I was quite bullied in school.  By the way I tried to do EDMR therapy and it was working but sadly I couldnt see my psychologist anymore. I'm in a good point in my life now though. I am really happy and finally in a healthy relationship.

But anyways, my point in this other than the vent is that I hate that I cant relate to anyone that I know. I wish I atleast new someone who didnt grow up with their parents, not that I want anyone to go through what I went through but just so I can feel less like a sad story and more like a conversation with someone who has gone through similar things."
Am I a monster for not being affected by my traumatic childhood?,5,mlgobq,5,"I'm perfectly aware of what happened to me and I remember every detail. I've never repressed it, I've never been hypersexual, I've never had any symptoms that other people had after similar experiences. It's almost as if I didn't find my past traumatizing. I don't feel anything when I think about it, I don't hate the person who did it to me. I don't feel scared or angry or hopeless or disgusted with myself. I'm wondering whether it makes me sick or it's just a part of the process."
And it continues!,2,mln3pn,6,"First time poster here, long time lurker.

Both parents are awful and I am completely NC with my mom. Several years ago she found out my phone number and I can't remember how. Ultimately I blocked her from calling. The fun part is about my cell phone provider is that when you block a number, it doesn't ring but my phone notifies me that the blocked number had called. She is also allowed to leave voicemails that I can listen to. That is pretty much not helpful at all and triggers me every time she calls. At least it doesn't ring so I don't feel compelled to answer and get into a fight. 

Well she has now decided to enlist her friends to call and harass me now! Got a lovely text that said ""What a horrible young woman you are to do such things to your mother. You will regret it. Your Mother is one of the nicest and generous people I know. You should get to know her. You must not take after her. Good luck. I wont contact you again."" 

The last time this individual texted me I said no more texts would be tolerated and they would be considered harassment and therefore I would be filing charges. I called the police department of where my mother lives (i moved out of state) amd they told me that I needed to contact my local jurisdiction. Well I don't wanna do that because then when they call my mom to tell her to stop they will have to announce which department they are calling from. Then she will know what city I live in and that can't happen. 

She abused me, and abandoned (and probably abused) my two older half brothers. She ended up stalking one of them so I am afraid she will find where I live and show up unannounced. 

Dunno what the point is here but I'm just upset that I am 31 and she refuses to leave me alone."
Pretend you were someone else?,5,mlg9xn,1,"This was mostly when I was younger. I remember imagining the lives of my peers. A healthy family, good friends, etc. I would pretend I was living through them and I basically assumed their lives were perfect. Was I just that weird of a kid or was this a coping mechanism for anyone else?"
You ever go totally off the deep end?,1,mlraex,1,"I'm talking things like psychosis. I had the whole C-PTSD package, extremely depressed since my earliest memories, constant suicidal ideation/depression with chronic health problems and isolation, but that all paled in comparison to what happened a few years ago, which I suppose was the climax after all those years of buildup. I have no specific memories of that year, only the thoughts that passed through my mind and so I call it ""Hell year"" or just ""that year,"" I was diagnosed with major depression with psychotic features which helps me remember that it actually happened.

My self-loathing and critic were so intense that I wouldn't allow myself the smallest luxuries and I was consciously dedicated to self-destruction and degradation. I'd physically harm myself as punishment for doing things like moving my eyes around. If I looked around a room, I'd get angry at myself for having the nerve to try and gather information about my environment. I would refuse to turn on lights for a similar reason and I'd often lock myself in a pitch-black room for hours on end and remain motionless. I once typed up 10 pages about the functions of hands and why I should be deprived of the privilege to move my hands, or how I didn't have the privilege to walk and decide where I was located in the world. I would try to analyze the structure of every emotion I felt and logically reason out why I should be incapable of experiencing that emotion since having emotions requires having relationships to entities or objects and since I can't have those relationships, I can't have emotions. It wasn't as easy to eliminate thoughts since thoughts appear randomly, so I tried to induce health problems to slow down the rate at which thoughts would appear in my brain.

There are a hundred more weird things I did but those are the first ones that come to my mind. I don't know what I'm looking for by sharing this humiliating information, I've just never talked about it before and I can't talk about it to anyone in person. I know it's not relatable for most. I've been crippled ever since that year, even though all those habits are gone I never managed to get a life going. Have any of you gone through something like this and scrounged together a life afterward?"
Anyone do the Predictive Index?,5,mlg44u,2,"I applied for a job and it went well so the recruiter had me take this test called the [Predictive Index](https://www.predictiveindex.com/blog/how-does-the-predictive-index-test-work/) and it consisted of two sections.

"Can I use an old picture as an ""anchor""?",6,mldyl9,5,"Hello everyone. I recently came across the concept of using certain objects as an ""anchor"" to the present, a reminder to stay in the here and now. I don't have many interesting or meaningful objects where I currently live, so I was thinking of printing an old picture of me and a close friend of mine and keep that as an anchor. It has a soothing effect on me as it reminds me of a person who means a lot to me. But I was wondering, since the picture is 10+ years old, does this defy the concept of staying in the present? Should I opt for more ""neutral"" objects, but from the present time, or it really doesn't matter as long as I have a physical object to focus on?

So I might be traumatized again,2,mllmpk,6,"TW: Abuse and child trafficking mention, car accident 

So I already was traumatized over my parents and the multiple abusive relationships I was in and being child trafficked for a bit, and then about a week or  so ago I watched my dog get hit by a car. It’s been kinda affecting me a lot, when I hear car horns or tires screeching or beeping I get freaked out and I’m so worried about it happening again. But it also feels ridiculous, my parents have said it so many times. He’s not injured at all and we’re so blessed and all, which we are. I just kinda can’t get over it. He luckily just bounced off then ran away loudly whining instead of going under.. So I feel kinda over dramatic to be affected this way
(Lyric)"
I guess I’m in recovery?,4,mlgnd9,1,"I still get dysregulated.  But for three or four weeks I have felt good. I have encountered a few major triggers and haven’t frozen or dissociated. Been in some minor and major arguments and haven’t frozen and have been able to think and find my words.

Of course I do get triggered and can have a morning into the evening disrupted. But I’m able to function and think and feel. There is not much escalation beyond my body clenching up. I don’t rabbit hole into shame or fear. I’m not devolving into a depression nest or feeling like I’m going to die.

The loud neighbors don’t bother me as much. And I don’t think I’m dissociated. 

I’ll have to see if this continues into the holidays as that’s when I seem to get the most wired.
Heck my mom doesn’t invite me to holidays anymore  and I’m not triggered by it. (She likes to try to punish me for not wanting to be around my abuser). Maybe a little sad but it’s so much better that having to fight about my feelings.

I learned about cptsd around this time last year. And have had two therapists since. I’ve almost come to terms with my ex best friend. The social trauma of that has calmed and it still bugs me but it’s better. I’m planning to get rid of the last thing of hers some time this summer. Through fire! Ritualistic burning of my journal depicting her stuff and my own trauma reactions. 

I’ve come to terms with my first ex and his stuff. And I have a better understanding of my abuse and the home life before that. I maintain my boundaries for the sake of my inner child. She will never be put in harms way again.

I can call for my job. Sometimes I may have to breath and recover after but I can do it. I can just hang up on people. Telemarketers and rude insurance reps. Boom no longer letting them rule my life because I have to be polite and not hurt their feelings.

Still have dark intrusive thoughts but that’s usually a flash back and my grounding methods are helping.

I’m not healed and it’s still early, but these all mark recovery to me! Only time will tell. I think I’m just writing this to say Thankyou to the community! Reading your stories and just the general support helped me get here. I’ll probably move my activity more to CPTSDnextsteps as I don’t think I’m helping much here anymore.

I hope everyone can continue their healing journey, and I’m just putting good energy out there for y’all. You deserve to be human! You deserve to live a life in the way you need, and to love freely!"
"How do most people here manage their work? Emotionally, nerves being open with colleagues?",6,mlcjne,1,"Hello,

I don't think I'm really asking anything in particular. Just wondering what other people's experiences are. 

I started EMDR at the end of February and I worry I've been underperforming at work. Does anyone else worry they're not doing a good job? I feel like I'm always making small mistakes or misunderstanding things, not being fast enough. I work 2 PT jobs but I often feel too guilty to count all my hours in one because I think I could have done the work faster. So if I do a 7 hour day, I count just five hours for example. 

In one job, my work is all online and remote, in fact my conversations with my new boss are all email. They're very understanding and never put me down for any mistakes but I can't help but feel I'm more of a burden than asset because of my questions and mistakes. 

I'm also just really very tired and have trouble focusing sometimes. I haven't told my email-only new boss because I don't want it to sound like I'm making an excuse. And it's also the only relationship I have right now where my recent healing journey is a total secret. I'm  torn between  wanting to share and wanting to pretend I'm 100% okay. Meanwhile with my other job, my boss/mentor knows what's going on but they want me to be 'okay'... It come from good intensions but there's definitely a pressure to be okay and happy. It's come to this point where I'm muting the call because a word I've read in the report we're reviewing me has triggered me and I'm crying."
"Dissociation & holding off panicked tears during MRI, and being on my back...",1,mlq0rw,5,"
I had to have an MRI, and found between the *loud* sounds it made and being stuck on my back caused me to alternate between internal panic holding back tears (biting my tongue) and dissociating. I kept catching myself and ‘bringing myself back’ so I wouldn’t move or start sobbing during it and prolong the experience. Being “stuck” on my back is a major trigger for me; completely helpless feeling with disgust that washes over me. I wasn’t so much bothered with claustrophobia as others usually are in those as I was with my position; I had to stay in there like that for 40 minutes. 




I guess I’m just venting sadness and a stressful day. I hope I don’t ever have to have one of those again; along with an angiogram some years ago when I had to stay still on my back for *3 hours* (I did cry on and off then). *Miserable!*"
I'm starting to resent therapy?,1,mlptzq,3,"A little background: I was diagnosed with CPTSD in the last year, but (like everyone else) it's been constantly present since I was a kid. I tried to go to therapy at my undergrad but there was a shortage of therapists in my city so it was impossible to get an appointment. In the last year I've seen three therapists, one of which was the perfect match for me but since it was through my grad school CAPS program it was only short-term. I was recently moved to a long-term therapist, but I'm starting to resent therapy generally.

For some reason, I don't respond well to CBT. It's not that I don't do the work associated with it or I'm actively resisting my therapist and the treatment. It's more like I've done the work on my own for a long time, but the symptoms of CPTSD are still there. With my previous therapist we focused on what we both thought would be helpful and integrated different forms of therapy together. It was especially great because I would be able to research things on my own in between sessions and bring what I thought was interesting to my therapist. I told my current therapist about it and she said that would be a good idea, but I brought her ""The CPTSD Workbook"" because it's helpful to me and she basically said ""that isn't empirically tested so it's invalid"" and I spoke about ""The Body Keeps the Score"" and she said ""the author didn't actually do any research of his own so I don't recommend that book at all."" 

Since I'm a grad student in a pretty analytic-heavy program, I understand what she was saying. It's easy to be a guardian of your subject and gate-keep in that fashion without realizing it. I don't think she meant any harm by it and she didn't say it in such blunt terms, but you get the idea. 

In my last session she gave me a book to read called ""When Panic Attacks"" and I'm more than halfway through it. I use the daily mood logs to challenge negative thoughts whenever they come up, but these are (thankfully) few and far between because I've made a lot of progress in terms of anxiety. Still, I don't really like the book at all and find myself having to force myself to read it through before my next session. It feels a lot like blaming people with anxiety for their thought patterns without considering the causes of the problem in the first place, especially when it comes to trauma. Obviously the book is effective and has helped a lot of people so I don't want to discount that because parts of it have been helpful to me too! 

I also resent the fact that my therapist keeps saying ""when you get off substances you'll be better"" or ""everyone I've treated that has gotten off of substance has been better off."" I smoke weed at night using a pen because it's helpful to me. I have terrible insomnia, chronic pain, and it is nearly impossible for me to release the tension in my body. I only take one or two puffs before bed - not enough to get high - and it addresses all of the above. I stopped for two weeks and I couldn't sleep because the pain was too much, even with gabapentin and advil. I only started up recently because my lack of sleep is affecting my everyday life and emotional wellbeing. And even though my therapist says there's no judgement and that weed is preferable to medication, I just feel like I'm inadequate for having to rely on something to just be ""off"" enough to sleep. I also feel like I won't get better if I don't stop, even though it's not a ""problem"" per se. Even here I'm explaining myself away and that in itself is frustrating for me. 

I also get frustrated because why can everyone else walk around with their toxic af behaviors and not have to put in such hard work every single day? It's exhausting to heal and become better and sometimes I just want to give up. I feel like I constantly have to be on my best behavior and monitor myself every second, because if I'm not doing that I'm not getting better. So yeah, I'm starting to resent therapy."
So how much social interaction do humans actually need?,1,mlpsm1,1,"I would say I'm an introvert. I have friends but I spend a majority of my time alone. Part of this is a coping mechanism. ""If no one is close to me I can't be hurt."" Type of thing and also the fact I'm an introvert and I gain energy from being alone. I'm also no contact with my whole biological family so  I don't have really many social connections. I do have a therapist and other professionals who help me.

I'm trying to work on it though, reach out to my friends more and spend more time with them. But I notice that after I spend just a few hours with them I need a week to recharge, even when they're my only actual social interaction I've had in a while. So how much social interaction do humans actually need?"
Not sure what I’m experiencing anxiety/panic attack/ something else?,2,mlkxsd,1,"After going out and reading about anxiety and panic attacks, I’m more confused about what I am experiencing.  

To paint the picture what happened - an appointment got changed from a 1300 to 1130. I didn’t mentally register the change, and neither did my calendars. When I missed the appointment I was having full blown fight or flight adrenaline surges. I think it’s a combination trigger flashback, as much of my trauma from childhood was from not picking up on instructions due to an LD. 

Any help/suggestions on identifying this? 

Closest thing I found was I over in  r/cptsdfight - but that isn’t exactly this."
I have to see my parents at my grandma's funeral tomorrow. How do I keep my sanity?,2,mlkxgu,2,"They don't know about my diagnosis, and I have no interest in telling them about it. I don't want to see them, let alone give them hugs pretend everything is ok. But if I don't, they'll get pissed and demand to know why I'm acting distant. They'll also be mad when I tell them I don't want to get dinner after the funeral.

When they see me acting normal around my brother and distant around them, they'll wonder if I've been talking to my siblings in secret. (I have. They're are all leaving the Mormon church, and my parents think I'm ""leading them astray"", which is ridiculous. My siblings reached out to me after their faith crises for support.)

So it’s not “trust issues” if it’s a perfectly functioning mechanism that has served me and protected me time and time again.

The REAL issue is my abuser, and other abusers.  I cannot be the one with the issue if, statistically, someone is being sexually assaulted every 5 minutes.  

And yet it is my work performance that is being affected, my bank account that receives the medical bills, my friends who have to carry my anger, my children who have to bear the intergenerational trauma, my capacity being tested to support other survivors, ... And the people who are part of the problem continue to oppress and keep it that way.  They continue to convince me that it must have been my fault.

I've stopped talking to friends about my problems because I feel like my problems are so much worse than theirs and they never have an easy answer so all I get is pity. I struggle listening to other people's problems because they seem so incredibly simple to me. I am never rude or will belittle their issues, but I struggle to relate when someone says ''I'm so angry at my dad, he keeps making broccoli for dinner even though he knows I hate it'' because I've had to make my own meals for myself and my siblings for years because my narc mom didn't care. 

I feel like everyone else's issues have a clear solution whilst mine are just the effect of 20 years of abuse and cannot be ''fixed'' only slightly dealtt with through years of therapy. I cannot share how I haven't been happy in more than 10 years and I cry almost every day with someone who's biggest problem is ''getting nervous about exams''. 

I want to be supportive and I want to be able to share my problems with friends but I just know they won't be able to help so what's the point? I don't want pity.

I feel like an awful person but I can't help feeling this way constantly, like I know there are people in the world who have it worse than me but I feel like everyone around me has easier problems than me and I cannot share anything.

Am I a horrible person? Am I exaggerating and making things about me? (This is something I was told a lot by my abusive parents growing up)

Guidance needed,2,mliyht,1,"I recently got out of a very difficult relationship after 10 years being together. My ex boyfriend had been cheating, emotionally and physically, for more than half of the relationship. And as you can imagine, the relationship itself was full of Gaslighting, manipulation, lying, etc. In addition to the cheating. 

Since I got to know about the years of cheating. I've not reacted in the way I expected to. There's been very little crying, feelings of hurt etc. It almost feels like I'm watching from afar as this trauma unfolds in someone else's life. 

That being said, I'm also unable to come to terms with the end of the relationship. It almost feels wrong and that I'm clinging onto some lost sense of hope of us being together. I'm not sure what this feeling is. 

Can you pls help me unpack these feelings? I've been doing some research and I'm not sure if this qualifies as a trauma bond/PTSD/anything else."
Repairing ties with family?,1,mlnkoz,2,"I was wondering if anyone else here whose family has been affecting by things has been able to restore a good bond with them?

Would family therapy be worth looking at?

Also, can anyone relate?"
I am not crazy. I am not overly emotional. You're deluded. Long Post - Sorry,4,mlcx9l,1,"As some background, my dad has been sick my entire life, he has a disease that just grows cancer pretty non-stop. I have a weird relationship (if you can call it that) with my dad because of this. When he was home he would often backup my moms abuse, doing things like coming into my room after she beat me and telling me to go apologize to her because I made her feel bad. He was also physically abusive in his own right like throwing me into the pool in December (in southern CA but still) when I was only wearing a sleep shirt and then just locking me out of the house for the night. 

A few therapists have commented that, even with the abuse, I put him on a pedestal because of his illness and the fact that I was trained to always expect him to die within soon, and this went on my entire life. Don't get me wrong, he taught me how to ride a bike and one year he left the hospital on October 31st and went straight to the Halloween Carnival at my school. He wasn't always bad but then again, neither was my mom. 

Anyway, I cut contact with my mom on Valentine's Day in 2020 after she lied to me that my dads procedure had gone well and that he would be heading home that day. When I finally found out he had been bleeding internally and went through 2 exploratory surgeries, I lost my shit on her and she tried to blame me for not being a good enough daughter to be informed of my dads medical emergency. I told her I was done and haven't talked to her since outside of a single letter.

In 2018 my dad had his worst bought of hospitalizations and ended up in the ICU for 6 months after a ground-breaking new surgery at a special symposium left part of his intestines' necrotic. He spent close to a year in the hospital and he came out in bad shape, constantly in pain and actually taking the prescribed pain meds that for the past 30+ years he never touched. He's on a feeding tube and gets multiple IVs a day to get his medication and fluids; it isn't a great existence. 

He ended up going out and getting Covid, I'm almost certain purposefully as some sort of assisted suicide but he had no symptoms and they didn't tell me my mom was sick until her oxygen was at 80% (thus the one letter I wrote). Anyway, I've been more distant with my dad than usual over this because it was so negligent. 

Last night out of nowhere I get a text giving me a schedule of upcoming doctor visits and procedures. None of them were routine but I played dumb and asked if they were simply to manage pain. He responded by telling me he's been having a lot of trouble breathing, he's been in more pain than usual, he's been getting transfusions because of bleeding they can't find, and they're pretty sure the cancer is back. He ended it with ""Nothing is ever just easy. Sorry .""

That sent me spiraling, both the information and the blasé way he shared the information. Whenever I react to shit like this my family calls me a crybaby and over emotional because it 'isn't that big of a deal'. Ignoring the fact that he has next to no GI tract left, he is a medical fucking marvel and has been written about in a few medical papers over it so cancer is a bigger fucking deal than last time. 

I didn't feed into it and just said: I'm so sorry, thank you for letting me know. Please keep me up to date. I figured a diplomatic response would be the answer but instead he told me more serious and life threatening medical issues he's facing and followed it up with: Love you kiddo and sleep well. ♥️ Hi to \[my husband\]!

They make me feel crazy. It's a big deal but it's juxtaposed against smiley faces and heart emoji's. I have to keep reminding myself that they aren't normal so I don't spiral further than I already have. I don't want my dad to die but sometimes..."
I am stuck in a vicious and significant cycle of anxiety avoidance,12,ml79vi,3,"Hi everyone, 

I originally began a draft explaining the traumas that happened to me during my childhood in the hopes that someone could help explain why I am currently stuck in a significant anxiety avoidance cycle. However, I decided to not continue with this draft and instead focus on what the current problem is. I felt if I could articulate the problem well enough then there is probably no need for all the details surrounding the traumas that happened to me. I will attempt to do this below.

So, what is currently happening to me? Well, I am stuck in a vicious and significant cycle of anxiety avoidance. What do I mean by anxiety avoidance? Well, anything related to anxiety and the feelings that accompany anxiety I avoid. Although I have known for a long time that I have avoided anxiety, this recent bout of avoidance is much more significant than what has previously occurred. It is affecting every aspect of my life to the point where I need someone with me 24/7. I cannot go to things like appointments or family visits and I cannot drive alone and struggle to let my partner do things on their own. If no one is around I feel terribly anxious and which triggers fears (i.e. health fears) and what I believe are traumas associated with my childhood.  

I'll try to explain this avoidance further. Anything that has the potential to trigger anxiety and stress in me creates a significant level of anxiety/worry/distress in me. It's basically fear of fear, but more so fear of the physical symptoms of fear. It has crept into every corner of my life. For example, if I was able to let my partner go somewhere alone (which would mean I would be alone at home), I might be able to manage aspects of the experience, but other aspects would just trigger anxiety/stress in me such as not hearing from my partner when they got to the destination, or picking up my partner from a location where other people I know will be there (such as extended family). Another more important example includes not being able to talk with a therapist because the experience of talking with one would trigger stress which then triggers anxiety. And this includes online therapy. This significant avoidance has continued since late 2019 non-stop and I have not been able to break through it despite my best attempts at being brave and courageous (on a handful of occasions I have managed to stay home for 6-8 hours by myself while my partner worked). I have basically been isolating at home since then. I guess one would call this a panic disorder without agoraphobia as I can still leave home providing someone is with me.

The reason I find myself in this current situation is due to a major (and one of my first) panic attack that happened to me following a run back in late 2019. Although I managed to get myself to a hospital and be cleared (everything was fine with the diagnosis being a panic attack), the effects of the panic attack have lingered in the form of chronic obsession about my heart health and health in general. It's not a hypochondriac type of obsession where I am constantly checking in on my heart health. Rather, it is situational such as in something triggering my heart rate like anxiety or exercise. What drove me to the hospital was my fast heart rate right after the run which I now know was largely due me panicking about it. The obsession has crippled me because prior to the panic attack I was already significantly sensitised to stress and anxiety feelings. As I previously mentioned, avoiding anxiety has been with me since my childhood because of all the traumatic things I went through. Prior to the panic attack, I was able to tolerate a level of anxiety when I challenged myself (i.e. go to a medical appointment) in known stressful situations. I would use tools I have learnt over the years to do this including the face and acceptance method by Dr. Claire Weekes. But I want to make it clear, even though I was able to do this at times, I was still stuck in anxiety avoidance prior to the panic attack. It's just now that it has become so bad that I can barely do anything. 

In the past few years I have come to an understanding that I have CPTSD and that my Generalised Anxiety Disorder diagnosis many years ago was just a symptom of this. As I mentioned in the opening paragraph, I had originally described the most significant tramuatic events that occurred to me during my childhood, but I omitted this information so that I could rather focus on the main issue. However, there is no doubt that the events that occurred during my childhood are the reason for why I am stuck so badly right now. Therefore, I want to put some dot points outlining the main trauma characteristics of my childhood: 

  
 

* Physical and emotional abandonment during moments of intense anxiety 
* Emotional neglect 
* Spiritual abuse 
* Witnessing physical abuse between parents 

  
 

Avoiding feelings associated with anxiety (including stress) no doubt has it's origins in these characteristics. CPTSD essentially leaves an adult with a dysregulated nervous system and a strong inability to self soothe. However, I have never been able to break through as to why I still struggle with anxiety avoidance. I understand it conceptually, but it feels like there is a roadblock that won't let me go the whole way and pass through to normalisation of anxiety and it's feelings.  

I know most people will say, ""you just have to face the fear!"" Well, I have tried this already since that panic attack and in fact that is what I have been doing for many years, but have never succeeded in breaking through to the other side where anxiety feelings no longer bother me. It's not that I don't want anxiety at all because I know that isn't realistic. Rather, I just want a body that has normal anxiety and not overwhelming and debilitating anxiety that shuts me down completely both mentally and physically. Facing the fear in this current state is extremely difficult because of the obsession that I have developed. Anxiety and stress by default cause an increase in heart rate which at the moment terrifies me. Despite medical reassurance at the hospital on the day of the panic attack, I have doubts now over my heart health and health in general. I wish I could go clear these doubts by seeing a doctor and cardiologist, but unfortunately the current situation won't let me do this. I attempted to do this at the beginning of 2020, but outside of the doctors office froze in fear and went into complete dissociation. I had never felt such terror in my life. That is what the current avoidance is like. It's that bad.  

I then thought well if I cant get to a doctors at the moment, then maybe I can talk with a therapist who can help me get there. Nope. This is just like the doctors. The same thing happens. The feelings of anxiety are just too strong and paralysing. I have tried everything with therapy too even asking over 20 therapists if they were willing to communicate vial email. Email for me seems to not cause too much stress. It's the live situations that trigger me particularly anticipation about upcoming scheduled appointments.  Maybe if I provide an example below of what happens using a hypothetical therapist appointment it may help you all to understand the kind of anxiety I am dealing with. 

Let's say I decided to make an appointment to speak online with a therapist (new). Ringing to make an appointment would induce moderate anxiety in me. This kind of anxiety is enough to make me not call. Let's say I made it past the phone call booking stage, well the next bout of anxiety would come in the form of anticipation about the upcoming  scheduled appointment. This too would be mostly moderate anxiety until the few days before the appointment where it would increase significantly. Let's say the day of the appointment arrived, well on the morning of this I would be experiencing moderate to significant anxiety levels. Let's say I managed to answer the therapists online call, well here is where the most severe and debilitating anxiety would occur. My heart would race like crazy and that would be enough for me to run and leave. I couldn't sit with it because of the current heart health phobia I have. All of my severe anxiety right now is about my heart rate and that is what is stopping me from getting help. 

So what can one possibly do here when they are so trapped by anxiety to the point that they can't even speak to a therapist without getting triggered into severe anxiety? This is ultimately what I am asking you all. If I can't get help for severe anxiety due it triggering severe anxiety, then what I am supposed to do? I know the avoidance isn't helping, but not avoiding is just so overwhelming for me at the moment. I want to reiterate that I have spent many many many days and weeks sitting through many periods of difficult anxiety and its symptoms and sensations including a fast heart rate. So the answer isn't for me to sit with these sensations to desensitise from them. 

I would be truly appreciate if anyone could offer me any advice or suggestions on what I can do here. I am desperate to be able to function somewhat normally (i.e. not need someone with me 24/7). I want to recover from CPTSD but this anxiety avoidance cycle is preventing me from this.

Thank you all for reading. If you weren't able to read all of this I have provided a TLDR below and breadcrumb navigation explaining the situation.

TLDR: I need to get help, but the help I need will trigger severe anxiety which is perpetuated by my heart health obsession. All together it triggers off a multitude of fears which I believe originate from the traumas that occurred during my childhood. Desensitising from the feelings of anxiety by sitting with intense feelings of anxiety has not worked. I have tried this now for over 10 years. I believe it hasn't worked due to unresolved childhood trauma. 

Breadcrumb: Need help -> help triggers severe anxiety (and stress) -> this triggers off many fears particularly the current heart health obsession -> mental focus strongly shifts onto heart rate and physical sensations of anxiety -> panic over fast heart rate -> further avoidance -> stuck -> thoughts about how trapped I am -> need help....."

What have you done that has helped you keep a job?,14,ml6d9i,11,"I feel terrified of working because it triggers me immensely.

You can’t properly heal your trauma while you’re still being actively traumatized.,1242,mkefrj,107,"I had this epiphany today while I was thinking about my trauma.

EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect to get so many responses! Thanks everyone for sharing your own thoughts and experiences. 

Here’s a little backstory of how I came to this conclusion. I’ve been in counseling for three years, I haven’t lived at home with my parents for several years, and I’m married to a loving, supportive husband. And yet, I’m still struggling with my trauma far more than I would like after three years of therapy. I’ve been feeling incredibly discouraged and like there is something wrong with me. And while I have been NC with my narcissistic mother for months, I have a close relationship with my dad and it’s very difficult to navigate since he’s still married to my abusive mother. 

I realized yesterday after talking to a friend that my on-and-off relationship with my mother over the past three years, combined with hearing about her abusive behavior towards my dad from him (I know I need to set firmer boundaries with him about this, I’m working on it) have really stunted my progress in therapy and healing. Even though I’m not physically in that environment anymore, continually hearing about the abuse is triggering and prevents me from feeling completely safe, even though I am living in a safe environment. I need to reevaluate my boundaries and do what I can to further distance myself from this situation so I can actually begin to move on from it. 

My heart goes out to all of you that are still struggling with trauma too. Sometimes it feels like an uphill battle, but no matter how bad things are, there’s always hope. I wish you all the very best!"
Emotional Flashbacks from Boredom,2,mlgs7u,1,"I'm new to accepting I have C-PTSD and identifying/making connections around flashbacks.

Does anyone else ever have emotional flashbacks triggered by boredom?

I have ADHD but I also realize some of my ADHD symptoms are actually trauma symptoms.

However...

 I've noticed sometimes I feel antsy in an annoying sort of way that tends to stem from ADHD. It's irritating to be bored but I can laugh about it.

And other times, like if I don't take a walk on my lunch break (I'm an admin assistant and spend a lot of time at my desk) or do tasks that require getting up throughout the day (like making copies or filing)... by the afternoon I start to get those ""I wish I could die"" type thoughts and dissociated feeling like I do in a flashback. 

I'm wondering if it could be because I associate boredom and having to sit still even though it's not what I need with being trapped?

A decent part of my cptsd comes from religious trauma (and I'm a part of that subreddit too). I spent a lot of time since childhood stuck sitting in services or youth/college groups, forced to be there by either my parents or my own gaslighting of myself, having horrible, scary, and/or toxic  teachings forced down my throat, often by people I have what seems like an unreasonable hatred for today. Teachings that have really messed up my self esteem and relationship with my body, esp being a woman.

I'm not sure if I provided enough (or too many) details. Does anyone else get triggered this way?"
Still feeling like it was my fault.,2,mlgh0d,1,"I had a moment of clarity earlier, while experiencing an emotional flashback. I was feeling that helplessness from when my dad was angry at my mom for a decision she made in parenting. She was letting me off easy on some homework that didn’t matter (an art project), and my dad was pissed and making it into a big deal. Because the whole situation was about *my* art project, I felt like it was my fault that my dad was angry, and I felt so helpless to stop it. That outburst is the only time I ever remember my dad getting physically abusive. Toward the end of the fight, he shoved my mom and then he walked out the door to go for a walk. 

So here I am, almost 20 years later, and sometimes I still get triggered back to those feelings. Even though I can objectively see the scenario and how the only person at fault was my dad (being a total asshole), I still *feel* down deep that it was my fault. 😕"
This is why the “common denominator” theory is so dangerous,68,mkw96a,8,"“The victims of physical violence may also remain victims. Martin Seligman has done extensive studies on what is called ‘learned helplessness.’  In essence, arbitrary, random, and unpredictable beatings create a state of passivity in which the victim no longer feels that there is anything that she can do. A negative belief system is adhered to. The person no longer believes she has a choice. 

A simpler explanation for the bonding to violence is the fact that as one is beaten more and more, one is shamed more and more. The more internalized the shame, the greater the belief in oneself as defective and flawed. The more one believes one is defective and flawed, the more one’s choices are diminished. Internalized shame destroys one’s boundaries. Without boundaries one has no protection.”

Seeing Family Again,2,mlg9rt,1,"I haven't seen my out-of-state family for about a year and a half now because of COVID. We are all finally vaccinated (them before me, I still have a little bit of time) and making plans to see each other. I'm generally looking forward to seeing them because it's been so long but there is deep grief and fear surfacing that I'm about to put my healing to the test and might not be ready. 

My sister, who is the source of much of my childhood pain, has been really pressuring me about when I will visit because she had a baby during the pandemic that I have not met yet. Keep in mind I'm still squaring the fact that someone who made my life hell as a child is now a parent... 

I haven't been giving specific dates yet because I want to make it clear I'm not rushing to see them just because she demands it but now the rest of the family is questioning when I will visit and I just don't feel ready.

I'm doing a good job not committing to anything I'm not ready for right now but the questioning about it wears me down and makes me feel like I'm the problem.

Is anyone else experiencing this? How are you coping? I really wish I could feel secure enough in myself to handle a visit but I feel especially tender now that it is in the close future. I want to protect my healing more than anything."

Since this is our childhood, our learned behaviors the subconscious thing that drives us so much more than we even realize..  can you really change that so that it's only ""just a thing that happened""? So that you're an actual person (sorry that's my beliefs shining through of course we all are people right now) but like.. a normal person? You don't need to pretend your inner self, your core.. is not hurt and feeling alien but.. actually okay?

How do you fill all that? How do you let go of all that? what replaces it? Do you actually feel normal, like one of what I would now call ""them""?(I know that's wrong, I just feel so freaking alien and don't know how to better express it) 
Can you actually let go and become whole?"
Does PTSD make anyone else feel like they embody two different thought patterns?,1,mlknoj,2,"Okay my question might be a little hard to explain, but basically I’m extremely self aware of my ptsd and anytime I have an intrusive thought I immediately recognize it and I sort of split that thought off from myself. In a way I feel like this creates two very different ways of thinking in my mind because there’s my PTSD brain that gives me reminders of my trauma & then there’s what I call my normal brain, which I feel is my regular self. Does this happen to anyone else? PTSD for me really just feels like it’s an intruder trying to get me to feel bad about things I had no control over."
My life before the age of 12 is a complete black hole. I don’t remember a single thing. And the memories I have after that age are scant. I feel like I’m missing a large part of who I am.,154,mkoxpo,17,"In my 30s, was hanging out with friends the other night who were recalling memories of when their parents came home with their younger siblings, or trips they took, etc — memories of them as early as 6 years old or so. But I don’t have those memories. I have almost no memories. From the age of 0 to 12 it feels as if I was in a coma. Pictures I see of myself at that age feel completely foreign, like someone photoshopped me into them. After 12, I have some memories, but they’re few and far between and almost invariably negative ones that involve abuse and trauma.

It makes me feel empty."
Is it okay to stop seeing therapist?,5,ml91tp,4,"I feel like I can't talk to mine, I don't understand the sessions. I leave as I entered.

At this point I have nothing left. Dying is the only thought that brings peace."
Feeling sick in the shower or in bed and PTSD?,3,mlbxtu,3,"I can be having a day not feeling ill - which I often do with panic and anxiety but even on my relatively chill days stepping in the shower or getting into bed or being woken up by my very kind, quiet cat, makes me jump so much I feel like being sick and it’s such a sudden shock. 

Does anyone else have experience with this and can anyone think of why this might be? I know it must have something to do with fight/flight and “vulnerability” but I can’t think of anything more specific."
Resentment is getting the best of me,5,ml8x3n,4,"Does anybody have tips for dealing with resentment and negative emotion? The amount of horrible things that have happened to me due to trauma re-enactment / attracting the wrong people is too much. 
I am seeing a therapist soon but I still feel overwhelmed by anger, shame and fear the majority of the time. 
I feel powerless in my life."
Did anyone else feel happier before they started to address their trauma?,240,mkl1k0,56,"Howdy, friends. 

Did anyone else feel “happier” before they started addressing their trauma? 

I’ve been at this for just about a year now and I am *exhausted.* 

I’m tired, my moods aren’t stable like they used to be, I’ll have weeks where I feel incredible and then it gets ripped away by a flashback, I cry, I dissociate, my inner Critic gets out of hand, I have little energy to exercise which is usually something I love, I have bouts with anxiety and depression, and I question if this is worth it because since digging into this I definitely feel worse. 

For those of you who have made it to the other side, what tipped the scale?  Any words of encouragement?  

I’m not giving up.  I’ve made it too far to repress all of this again.  But, my god, I’m ready for some peace and quiet."
Only evidence i have is how fucked up i am,17,ml2vmw,1,Your honor i am defenseless. Is it a crime to just try to survive? I have no scars or paper trail. Just the fact that my flight or fight instincts have been in overdrive since childhood. What child stashes a secret escape fund and fantasizes fleeing if nothing is wrong? All i have to prove my case is my word. And what value is my word anyways in the eyes of the law?
Started Therapy,20,ml18f8,4,"I have been doing okay on my own. Healing, learning, but I decided to start therapy. Had my first appointment today. That’s a big step for me. So yea. Just wanted to share that"
Remembered Something from Childhood and now I’m worried I’ll become a bad person,11,ml4jm2,8,"When I was younger, I met someone online playing Xbox, who proceeded to groom me over the year that I knew him. I was told to tell him I loved him, that this love was platonic and between friends, but I was told to do it every single time I would leave calls with him. I was also, at times, told to remove parts of my clothing while calling him. Along with this, he would pretend to empathize with me over everything, saying it would be better if I could just stay on call with him indefinitely. Eventually, I got a new console, a PS4, and would never hear from him again. I forgot about all this, perhaps due to some form of repression, until recently.
        Four years from then I am now an 18 year old porn/hentai addict attempting to quit, and I fear that while I have never once searched for, downloaded, distributed, nor indicated an interest in anything illegal, I may have accidentally or unknowingly seen it at times on hentai sites. This fear has led me to continuously think I am at risk of becoming like this groomer, for some irrational reason. I am attracted to adults, to clarify in case anyone is concerned, but I still cannot help but thing this. I don’t want to be a bad person, and I would rather just forget this ever happened to me. I want to succeed in life and follow my passions, but this event, my addiction, and another event in my past have shaped so many habits and thoughts that I don’t know if I am capable of moving on anymore. Apologies if this seems off from the normal content posted here, but I needed to talk about this with someone, and my friends/family are unavailable at the moment."
I can’t do psychiatrists and their nasty pills anymore!,11,ml4efn,18,"I just can’t keep on this ugly roller coaster ride these doctors put me on. Get on a medicine. Side effects suck and Rx doesn’t work or makes symptoms worse. Get off and have a withdrawal. Try new medicine and repeat over and over and over! I have to get off this decade long nightmare! (Neurologist is a god send, he is board certified sleep doctor and by go he gets me to sleep! And isn’t worried about all the controlled crap and addiction stuff, he knows this condition is worth all those pesky little risks)

Anyone find success and healing OUTSIDE mainstream medicine and doctors??"
Addiction,7,ml6vem,4,"Today was a good day. 

I took it one step at a time, I got productive, I listened to some wise words on addiction (a place I’ve lived in for a long time) and felt inspired by others who have realised their traumas as the driving force behind their dependencies. 

Today it felt like there was hope for a better life, and I want to thank each and every one of you who is brave enough to share yourselves and be vulnerable so that we may all understand better. 

I love and am eternally grateful for you all, wonderful strangers. 

Stay strong❤️"
Trauma affects the health of the body in ways I never thought,11,ml3n1t,0,"For awhile now I have been trying to find answers. Why was it that I use to be great at school, and now I instantly cry at the thought of homework? My memory use to be great, and now I barely remember what I did earlier today. I feel so spacey so often, so many hours of my day is wasted on who knows what. I get anxious over watching a movie that I don’t know the ending too. Every day is a constant feeling of dread under my skin, but for no reason whatsoever. 

I am happy that I have supportive people in my life. I have spent so many years in therapy trying to find answers to my life. But what I discovered was that trauma didn’t just affect one part of me, it affected all of me. My anxiety has gotten to the point that it triggers asthma attacks, my allergies / breathing issues have gotten worse too. My body aches everyday, it’s like I’ve been carrying too much weight for too long. Im tired everyday, no matter how much I sleep. I thought my trauma was something that could be buried away, that it wouldn’t affect me after all these years. I had even forgotten a lot of what happened, but my body never forgot. It never did. 

Finally I am starting to listen to my body, to understand. So many times I am mad at myself, why cant I just function like everyone else? But there is a reason. Its crazy how it took me this long to realize how deep it affected me, to think that it exaggerated so many other health issues in my life but I was too blind to see the elephant in the room."
DAE with CPTSD get tired really easily?,125,mkn8wy,17,"Both my brother and I have noticed that we get tired really easily, more than the people around us. I have a formal diagnosis of CPTSD, and he grew up in the same household that I did.

I was wondering if anyone else had noticed them? I'm wondering if it might be a CPTSD thing. It's really annoying to get so tired all the time!"
Emotional flashback from feeling loved?,8,ml4j79,4,"I'm still new to understanding trauma, but I'm realizing that emotional flashbacks (or something else?) might be a regular thing for me and just experienced one last night. What confuses me is that just before it happened I was feeling calm and my boyfriend said ""I love you"", and then all of a sudden this wave of sadness and distress came over me, and it didn't help being completely confused. He was doing everything he could to help, but hearing him say comforting things just made me feel even worse, like I didn't deserve kindness. I didn't have many words going through my head, but the emotions made me feel deep sorrow and unworthiness, so painful I started to just imagine punching myself. It lasted 20 minutes or at least that's what I'm guessing.  


Have any of you experienced being triggered by feeling loved? Also is this an emotional flashback or just something else?"
When will I finally feel like I deserve to be happy?,26,mkxbpa,5,"It's like imposter syndrome meets survivor's guilt. I am healthy, I am happy, I am in love, I am financially stable, and so many other things that have gone wrong in my life are finally going right. 

So why do I feel like it's wasted on me?

It's not a conscious thought, but every time I do something like buy myself a new pair of shoes, I feel horribly guilty, wasteful, and like there are better ways to spend my money--there are people out there really struggling to make ends meet, and here I am, enjoying myself.

It's the strangest feeling when I pass by a homeless person now. I used to stop, get out of my car, and ask if there was anything I could do to help (and even then, there was a lot of the time I couldn't do much anyway). It made my heart hurt. Now I realize that while it is unfortunate, it is not my personal responsibility to take care of each individual person I meet. If I have something to give, I give it, if not, I walk on by, and continue with my day.

It feels selfish to me, but a big part of my CPTSD has always involved fawning, changing a core part of who I was to accomodate anyone else involved wirh me. Especially people in need, even to my own derriment. It fills my brain with static because I know it is the 'healthy' thing to do, to have boundaries, to put one's own health ahead of all others, but it still feels wrong at times, that I should be happy while other people suffer."
My struggles with the glorification of trauma and mental illness,46,mksd62,16,"I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how difficult it is to get people to believe my story when I tell it, and believe that when I use the words ‘trauma’ and ‘abuse’, that I am not exaggerating or using the words to mean something that they’re not. And I find that in situations where I need to seek support, I now have to divulge way more information about my trauma than I am comfortable with in order to get people to take me seriously. And I firmly believe this is because of people who use the words ‘abuse’ and ‘trauma’ to describe situations that aren’t actually abuse or trauma. And it does not have to be trauma for it to be painful! Something can be intensely painful without being traumatic. One isn’t worse than the other, but they are intensely different. People have got to stop describing difficult and uncomfortable experiences as ‘traumatic’, because every time someone calls something difficult they went through a ‘trauma’, it takes a little bit of that word’s meaning away. Because of the glorification of trauma and mental illness perpetuated by hollywood especially, I find that people want to speak for us and our community and try and insert themselves into it when frankly, they have no clue what they’re talking about. If for one second these people who claim to be advocating for trauma survivors while also making our lives harder by misusing the words knew what it was like to live this life, they would stop what they’re doing and let us speak for ourselves. I’m certain of it. We are a resilient bunch, but because we’ve largely been labelled as helpless victims, we aren’t being allowed to speak for ourselves. I’m exhausted because I find myself having to prove that my experiences are real and my stories have validity because of those who use the word ‘trauma’ to describe something hard that they went through. Because of this, now we no longer have the option of saying ‘I have lived through multiple traumatic experiences’ without having to follow it up with more information in order to have the scope of our challenges realised. I don’t need validation from anyone, but I need people to understand what happens when they overuse these words. I’m exhausted."
I need some hope or reassurance.,2,mla6d9,1,"BIG BIG BIG TRIGGER WARNING: SU!CIDE. 



An old acquaintance of mine took their own life. They seemed so happy and had such a big friend group. I never ever could have guessed. 
I am so so shocked & scared.

If it could be him, it could be anybody ever. 
I’m scared if it could happen to someone like him it could happen to me. 
I would never ever want it to get that way, what do I do?"
I feel very tired and worthless today,2,ml9yc6,1,"It was a hectic week last week, with both good and bad moments. 

Today I'm taking a me-day. I dont have anything planned or anything to do. So I can relax... Or can I?

I've been struggling a lot with body image/self image lately. I have this image in my head that i have to look a certain way to be attractive (thanks media) and so I try to work out, eat healthy and lose some weight. But this is hard since my body is still so exhausted and working out makes me feel even more fatigued. I also crave more unhealthy foods whenever I feel so down. 

I've had a long history with eating and exercising struggles and I tend to become overly obsessive with them because they give me a sense of control and make me feel more worthy as a person. But the last year or 2 ive been pushing my body beyond its limits and now often have little aches and pains. A lot of my muscles have been cramped up for that same time so that makes exercising even more difficult because I cant do the motions properly and my breathing is very shallow because of it.

Long story short: I can't work out and eat as healthy as I  think I have to. So here I am. On my bed, exhausted. Beating myself up because today it just aint it. I know resting and gentleness is all I need today and maybe also tomorrow and the day after, but the critical voices in my head keep telling me that I should work out and that I am worthless now. Which makes me even more exhausted. I tried a little exercise but I almost broke down crying so I stopped. 

But I just feel like Im never good enough just the way I am. I am overly critical on the way I look and I cant imagine that anyone would want to date me. Even though other people always tell me the exact opposite and I rationally know I am decent and there is nothing wrong with me. Uhg.

I needed to get this out. Dont know if others can relate. Thanks for reading."
How do I bounce back from socially-devestating nervous breakdown at work,10,ml1jd5,8,"I don't have the capacity to monitor and organize what I'm about to say, so I'm just going to word vomit. And I shut off grammarly, so my spelling and grammar is going to be shit,

A guy at work I'm good friends with. He's a chill dude and shares my sense of humor, and, too be honest, is the only person who will even try to tolerate my dumbass shenangians. Today we caught sight of a pretty girl and he said he never wants a daughter because she'll wear outfits ""like that"" which cause men ""to not be able to control themselves"". He went on to say how he would never do anything like that (and I believe him, as he's a nice dude whom I've never seen, even remotely, make an inappropriate comment about anyone) but that most men cannot control what they do when they see a pretty girl. He went on to say that women have more control and that they should wear clothing to fend off batshit crazy men who need to rape at the sight of a female shoulder. I argued with him fervently, though I appeared just to be slightly ruffled. I proceeded to go to the bathroom and fall apart. I was sexually assaulted, as a child, wearing an oversized t-shirt and sweatpants—and here's the kicker—by a woman. I had a full-on 30-minute breakdown, several trips to the bathroom to have dissociative episodes, and bite the shit out of my hands to keep me from screaming. I've had tons of episodes at work before, but none this bad. Normally I can bounce back, even if I'm crying, and get on normally (save for odd looks). Today though, I lost it. My mother has always been a stickler for socially appropriate rules. She's told me time and time again that I don't have friends because I make my trauma of too much importance or try to talk about deep topics too quickly. She says that I should stick with just having acquaintances, as having friends is too hard for me. Basically, I am to create a shell of myself and present it to people in order to fit in and be even the slightest bit liked. Well, I broke. I told him in an abrupt manner that I had ptsd by saying ""Damn ptsd decided to really show up. This fucking week."" After collecting myself a bit, I straight up told the dude in the calmest manner I could muster about my background, nothing too gruesome, just the truth. He was obviously very uncomfortable, but I tried not to back down. I asked him if he was okay with me giving some pretty harsh feedback, and he permitted. I straight up told him that his narrative was chidish and that he'd have to grow up one day, because if one thinks that sexually assault is anything more than evil people (if I could even call them human) with an insatiable crave for control, then one is mistaken. I am not an anomolous statistic; I'm a real human with a real life. People who don't have experience with a topic may generate opinions about it with broad strokes taught in the home or community, but broad strokes do nothing but erase many. He's a stand-in manager, and though he wasn't managing that night, he let me clock out asap, and offered to finish up some of my work. Though I made him promise not to walk on eggshells around me (and apologized for bawling like the pussy I am) I was too thankful to go home to refuse the offer. He told me he'd try to be considerate now knowing that about me. Will he forever think I'm a weirdo now? I don't know how normal people think about these things. I've never not had this experience under my belt, so I don't know what it's like approaching the topic without any related background. Will he think of that every time he talks to me now? He's really the only person willing to talk to me, but I'm afraid it's gonna be all weird now. Will it only be weird if I make it weird? How do I not feel super uncomfortable talking to him after this. This took me almost a year to tell my therapist and I've known this dude for like 4 months.

I think it'd be best to just go to my next shift rejuvinated and back to my oddly bubbly self, hoping not to highlight the incident too much. I have absolutely no friends, and I really wish I had right now. I wish more than anything that I had someone to listen to this story and sympathize and be okay with the fact that I made the choice to share this part of myself (be it a stupid choice). I did that and there's no point in criticising me for it now that all is done and said. How do I be okay after all that? I'm scared. I really want to hurt myself. 

I flaired it emotional support, but any advice would be amazing at this point. I don't know how not to spiral on this. I know he probably doesn't give a fuck, but it's bothering me so much. I want to die. I don't know if I can go back to my job. I'm freaking out right now."
Would anyone be interested in Cptsd dance classes?,43,mksci9,21,"Hey! I’m a dance teacher (now on a break), and am currently in therapy for cptsd. I have a really good bond with my therapist and I had mentioned to her how I saw a link on here for cptsd yoga, and how i was really excited to see this existed. She told me she’d been thinking about that already and how she had thought I could give cptsd or trauma dance classes later in life, if i wanted to. And I’ve been thinking a lot about that lately. It actually has given me something to look forward to later in life, which is pretty rare for me. I guess I’m just wondering if there are any other (ex)dancers or enthousiasts that would be interested in this?

edit: spelling

edit2: It’s so great to see how many people would be interested in this!! I’d have to do some research and thinking about the format and such, but I think this could be really great. 

I’ve also had a lot of experience teaching pre-teens, and after a lot of reflection on myself I noticed that they’ve learned me a lot about body awareness. 12-14 is usually the ages where a lot of kids get growth spurt and thus lose that ‘comfortableness’ in their bodies. Over the years I developed a lot of exercises for this, coming back into your own body in a safe and very personal way. In these exercises I focus a lot on moving with what you’re  feeling in your body instead of fixed movements, where a lot of perfectionism can come in to play. Feeling what your body needs, can be very triggering, but, for me at least, when I’m dancing it takes away that heavy burden of existing. It feels as if I’m in another world, floating, but at the same time caring for my body and what it wants to do. 

Needless to say, these exercises helped me too and I think they can help a lot others as well."
Help Understanding Flashback States?,6,ml4sry,4,"My girlfriend is prone to reading into my facial expressions or when I'm quiet as me being upset with her. She also gets in a defensive or anxious state if she takes something as criticism or I call her out of the blue.

When she gets in a heightened state, she seems to take a long time to get out of it and we are having some problems. I will try to make things better but it doesnt work and she seems almost annoyed by my reassurances or efforts which I don't understand. This gets me frustrated and feeling a little panicky myself, and I'll ask why she is mad at me or why she's reacting poorly, she'll say shes not and shes fine, and it just gets worse and worse. 

If she's thinking im mad at her and I explain the action or word and reassure im not, you would think there would be relief there but theres not. She will say okay, I will try to move forward and i can just feel in her words, tone and body language that things still seem not good. So i comment on it and it upsets her more.

I'm guessing this is essentially an emotional flashback, and she cant just come down out of it that quick? What feelings are going on there? In that state is she feeling like im a danger still, or is it frustration/shame at herself? How can I help this situation when it happens? And is there anyway to do it with me being the type who needs to fix things right away and feel like we are okay?"
"My inner child spent so many years huddled in a dark corner, terrified and self-loathing. Flickering moments now break that darkness, showing her standing with a proud gleam in her eyes as she screams in an fury overwhelming those who failed her, neglected and abused her.",43,mks3b8,11,"It's hard to describe the feeling that swells in my chest when I see my inner child standing up for herself, knowing she is worth so much more than what had been done to her by those who should have protected her. I'm almost brought to tears at the realization of how *fucking brave* she is. A part of me feels hope that I can heal because it knows that my inner child is *a part* of me and her strength makes me worth living. I have to keep fighting and struggling and *loving myself* for her. She deserves it."
Got diagnosed with CPTSD and with having alters,18,mky771,3,"I’ve had insane dissociation my entire life, but recently have been experiencing more severe symptoms. My treatment team (therapist and psychiatrist) have both told me that I have CPTSD with alternate parts of myself that exist in my brain. It’s like some symptoms of DID but not enough for a full diagnosis. Has anyone else experienced something like this? I’m feeling a lot of denial"
A rant and some questions about parts (if anyone wants to give some insight or support),2,ml8qeh,1,"I recently got my hands on *""Healing the Fragmented Selves of Trauma Survivors: Overcome Internal Self Alienation""* by **Janina Fischer** and so far it's really good! I use it as a modality for self therapy since I don't have access to a therapist as of now.   


I've recently found myself in a situation that I'll try to describe as an example of what I perceive as different parts but I'm not sure of I fully understand the concept of parts and how to interpret and apply them.   


So, about a couple of months ago I was dumped by my then partner of almost 2 years. We had a really good relationship and I definitely saw a future with her but things didn't work out. I've had a bunch of more or less serious relationships in the past and I think my attachment is somewhere in between anxious preoccupied and fearful avoidant.  
   
At first I was devastated, of course, but found myself to get back on my feet pretty quickly. A couple of weeks ago I met this girl who's a friend of friend and I felt like we where checking each other out, since then we've met each other maybe 3 times and talked for a bit, every time with a small group of other friends around (Covid-safe of course!)

This is where I'm starting to have pretty mixed, confusing and ambivalent feelings at the same time and I'm wondering if it's different, fragmentet parts of me that makes me feel so emotionally confused or if this is what a ""normal"" non-traumatized and dissociated person would feel as well. 

  
\- One part of me seems to get into this obsessive kind of mode, where I think about her a lot and finding myself augmenting the situation and my feelings for her even though I barely know her. I would suspect that this could be a child part that's **desperate to attach** to someone in order to not feel lonely and abandoned and to feel cared for and appreciated. This part is a strong one.   


\- One part of me feels kind of depressed and hopeless, like what's the point? I'm just tired of relationships failing and people leaving like nothing ever mattered, and why should I even care about this girl, she's probably not worth it and will end up disappearing any way.   


\- One part of me just feels avoidant, anxious and a bit angry, like I want to avoid her or ever hanging out with her again.   


\- One part of me, which I guess is a grown up part, tells me to let it go and take it easy with myself and my own feelings (and hers). This parts also tells me to not engage in any romantic relationships since I really need to work on myself and stay single and heal. I think this parts also tells me that I'm not ready to be dating and should be responsible and force myself to be by myself.  


\- Another part of me, who I also suspect is a grown up one, is generally positive and sees no wrong in getting to know someone and take things easy and see what happens. This parts also thinks that some company would be nice and that if anything would happen between me and this girl, we'll be able to communicate and take things slow and easy. This part is also curious about the person and wants to get to know her and care about her. I believe this part to also hold some kind of self-compassion and is telling me that there's no wrong in wanting to connect to another human being.   


I haven't got it professionally or medically confirmed that I suffer from C-PTSD or structural dissociation even though it seems kind of likely. This is just my random thoughts about myself.   
Does anyone have any insight or wise words to share in this whole mess?"
Is anyone else very very very into psychological horror?,58,mkon5g,44,"I found that normal ghost or the usual gory horror movies never interested me, stuff like IT or chucky or stuff like that. I get extremely engrossed in any game, music, or other types of media that is designed to fuck with my head, give me a prolonged sense of dread or hide behind facades. 
examples are [The Mind Electric](https://youtu.be/0vfZjdK8Ktw), [Everywhere at the end of time](https://youtu.be/wJWksPWDKOc) ,Doki doki literature club, School Live!, Made in abyss, Watership down, Omori, off the top of my head.

Like, the more it fucks me up mentally and emotionally and the longer it makes me lie in bed thinking about it the better. I also love sharing them with my friends and absolutely love seeing their reactions to how messed up they are. Is this in any way connected to my abuse trauma, maybe trying to seek out something again somehow? or is this completely unrelated"
Confused with diagnosis on paper,1,mlbybl,5,"So I was seeing a therapist every 3 weeks for over a year. I needed a piece of paperwork to try  for disability from her. At the bottom of this paper it said ""ADHD anxiety depression and c-ptsd?"" What does the question mark mean at the end? The adhd and other stuff I knew I had. I wasn't able to stay in therapy long enough after to ask. I can tell I do have some form of ptsd"

Why Is This Always So Hard?,2,ml7y8s,1,"My father and step mum visited yesterday.  I didn't see my father from the age of 4 to 21 ish, partly because my abusive stepfather didn't like it, partly because he was pretty terrible at coming when he was supposed.

We have a reasonably good relationship now, and get along well.  But after a few hours, I was exhausted and overwhelmed.  Why can't I just have a nice time?  I was crying by the end of the visit and had to go to bed after.  

I am so unhappy about being such a mess so much of the time.  I wish they would just understand me without me having to explain the ins and outs of cptsd.  

My step mum is great, but she says ""you can't change the past"".  I know she is trying to help and be kind, but I end up feeling like there is something wrong with me because I can't just let it go....

All this with the lovely additional layer of ""if I'm not perfect no one will ever love me"" that cptsd throws in....."
I'm Done!!!,48,mko5cq,5,"So, for the last about 2 years, I've been in trauma-specific therapy trying to finally work through all of my story and start to understand some things. Finding this community has been a great help as the last few months of the process have come to a close. As of today, I am discharged! I'm happy I'm done with it, but we also took my story and shredded it, deleted the computer copy, etc. and I'm not sure how I feel about it. I'm kind of done with my story but I also went through all the sweat and tears to get that all down with my therapist and now all of its nearly 10 pages is just gone...

Anyway, I'm happy... I'm pretty sure these are happy tears."
Book Recommendation “All about love” “The Road less travelled”,4,ml49x1,5,"The first book
“All about love”
Is about the definition of love. Those of us who did not experience love growing up do not know about the definition of love when we want to self-love. Does love mean criticism, does love mean abuse, does love mean neglect? These are the problems that we encounter. This books gives a precise definition about love and its description resonates with some of my experiences.

——-Note and warning: Religious themes concerning Christianity in the second book.——

“The Road Less Travelled” also teaches about love and teach about discipline under love. For me, discipline means physical punishment, and has nothing to do with love. It’s like, either I’m hardworking and bombarding myself with self-criticism, or I’m completely slacking off and giving myself some love and compassion and acceptance. This book tells you how to have discipline without hating yourself."
How I got over my psychological problems and issues,1,mlaoak,1,"Hello everyone I opened Reddit lately and after a long time and I saw this subreddit that I used to scroll through regularly half a year ago. Lately my life has changed a lot I went through some pretty harsh bullying in school years back with a lot of physical abuse, everyday I would go to school get beat up and back home to play video games and the same loop everyday my parents didn't give a flying fuck, so I was 17 with a lot of problems, anxiety and depression and I read somewhere that difficulties help the mind like excercise the body, I was near suicide at that period so I just told my father I will be back in 5 days as usual he didn't care so I took my motorcycle and went to the nearby town without knowing anyone there I slept in park benches and in apartment building basements I saw many different people and even started talking to girls in the street something I never imagined you could even do and after the 5 days I came back home took a shower and left again doing the same thing just better this time I made friends and a friend group let me stay In an old house we used as a place to hang out and with literally nothing I was happy, really happy and I realised something my personality changed a lot in these days I became psychologically stable and I had either happiness or felt content because I didn't really had or still have any needs expect cigarettes and tobacco, now I'm back home I made my basement my living space and I live here now with 2 chairs 1 table  and 1 bed and I'm content with that I work small jobs father some money that it takes me months to spent because of how cheap I live and I go riding with my motorcycle around Greece the  towns and villages near me now but Im expecting the lockdown to end so I can travel to many places, that is my life story and my advice would be to see the world,get through hardships in life because if you don't face your fears they will find you at home"
Did anyone have a parent who didn’t know how to be an adult capable of having children?,33,mkqgj3,6,"My mum told me that because my dad lived at home for so long he never felt like a grown man. He said he didn’t know what it meant to be a father and husband and as a result my mum was the adult for all of us. 

I grew up wondering why my mum was so careful, sensible, mature and my dad was so clueless, helpless and lost. It was like mum was both the parents. 

As a result I became the helper daughter, the one who tried to fix them. I picked up on all the tension and tried to make them happier. I was always sensing the moods and adjusting accordingly. 

It was like my dad had kids but didn’t know why he has kids or why he was a parent. Just this prevailing sense of doubt and unease. 

The thing about having a parent who was so out of their depth is the lasting effect it has on me. I was mums little helper. I was mums psychologist. I was mums biggest support and filled in the gaps he didn’t. It meant that I didn’t feel close to my dad and only needed my mum. It meant that I was a mini adult when I was 16. 

I have so many memories of my mum being super stressed and upset and dad not knowing what to do, not being much help and mum needing to spell out what she needs because he would be clueless. I remember feeling like the mediator and have to jump into help dad when he was lost in order to calm the situation and make it more bare able for me. 

It’s this lifelong ball and chain of filling in the gaps to make their self esteem, relationship and parenting easier so that I could have some semblance of a happy home. Because if I didn’t step in, I’d be stuck in chaos. 

I wish I could wipe this part of my life and have parents who weren’t constantly struggling to be parents."
"""Have you ever tried therapy?"".",86,mkj6yp,23,"I don't know why but this sentence invalidates and enrages me like none other on Reddit.

I am the victim of sexual abuse, witnessed a murder, and was hit by a car by a hit and run vehicle. I have been in therapy since age 16 (20 years). There were times I had 2 therapists at once. Sometimes I just want to talk about my day and when I see the inevitable ""A therapist may help."" it's like ""wow thanks internet stranger, I never thought of that!!!"".

It's almost borderline insulting."
"Trauma from every single period of my life CW: S*xual abuse and Neglect, Verbal abuse",5,ml20zs,2,"So I just for the sake of needing to get it all out because I tend to not be able to, I just wanna list all i've been through from childhood to adulthood. I'm a gay male with DID btw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*Ages 3-5: I can't remember a lot, from ages 3 and I assume even before I would be neglected, not physically, but emotionally by my mother and my father had abandoned me as a child and would be completely neglected via not being hugged or comforted ever and being forced to ""Cry it out."" I would be sexually abused at either age 4 or 5 by two men whom I still can't remember who had forced themselves on me and hurt me and as a result I would be very frightened and unable to attend pre-school initially because I would cry and scream and hurt myself so much and be so clingy that I couldn't attend my first one and had to be swapped to a new one.

&#x200B;

\*Ages 6-8: At these ages my mother would be sexually assaulting me, forcing me to shower with her in which she would expose herself to me and make me touch her body. At this age as well if not sexual abuse by her I would be forced into emotional incest, being forced to comfort her at the same time as she was assaulting me because she would cry about being a bad mother and I would be forced to play the role of her husband and tell her I loved her, gave her back rubs and hugs. My grandma who has bipolar 1 like me began to stop taking her meds every now and then and became extremely abusive as well verbally and she and my mom would neglect me or constantly insult me every single day. I would begin to start showing more signs of sexual abuse such as bedwetting and other behaviors. As well I would be constantly bullied by students. At this time I had also protected my friends from a robber and hid them as a man stole my brothers items. As well at this time I told my mother I wished to die to go to heaven where it's safe in which she laughed it off and walked away.

&#x200B;

\*Ages 9-10: At this time I would be harassed and bullied by students and then my own teachers as well as my mother and grandma and grandpa who was a drunkard. My mom became boyfriends with a man who would also terrorize me, I was witness to him smashing a chair into his brothers head repeatedly and had to be the adult in the situation and protect him by stepping in front of him and saying ""You wouldn't hurt a child would you?"", then afterwards bandaging his brother myself. I would be witness to his cocaine addiction and him coming home cracked out and scaring me while he was having bad trips. Him threatening to kill me or beat me, and other stuff of that nature. Being around my mother, him and his friend mocking and yelling at me while they were drunk and I was crying, and telling me intimate details of sex life and how they were selling drugs together to addicts. I was repeatedly told that I was a bitch, always complaining and the abuser.

&#x200B;

\*Ages 11-14: I would be forced to move into my grandma's house because of my mom's frivolous spending, in which every single day I would be screamed or tortured by my grandma, grandpa, cousin, aunt, sister, and mom and be forced to pick fights with every one of them and be harassed by them. My memory in general is extremely poor but I remember extremely little of the sexual abuse when I was younger and this period as well. My mom broke up with her boyfriend after moving in as well. During this period I would be routinely mocked in a group by most of my family members as I cried. I was forced to go to therapy because I was a ""problem child"" and in those therapy sessions my mom would talk to the therapist and the therapist and my mom would never allow me to talk during sessions with two therapists, with both therapists the only listened to my mom's needs and wants and never gave any advice other than ""Go do breathing exercises I guess.""

&#x200B;

\*Ages: 15-17: I was living in an apartment with my mom after she moved out, in which she would refuse to sleep and go into psychosis and terrify me and abuse me verbally every day and act even more childlike than she already has throughout life. At 16-17 when I entered high school my mom's ex-boyfriend dumped his ex-girlfriend on us and she lived with us for two years in which she stole from us and I barely had any food to eat, she shouted at me and was also an addict. Was forced to endure my mother's psychosis even more and was not allowed to sleep for two days straight because she would wake me every 30 minutes on the dot. At age 15 I had begun to engage with older men online for sexual gratification and was at 17 groomed and sexually abuse by an older man. Due to my feminine appearance and desire to shave being called the T-slur by my mother and was insulted for my sexuality and tried to be convinced that I was straight.

Advice for first time triggering and meeting with new psychologist,4,ml3ayl,2,"Four years ago I was diagnosed with complex PTSD and major depression, panic disorder and some general unhealthy social behaviors. I put in the work and my life changed so much for the better. 

Much to my surprise, my traumas were recently triggered and now I'm a full blown mess. I don't know how I didn't realize it could all be triggered alas here I am. 

I've luckily gotten en queue to meet with a new psychologist, alas it is starting over from the beginning (I am living in a different city than my old counselor). 

With my past, including interactions with medical professionals, I am very generally skeptical. I'm also not sure what to expect from counseling with a psychologist (before it was just a mental health counselor). 

Any advice on what to expect from my first few sessions? Any red flags or green lights to look for or seek out? 

The traumas are extremely complex and I just don't believe I have much of anything left inside of me at this point... Meaning pretty much a full mental and nervous breakdown, constant panic attacks, it's a miracle I am going to work and keeping that steady though I'm extremely hypervigilant so it's not easy. Anyways it's all to say I don't know what my options are to work thru this with the new psychologist but I don't wanna do a story time where I run thru everything that's horrible and happened to me because I don't have anything left in me to traumatize myself further. Does that make sense? Any advice here on helpful approaches to talk with him about or things to look for?"
I often get tired of self-parenting and just want someone to hold me.,561,mk9c6s,44,"(no advice wanted, just support)

I know that parenting myself and being present with myself is the only way to fight this thing, but goddamnit, sometimes I just want a guy to hold me. 

It's so much emotional labor that normal parents are usually supposed to do for you (because it's their job), and so taking it on is exhausting. 

I still live at home with my family and I cannot feel present with myself when I'm here, so I get very lonely and sometimes just wanna be held like a little kid. I read somewhere that loneliness is not just about not having people in your life, but it's also about not being able to enjoy your own company, so maybe that's why I crave the company of others when I can't physically enjoy my own because of the environment that I'm in.

Maybe it'll get easier when I move out and have more physical/mental space so that I can finally breathe."
How much of their childhood do non-CPTSD people remember?,3,ml46ds,14,I have no idea what a normal amount of amnesia/memory decay is. Like no one remembers everything but where do you draw the line...? How do you draw the line?
my dad died,35,mknybz,6,"he died a couple of weeks ago in his house in the middle of the desert. we had to call the sheriff to do a wellness check. it was too late. im not sure how long his body was there in the house, dead, before they found him.

he was a very complicated person. i loved him very, very much. he had been homeless for a long long time. when my grandma died, she left him enough money to buy that house. it was the only home he ever rly had. he definitely had cptsd, was also diagnosed with a lot of other stuff. he wasnt very responsible or masculine. but he was a wonderful, sweet, sensitive, loving person. i loved him so much. my mom and stepdad are both shit, abusive af. he was my only semi good parent.

i have to go to his house which is several states away this week, to clean it out. im not sure exactly how he died. his health had been bad for a couple months before he passed and he couldnt rly walk. but he didnt trust doctors or hospitals and my sister and i couldnt get him to go to one.

im so scared to clean out the house. im no contact with my mom and stepdad, but they are my sisters main form of emotional support. they have said literally nothing to me. they're dead to me at this point. the coldness/cruelty is rly unparalled at this point. i just want an adult or someone to lean on but no one is ever there.

ive gone thru a lot of death/loss in the last couple years and what i hate the most is i never get to say goodbye. my dad and i only talked on the phone since i was 18 (im now 27) and i didnt talk to him for a month before he died. i never, ever get to say goodbye. people just disappear.

i dont want to clean out his house. i dont want to smell the death smell i know will be in there. i dont want him to be gone. i dont want any of this but there isnt any other way. im so scared. i feel so alone 😭"
I feel like there are different people inside me? Please help?,5,ml03iv,5,"Today, I was in the shower, I looked at my body, and I just dissociated the fuck out. Happens from time to time. My head was in a fog, I felt completely numb. When I felt a little bit more clear, I felt..younger? Like I felt like a child. Later, I had dinner with my parents, and I (?) was acting totally strangely. I physically felt smaller, more tiny, and I pretty much acted like a child. All the while I was thinking *""Who the hell is this?? Why are you so weird???""* Now I think I'm back. A while ago I was getting ready to sleep, and then suddenly I felt very overjoyed, and I felt like my name was Steven, even though that was not my name. I also felt like a different gender.

This is not the first time something like this happened. I remember I was having another dissociation episode a while ago and I heard two people(?) arguing inside my head. Also, when I was being verbally abused, I felt like a totally different person. This other character would come inside my head, and basically try to protect me. They (?) would think **""I have to protect (my name), this is my purpose. I have to make sure that (my name) is safe.""** After the threat was over, I would sorta feel like myself again. All I know that this person is older, and probably female. Not sure though.

Who am I? Am I even myself? What is this? Please somebody help me"
DAE prefer being emotionally dissociated?,6,mkxuxt,4,"For me personally, I don't mean that the emotions are too big for me to handle. I mean that I just prefer to make decisions intellectually. I've been doing it my whole life. I was born doing it. My mother does it. My grandmother does it. My whole extended family does it. We all make decisions intellectually. Emotion-based decision-making, in our family, is...uh...viewed very unfavourably. I don't mean that we dislike people who do it; but there is an underlying assumption that the only reason one would make a decision because of an emotion, is that one is intellectually incapable of doing so because of a *reason.*

Now I'm less emotionally dissociated and I have all these emotions coming up, telling me what to do. And I hate it. It goes against generations of programming. It goes against a quarter century of learning how to make decisions well. My brain no longer matches my gut. It feels horrible and it feels like I've been railroaded!

The angst train has reached its destination, thanks. Can't seem to put the cat back in the bag.

Sorry if I've said anything insensitive in this post. Despite being highly intellectual, I've always been very sensitive to others' feelings. With all these emotions coming up, all my radars, filters, and boundaries are basically fucked. I have no idea what's appropriate or not anymore!"
DAE feel significantly YOUNGER than their age?,47,mkk8om,21,"I’ve seen a lot of people with CPTSD/trauma talk openly about feeling older than their age, but what about the other way? Is that okay too? I feel like an absolute weirdo sometimes. Most days, I feel stuck in my preteen years. When neighbors look in my window, I’m afraid they’ll see my toys and judge me for acting like a child when I’m a whole ass adult. I used to think I was an age-regressor, but the feeling never went away. I never intentionally made myself feel younger, I just always do. 

I clam up when I’m upset, and eventually burst if I’m prodded too much. I distract myself from big feelings by playing video games made for middle-schoolers and watching carefree YouTube. When I’m happy, I skip around and sing and have bounds of energy. And when I’m insecure, I try to stay as close as I can to the people I trust. 

It’s hard to explain, but I generally just feel an air of “younger than 23” constantly. I can’t think of any time I’ve felt like an adult, even while signing legal forms, getting married (and divorced), moving houses, working. Nothing makes me feel my age. And it feels like nobody can relate. I hope I’m not alone."
"""Recognition-filtration""",3,ml2r5t,1,"I have discovered my own adaptation of ""forgiveness"" that is more tailored to my current emotional needs in healing, which feels more validating and empowering in my experience. I call it ""recognition-filtration."" Recognition-filtration helps me recognize things from an unbiased, objective perspective, such that my parents are not well, and act out of trauma projections that I don't recognize them wanting to change; this is information that I can ""recognize"" and then filter out. I am not meaning ""filter-out"" by dissociation, but more so acknowledgment and empowering understanding that I can release in a way (I am wary of saying ""acceptance,"" as I don't necessarily ""accept"" these notions.) Doing this has helped me a lot with the rage/anger I experience, and provides an empowering tone.  It also takes a bit of the emotional power they have historically had over me, out of their hands, which makes me feel even more empowered--though, I will say, I definitely still am experiencing anger. I despise when victims of abuse are pressured to ""forgive"" the circumstances they've endured prematurely or inappropriately. For example, it would be highly inappropriate for me to ""forgive"" the circumstances/relationships I am still entangled in that cause problems for me. Forgiveness implies past tense, not dealing with it anymore, and likely a lot of support, different life circumstances that make reflecting in that way more possible, etc. So, in this process, ""recognition-filtration"" helps. I  hope this makes sense or is helpful to somebody."
Therapists will really take hundreds of £ from you then suddenly decide they're done with you,40,mkkm3x,28,"I have so many people in my life I'd like to recommend therapy to but idk how to do that with a clear conscience when they're running the risk of paying half a grand just to have their therapist quit the zoom call and stop speaking to you the second you express any anger.

Happened to me today. Was talking about a mental block I get when I'm trying to work (therapist looked bored the entire time), I got angry at myself and hit my desk and my therapist yelled at me, quit the meeting, and has basically just fucked off. Over £500 that I can't afford down the fucking drain because these people will take your money to tell you ""You're loved and wanted and people won't abandon you"", just to fucking leave the second they feel like it. (Literally the last session we did was about my abandonment issues.) I know there are good therapists out there, but it's the blood-sucking ghouls like these that turn recovery from incredibly difficult to monumentally fucking challenging. For FUCK'S sake."
CPTSD and cat ESAs,5,mkyae0,14,"Hey friends

My therapist just approved an ESA letter so I can register a cat as a support animal! I'm so excited!

I'm allergic to dogs, so I'm hoping to train a kitten. Does anyone have any experience doing so? I have experience training rescue cats with behavioral issues, and I *know* cats can be trained and supported with their anxieties, but I don't know how to train them to support *me*

I'm hoping to condition her to approach me when I'm having a flashback, dissociation episode, or panic attack, and accompany me outside in some situations (on airplanes and to doctor's appointments.)

Any advice or personal stories would be appreciated!"
needed opinion on possibly having cptsd,5,mkzesp,3,"I have a doubt that i might have cptsd so i want to share a bit of my story just to get your opinions perhaps it will help me ( thank you for taking your time to read it) :

 I understand my parents didn’t grow up in the best environment and they tried to do their best and although i have a good relationship with them now  i can't deny that at times i have bouts of childhood flashbacks and i would start crying  ... they both had anger issues especially dad .i always felt uneasy with him . one moment he was a way and then he suddenly would shift . his anger was terrifying he would throw fits like a child at times . but then suddenly he will act like the most loving parent everything was somehow  always about him . If something affected his mood it had to go . if i was punished for something (beaten) and i would cry somewhere in the house  he would threaten me to  stop crying because it was annoying to him .i remember dad slapping  me at least three times in separate occasions  when I did absolutely nothing wrong but talk to him or be in his way when he was mad . and yes no apology . YOU SHOULDN’T HAVE TALKED TO ME KNOWING I AM MAD he would say . One time i came in really excited about something i wanted to watch on tv but apparently i didn't greet him the way  he prefers , so he yelled at me or hit me (i don't remember well) and i left the room in chock that i suddenly started yelling and screaming  in the bathroom ( my memory is fuzzy about this ) i remember my mom  terrified at me and telling dad that he is causing me to go insane or something ( english is not my native language it's just a translation) and then a scene where my dad is sitting with me in my bedroom explaining to me that he acted that way because i was not greeting him properly and that he was justified and he asked me to never act like that again . i couldn't even look him in the face i remember nodding and saying yes . i remember feeling so much hatred towards him  because of how his horrible side would turn a complete 180 and  demand of us to be close to him and greet him always with affection , it always felt  artificial and forced .  as a kid  i wouldn't ever talk to my parents about my issues at school or anything .They praised me for not wanting or demanding things , in reality ,I just suppressed my desires to avoid conflict and anticipated humiliation  . My brother was not like me . if he wanted something he would just say it he is a lot more assertive than me  . Now as an adult I have an insatiable hunger for safety . emotional safety . I don’t talk to anyone about my feelings . there were rare moments with a couple of people where I confined in them some things but as i get older (im23) i feel more and more distant . sometimes I find myself undermining my own self and acting as though my feelings are silly and not ""a big deal"" .I don’t know how to regulate my negative emotions or sometimes even  recognize what I am feeling .  I never cry in front of anyone . I feel friendless , unable to connect with others  , avoidant , depressed, anxious and like an imposter whatever i go ,  I am so scared of conflict or to disappoint people . I have mood swings and low self esteem . But i show a very confident facade .the only way i was validated was through academic achievements that i don't even feel any pride for but that remains  the thing i continue to do to this day .i used to have panic attacks but now its less common . I still get triggered here and there and i would  just feel fear and i would start crying . I don't know if this can indicate  cptsd or just depression or something else 

. i want to clarify that  i don't do drugs or alcohol but i did have a period where i started to  restrict my eating since it gave a sense of control . i feel nauseous a lot and have trouble sleeping ( i always thought it's just anxiety) .i am going through another depressive episode and honestly  i am really tired of this way of living 

i apologise for this being very long . i hope i get some insights from you so i might get to the source of it all . 

thank you in advance ."
Any fawns here have a hard time recognizing when people are mistreating you?,508,mk7pvq,72,"Like sometimes I’ll be telling a story to someone about an encounter I had with a person or someone will overhear someone speaking to me and they will be like “wow they were really disrespectful/mean/rude/aggressive/hurtful” and ask why I didn’t stick up for myself and I’m like what???? it was??? like maybe cause of my childhood I’m used to certain type of behaviors so things don’t really register as abusive behavior until someone tells me. Fighting back or being mean to people doesn’t even seem like an option a majority of the time, unless it’s like really serious or something and even then, I have a hard time. It makes me super susceptible to being taken advantage of and I end up in abusive relationships a lot because a lot of red flags or warning signs don’t even register to me. 

Like even when people do hurt my feelings I don’t always register it as a red flag because I was always told I was overly sensitive so if I got hurt by someone, I would just suck it up and tell myself I shouldn’t feel that way and eventually the feeling would go away if I ignored it long enough. I don’t get angry really either and I’ve heard anger is an emotion meant as a response to injustice so maybe bc I don’t feel that I don’t recognize injustice in my life. 

I have really horrible anxiety and I think it may be related to this issue. I’m used to taking hits but I never am able to express the pain that I’m supposed to feel from them."
A Success Story: Some Tools That Are Working For Me,8,mkv9n9,3,"A bit of background about me. I was a couch-bound agoraphobic freeze type and now I'm a somewhat functional member of society. I think the most important thing to note is I went from being in a constant state of flashback to now experiencing 1-4 very minor flashbacks per month. 

I am by no means completely cured, but I know have a pretty long streak of feeling happiness and accomplishment (which was something that seemed impossible just two years ago).

I'd like to mention a few Body-Based tools that have helped me with the hopes it might help a few others, but like all cptsd advice, YMMV.

&#x200B;

**1. A Progressive Exercise Routine**

I knew that exercise could lower stress, improve sleep yada yada yada....but when I was stuck, I honestly didn't care about all that. It seemed futile at worst, too difficult at best, and also perhaps deep down I didn't feel like I deserved to be healthy. Let's also not forget how embarrassing and shameful it feels to be so out of shape. 

What helped me get out of this pattern was to make a deal with myself; I would do a 30-minute workout each day. That's it. I didn't have to try hard. I didn't have to sweat. I didn't even necessarily have to finish it. I just had to try it out.

I started the workout P90 at home (not p90x, just p90. The one for older folks and people that have never worked out before) and I used the lightest weights I could find. I half-assed each workout big time. I did it with normal clothes and usually in a dissociated fog. When they asked for 15-pushups I did 6 low-effort pushups on my knees. If they did a movement I didn't want to do, I didn't do it. 

I made a deal with myself that I would try a little harder next time and I made it clear to myself just how unskilled and out of shape I had gotten over the years (not to shame myself but to let myself understand why it was so difficult and to cut myself some slack). 

Over time, the workouts became easier and easier. My movement in daily life became less labored, my sense of self increased slightly, and I felt much more ""in my body"". Most importantly I trusted myself a bit more. Looking different and having more pride in my appearance also was a nice plus.

After about 60 days or so I started going to a local gym and repeated the process over. At first I just sat on a bike there and pedaled for 15 minutes while trying not to run out of the gym. Over time this grew to 90-minute workouts at the gym most days. 

I recommend [beachbodyondemand.com](https://beachbodyondemand.com) to start, but if you don't want to spend money, [https://www.gymra.com/](https://www.gymra.com/) is free and also has a free tv app.

**2. EFT-Tapping**

I always assumed EFT tapping was B.S. but I listened to a trauma psychologist talk about its efficacy for restoring motivation.

I usually start my day out tapping about how I don't want to get out of bed. It allows me to tap into the reasons I don't want to do anything and it gets all my worries and negative thoughts out in front of me so I can see them. I don't know exactly why It works but it definitely increases my motivation and sometimes results in an emotional release. 

These are the resources I use:

[https://www.youtube.com/user/eftwizard](https://www.youtube.com/user/eftwizard)

&#x200B;

**3. Yoga** 

A lot has already been said about yoga and its application for cptsd but I want to anecdotally say that after doing it for a while I feel much more grounded in not just my body but reality itself.  I also want to point out that if you have cptsd or ptsd, moving in silence and doing something for yourself is going to suck at first, but keep in mind the benefits far outweigh these discomforts.

**4. Body Scan Meditation**

It's my opinion that everyone with cptsd should be doing this daily for as long as possible. I try to do 30 minutes per day of Body Scan Meditation. You should expect to feel more in your body and relaxed after this. It's truly one of the best ways to regain your body.

Wanting love desperately but refusing to let anyone close :(,15,mkruzw,6,"Recently, I've fallen back into my old embarrassing habits of looking up a million couple videos on Tiktok and Youtube because I keep thinking about relationships and wanting my very own someone. 

The thing is, even though I swear up and down that I want a relationship and that these videos are making me uber jealous, I refuse to allow people to get close to me. I keep the RBF on at all times. I don't talk to new people. I am withdrawn. I spend all of my time in my room when I am not at work or chatting with my two closest friends.

I cannot mentally or physically handle interacting with others. I bounce between having no emotions and being emotionally volatile. I've spent these past few weeks just floating through life and having breakdowns nearly every day.

I want affection so much but I can't stomach the idea of letting someone that close--physically or mentally. Like I have had only a few instances of sexual harassment throughout my life and they've all been at parties so they don't really affect me like my childhood trauma does; however, I still don't like other people touching me if I don't know them or want to accept their touch. It literally disgusts me.

Whyyyyy am I like this. Wanting love but refusing to let myself have it?? I mean there's also the matter of me not even operating on the same wavelength as everyone else so?? (thought I had autism but the counselor says I just likely have ADHD...might get a second opinion where they're not basing it on archaic understandings of the condition)"
"Crying during yoga, meditation, and tai chi",34,mkl82y,10,"I've noticed that I cry a lot during any kind of breath work, which in my own hobbies and activities includes yoga, meditation, and tai chi. I'm not thinking about anything in particular. It just happens.

I've mentioned my crying to friends who also meditate and do yoga, but they haven't felt this same  urge. The reason I am thinking about this is due to the fact that I'm reading The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel van der Kolk, and am learning about how trauma is stored in the body. 

Could the crying during breathwork be a way to release/relieve trauma? Do others here cry during breathwork? Apologies if this is a silly question - I'm still quite new to the topic."
DAE revert to past versions of themself or similar when triggered?,9,mkuvha,4,"I have emotional flashbacks and sometimes I end up losing my current sense of self. The further back in time I go, the most disconnected from my present I am. I get confused about what year it is, can't believe that it's 2021, and everything around me feels foreign. I refer to myself using the names & pronouns I used at that time in my life. It's a pattern of the same few states of self, too. Each one has their own emotions they experience, ways they respond to whatever's happening, an appearance in my head...

I get triggered via reminders of specific events, but each self-state is... it's own thing. Experiencing isn't exclusive to the memory that triggered me. I begin to navigate the world as that self until I'm no longer triggered. The ones from a few years ago, I can act fairly normal since they're very similar to me now. But the youngest one, from around 5-8 years old, I'm nonverbal when I'm her. And unlike the other ones where I lose awareness of the present, when I'm her,... Present me is still there, and I talk to her and calm her down.

I've been previously diagnosed with OSDD. But that was also related to my psychosis so I thought it was a misdiagnosis. Once I went into remission for psychosis, I thought that was the end of the self-state changes. But I've realized that... it isn't. And I guess now I'm wondering where the line is between an emotional flashback and a fragmented alter. I don't have amnesia during these events, but my memory does get fuzzy and I won't remember all of what happened. I really don't know when this started, honestly. But I've become more aware of it.

I just feel alone and confused. If anyone else has experienced something similar, whether you have alters/fragments or not, it'd be helpful and comforting to hear your experience, if you want to share. And for reference, I don't want to consider myself a system because when I was psychotic I did and it was super detrimental to me."
Are these panic attacks/anxiety attacks?,3,ml1xed,2,I work at a restaurant and sometimes when I get overwhelmed I hide in the bathroom for hours crying until I can go home. I feel so scared and ashamed to come back out and face everyone that’s how I’m able to stay inside for so long. It can be for small things for example there was this one time I was working as a hostess and this huge table came in and the only table that was available to them was the one right in front of me. They were so loud and making all these noises and I got so overwhelmed that I couldn’t do my job properly like when a customer from the table would try to ask me something I could not respond because when I get nervous I start looking around everywhere and I’m not able to concentrate. As the table were leaving one of the guys called me stupid and I didn’t even say anything back to him because I felt like I couldn’t do anything I was so overwhelmed. This was the first time my coworkers ever saw me like this so they did not know there was something wrong with me and I saw one of the guys in the kitchen talking about me and copying the way I was looking around everywhere and making fun of me to everyone. And today a customer’s order got late. He was a regular customer and he was always friendly towards me even when his order was late.  But his food never was this late before so today he was a little upset. He did not even yell at me. He just complained that he had to go back to work and now that his food was late he did not have any time to eat it. But even this caused me to get so upset. And then an hour later the restaurant got a prank call and I just couldn’t handle it so I went to the bathroom for two hours and cried. Again I was so scared to come out because I felt like everyone outside was talking about me and it caused me to stay in the bathroom for hours and hours. Do these count as panic attacks/anxiety attacks?
I had an MRI today and stayed still for over half an hour!!!!,27,mkmgp2,10,"Just wanna start by saying that I don't have medical trauma, but my trauma basically led me to neglect my health badly. This past year I have really tried hard to address my medical problems and look after my body. Today I had to go for an MRI and I was so damn terrified. Being there, trapped and still for half an hour was an unimaginable torture. All I wanted to do was jump up and press the panic button over and over again, but I did my breathing excersizes and got myself through the whole half an hour without freaking out too hard.


I'm so damn proud of myself, its crazy"
Do you ever just suddenly dissociate and fall apart from sensory overload or feeling overwhelmed?,5,mkynj4,2,"There's this thing that's happened to me throughout my life, though it happens less now than when I was younger, that I think is just one of the worst, most unpleasant things I've ever experienced. It's this intense feeling of just... bad unpleasant-ness, where it's like my brain and/or the world are falling apart and I can't ground myself. It doesn't consistently happen, especially not as much as it did when I was a kid. But sometimes it just takes such ridiculously seemingly tiny things.

When I'm in public and suddenly get this feeling, thoughts, and basically certainty that I look stupid or awkward or other people are seeing me negatively... it's like I feel my consciousness flies up away from earth and I detach and suddenly I'm pulled into my mind and my fears, seeing the world from miles away. It's like my mind's out in space, or lost in the ocean about to drown and I can't get grounded in any way.

Or sometimes just on a day when I'm feeling extra sensitive and all my senses are too heightened, and then I hear a siren. It pierces my ears, scrambles my brain and it's like I don't want to dissociate over something so dumb but can't stand the physical discomfort and mental discomfort it causes.

Or if I'm feeling sensitive and generally emotionally in pain, not feeling great about myself, and then someone yells at me. I'm struggling to pay attention to what they're saying and what's going on in front of me, pull up the sinking feeling I have to fight the growing pain and self-hate and keep myself from totally sinking, racing thoughts in my brain the whole time. It's all too much, and I end up leaving feeling terrible over such a small event.

Or during a social situation, where I'm having trouble staying grounded and just freeze up, fighting with my brain and feeling negatively about myself. My mind is racing faster than seems possible, analyzing things and trying to work through my thoughts in ways that don't really make sense, trying to either figure out if I'm wrong and it's just my anxiety/mental illness, or see ""proof"" that things really are terrible and people really do hate me.


It just seems like very little things happen and, in the moment, it feels like they tear my whole world apart. Sometimes it's not as bad, but other times, in just a minute it suddenly feels like nothing is ok and nothing will ever be ok again. I lost sight of anything good and the world looks terrifying or hopeless or whatever. 

I can't tell if it's a sensory overload thing sometimes, or emotional and mental, or what. 

Does anyone else relate?"
How do you sleep alone?,2,ml3z4g,3,"How do you sleep alone when you’re having a full on mental breakdown from being scared/paranoid. I deal with SEVERE sleep paralysis especially when I am sleeping lightly/alone. Having to sleep alone for the first time in 3 years got sprung on me last minute and I’m not prepared for this. I don’t think any amount of time would prepare me for this because I simply can’t handle this. I’ve been having the most insane panic attack tonight realizing the severity of this issue and that I will be awake all night tonight and for the next few nights. I don’t know if I will be able to relax my brain enough to get some rest during the daylight hours or not. These issues are not as bad when the sun is up because my visibility is better. I can’t see in the dark or very far at all without my glasses which makes my fears a lot worse. As a woman I have a lot of anxieties and paranoias as it is but these are made worse with the fact that I’ve dealt with my abusers in life stalking me and putting me in actual danger. Not to mention my intrusive thoughts, hyper vigilance, serious trauma dreams, etc. I talked to my therapist about this which took up a whole session but it was not helpful or effective and nothing that was said made this a palpable situation for me. I’m not sure how to get through this. Especially if this becomes a regular thing. How do I explain to people what this is actually like and that I’m not trying to be crazy/immature but I am feeling really unwell due to this? I will say that if I had a pet right now this would not be so bad. My apartment doesn’t allow pets however an I am broke and waiting on a disability decision. Also, phone calls late at night like this are not an option if that is something anyone would recommend. I have no one to go to at night in this circumstance, I am stuck with myself hanging on every sound and bad possibility which is the worst punishment imaginable."
"Cutting father off, but ex taking grandchildren to him",2,ml3vup,5,"Hi,

As I began to heal and start standing up for myself, my relationship with my father ended (3+ years). Soon after my relationship with my husband ended (2+years ago). 

I have tried to work things out with my father but its been entirely one sided and he's never made any real effort to repair our relationship. Mostly the issue is he prefers to spend time with his new wife's kids, not supporting me at all and cancelling on my kids - but ​I'm just an ungrateful child after all he has done for me. 

My ex and my father never liked eachother, but since the break up, my father has taken this as an opportunity to see my children. I've told both of them I find this unacceptable and have gone as far as to put it in my parenting agreement with my ex. Yet,  my kids came home after spending Easter with their father only to tell me that they had not only seen my father, but had been told not to tell me about it. They were also told I won't let my father see them (I will, and I even ask if he would like to see them). My daughter was distraught after she told me and asked me not to get mad at her Dad and apologised for upsetting me - which makes me so, so much angrier as I am trying to stop these patterns of behaviour. 

I've worked on so many of my emotional triggers but this one I can't get over. My dad and his wife going to spend time with my ex husband, his new girlfriend and my kids. This is somehow preferable to trying to work on some  kind of relationship with me.

I don't know how to move on from here.  It hurts just as much every time it happens."
i dont want it to turn out that they genuinely love me,9,mkucro,8,"because then it means that my own parents love wasnt enough for me. i dont know how to live with myself knowing i got everything i fucking wanted but it wasnt enough. theres just this giant yawning void in my chest all the time and it aches every time they say anything along the lines that they love and care about me. it always feels like manipulation, like theyre trying to convince themselves. as much as not being genuinely loved by a single person on planet earth hurts like a bitch right now, i dont know if ill be able to handle it if my very own parents love just wasnt enough for me.not being loved is simple. its easy. its an obvious hurt. i could tell someone my parents dont love me and they would immediately understand why i am the way i am. if they do love me, what the fuck do i do then? do i get to be this unendingly miserable and scared?"
"Notice lately at work feeling a need to defend my place aka, make it clear what I did or didn't so won't get in scolded or someone else get credit for what I did.... Does this (CPTSD) really take over every aspect any one else's life?",4,mky7t3,1,The title says it all
I haven’t posted in a while. Help. I don’t even know what I’m asking for.,17,mkpdnk,7,"I don’t know.

I’ve been in treatment and it’s so hard. 

Boyfriend has been really bad to me.

Birthday was Saturday. Childhood dog put down on Sunday.

He was mocking me and making a joke out of my pain saying he’s “never enough” in comparison and I can’t do it. I just want to cry forever. I don’t want to exist anymore. I don’t know if. I don’t know."
My best friend drunkenly told my sister possibly the most important secret of my life and I don't even have it in me to be angry.,66,mkgisl,35,"My best friend drunkenly told my sister I am pretty certain it is my dad who sexually abused me as a child. This is something I had been keeping very private because I don't want to accuse anyone until I have done therapy and have given it some serious time. The memories only started appearing in January and I've barely had time to figure out what's going on.

Now my sister is drinking, her bulimia is back full force and she doesn't want to speak to me.

I just feel so sad. This was such an important secret to me but I feel more stupid for trusting anyone with it. I should have kept it to myself. I don't even feel angry, just utterly defeated.

I've lost so much this past couple of months I don't think I can take much more."
Food trauma?,7,mkv7az,4,"Are there any resources (subreddits, books, etc) about food related trauma? There were years when I was a child that I was sent to school with no breakfast, no packed lunch, and no momey to buy lunch. I knew if I complained, I would get yelled at and punished.

As an adult, I can get horrible panic attacks about food. I will have to repeatedly check my fridge and pantry to make sure food is still there."
I can't stand it it when the popular guys do this!!!,4,mkyq0x,3,I'm in High school but almost every day I'm always messed with by most of the popular guys because I'm all ways flinching even at the littlest things but I can't help that because my PTSD(a part of it was growing up getting beat by my siblings) but one day I was in my woodworking class and someone come up and slapped me on the butt with a board and I snapped and starting hitting him with a board and I hated it because last time I snapped like that was when my lil sister came to live with me and my dad and I could not take the abuse drone her anymore and I snapped and told her how I felt I'm sorry this too much ain't if you've got to this point.
The punishment for misery is further misery,28,mkktt3,9,"I'm starting to really despair. I see that I put a lot, literally exhausting effort everyday to not just put my car in the wall and end it all. I want to be loved. I want to feel I have a purpose. I want to find a place I belong. But I just don't find love, I feel meaningless and purposeless almost all the time, and I don't belong at all where I live.  
I'm exhausted of life. Seems my crime, ie not being loved when I grew up by anyone in my close family, is punished by a life sentence of alienation. Maybe love is like money. To be rich, you need to be born rich. To be loved, you need to be born loved? 

Maybe my fate was already sealed the very day I came to existence."
I wish there were resources for people in the same stage as me.,4,mkynw9,3,"Right now things have been really bad for me. My symptoms have been worsening for a while now and the past couple of weeks have been particularly bad.  I've never been hospitalized and am not currently on medication (although I'm seeing a psychiatrist tomorrow), and I've been able to maintain a job (although my work performance has been slipping), so beyond my weekly therapy appointment there's no record that there's anything deeply ""wrong"" with me.

The reality is that I'm barely functioning and keeping it together. Things have gotten so, so bad for me, but there's nothing I can do. I can't afford to work part time and really like my job and would like to keep it, but there's not accommodations I could ask for that would make my job easier for me. I don't qualify for disability. I can't afford to lose my job and don't have the savings to fall back on if something were to happen. All I can do is keep going to therapy, hope medication might work for me, and do the best I can at work. Which sucks. I just wish at least part of my income could be subsidized so I could drop down to working part time and still pay my bills. But there's no resources out there for me and people in similar situations, and I hate that. I need more help than I'm getting right now but the help I need just isn't available."
Does anyone have parents that had drastically different terrible parenting styles?,12,mkr4m2,2,My mom and dad were never really together. I was a type of one night stand kid I think. But I would be shifted back and forth from spending time with my dad while living with my mom. Mom was neglectful and could be a bit of a loose canon when she was (frequently) drunk. She would try to connect with me emotionally though to the best of her ability when she was sober. My dad on the other hand didn't seem to be able to connect with me emotionally and was an incredible helicopter type. So I almost felt like I was being torn apart by their radically different approaches.
I've been having really bad sleeping problems lately -- again,5,mky812,5,"Just want to vent.

I can't sleep again. It's almost 2 am and I have work in the morning... I don't feel sleepy. I do feel tired. 

I took some herb pill half an hour ago, but I doubt it will work magic. I don't like prescription sedatives because they make me feel groggy the next day and often don't even work like they should.

I don't even know why I can't sleep. I feel uneasy, as usual.

When I have been able to sleep lately, I've had nightmares often. Some concerning my past."
"Is it normal to feel triggered when other people are ""too"" friendly w/ other women. TW CSA",3,mkznjy,5,"hello im f(18). this is my first post and i just wanted to know if anyone else felt this way. 

a little bit of back story so others can understand: I was sexually abused as a child by a cousin and was in contact with them well into my mid teenage years. i don't do well with any affection, physical or emotional really which is why i've kept to myself when it comes to romantic situations. 

ok so there's certain things that trigger me and it's with everyone, doesn't matter if we're close or not. Some examples are, getting too close, too touchy, stares, etc. i don't like people looking or talking to me in a way that i can tell they feel attracted to me. but now im realizing that i also don't like seeing it happen to other women. the woman i just saw this happen to didn't look uncomfortable and it really wasn't a bad situation at all. it was a group of older people talking, mingling and all that. very casual but of course you could sense attraction from all the men, towards the woman. anyways so they were all talking and they looked genuinely comfortable but there was a man who kept talking to her, he would casually put his hand on her arm. it wasn't anything bad but i guess just the fact that i could see he was interested in her made me upset and overwhelmed.

i feel bad because i did step in a little (i know the man, he's a good man he is but i just told him not to get so close and this and that) but it genuinely made me feel so bad and it just triggered me so much. i feel really bad right now, i had plans but i just want to go up to hotel room and cry about it all. does anyone else feel this way? because its easy validating myself when it happens to me but i don't know how to feel when other women have people show interest to them. sorry if i make no sense. thank you for reading."
Everything is making me cry today,4,mkxp2i,1,"Just absolutely everything. Some celeb gossip? Waterworks. Wrote an essay? Waterworks. My partner made a (albeit stressful) phonecall? Waterworks. I finally took my rescue meds because everything is making me cry. I hate it. I'm trying desperately to self regulate but I currently don't have a therapist for bullshit reasons and everything is just so hard. I cried yesterday too because my extended family is trying to help us and I don't know why. As far as I can tell they hate me for outing what my m*m did to me so I don't know why now. 

I know its just a bad day. I'm doing everything I'm supposed to. But everything is just so wildly upsetting. I just want to skip the rest of today."
40F suddenly feeling like a chastised 6yo because I didn't do someone's job for her.,2,ml1tea,3,"I absolutely, without a doubt know I am in the right here. It would have been totally irresponsible for me to do the thing she was upset that I didn't do, for reasons I will explain. But I have spent the last 3 hours feeling like I fucked up. And I'm incredibly shaky and panicky over this.

I am currently overnight ""sitting"" for an elderly couple 95M/93F. They are extended family, but not blood relatives. They are my aunts (through marriage) parents. I have known them since my birth, and our families have always been close. I love them dearly. Because of dementia issues, they don't even know who I am anymore.

They are currently living with their son and his wife. They are retired and are now full-time caregivers, and have had this arrangement for the past 18 months, and it's a lot of work. They NEEDED a vacation and wanted to travel across the country to meet their new grandchild.

So they (and my aunt) worked to find an in-home health service to come and handle their daily needs for the week that they're gone. Medications, meals, helping with dressing and bathing, etc. It is ridiculously expensive per hour. However, they are in bed by 7pm every evening and don't typically get up until after 8am. 

So my aunt asked if I would mind sitting overnight in case of emergency. Like, fall out of bed and break a hip emergency. Call 911 if necessary, direct them back to bed if they wander, but I'm not supposed to have any caregivers responsibilities because I am nowhere near qualified to do so. This allows them to cut the bill in half, so I agreed. 

Last night was my first night, and everything went fine. They were in bed with their door shut when I arrived, and I didn't see them. My aunt was here because she'd been here for Easter dinner, and she left after showing me where I should sleep (on the couch near their bedroom door so I can hear if they have an emergency) and chatting for a bit.

This morning, the CNA from the health agency arrived right on time at 7am. We introduced ourselves and I left, saying I would be back at 7pm. She was very pleasant.

When I arrived again this evening, she seemed kind of stand-offish. I asked her how her day went, and she said it was fine, except that 95M had soiled himself when she went in to wake them for their pills, and made a terrible mess. Went into how awful it was to have to clean him up and do the laundry, and he had gotten it on the light switch, and all over the bathroom as well, and she'd had to clean it up too. I kind of commiserated with her because yes, that sounded terrible. I thought she was just venting. 

But then she went into a lecture wanting to make sure I knew where all the supplies were kept (incontinence products, fresh wipes to clean him up, clean absorbent pads for the bed, etc). I tried to interject that I was only supposed to be here in case of emergency, and that I was not a CNA, and I was not to have any contact with them unless there was a medical emergency or they wandered out of the bedroom.

""Well then why are you even here?"" was her response.

I reiterated that I was here to direct them back to bed if they left the room and call 911 if needed. She kind of grumbled and said she didn't see the point in that, and then said someone else was scheduled for tomorrow,  but she ""guessed"" she would see me Wednesday, and left in a dramatic huff.

And now it's after 10pm and I'm feeling super anxious, spending the night in a place that I am not at home in, feeling like I've been judged a failure by a complete stranger for not doing a job that SHE is being paid to do. Like, I agreed to do this sitting thing out of love and am not being paid to spend 5 nights away from my home and family, although knowing my aunt she will probably gift me a generous check at the end of the week. It will still be a lot less than the $50/hour that she's paying to this agency, and yes, I know the CNA is not getting all of that money.

But.like, why do I feel so helpless and lost and like I did something wromg?"
Anyone been in in-patient and was it healing or not?,4,mkzatl,8,"I just did an out-patient Hospitalization program at a well known hospital in my metro area and it was absolutely UNHELPFUL. Not trauma-based, saw The awful psychiatrist for maybe 15 minutes tops a day and just a lot of group therapy that was really not geared to any of my problems. The daily 30 minute therapist was nice though. Is in-patient any better or is it just more drudgery that does not get you any closer to finding peace and healing? My insurance is going to pay for everything so I’m considering it"
DAE get triggered by being physically ill?,11,mkqs66,4,I have a cold and my hyper vigilance has ramped up to 100! My scared inner child thinks I am dying...
Can flashbacks be added to?,3,mkyzzi,3,"From what I understand, the parts of consciousness that hold a flashback don't really develop beyond the scope they were created with.

If this were true then is it possible for a secondary sequential part to me formed that holds later trauma related to the initial trauma?

I ask because I once had a part containing an emotional flashback with the mantra (if you will) of ""I'm going to die alone"". After a second secondary trauma, a second mantra was added to it, ""don't lie to me"". I can't figure out what's going on here. I figure if I can grasp the mechanics of this I would have an easier time resolving it.

Does anyone else have an experience like this? Do you know how this works?

Thanks!"
DAE have suicidal thoughts at one moment and forget about it completely a moment after?,43,mkgwil,7,"An hour ago I sat with my family, everyone was having fun and and my only thought was, that I want to die right now. Now I'm instructing my little sister playing piano, eating some sweets and nearly forgot about my dying wish. It's not that suddenly I found hope or a reason to live, but the feeling of wanting to be dead is gone and replaced with something else, but I can't figure out with what exactly.
I like my sister, I want her to be happy, so is it because there is no room to think about myself when  being there for somebody? Well, I would help the whole world then, if only I wouldn't have to feel like a worthless shit anymore. Is that the reason why people do that? But that wouldn't be a selfless act then. I don't want approval, i don't want glory, i don't want admiration. I just want to be authentic and free of fear of people and fear of judgement. I want to just not care what others think. I want to love. I want to help. I want to create. I want to die. Not again, ughh...How do I stop that?

Can anybody relate?"
It's OK to be scared - Monday morning motivation,20,mkm2tp,3,"Today is an opportunity for you to live on your terms. You are the person in control of your life. No one but you is going to be the HERO of your story. It's OK to be scared. IT'S NOT OK TO QUIT ON YOURSELF. 

Think about all the times in your life that you have been terrified of something you knew would make your life better. Why is that? Why do we get so scared of the idea that we can live on our terms, be the hero, and do things we want to do because WE WANT TO DO THEM? For many of us, it's the software embedded in us in youth. We are told to be seen, not heard, to think small because our dreams will never happen, and not even bother because we probably won't succeed anyway. 

The part that I get stuck on is that these limiting beliefs that we carry from our childhood often have nothing to do with trauma or traumatic experiences. Many of these beliefs and mindsets come from our society in general. When we were born, we were told only to accept the bare minimum of what our potential power is. I don't know about you, but I am so tired of the bare minimum, and I don't believe that people like us exist for the ""good enough"" mentality. To be honest, if good enough was good enough, I don't think you would be reading this right now.

Deep inside of each of us is an incredible power to step into something great, but we often quit before starting the line. We often find ourselves asking permission from our friends and family but sadly they have the same societal thought process. And then we find ourselves seeking permission to exist. 

Let me tell you something- YOU DON'T NEED ANYONE'S PERMISSION TO BE GREAT except your own. 

**Ask yourself an essential question today:** What do I have to do to have the life I want to have?

You DO NOT HAVE TO QUALIFY your life to anyone. THIS IS YOUR LIFE! 

If you are ready to take control and be the hero of your story, then let's get these stupid limiting beliefs out of our way!

Be Unbroken,

Venting About a Memory (Support?),3,mkyqss,5,"TW: Child trafficking, injury and death (pretty into detail tbh), and car accident, sex trafficking mention and fighting ringss

So at the place where I was child trafficked, one of the things they liked doing other than sell us for sex and put us against each other in fighting rings was do ""challenges"". They somehow thought they were fun, but it was really just them being really sadistic. What they did was ask me to do something. I don't really remember what they wanted me to do, but I do know it was something I didn't know how to do. And they had another girl chained up, and they said something bad would happen to her if I didn't do it. And I freaked out because I didn't know what to do. I ended up not being able to do it, and what they did was run her over with a car. (This is where I start going into detail about what happened to her) I just can't really get it out of my head, how terrified she looked when she saw the car, watching it split her in half and then having it get all over me.. It's not really something an 11 year old should've seen, nothing \*anyone\* should have seen really. I just honestly still kinda feel like it was my fault, even though it never would've happened if they hadn't chosen to do that. But still. If I had known how to do it, then she would've been okay. Probably. They usually didn't kill anyone if the ""challenge"" had been beaten, but sometimes they did. I don't really know. Thx for reading if you did tho

Finals and Freeze/Flight Response?,2,ml0t9z,4,"I’m a freshman in college living at home due to the pandemic, and this has been the most taxing year of my life mental-health wise. My finals week is coming up and I can’t stop swinging between hyper vigilance and dissociation, and it’s starting to get to me.  

On better days, I charge up with caffeine, run long distances, complete the assignments I can and make an effort to take care of myself. Today is the first day of reading week/last week before finals, and I had bad nightmares and couldn’t focus in my 11am class. I napped after until 3pm and physically couldn’t will myself to do my homework until 6. I have procrastination issues but I’ve gotten a handle on them recently so this is weird. 

My flashbacks have been really bad today. I just drank 2 cups of coffee, I still have so much to do, and all I want is to sleep. And cry. I almost puked earlier lol. I’ve just been listening to music from an NYC band I love (The Strokes, I go to Columbia)  to remind myself that soon I’ll be able to leave home, but I just can’t focus."
DAE get triggered by younger people who are comfortable opening up about their sexuality and promiscuity?,22,mkk7nu,8,"**Trigger Warning**: sexuality, promiscuity

The other day I saw a tiktok of some teen saying ""counting the days to turn 18 to open an onlyfans"".

fuck fuck fuck fuck. trigger alarm trigger alarm trigger alarm. Weeks have passed and I'm still triggered when I remember it.

What's with that enormous display of confidence in themselves? I'm envious of them. My sexuality and feelings are so repressed. Lately I'm opening up more and becoming more vulnerable, but I still live deep inside my shell. This kind of triggering events remind me that even though I've gained confidence lately, I still can gain **a lot more**.

It's also triggering when I see people mindlessly making out or intimating freely with whoever wherever. When I imagine myself freely pursuing my sexual desires I get scared.

I guess I've been shamed a lot for my body and my way of being, *sigh*."
I think I got triggered by something my therapist did and I have to bring it up to them. Any advice?,6,mkughk,5,"I think my therapist unknowingly triggered me during my last session. I know I need to bring this up with them. I literally haven't left my bed in two days. I feel like someone beat me up. 

I am pretty scared tbh. My legit solution was to just quit therapy. 

If my therapist so much as gives a whiff of defensiveness I'll fucking lose my shit. 

Any advice for bringing up how a therapist hurt you?"
Working a job with this,3,mkwyoe,1,Looking for advice from people who have a job and cptsd. I need tips for how to make the application process easier. I'm having trouble finding a place to apply to and being nervous about job interviews.
Being a disabled person and society,10,mknfxm,1,"The government implemented this ""clinical frailty scale"" for their triage guidelines that will decide for doctors who gets to stay on their vent in the ICU and who doesn't, if our hospitals get to that point, which seems inevitable at this time. Disability groups have been repeatedly trying to get this news made public and are being ignored at best, or told that it's ""tough luck"" at every turn, or that it is justified.  I've written into multiple news outlets, to crickets. They have no issue covering all the other discrimination in the world today, but they simply do not give a rats ass about this type.  

Trying desperately to get the general public to know what is going on, I have been having debates on Reddit with people who think discriminating against disabled people in the triage protocol is justified. I will carefully explain to them why the triage guidelines implemented are discriminatory and they will simply say, condescendingly, that ""oh well, tough choices have to be made"" as if we are not aware tough choices have to be made. Or even better ""tough shit"". 

The government knows this scale is discriminatory yet they ignore it, and are allowed to keep ignoring it, for over a year now. This panel of bioethisists sit there and justify it. You want to know what the issues are? They're using criteria such as: can the patient normally walk, can the patient normally sit up on their own, can the patient complete errands and household chores normally, etc as some of the criteria for deciding who gets life saving treatment or not. What do any of those things have to do with surviving covid? Absolutely nothing. Pure ableism. 

And it's been ruled discriminatory but it's still in there, the whole issue is just being swept under the rug by everyone in a position of any power, condoned by society. Doctors and ethicists, who are supposed to be saving your life and being fair, working against you justifying your death for arbitrary reasons.

And then I see normally ""woke"" people online sitting there arguing with me that it's ok these are included. I've had people ask ""can't we just ignore the Charter of Rights and freedoms in this situation?"" in order to stop a disabled guy from suing the government so he can access the vaccination, as he is house-bound and cannot get to a centre. Imagine that, being denied access to the vaccine, knowing that if you end up in hospital you will be more likely to be refused the care able-bodied people will get - you will be deemed not worth saving - and knowing that society at large is literally asking for your human rights to be stripped away in order for you to not get the vaccine which might prevent that situation from happening. Lol! Such a wonderful feeling.

Disabled people are seen as garbage to be blunt, and society and all the institutions will explicitly organize around this, feel justified in doing so. And nobody will help us in this fight, instead they sit there arguing that this discrimination is justified. Or they just ignore it. So easy to quietly to ignore. Or they'll virtue signal about using PC language when it comes to disability. You think we give a single fuck what language you use? My god. My post on this triage issue in my province's subreddit attracted nothing but downvotes and bile. Just trying to get the word out and find some help and people are arguing that your death is justified and simply a tough a choice that has to be made. 

 I am haunted by the job struggles I had two years ago at my job where I was being underpaid by about 30% because of audism. I was constantly excluded from the group which was a small office and then I was told I didn't have the personality they were looking for, that I needed to contribute more to studio life. How could I do that when I couldn't hear the chitchat going on?  I was very competent at my work and was able to answer colleague questions when asked. That didn't count because I couldn't socialize in the same way?  I'm extremely lucky to even have a job, deaf people are already chronically unemployed as people see them as incapable of doing work. So they're trapped in poverty. I thought going into a visual field would be a safe bet but it seems I just cannot escape this shit. And trying to explain it is futile, nobody believed me or got what I was saying. And people will argue with you that you don't deserve accommodation, they will side with Uber over not giving rides to a blind woman, my good friend thought it was ok that Starbucks was denying service to deaf people a few years back. People feel 100% justified being bigoted against disabled people. I suppose it's instinct. Can't blame them I guess.

I am quite stressed about work now after that last experience. I don't know how to act at work anymore because, even though it's a new job, and seems to be much better, I know not being able to hear the same as everyone makes me look stupid and incompetent and I don't know how asking for accommodation will be received, will I just be laid off because I'm seen as a pain in the ass? People doubt your fitness for the job. They exclude you. I wish there was a robot to talk to and decide this stuff, it would not be biased it would just set me up with what I need.  I'm lucky as hell I can hear as well as I can, a lot of Deaf people can't hide it. I'm extremely lucky to have a job. I'm lucky that I personally would not be a target in triage (although I do wonder what would happen if my hearing aid batteries die and I can no longer hear any of the doctors or nurses). 

But it's so incredibly lonely being in this position.  I guess the only time there's outrage is when cops put 5 bullets in a Deaf man who could not hear their commands. Try to do anything to prevent other disabled deaths instead of outrage after the fact? Fuck you I guess.

Rant over."
I suspect that one of my parents is a psycho/sociopath,8,mkpf0h,4,"I have been considering this possibility for a few years already, in the back of my mind. I just decided to read up on sociopath behavior in depth, especially how sociopaths act as parents. While psycho and sociopath may seem like strong words, it's almost scary how accurately the descriptions and examples fit one of my parents from personal experiences. At the same time, I'm not a psychologist, so I can't be sure.

Has anyone else dealt with something similar, what were your experiences? Any thoughts on how to deal with this?"
"When I disassociate, it feels like I'm failing a ""trust fall"" with reality.",16,mkk51y,4,"Instead of being caressed by a sturdy woven net, I fall through like a wall of tissue paper.

 I see myself talking/acting with a lag of conscious thought to action. Feels like stuttering but with reality. Like I know what my intentions were but there is a lag with the feedback that my intended actions were actually carried out. And then to top it off, while disassociating I feel a clear disconnect where my next words/actions don't feel like my conscious choices. Like my ""auto-pilot"" takes over. That scares me so I jolt myself to get back in control. I guess my main worry right now is that when this happens I do feel like another part of me is taking over. I don't want to cry wolf and say I have some kind of DID, but I feel like I have definitely coped by organizing myself into separate timelines in order not to feel the full weight of my entire life. And I think that right now I'm worried that my ""true self"" is going to lose more control if I don't have better ways to ground myself when disassociation occurs. 

I'll go over this in therapy but until then, any advice on smoother grounding techniques? I am usually pretty mindful of recognizing my triggers and priming myself to calm down. But when I actually disassociate, it's such a hard transition and I just freak out and try to brute force my way back to control."
Establishing boundaries went ehm.. oof,4,mku577,2,"I am trying to assert my boundaries more and sometimes that works out and sometimes my partner get triggered and feels rejected. That in turn triggers in me feelings of not being worthy of that kind of selfishness or thoughts that no one loves the ""real"" me, but only stay with me to the extent I can self sacrifice, that I should not trust anyone etc. I am writing this dissociating (so forgive me for poor syntax) and having a hard time contradicting these thoughts. It was such a stupid thing too. My partner wants to exercise with me multiple times a week and I said I wanted to still be able to practice flamenco 3 times a week instead of 2 because it does wonders to my mental health. He said ok but was clearly disappointed, withheld affection, and then later said something about me wanting to leave him, rebelling against him for no reason, him not being good enough, not making enough money etc.

So it seems we are playing ping pong with our insecurities and it is so hard to interrupt this when we are both triggered. 

Any ideas to stop this mechanism when it happens?"
Should I move in?,3,mkw448,3,"I had a psychological seizure and an injury to my finger (severed tendon) after breaking up my abusive relationship in December 2019. Helped my Mom in a rural area and spent quite a bit of money to help her, but she’s very mentally ill. 

I got back on the dating scene around January/February of 2020. I met a 30 year old young man whom I fell in love with, but he was unfortunately furloughed from his job and moved in with me very very quickly after dating for 3 months. I also took care of him after/during his psychological seizure. 

My sister was having a mental breakdown and was socially isolating herself during COVID, so I was hanging out with him quite a bit. Tried to kill herself in the city where I live (it’s all pretty compact), and stole $11K from me (am looking into recovering funds with help of Bank’s Financial Crimes). 

I emotionally and financially supported him until he found a well-paying job 3 weeks into living with me. Things were going well. 

New Year’s 2020 his parents decide they don’t like me. January 2021 he comes back from the gym after talking to an acquaintance and says he isn’t sure that he loves me. I am (understandably) upset as I have flashbacks and am struggling to find good employment. I tell him - my heart broken - to move out. 

He moves out. 

I struggle through a job where I am treated poorly, but it’s a good “foot in the door” opportunity. I quit over sexual harassment and the low pay. 

After I quit, I was struggling mentally very much. Before committing myself, I ask him for help. I’ve been staying at his place for about 3 weeks now, away from the city where I went through further trauma, and am healing up well. 

His uncle’s estate is divided up, and now he’s completely financially stable. He says now that he realizes the joy I bring to his life, and that I should move in. He has apologized and we have talked over things more extensively over the last 2 weeks. 

I want to make sure this isn’t a trauma bond situation. He’s helped me get a very promising lead on a job; I expect good news tomorrow. 

My apartment is fairly isolating, and it does help to live with somebody, but I want to move in for the right reasons and not just because I can’t live on my own (which I have before in my life)...am new to the city and no friends/support because of COVID. 

How do I tell if this is a trauma bond or what? 

I don’t want to go back to my isolating apartment in a city with traumatic reminders, have always been the steady partner, and am healing amazingly here regardless of how you’d characterize our bond. 

I’m trying to do the right thing; he’s been clear on his feelings toward me (romantic, he says he definitely loves me), I’ve been journaling and integrating active coping methods into my life to curb my depression. 

I want to do what’s best for the relationship and also to establish clear boundaries. 

We improve together. I want to move out without the move being traumatic itself (I have moved about 3-4 times in the last year), so if I moved in it would be gradual."
Is there anyway I can share trauma without it being on my Reddit post history?,5,mks8ov,7,"I want to share a trauma, but don't want it to be publicly viewed as I have had people go through my post history. Is there a chat room that is active from this group?"
I do better when I am busy?,2,mky7zf,1,"For example, before the pandemic i had finally found my groove, I was going to the gym regularly, going to all my classes, completing my work on time and working part time at a job i enjoyed. Most importantly though I was doing good in uni. I was pushing deadlines but I got all of my work done!

Now, I only have to focus on school and just deciding what to eat for dinner. I have so much time but I cannot bring myself do my work and haven't been able to really for the entirety of the pandemic. It is hurting me now and I feel so stuck. 

I think this has to do something with the fact that during high school I was extremely busy all the time and I was living at home. And once you have a routine it's easier to keep with it.

 I was the eldest daughter so I had many, many things to do. I began the day at 6am for school and walked back home with my siblings by 4pm. The I had chores such as cleaning, cooking, making sure everyone takes a shower and does their homework, laundry, etc. on top of my schoolwork and taking care of myself. No, I did not socialize with other kids outside of school. 

So now I am just paralyzed with looming deadlines and I can't bring myself to do anything without stimulants but I don't as much anymore. I cannot wait for this pandemic to be over :("
I’m SO SO SO frustrated with my memory problems,3,mkvg0u,4,"I feel like no one understands the depth of my memory issues. I feel so isolated in this problem and feel so stupid!!

When I tell my family I can’t remember things I said or did in the past, they tell me I’m lying or saying that as an excuse.

My friends and family say “just write it down,” but my notebooks are FULL of things jotted down. I’ll either forget I wrote it or not understand what I was trying to write so I get confused. 

I started a brand new job and I’m scared I’ll get in trouble because I’m forgetting to do small things. I work in customer service and there are so many little steps and rules we have to follow for each phone call and I always write down what I need to do, and try to concentrate as hard as I can to remember, then as soon as I get off the call I’ll be like DAMN I forgot to do everything!!! Every call’s the same: I say I’ll remember, write all the steps down, get mad and say I’ll remember next time, rinse and repeat. 

I’ll have errands or bills I need to pay that are time sensitive and when husband asks did you do it? I say fuck I forgot. Even though I wrote it down in a million places. 

Anyone else?? I just feel so stupid like it should be this difficult! It’s like my brain is completely empty. So so frustrating. My therapist even said to do more meditation but I forget to do that too. Ugh. So frustrating"
My body won't calm down.,2,mkxwy7,6,"My body has been in trigger mode for two straight days now. Pounding heart, feels like I have a gaping hole in my chest, physically exhausted but can't settle or sleep. I've journaled, I've taken GABA, I've done breathing exercises, I've gone for walks, it's still there.

My birthday is coming up and it's the anniversary of a sexual assault, so I feel like that's probably part of it... But my inner child part is also really activated right now. I just want to be cuddled in a totally platonic and supportive way-- that seems like it would help with the gaping hole in my chest.

Anyway. This really sucks. 

That's all."
Stuck and feeling hopeless and completely lost.,1,ml22b8,6,"long read but please please bear with me. 

so I just came across a post that said “you can’t heal in the environment where you were hurt”, so then what the hell do I do? Keep hurting? I feel hopeless about the future because my physical health is suffering, my face covered in acne and body in anxiety rashes, I barely eat so my hair is becoming brittle so it falls out and I also pull at strands, digestive issues from anxiety, hormonal problems, also I don’t like shaving/waxing or anything, obviously no guy will find this attractive and having never had a boyfriend I can’t imagine ever finding love if I keep feeling like this forever, trauma started when I was 16 (22now) I never got a chance to know myself or know what I like, I’m young but don’t want to “hustle” because I have nothing inside to give, heck I can’t even feel my own legs, forget hustling or pushing myself to work or achieve success or have ambition. I wanted to move out by this time, be pretty and have a boyfriend who loves me and be in a good uni, what the hell happened? I’m so fckn abnormal. 
I literally have not talked to boys since the past 3 years, have not went out or connected with friends, because of how different my experiences have been, it would be heavy for them, and I can’t lie and faking to be happy is so much work. So I just avoid it completely. 
What do I do ? Do I leave my house go to a different country? or keep living with my parents who physically hit me & emotionally & verbally abused me up until I was 18 (btw it is culturally acceptable to live with parents,I live in asia, though it affects my mental health) 
They don’t beat me or anything anymore, but they look at me like I’m a failure and we are enmeshed and have no boundaries. When I’m dissociating and having an existential panic attack I can ask my sibling and parents for physical & emotional support, and in that moment despite the past drama, they try their best to be supportive and physically support me. But i don’t know who to go to?!!!
Now I’m confused what the hell do I do? I don’t want to move to a different continent and lose this support too? Also I have no energy physically or mentally to take on financial stress or university application/acceptance stress or corporate competition. Not right now. I just want to go to a beach and live there for at least 3 months, but we are in a pandemic, I have sexu@l trauma so I won’t be able to live alone or really relax and be able to have that experience. 
But I have to start somewhere? Or am I stuck forever ? I try to be optimistic but at night the true fears come out. Please help me :("
[possible relationship trigger warning] Proud of how I managed a super intense flashback,5,mkssj5,1,"Just had a major flashback that was triggered by something I don't have a history of.

I was listening to music, feeling good, when a song about infidelity came on. It put me in full-on 4F panic, and incapacitated me for an hour. Pounding heart, uncontrolled catastrophizing about being cheated on, franticly searching for a quick fix to feel better. Instead, I worked through Walkers' steps for flashback management, wrote about it in my journal, and gave myself a little space to feel safe before going back to work. It worked, and I'm okay! This afternoon when I catch a break in my work, I'm going to take an hour off to continue to process instead of ignoring it.

I've never experienced infidelity, so my response was confusing. As I work on healing and recovery from trauma, my relationship is also improving, although improving intimacy is slow-going. I think the song triggered my fear of abandonment, but it was so unexpected it caught me completely flat-footed. I still feel sad, like lingering emotions form an event that only happened in my mind, but it feels manageable and transient instead of overwhelming and permanent.

Getting a PTSD diagnosis and finding the CPTSD community has really changed my life. Having the *language* for what I'm feeling has allowed me to take an event that would have ruined my whole week and probably caused a fight in my relationship and allowed me to process it in a healthy way and avoid paralysis. 

I'm greatful for the progress I've made so far. Just wanted to share that with a community who understands the significance."
I don’t know why I still think my parents are capable of helping me?,21,mkhr6r,6,"The child in me wants to have parents who can give me guidance. But my adult self sees all their shortcomings, their age, their overreactions and how they over complicate everything. But I still come back to wanting to have their reassurance and wise knowledge. 

I’ve become so used to doing everything myself that I don’t let them help me. They usually disappoint. I think they are hurt because I’m showing them I don’t need them when deep down I want to have their reassurance.  

I’ve become very good at making a point of being super independent."
"In addition to family abuse, I had to deal with a lot more as a child, and now I need help in understanding what that means for me (about sex but no idea which flair to use)",2,mkxkpx,2,"Throwaway account, obviously. Maybe someone here can help me figure some stuff out:  


I'm 50, female, married to a man.

I have never been with a woman and the thought of doing so kind of skeeves me out, but I like lesbian porn. 

I'm terrified and repulsed by masculine lesbians. Like, they scare the absolute shit out of me, which I know isn't fair on them but I can't help it.

If a female starts getting close to me I feel like she's a lesbian and I get scared, and therefore i don't have many friends. I prefer the company of men because at least I know what they want.

I have a hard time orgasming during sex, but I can easily reach climax 2 or 3 times alone.

I like sex with men I will never see again, hidden and secretive. I have had many one-nighters, both before and during my marriage. My husband knows, it was in the past, but I still wish I could do that again. I'm too fat and ugly now for anyone to be attracted to me.

I was molested as a little girl (I cannot go into detail but it wasn't a man--one episode for certain and another in which I am not sure if they were boys or girls. I can't say more because my story is weird and unusual and recognizable).

I find men attractive and sexy. I can admire a pretty woman but I do not think women are sexy and I am not attracted to them sexually.  


During sex I cannot ""be there"" mentally. I am there, and I can perform, but my head is not there. I'm really good at sex and good at making men feel good, but I'm just thinking of the mechanics of it, and trying to figure out ways to make it end faster.  


I grew up with two narcissist parents--dad was overt and loud and mean and violent, mom was meek and the martyr and the victim and a big child, and both drank. I had an older sister with serious psychological problems with substance abuse as she got older and she was abusive towards me. I had an older brother who was abusive towards me. 

Without a doubt most of my issues come from being molested but even though I know that, I don't know how to change it. I am always afraid of speaking too much about this to therapists--if they are female my head tells me they might be lesbian and if they are male I'm thinking they have an agenda.   


Does anyone have any advice? Am I doomed to live the rest of my life unable to enjoy sex with anyone but myself? That would be lame. I want to enjoy it with my husband and get over these hang-ups."
Anyone on abilify? Share your experience so far,2,mkxd1c,4,Diagnosed w ocd as well
I don't want to be defensive anymore,6,mkpgh8,2,"TL;DR: Can't have a couple's discussion without feeling attacked, want to take responsibility for my actions and make amends genuinely.

I feel like I jsut need to hear some succes stories on this topic, listen to experiences of people who improved and get this out of my chest somehow. I'm 27 years old, I have always been alone and a loner. I used to live with my mom until I was 18 years old, then I moved out, lived alone for some more years, got back to live with her for 3 more years and then finally left for good at 24.

I have been analyzing my relationship with her and how things have turned out in my life. How I'd always feel inadequate and like I didn't belong anywhere. How she'd beat me up for getting bad grades and misbehave a little. How she'd never keep a secret I told her and how I couldn't trust her because of that. How she had her own plans for me and I never felt like I could be me. I still have a lot of trouble socializing and trsuting people and I guess it all goes back to that. Also, she'd always be paranoid about the most menial things, like she'd always tell me to beware the girls in the stationery shop we had because I was ""the boss's son"" so they would try to get pregnant just to get cash. And many other things. In a way, I think up until the time I left her house for good in 2018, I still felt like just and extension of her life and beliefs. I don't ever remember her saying sorry for anything, and honestly, mye motions towards her vaccilate between apathy and anger.

All this had been buried for a long time since I didn't interact with people. I seriously used to hate myself a lot. Nowadays what I feel is more inched towards disgust. I feel helpless and inexperienced, and I feel like most people around me are better than me at the things I'm not. All my life I've wanted to get a girlfriend, a life partner, and I finally did so last year. Yet, when it comes to conflict solving with her, I am as stupid as a door. I can never view her perspective, and even when I do, it feels like I just feel this urgent need to prove to her that I didn't mean to do the things I did. And it's true, I hurt her by mistake, but that doesn't mean that I should ignore her feelings and try to prove it instead. From what I've read, good conflict solving is actually the opposite. I just don't want to feel so vulnerable and afraid whenever she just needs my validation. It makes her feel alone in the relationship, and it makes me feel the stupidest person on earth.

I also have problems telling her my emotions. Sometimes I jsut get stuck feeling numb and when she asks me what I'm feeling, I can't answer her. I also cry like a baby when we fight, I guess I'm terrfied of her leaving and being alone all over again. I've been so alone for so long that I don't want to feel it ever again. I also legitimately love this girl. We are awesome together, we have great fun, I make her laugh, I help her evolve, she incentivizes me to be bettar, and we have amazing and fulfiling sex, despite both of us not being so experienced with that. I don't want this to end just because of my problems.

What I've done so far is I've been reading Pete Walker's book, I've been going to therapy, and I'm also reading Paul Ekman and the Dalai Lama's ""Emotional Awareness"". I don't want to feel like this anymore, I just want to be better. Any help is appreciated.  


Edit: I think I just did it again. For me it's unfair for the other party not to believe that I made a mistake and not that I was intentionally hurting them. Is this really how it should be?"
I want to move away but I feel so guilty,4,mks0cd,5,"This is going to be a long vent, TLDR at the end

I have always hated the town I grew up in, and I have promised myself since I was a kid that I would move away as soon as I could. Years have gone by and I’ve gotten married, and my husband and I started looking for a house to buy. We saw a lot of great ones, but my gut always told me not to jump on it.

Today I realized that it’s because I don’t want to put down roots here. I almost feel like I would be doing my inner child a disservice by staying in the same small town I was abused in surrounded all the people who turned the other cheek. My abuser moved away a long time ago, but all of those painful memories are still there.

I’ve mentioned to my mom before that I want to move out of state, to somewhere with more sunshine and warmer weather. She always guilt trips me for leaving her, tells me that I’m going to get in over my head and that it would be a huge mistake, and I’ve let that stop me for a long time. She parentified me a lot as a kid and I still struggle with feeling responsible for her and her emotional wellbeing. At the same time, she’s always made me feel like I am incapable of doing anything/ being independent from her. She cried and threw a fit when I moved to an apartment 15 minutes away from her with my husband. We have a very codependent relationship with each other but in a lot of ways are each other’s best friends even though it’s really dysfunctional.

It scares the hell out of me. My husband and I would both be leaving very cushy jobs where we are paid very well with super low stress, plans for both of us to advance our roles, and low cost of living. I’d feel guilty missing get-togethers with my mom’s side of the family, and I’d feel guilty that any future children I might decide to have won’t have a close relationship with their grandparents. But at the same time, I am so unhappy living here. I feel so trapped by my history in this place and I want to get out so badly. I don’t think I will ever reach my full potential of healing if I can’t live somewhere that makes me feel... alive

This is the perfect time to do it. I graduated last year, my husband’s classes have all converted to online because of the pandemic and he will be done in 9 months. His sister moved to Texas 3 years ago and our brother-in-law works for a tech company down there that would give my husband some really good connections to quickly find a job. I don’t know that I could find something as easily, but we could live pretty comfortably off of just my husband’s salary and our savings if necessary for a while if we had to. The area we’d be looking at is in the early stages of a tech-boom and that is very exciting to my software engineer husband, plus the fact that he would like to live close to his sister and our nieces/ nephews.

My heart tells me to just take the plunge and do it, but my head fixates on the what-ifs, the potential negatives, and the guilt I’d feel for leaving my mom. I wish it was as easy as just deciding not to care, but I have spent my whole life caring for her and living my life in service of her and it’s so hard to just let that go. 

Logically, it doesn’t make sense. Our disposable income might go way down, we might have more financial stress until/ if I find a job, we have so much stability and room for growth in our current jobs, a lot of my husband’s family is here, i’d be leaving my mom etc. But at the same time, I might gain so much freedom finally being able to be away from the place that I spent so many years being miserable. I spend hours researching neighborhoods, rentals, job openings, etc and in the end I never do anything. I feel trapped by my indecision and guilt.

TLDR I want to move away from my home town where I suffered years of abuse but my mom’s guilt trips and my own self-doubts are keeping me trapped here."
"DAE go back to songs you used to like when you were younger and realize the lyrics hit the nail right on the head for how you felt, but you couldn't recognize it then?",1120,mjuyvl,256,"i was a teenager in the late 2000s/early 2010s and was really into all the emo/post-hardcore/metalcore/pop-punk bands. i've been listening to a bunch of my old favorite songs recently and realized all the lyrics are quite literally how i felt about things but could not express, especially taking back sunday lyrics (i cried uncontrollably when i heard the song ""my blue heaven"" again).

weird how even when we are completely unaware of our cptsd and ongoing trauma (or at least it doesn't register as trauma), our brains still somehow *know*.

edit: wow, did not expect this passing thought to resonate with so many of you. thank you for the awards and song recommendations! I hope you all are having a great day and hanging in there (I know I'm trying)."
"I’ve been trying to get some answers about why I am the way I am for my whole life. I think I’m starting to figure it out. I wrote this summary, and I’m wondering how many of you it also applies to.",285,mk2ol3,73,"A child is born with Highly Sensitive traits (HSP). Their caregivers do not nurture and cultivate these traits for several possible reasons: (a) they are oblivious and don’t recognize it (child is labeled as “eccentric”); (b) they don’t know how to deal with it so they give up very early on (child is labeled as “difficult”); (c) they notice it but don’t care so they ignore it (child is labeled as “a bother”); they punish it (child is labeled as “bad”). 

As a result of the core traits of the child being ignored or punished, the child develops CPTSD. This results in anxiety, depression, dissociation, mistrust in self and others, and emotional disregulation.

As a result of the development of CPTSD, the child develops ADHD, which includes coping and survival mechanisms such as a keen ability to read other’s emotions and intentions; using logic instead of emotions to make decisions;  being drawn to patterns and routines, which provide safety, comfort and predictability; and avoidance of difficult situations where the outcome is not certain.

As a result of the development of ADHD, the child’s behaviors are seen as “advanced for their age” and the child is labeled as “gifted”. The child is then held to a higher level of expectation, but without the foundation of family support. This leads to early and prolonged  burnout - “after gifted”.

As a result of this pattern, the child spends their life feeling unseen, inadequate, unaccomplished."
introducing myself and my specific big challenge,1,ml08jd,1,"I recently found this sub. I am 36F and have been in therapy with multiple different therapists & psychiatrists since I was 18. About 1/3 of have said I exhibit features of BPD, 1/3 have said C-PTSD, and 1/3 garden variety depression & anxiety. I don't actually care what my exact label or diagnosis is; I just really really need to manage the following particular symptom that has followed me around my entire life no matter what because it's destroying me.

Basically, in romantic relationships, I have a constant fear of abandonment, and after breakups (if the other person ends it, aka they in fact do abandon me) I attempt suicide and end up in the hospital and once out I'm still suicidal until I find a new long term partner. This has happened 4 times now. I feel extreme emptiness and no interest in being alive when I'm single, regardless of other things in my life (friendships, career, etc). To cope with these feelings I self-harm, oversleep, and don't eat. 

My therapists can't seem to help me with this. It's hard to know what caused it - I have an anxious attachment style and experienced emotional bullying in school as a kid/teen, but no abuse from my parents. I've tried DBT, CBT, and psychodynamic talk therapy. I've taken SSRIs, benzos, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotic drugs. 

I've gotten a lot better/smarter at fine-tuning how I would successfully attempt next time but I'm willing to try to stay alive for ONE more year if I can find something that helps. Has anyone had luck dealing with this particular tendency?"
The way I was abused has made therapy an impossible mode of recovery.,159,mk5oj7,36,"My father used his skills acquired managing and studying people to twist my mind into believing all sorts of things about myself, him, and my childhood neglect that simply weren't true. 

Some of the methods he used in breaking my barriers and planting false ideas in my head are the same ones therapists use. I once had a meltdown in a therapist's office not because she uncovered something I didn't want to deal with, but because she was using some of the methods he did, and I didn't know how to react. I couldn't speak for days after that appointment. 

Being neurodiverse and being abused makes articulating what's wrong with you when you're upset a difficult task. It's even harder when the person who is supposed to be helping you has to use what hurt you in the first place to help you."
DAE feel like they are ruined?,52,mkc5ss,7,"The emotional and verbal abuse inflicted upon me during childhood and beyond by my dad is something I've struggled for nearly 40 years to deal with.

I remember as a young child feeling inadequate around other kids, never skinny enough, smart enough, ambitious enough. I compared myself to others very early on and was very much hypervigilant of how others perceived me. 

I have major feelings of unworthiness hopelessness and quite honestly an existential depression that never seems to entirely leave me. I struggle to accomplish anything because I have this internal battle (me vs dad's voice) about the point of achieving said thing. I swear I even wonder why bother doing the dishes and pulling the weeds etc when we're all just going to die. 

It's sad because art used to be an escape for me and early on nobody gave a shit about it because it wasn't what they thought was a valuable hobby. Now, I don't enjoy art anymore. Drawing for the fun of it is an ability I have lost. Now when I try to draw I am plagued by my dad's internalised voice. I have this whole internal battle about the meaning and the point of any of it. It's such a massively shitty way to live.

I also feel like a burden to my boyfriend who is a sweetheart, and such a happy-go-lucky positive guy with lots of interesting hobbies and passions. I often tell him how jealous I am of his passions because I wish I felt that way about something.

I know my life is up to me now but I feel like I simply don't have the tools to live ""nornaly"". I spend much of my time faking like all is fine.

I also have an autoimmune disease and apparently autoimmune diseases are linked to adverse childhoods. It's so sad. Apparently those of us who experienced adverse childhoods had stress levels so high for so long and now as adults we tend to be high strung and stress so easily over simple things so at some point your immune system is triggered all the time and goes into overdrive.

I used to love working out and weight training and lost over 100lbs but after I stopped taking my largely ineffectual thyroid meds I have gained it all back and then some, which is massively exacerbating the plantar fasciitis I've had for 8 years now. Working out used to help me feel normal. I'd get that natural endorphin high and it would boost me. Now I can barely walk. I tried to get back into working out (just short 20 minute ones) and the amount of foot pain I'd feel for days after was absolutely crippling. I feel so trapped.

I'm just feeling very overwhelmed and sorry for myself right now. The thought that someone here understands makes me feel comforted and also sad."
Stuck in limbo. Why can’t I just do what needs to be done?,2,mkurwc,1,"I feel stuck in limbo. My home situation deteriorated right before the pandemic and I have been trapped in the same house as my abusive parent. I’m trying to get myself out but it’s messy and drawn out because there are lawyers involved and I don’t have a job. 

Here is part of my problem. The lack of a job. I am on disability support so I do have some money coming in, but it’s not enough to pay my expenses once I move out on my own. I am acutely aware of this and yet... I don’t feel like I have the mental reserves to go through the motions of applying for jobs and attending interviews. So I sit at home and waste my time playing silly video games to distract myself from my reality until I can finally escape. 

I berate myself on my laziness and stupidity. I hear about stories of people who apply themselves, get a job and work hard to escape their toxic situations. Why can’t I do that? What is wrong with me? Does it mean I don’t want out badly enough? I feel like a failure. Like it is proof that I am the useless, selfish, disgusting person my parent tells me I am.

It feels worse this time because  I have always considered myself to be a proactive person. I do what needs to be done, regardless of how I feel. “Because that’s just what you do”. You suck it up and keep going, right? ...

I had to withdraw from studying this semester as well because I pushed my body too far last year trying to finish my first degree, and made my chronic pain issues significantly worse. I use what little energy I have trying to keep my other mental health diagnoses under control and rehabbing my body. My studies were the one area I thought I was making progress in. I had been clinging to that thread of hope for so long and now it feels like that thread has been cut and I am in freefall. I have nothing to show for my 30 years on earth. 

There is just too much to do. While I sit here in limbo, feeling powerless, invisible and and worthless.

Can anyone relate?"
I'm looking to educate myself on trauma and the effects of childhood upbringing on adult behavior. What sources do you recommend?,6,mkmn3v,5,"It need not be CPTSD specifically. I asked here because of the population of the sub and the subject matter.

Looking for something a bit more on the academic side. So less ""self-help' unless it presents itself academically"
"Just got off a call with my doctor prodding me about my trauma, and I am flooded with all of the bad feelings again",4,mkp7b0,2,"I have seen a neurologist for chronic pain following neurosurgery over the last few years, and have tried more medications and treatments to ease the pain than I can name off the top of my head. In the past this neurologist asked if I experience any psychological stress (because stress can contribute to chronic pain), and I mentioned that I experienced trauma (and said nothing more than that). 

I thought that would be the last time he would bring the topic up, but boy was I wrong. Today he asked me the same question again, then asked me about the type of abuse, when it happened, my abuser, and my symptoms. I had to cut the conversation short when he asked about my abuser, and made it through the rest of the call trying my hardest not to break down. 

It has been almost an hour since the appointment and I have been a complete sobbing mess. It is confusing how I can talk about the things that happened to me with my therapist and make it through our sessions without crying, but then I am asked by someone else about the trauma and the skills I learn from therapy fly out the fucking window. I have been in therapy for years. C'est la vie"
This is life right now. Why I'm stressed. Over reacting? Trivial?,1,mkyt86,1,"My mother taking everything I say as if it was the Bible, going to me for life counseling, all the while if I bring up my issues she tell me I'm literally insane, I don't have any mental health issues, shouldn't talk to anyone or they'll lock me up in a mental hospital, I think at one point she said strapped to the bed, and be forced medication. How I'll destroy everyone's life. How I will destroy this family and everyone's life if I leave the ""safety, love and care"" of this family. 

My sister constantly tells me to shut up, I don't know what I'm talking about and how stupid and retarded I am. 

My dad saying how great our loving family is and our support system yet greatly discourages and talks down on anything small risk I bring up. 25, only last year was the first time allowed to ride my bike on main streets without getting in trouble. Even if I had the money. Get a car? Nope got to save for retirement. Move out? Nope got to save and only when I get married. Asked to not pray 5 times a day with them ( Lutheran religion) and my dad burst into tears and my mother going into her lecture of who's life and how I'll destroy it.

This last weekend, Easter. Hiding 7 full seizures, family doesn't know. Trying to make a EEG apartment without them finding out and how to carefully plan how to turn off my phone so they can't track me while my location shows I'm at work or on a bike ride. Getting into more minor car accidents because I'm unable to focus/ blacking out yet still need to be able to drive.

Not to mention. Now my parents won't allow us as a family to watch pg-13 movies because they're too adult, graphic and profanity yet still want movie nights."
Does anyone else have to fight themselves so hard during flashbacks?,2,mktyul,6," ⚠️ Trigger warning ⚠️: drowning, flashback, self harm

I really want to avoid triggering anyone. I found out that CPTSD is what i have been experiencing for the last 3 years since i first left my abusers. I thought I've only had a couple flashbacks but I've been reading ""Surviving to Thriving"" and realized i had been having flashbacks everytime i got upset

When i go into a flashback, i age regress and it's like 80% of me wants it continue. Just the strongest urge to just stand there and make myself suffer. I don't want it to end. I deserve it. Big urges to self harm like getting hit by a car, sleeping out in the snow, starving myself etc. Only thing that stops me is knowing my boyfriend would get mad and yell at me.

I describe it sort of like drowning. A small part of me (20%) is trying to swim up to the surface. i want it to end. I wanna stop shaking and sobbing. I wanna feel safe again

However that 80% is pulling me down. Everytime I'm almost there, it grabs me by the foot and pulls me down. 

I've recently learned grounding is very useful and started carrying a rough textured rock and/or a face brush with me to rub when I'm really anxious. They have saved me a couple times. I also use a lotion called Stargazing mediation that has essential oils in it. It's only used during flashbacks. Some of these flashbacks start because i ruminate and can't stop

I just wanted to know if other people experienced emotional flashbacks like this. If not, how do you experience them? and if there are any other tips you use to get out of a flashback.

Also i love everyone on this Reddit ❤️ you guys are so amazing & strong. If you need a friend, please dm me 💜"
Want to leave my ex but don’t want to upset him,3,mkqzg3,5,"Hi. So I have been seeing my ex again. He has hurt me in the past before emotionally. But I have tried to forgive him, seems like everytime I see him I get a heavy depressed feeling in my chest of heartbreak. So I feel it would be best if we went our separate ways. I feel uncomfortable about how to part ways with him.... any help? Not sure if I am avoiding confrontation. But I find sometimes when I push someone away I end up wanting to come back to them. So I don’t want to loose him and regret it. But I also don’t want to keep feeling like he is going to hurt me and crap everytime I see him or spend time around him."
Finally managing to breakout of my depressive episode,1,mkyomh,2,My aunt just passed away a couple days ago. And I never handled death well. It just reminds me of losing my mother when I was younger. But today I broke out of my depressing ass bubble and finally exercised for the first time all year and played basketball with a few friends. Not a huge improvement but I at least feel better at the moment
Talking about the trauma in therapy?,1,mkyn94,2,"I'm supposed to start talking about trauma tomorrow. I'm bipolar and finally reasonably stable. My therapist feels it's time to start talking about it.

My question is... why talk about it? I know it'll make me upset and depressed and suicidal. I don't really remember it. It happened when I was a kid and teenager and I'm 28 now. It stopped 10 years ago. It won't happen again.

Why talk about it? What's the point? 

Can I be ok without talking about it or do I need to talk about it in therapy? 

I don't have the will to move past feeling bad.

The advise was verbal and emotional with emotional neglect."
books related to the spiritual meaning behind trauma,0,mkym1p,4,"I recently read about a book listed here which dealt with the spiritual meaning behind trauma.

Any other Americans feel traumatized by the U.S.?,401,mjycu4,98,"Don't get me wrong, I love a lot about the U.S.--the natural landscapes, a lot of the people, the ideals that we are supposed to represent, etc. But I also find that it's a very hard place to recover from trauma in. There seems to be a culture of violence (I mean the amount of mass shootings is ridiculous and treated like its nothing by half the government) and theres a culture of ""winning"" and hypercapitalism that just discourages empathy or at least encourages apathy. I know no place is perfect, but it feels like living here is uniquely stressful. A lot of what I need in healing from trauma is to feel safe and surrounded by people who are caring, but so much in the U.S. is triggering, and I do feel like it's moreso than other countries. I'm part Belgian, and I've visited family in Belgium three times. Each time I felt much more relaxed there and like the people are a lot more easygoing. I think the fact that they also don't view social programs as ""socialism"" or something evil made me feel a little more like there was a general attitude of caring, and not the toxic ""every man for himself"" mentality. I know they have their problems too, but culturally it's much more relaxed than the U.S. Does anyone else feel this way and how do you deal?"

Finding it really fucking hard to let my defense down and talk in therapy,9,mkir55,8,I feel like I'm wasting mine and their time. I just clam the fuck up and my muscles are so fucking tight for the whole session. I can hardly talk. Why must this be so difficult.
I still don’t know if it’s me or them,3,mko6wf,5,"I live far away from my family. I moved away after school because of how toxic my childhood was. My mom always emotional took it out on me and played favorites with some of my siblings.

I know they were all together yesterday celebrating.

She called me, I didn’t answer because I was alone and sad. She left a message. “Happy Easter! Miss you so much. Wish you were with us here!”

And I still don’t know.

Is she calling me to rub it in my face that they are all having fun together?

I’m exhausted by this never ending shame.,0,mkxhh6,1,"My adult daughter, a carbon copy of her narcissistic father, effectively ejected me from her life after her baby was born and told me I cannot see the baby anymore. Her way of punishing me with the one thing that would hurt me the most. I wasn’t invited to her christening but my whole family, four sisters their spouses and kids, aunts uncles, cousins, my ex husband (an ex con, recovering heroin addict with numerous breaks in sobriety and a second ex wife, who cheated on me with underage girls, and physically and sexually abused me) all were invited. At holidays it was either I could go or she could go to the party so of course, I was the one left out, everyone loves her and her baby, and all her success, and of course I got phased out of the family. Even my other daughter stopped talking to me. My mom passed away in March 2020. After that I had no contact with anyone at all. It has been three solid years since my daughter did this. We moved 2000 miles away last year to try and quell the throbbing pain and shame. The shame is devastating. I’m not sure how I’m living through this. I feel otherworldly, like nothing could hurt me at all, I’ve felt the ultimate pain so many times I’m out of pain receptors. I do not self harm anymore, I haven’t for 3 years. I think I concentrate so much on staying alive and getting through each day, for my darling husband, my poor husband who has to live with a shell of a person.

I was diagnosed with CPTSD six years ago. I suffered a horribly traumatic childhood and adolescence, and married at 19 to an abusive addict who caused another layer of CPTSD. I’ve gone to a six week treatment center which helped immensely as I’m no longer self harming and I’m still alive. I just don’t feel alive. Covid is making it nearly impossible to make any friends in my new state."
Help with Freeze Response,7,mkk08i,12,"Hi,

I've been in a flashback for around 5 weeks. The intensity varies, it's been bad the last four days. This morning I woke up and was unable to move my legs. The last time I remember it being like that was when I was 7 when some abuse was happening

I managed to crawl out of bed, get up against the wall and then slowly started doing so pulsing, shaking and some very basic qi gong. That has helped a bit but I still can hardly feel my legs

I have no one around to support which is making the flashback worse, as this triggers feelings of abandonment and neglect but that's just how it is for now

Does anyone have any experience of working through freeze bordering tonic immobility on their own? If so, would you mind sharing what worked for you?"
My EXTREME College Bully getting Masters in Counseling...WTH?!?!?,11,mkgkr4,2,"College was rough for me, really rough. I went to a very small liberal arts college and I came from a very wacko conservative family and I felt a lot of pressure to be the daughter my parents wanted me to be. I went to college in Seattle and my parents controlled me financially and emotionally, I didn’t even smoke pot in college until my junior year. My alma-mater is known for turning out Harvard MD-PhD grads, so imagine being untreated ADHD, depressive, cutting, bulimia, boyfriend dumped and spread rumors about you at a college of &lt;3,000 student young gal in the 2010 when body imagine was still size 00 and $$$.

I didn’t drink or smoke my first 2 years, and to cope with my skin crawling, wanting-to-die-every-night anxiety I binged like no tomorrow and cut almost daily.  With access to a “buffet” daily, I would binge macaroni and carbs and whatever else, and then head to the “accessible” single-restroom in my dorm or pop the wide shower drain and purge silently. 

My sophomore year my parents bought an investment house and forced me to landlord my peers at 18 years old. It was obviously disaster, and to cope I purged more. My parents screamed at me from states away when they thought anything was wrong (Aka booze or pot or anything fucking normal or fun in a regular college formative years) and I was to be the fucking landlord, repair lady, and RA (as my housemates treated me) at 18. Bc the house was “mine”, no one cleaned but me, I did all the yard work, and maintained a 2,000sqft house myself while trying into to GO TO COLLEGE?!? I lived with a few girls I didn’t click with because they would band together against me about dumb things that 19 year olds do, but I was drowning as it was, almost peeing in waterbottles in my room I couldn’t leave except for class. I failed O-Chem, had several nervous breakdowns, and don’t remember of lot of that year. 

Nearing finals of sophomore year, one of my roommates had her mom send a letter to MY FUCKING SCHOOL saying I was doing hard drugs because I was in the bathroom forever and they could hear me puking and my arms were covered. She fucking knew I was cutting and bulimic and tried to HAVE ME KICKED OUT OF MY COLLEGE?!?!  

I just stalked her for the first time in years and saw she is getting a masters in counseling. The same girl that went into the basement and stood on a table and SCREAMED BODY SHAMING THINGS AT ME THROUGH MY FLOOR VENTS. I can’t. Cheers! Thanks for the rant. 

I am so glad this generation can talk about these things. I’m 31 and I was shamed for being bulimic and cutting. Wow. And I still don’t even realize how bad that hurt me over the actual acts themselves."
I hate being like this.,2,mkrjo0,5,"I'm sitting here sobbing for no reason and hiding from my family. Whatever small scraps of my life that I'm not dissociating from are filled with pain--for no fucking reason. I'm so sick of it. My psychiatrist keeps telling me to go to therapy, but it doesn't work. At *best*, it doesn't work. At worst, it makes me feel physically sick. I'm so fucking tired of different therapists selling themselves to me at the initial meeting, telling me they can help me and there's so much hope when they can't and there isn't. Honestly, I don't know how therapy would actually help anyone. All they really tell you to do is get some friends and a hobby and then maybe go outside. Like, that's what you get for $120. Just some lady telling you that you should really get a life, and then you have to go back and do it again the next week. Or they'll suggest EMDR, which also doesn't fucking work. It's not even about wasting money; it's more just them giving me hope that I'm not going to feel like absolute shit anymore, and then I slowly have to realize that it isn't working. It kind of makes me hate them, I guess.

Ugh... this is awful..."
I lost 7 years of my life to abuse and trauma,17,mkedjl,11,I was totally incapable of moving forward in those years except to think about and process/reprocess/experience/re-experience abuse and trauma. Am I allowed to mentally subtract 7 off my age so I can feel less pathetic about my current place in life? I certainly feel like 7 years hasn't passed. It's like I was mentally trapped in a time capsule and I couldn't grow until I moved that pile of baggage off of me. I'm doing a lot better now but I also feel so stupid and behind compared to my peers. I'm experienced in things healthy people rarely need or deal with. I'm inexperienced in all the typical daily things normal people need to integrate in society. I feel so so pathetic and behind.
Transference at work with my boss,2,mkrd7a,3,"I think I might be in a bit of an emotional flashback right now, so I'm not at my most clearheaded and may edit later for greater clarity. My dad was abusive and we're estranged. I'm currently working at a small independent pharmacy as a technician and have been for several months. I'm having trouble with what I'm pretty sure is transference re: my dad and my boss. My boss is very nice, almost a pushover, but that doesn't help because for the first time in years I'm working in close quarters with a male authority figure (I have literally always had trouble with those). I'm trying to put what's happening into words and the best that I can do is that I view/interpret everything he says and does through the lens of what I would think if my dad said or did it, and I'm hyperaware of his moods and always second-guessing what he thinks of me. It doesn't help that, being so nice, he doesn't say what he thinks the way I've gotten used to in more assertive cultures.

Also, I've been taking too make sick days, like one every 2-3 weeks. It's because of my depression and CPTSD tbh, which really frustrates me because I feel like I should be able to just function like a normal person, but apparently I can't. I called out sick today and for hours I've been analyzing my boss's (admittedly somewhat weird) reaction, and I'm afraid of getting fired. I'm afraid that he's been picking up on hostility from me and thinks it's weird.

I've known this transference thing was going to be a problem for weeks now. I tried to ignore it, I didn't want to acknowledge it because I didn't want it to be true and I genuinely did not have time. But predictably it's built up to calling out sick and EFs. I really wish I could talk to my old therapist, but it's been a couple of years and my insurance doesn't cover her anymore."
DAE go long periods of time unable to talk to anyone except their family where the abuse originated?,2,mkr34n,1,"I often struggle with not being able to keep in contact with friends except for my boyfriend, mother who was neglectful and continues to use me as an emotional dumping ground, sister and brother. I continue to stay in contact because I have guilt/pity for their struggles and still feel like I can help them somehow.  My sister is also going through a traumatic time and it's affecting everybody.

But I feel like I have no life of my own. I recently suspect that I have Asperger's and feel like I have no support except for my boyfriend, and I feel so alone in this. Am I a bad person for distancing myself from my family's sruggles? How could I call myself a good sister or daughter in that case? Is getting the support I never had from a family just a dream?   I would really appreciate anybody else's experience. Thanks."
DAE not willing to try?,1,mkvtei,3,"I'm a mess & I won't go into details about how messed up i am in every aspect of my life.

The worst part is I'm not willing to try, I don't feel like trying to ""heal"" or ""overcome my depression/anxiety"" and all the crap out there (no offense, this is just me). 

Before I used to read articles and try to apply what's on there, but lately I have completely given up and I won't even try to read or watch a how to video on youtube. 

I hate everything, music? I hate. Youtube videos? I hate them. Reddit? I hate it.

Why? because I feel I'm being manipulated to use the services, there's always this cool thing that you must watch/read. And yes here I am using reddit, But this is probably the only way to interact with people I can relate to."
People who don't understand what it means to grow up abused and marginalized get my blood boiling sometimes,161,mk0h43,13,"So, I'm trans, gay, the child of a migrant and I grew up with an abusive family. I feel like some people I encounter have got no idea what that meant for me growing up and the consequences of that in my day to day life. Those same people seem to have no consideration for people with mental health struggles or disabilities, either. They treat depression like something that happens to other people and claim to be ""all about positivity"", which I see as toxic positivity, really, and at worst something like eugenics, when they eye you with suspicion if you're taking meds for anything. 

I feel like I shouldn't tell them that they're lucky to have lived the way they did so far, but in truth I feel that way. Good for them they were spared the stuff that happened to me. Good for them they didn't struggle with CPTSD symptoms because of it. Good. For. Them. I just can't not get angry when they act like having trauma symptoms after traumatic things happening to you is this terrible, pathological thing. No. It's a result of actual unfairness and violence. I want them to get that into their head and to stop bothering me with their ideas of a perfect should-be world that never existed for me."
I feel like I may be experiencing an emotional flashback but I am unsure (TW: brief mention of passive suicial ideation),2,mkpl68,1,"I am struggling hardcore. A few weeks ago I had a dream where I was a kid living in my parents' house again, and since then, it has unclocked a whole entire wave of memories and emotions, and I have essentially been rendered useless. I can't go to work, I can't do my coursework, and I am failing at everything. I am having terrible sleep disturbances and am feeling both extremely anxious and so depressed at the same time. I am diagnosed with bipolar I in addition to C-PTSD but this is different than my typical bipolar symptoms (although those don't help). I just don't know what to do right now. I'm feeling as though I've backed mysef into the edge of a cliff and that I'm so far gone that the only logical solution would be to jump because it feels like there's no solution to the current situation. I think everyone is tired from my bullshit, i.e., late assignments and calling out of work. I feel as though the forgiveness has run out and I've disappointed everyone for the last time. Not even sure what kind of advice I'm looking for, maybe just for support and a possible step in the right direction?"
haha I had a trauma dream and woke up early in the morning in a panic and couldn’t fall back asleep,3,mkmjhr,2,
Is it possible that my sexuality was altered by unresolved childhood trauma?,5,mkhybw,5,"I'm not intending on getting into details. Either way, I'm a 27 year old man, I've dated a few women before and for as long as I can remember, I've been attracted to women. Or at least I thought I was. Recently I met a man who made me question everything about myself, starting with my sexuality and ending with my sanity. I thought I figured out what happened to me as a kid and that I never let it affect me, but I'm not entirely sure anymore. For the first time I feel like I'm truly and properly attracted to someone. This is nothing like my previous interests in women. That's why I'm wondering if this could be symptoms of my unfortunate childhood events."
Book,3,mkm9t0,2,"Has anyone read the body keeps the score ? It’s a great book , it’s just A lot of sad stories to take in , it’s taken me forever to read it . I know he recommends body work like yoga and emdr has anyone tried them and noticed a difference ?"
I have been patiently awaiting my peace for 13 years.,8,mkgl5n,2,"I don't think it will ever come. I've dreamt of having a normal life since I was 9, and despite doing everything correct and in my power I'll never get the chance. I don't think you can come back from childhood neglect & abuse, getting raped, be in an abusive relationship for 2 years, have a traumatizing heart surgery & developing a lifelong disabling chronic illness. There's no fucking way, and there's no hope with no support system. People run from me because of how damaged I am. There is no future to look forward to, and it's never been worth it.
I long for peace and stability, but some people just don't get a good hand."
I just really need to be held right now.,8,mkh6tl,5,"I feel it in such an overwhelming way I couldn't focus on anything lately. I just want someone to hold me. Not just a casual hug - a really long, intense cuddle.

But there's no one, and nothing.

What the hell do I do?"
Feeling kinda devastated and I don’t understand it,3,mkm7eg,2,"My therapist of a year and a half recently told me she has to change services and she’ll no longer be able to treat me once the month is over. I feel so confused internally, ever since she told me I’ve noticed I’ve been switching between sobbing, anger, anxiety and numbness. I’m not even that much of a crier but idk I just feel really hurt, I’m not sure if I should express myself to her about her leaving idk I want things to be easier for her. Why is this affecting me so much?"
How do you know you were abused if you don't remember it?,11,mket6k,12,"If can't recall any specific events, or just a few minor ones, how can you know you were abused?"
"My Father Tried Getting Me To Talk To Him, HELP",2,mkoez6,1,"Hi again, its your friendly neighbourhood twpsyn. Once again I apologise for any grammar or spelling

I don't know if I have CPTSD I am trying to see somone to get diagnosis but I have to go through a counsellor first. If that means I don't belong her please let me know. I did go through trauma from my fathers possible abuse (I say possible as I don't like using that word) 

On to the story

Today my younger sibling came over after work. I was out walking my dog (I would Pay the dog tax but I'm paranoid someone might recognise him) at the time. I thought I would have enough time to do the length of the walk and be back inside safely before my 'father' (I put it like that as I starting to believe he doesn't deserve that title) arrived.

This was not just for my sake but the dogs, he basically said he wanted nothing to do with this dog when the dog turned 9. I didn't want to face this man or let my dog see him and get confused.

I was nearly back maybe 100m from my door as the crow flies (I was delayed by an aggressive dog who I had to back up to avoid) when he is driving towards me. He pulls over and tries to talk to me, I ignore him and keep walking not acknowledging him, as he keeps calling my name.

My heart was racing so much I felt like it would beat out of my chest. I was scared he would turn the car around and come after me. He has a temper and gets physical, I thought he would come after me and catch hold of me again.

Now I'm worried I am being too harsh, I haven't spoken to this man since august of last year. Also it's my mothers birthday and I'm scared I may have caused something that will ruin her day if he tries to turn my siblings into fling monkeys.

I need help to know if I did the right thing, or if I should have 'manned up' for lack of a better phrase and been polite or something"
I know this is gonna disappear anyways so it doesn’t matter,16,mkcbsp,11,"All I can think about is either relapsing or planning a final exit.

Things have been too hard. Sobriety isn’t worth this. I want out of my brain/body.

When is shit going to get better. I work so hard for nothing."
"Apparently, All of My Problems Are Trauma Related? TW - sui, hallucinations",2,mkn98y,1,"I have auditory and visual hallucinations constantly, I cannot speak because my brain is confused and racing, I cannot live like this anymore. 

I thought I had a psychotic disorder but my therapist and psychiatrist say it's all trauma-related but I don't know. I have a ""normal"" amount of trauma response otherwise. It's just confusing to have so many symptoms and for none of them to be fully addressed. No one addresses my hallucinations or thought confusion head-on."
Shows/movies with loving families and positive stories from friends about their families are so hard for me to be around.,22,mkalbu,5,"Makes me seem just like an unpleasant bitch, especially to my boyfriend. 

I hardly want to watch anything positive ESPECIALLLLY if it involves a loving family. 

Just a reminder of how life wasn’t for me and it’s hard to explain but it just makes me feel like shit most of the time. Sometimes I make fun of the movie and/or say “ew” or “cringe” at normal things too. Horror movies and documentaries have become my “safe movies”. 

Then when anyone says happy stories about their family, or literally like, any story that isn’t fucked up sad, it makes me so uncomfortable. 

I get anxious and shut down. My facial expression gets immediately plain and straight and sad. People just think I’m bored with what they’re saying or rude. My bf thinks I hate him. 

wack stuff man jus trying 2 live my life and get triggered so easy"
DAE have an eating disorder that has become a coping mechanism?,14,mkdapp,3,"It all started off with just feeling blah about my body. 
Bulimia followed me all these years. 

Ah, I see. Anorexia has entered the chat. 

Oh dear.

I only care how I look because it means my suffering has a benefit. If I restrict, I’m safe. I don’t lose control. I’m a size that means I can escape if I need to. People treat me better. 

If I gain it back, then I’m abusable again. 

I can’t look at a number on the scale because it will *throw* me through a loop. Even if it’s one that would make me.... “happy”?  I would feel like the scale is broken. Lying. If I’m that number, why is my life not nice? Why isn’t the world spinning the way I want it to? 

Where’s the control if I’m not working towards something? 

I know this doesn’t end well. I am trying hard to work against it but I haven’t found many resources for CPTSD and eating disorders. Mine are intensely linked and im scared that even though the disorder hasn’t outright ruined me yet, it will. I know it will. The highs always end, even with starvation and the fleeting control

And then I hate people looking at me lol

Can you guess why 

Fuck my life"
Help Please,3,mkk53n,1,"TW: Suicide/Family Trauma



I have trauma associated with a person in my life taking his own life by suicide. I’m worried that my aunt who is not doing well financially plans to take herself into the Smokey Mountains and do something similar. There is really nothing I can do to stop it.

I personally believe it is someone’s choice to do that and I can do what I can to let them know I want them to stay around but at this point it might be too little too late. 

I don’t have a strong relationship with her but I care about her deeply and my heart is still very tender from the last loss I experienced. It is going to difficult to function over the next few days/weeks. Any suggestions on self-care or getting through work and getting other adulting done. 

**I also have a pretty limited support network myself. 

Any advice and encouragement would be helpful. I’m very grateful for the existence of this room.

"My boyfriend triggers me, how would you deal?",3,mkjw6h,2,"Okay, so before anyone says that I should remove myself from the trigger I'll explain a bit of background.

My bf doesn't consider himself to suffer from CPTSD, but he had a really rough time growing up and is the first person I felt saw me for what I was. He saw I was hurt rather than just a nightmare, you know? My bf has a problem with his collarbone which started when he was 11ish, he's had multiple operations and has caused him extreme pain since. His dad didn't get him help for it for a long time and kind of made him feel like a problem. Its much better now than it was and it comes from time to time rather than being constant. 

My issue is that his shoulder has been hurting for a couple of months now and the way it makes him behave is a massive trigger for me. For a while he said it was me causing him to be distant bit then about 2 weeks ago he said it was his shoulder. I've been trying to help where I can but his pain makes him short with me sometimes, and it's selfish but I just want him to give me a big hug sometimes and it's hard bc he's in pain. Sometimes I just need someone to laugh at the bad joke I made bc it look me 5 mins to be able to say anything. I need to be able to cry but he doesn't seem to accept it , he needs positivity bc of the pain but I also have stuff going on. 

We're arguing all the time and I know we're both hurt neglected kids who years later don't know how to cope with things. I also know this will pass as it has before. It's just so hard with lockdown and everything to protect my head when this happens. I feel constantly triggered and literally embarrassed of the amount of times I tell him I'm triggered but I just don't know what to do for the best.

I feel like I was just starting to get better and now I have nothing left at all. My home doesn't feel like somewhere I can relax and it's so tiring bc I lived like this and then without a home staying on sofas for a long time. On the other hand my bf is the only person who stayed around, he has never abandoned me even at my worst. 

Sorry if this is written badly, disassociation makes me selfish and stuff idk. If anyone could advise me I would really appreciate it. I don't have many people around me atm."
How do I stop feeling like a bad person after a minor mishap?,1,mkrfa4,1,"This was posted in like two others places but its kinda still really bothering me and maybe getting worse? Altho this post in particular contains extra info I feel is relevant but am too scared to post in other places because hnnn yea even tho thats stupid because people can check my profile on this shit? I just feel... really dumb and close to crying rn.  I've been having a really  fucking hard time with making progress lately and have been dissociated a lot but still trying to work thru my shit  regardless to see if that helps? Anyways last night I posted an intro in a place I thought my be good for me. I forgot some of the rules because I've been so out of it it's not even funny anymore not only that I feel like I have to justify my entire life all the fucking time which really messes with my ability to just simply stfu and follow rules. The mods contacted me and said ""yo gotta go change your intro my guy, heres some rules to remember, edit this and then get back to us so we can take it off pause :)"". I put down that theres stuff on my link that people might take the wrong way, well because I age regress really badly sometimes and fucking kinksters make the shit i use to help cope into something worse then it is and that makes me upset, anyways that means its gotta be nsfw and against the rules right? so took that out and i just feel like a really bad person who doesnt listen and like i should just stop attempting an just leave that place alone because maybe im not a good place actually? i feel like panicky and sick to my stomach like i really badly fucked up even tho its prolly fine and im NOT having a good time and how the fuck to i combat the feeling of just... all this shit. sorry if that doesnt make sense im just... hhhhh"

I fear I will return to using drugs,1,mkqhbr,6,"I am a chronic avoider of feelings and internal experience. Recently I’ve been forced to confront my feelings and inner world in a way that has me feeling extremely overwhelmed and out of control most of the time. I desperately want to go back to avoiding all this. Sometimes I do, by going to sleep. I’ve been taking a lot of naps when I get so overwhelmed that I cant handle being conscious any longer. I cannot stop self harming in the moment as a means of emotionally regulating even when I’ve sworn it off multiple times, signed safety agreements, promised myself I won’t, etc. 

And now I can’t stop thinking about going back to using drugs and alcohol as a way of coping. I have been sober for 3 months, but I spent 2 of those months inpatient. I know it is bad for me to use drugs/alcohol to avoid and won’t help long term, but I keep wanting to do it anyways and think about the relief it would give me. I am really scared I will give in to the desire even once and quickly return to active addiction. I don’t know how to cope with this and stop myself from doing it other than just “white knuckling” through this every hour of every day. I desperately need treatment for my psychological issues but I’m not getting it quickly or consistently enough in an outpatient setting. 

Can anyone relate? Has anyone been through this? Is there any other way to cope other than just white knuckling? Do I need to return to inpatient if I can’t stop myself from self harming and using drugs?"
What was this? Not a flashback as I wasn’t there.,4,mkha35,5,"For a couple weeks now I’ve been going through the works learning about cptsd and childhood trauma. Only in the past couple of weeks have I accepted that my 28 years on earth have been difficult because of my very early years and emotional neglect. My 30 year old brother too. Last night after having a couple of drinks, joints and an edible with my best friends, I was thrown into what felt like a visual flashback or something? I got this impending sense of doom and the strongest feeling in my stomach and it took my breath away. I could see my older brother as a very young baby crying out knowing no one was going to come for him. It absolutely destroyed me. Even now sober I’m crying as I type. I have never felt empathy that deeply before and it really scared me tbh. Has anyone else had anything similar? Is this part of healing?"
Starting a book club for How to do the work by Nicole LePera,0,mkpyv4,4,"\[ I am not sure if this is allowed mods, please let me know?\]

Hello everybody! My name is Nikki, I go by ""Ratagamic"" online. I recently purchased How to do the work by Nicole Lepera who also goes by ""The.holistic.psychologist"" on Instagram! Her posts encouraged me to enter my healing process and I am very excited to start reading her book. I would love however to be able to share my insights with other healers and hear their perspectives chapter by chapter!

If you are interested please send me a DM, with your name, if you have a copy of the book, and what days you might be available to hop on a discord call for two hours + maybe a spare 30mins  (with your respective time zone).

I am planning to keep this a small group with around 5-6 people at most!"
medication decision,2,mkkv4a,2,"Between CPTSD and Overtraining syndrome I’m 3 years of not healing. Considering SSRI. 

Symptoms:

1. Insomnia - fall asleep can’t stay asleep but feel sick or nauseous/dizzy not well rested 
2. Tinnitus 
3. Fatigue - incapable of working out without sympathetic system going on fire
4. Despair/Hopeless/Anxiety
5. GI - constipation or urge to go to the bathroom when driving or leaving home and causing anxiety 

Worries about SSRI:

1. Loss of erections
2. Worsened insomnia
3. Brain zaps 
4. Withdrawal 

My goal is 6-12 month of treatment since this was from acute trauma and overtraining. 

Prozac, Trintellix, Lexapro?"
DAE get triggered by generic anger management advice?,15,mkaltr,3,"For context, I still live with my family.

I've been holding in anger my whole life because anytime I DID show even the slightest bit of it, I'd get called a ""dumb bitch"" or get lectured about how I need to learn how to control myself, even though I was like fucking 10 years old. I was never simply asked ""what's wrong?"" Even to this day, I get passive aggressive texts from my family members everytime I hit something (like my bed) to release anger. It's gotten to the point where I just keep it all in until it eventually makes me implode on myself and I start crying (not in a good, releasing, kind of way, but in a ""this is my last option"" and it doesn't feel good at all way). I'm terrified of showing anger, but it really want to.

Obviously, we should NOT be destroying property, hitting people, or insulting people, at least those who don't deserve it, but I think that if you're really being pushed over the edge and being treated unfairly, ESPECIALLY if you're mad about your WHOLE LIFE, it is perfectly justifiable to bang your fist on a table and yell ""FUCK,"" without feeling the need to explain yourself. The fact that I physically cannot eject negative energy out into space without feeling like a crazy person is UNHEALTHY. I feel this same way about crying in front of people. It makes me feel like I'm being manipulative, even though when I see other people crying or angry, I take their emotions seriously.

This is why the generic anger management advice of taking ""deep breaths"" counting to ten, or thinking of something happy just doesn't work. These tips are for BEFORE you really get angry, and are more for trivial, everyday problems. But when I'm REALLY pissed and have just about fuckin had it, trying these management strategies just feels like I'm repressing anger that needs to come out, because it DOES need to come out. So hearing advice like this is extremely triggering and gaslighting for me. This is why searching for a good therapist is stressful. I REALLY don't want to hear this kind of advice come out of another person's mouth ever again.

I know that r/CPTSDfightmode is a thing, and it's a wonderful subreddit, but I don't quite resonate with most of the posts there. This is more of a long-term repressed kind of anger, it's not anger that I use to defend myself from traumatic situations (I'm a freezer, not a fighter)."
Recovery,29,mk709f,10,"I used to come to this sub years ago and trauma ruled my life, 24/7/365. I'd go to therapy sessions and it would blow me out of the water for a week at a time. I would see other posters here with other interests, commenting on other subs about TV or whatever, and think that they were so much more recovered than I was, since they could even have other interests.

Getting broken up with is triggering me,13,mkbany,7,My boyfriend of three years just broke up with me. He says he just feels like he needs to figure himself out and that he doesn’t want to be in a relationship now. And I just feel so crushed. I’m NC with all of my family. I just finished grad school and I live alone. I am so fucking lonely lately and he’s really the only person I talk to. And it’s all making me realize that I really have such little self worth because no one ever cared for me as a child so I don’t know how to care for myself now that he’s gone.
Can I even say I have cptsd?,8,mkcbeh,7,"Diagnosed with OCD and anxiety. When I brought up to my psychiatrist that I think I may actually have ptsd she just said that you get ptsd from things that happened recently (which I think is simply incorrect?) and then suggested to work things out in therapy. (I already am on lexapro, so I suppose it’s not like she could do much). 

My therapist for some reason never uses the word “trauma”. I started going to her for OCD and later she suggested than my issues my actually be more from childhood and that’s what causing worsening anxiety and stuff and that we need to focus on that. (Which I agree). 

I had absolutely shitty childhood and experience all the symptoms from what I have read about cptsd. I even bought some book about recovering from cptsd and I feel extremely validated in my experience.

But then I start self doubting and thinking that I’m just making it all up and I have no trauma or anything. I feel so ducking shitty."
My childhood pictures are only further proving my trauma,25,mk5mal,8,"tw: religious & physical abuse 

I lived in my home country for the first 5 years of my life, away from my father, who was abroad at the time. Those were probably the most blissful times of my life, the last few years before I'd be awoken with severe beatings to finish up my school work or thrown around because I wasnt 'covering up' well at school or have my hair pulled or screamed so loudly almost every single day if I dare talked back at my father. In every one of these pictures, I'm smiling so wide with all my teeth showing. I was genuinely so happy. 

And then theres the photo albums with pictures after we had moved abroad with my father from ages  6 to 11 - I'd have a straight face, no emotions.  I look so distracted, sometimes even sad. This makes me heartbroken bc I know it was around this time I'd started maladaptive daydreaming to cope with the abuse. I had started completely numbing and dissociating myself from reality and these pictures are proof of all the trauma I'd gone through 

It's like I cant make eye contact with the little girl in either of these pictures. I'm mourning for the happy little child, who couldnt see any of the abuse coming and the emotionless kid who's still got a lot more abuse to endure. It hurts so much."

Ace Ventura Pet Detective did NOT age well.,60,mjzy9q,13,"Trigger Warning : vague mention of abuse of trans person

So I am a white cis-het person in America and I recognize the massive privilege that affords me and the massive blind spots it leaves me with.

I saw Disclosure on Netflix this week.  (I freaking love Laverne Cox!)

In the documentary, they showed a scene from Ace Ventura Pet Detective where a female presenting character is outed as biologically male by Jim Carey's character in a manner I can only describe as sexual assault.  The reaction of all the men in the scene to this outing was utter revulsion.

I saw this movie as a little kid and my friends and I quoted things from it and thought Jim Carey's over the top humor was hilarious.  

Revisiting this scene in Disclosure as an adult has left me sick to my stomach.  No human being deserves to be treated that way.  This character was the villian and their crime was theft, using sexual violence as punishment to theft is inexcusable.  Then to package it as entertainment, sending a message to a already vulnerable community that you are disgusting and unlovable?!  To make a person or a category of people feel that way is the real disgusting act.

I know that there are many LGBT members of this sub.  Having the courage to live their authentic selves in this world is often very traumatizing.

I want to help make this world a safe place for everyone to live and love in the way that they desire.

And seriously, fuck that movie!"
"DAE remember things that happened, only to forget them again?",34,mk3gjx,6,"I’ve noticed this issue coming up. Sometimes when I’m having a conversation, or reading something, or maybe waking up from a dream, I will remember something very clearly from my childhood that is upsetting. It can be an event or possibly a dynamic between me and someone else.

For example, my mom has mellowed out over the years and I have a hard time thinking of her in a negative way, tend to find excuses for her or blame myself for things. Like, I *know* on some level she did some messed up stuff, but because of how she is now I will give her the benefit of the doubt and think, well, maybe I was just really difficult to handle and she tried her best. A few weeks ago I woke up from a dream that reminded me how things *actually* were back then, and how they were definitely not okay, very abusive, etc. But now, I can’t remember what I remembered. I know what I remembered was legitimate, but it’s totally gone now. 

This has happened quite a few times now with different things and I’m wondering if it’s something anyone else has dealt with."
I really don’t like SA Awareness Month,58,mjzhws,11,"So, April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. I know this because I’m constantly bombarded with Facebook posts, Instagram stories and infographics and cartoons and Snapchat stories about the fact that it is Sexual Assault Awareness Month. 

While I think that the overall message behind this month is, for the most part, positive and can help to make some survivors feel less alone... I just hate it because I find it so triggering to constantly be reminded of exactly what I’m trying to forget.

Does anyone else feel the same way?"

A poem about moving out of the home you were abused in,8,mkb0eo,7,"i feel so fucked up inside 

having dreams where i’m paralyzed 

and mother couldn’t care less

whether i’m there or not and i’m a mess

tell people how you really feel

they’ll run away and take the wheel

no one cares about you like yourself

a book is over, going on the shelf

all and all you’ll feel alone

mothers sitting on her thrown

she has what she wants and that’s it

doesn’t matter if i don’t fit

walking out and falling apart

hoping that i get a fresh start 

but when things go wrong i come crashing down

all alone no one hears a sound 

try to connect but it isn’t there

moving on, im numb and stare

all of this feels like a dream 

but i can’t wake up, i can’t scream

touch the wall, am i awake? 

move my legs for safety’s sake 

empty bottles on the table

i am floating, i am unstable 

eyes are tired from all the crying 

i am fine, i am lying 

feeling unwanted, feeling lost

bring others up, but at what cost?

at the end of the day it doesn’t matter

3 years later and i didn’t have her

wanted love but had to get out

best for me without a doubt 

have to take each day slow

but one thing happens and i go low 

so i come home, head on her chest

eyes are swollen, it’s time to rest."
My husband doesn’t have the energy anymore,10,mka131,17,"I’ve come to the realization that I do suffer from cptsd almost at the same time that my husband told me he is considering divorce and wants a second opinion (marriage counselor).
We’ve both put each other through a lot and even though I’ve seen a couple of therapists I stopped on January because of economic reasons and because it wasn’t really helping.

Now I am trying to give him space, understanding that I do stress him out and I’m reading about cptsd, working one work book, Woebot, I also wrote to a few therapists for both individual and couple therapy (I haven’t gotten any response yet) but he just told me he does not have the energy to climb that mountain, with tears running down his face. I didn’t cry, I calmly said that I really don’t expect him to do nothing, just to let me work on myself, and with time and space maybe things will get better, besides therapy and that I see now how necessary it is for me to get help and that I am regretful for not doing it early.

I am hopeful, maybe I’m in denial, that this breakthrough moment that I’ve been going for the past week will be the definite and that I will learn to love myself, whoever I find myself to be, to understand that he is not abandoning me whenever he has to go somewhere without me, that I can validate myself and work on my self esteem but I really don’t want to lose him. The thought of having separate lives, the thought of separating from my daughter, it breaks my heart deeply.

Has anybody... gone through this and saved their marriage? 

I wish I knew what to do."
Constantly struggling to fall asleep 😫,5,mkc51l,5,"One of my main symptoms from my CPTSD is insomnia and it's been steadily getting worse the past few weeks. I've been approved to use medicinal marijuana, and have been using on nights I can't fall asleep, but still struggle with sleep. I've also tried guided sleep meditations with little success. It's at a point where I'm getting very little sleep and am often not falling asleep until around 1 or 2am at the earliest when I have to wake up at 6 for work. In other words, I'm exhausted all the time. 
I was wondering if any of you may have some advice on what else I could do to help ease my racing thoughts so I can alleviate my insomnia and get some very much needed rest."
"An adult screaming “I will not accept unacceptable behavior” at you, isn’t what AA intended",148,mjtpvx,42,"Just in case anyone else needed to hear this today. 

My fam was lead by my recovering alcoholic father, who has been sober but not healthy for my existence. His sobriety was constantly talked about and lauded, as he regularly spun off into violent rages. My mom was a regular at al anon. I think they’re both narcissists? 

Neither seemed to really apply the ideology to themselves, but boy did they sure feel good about using those “healthy” tools to keep us in line. 

Lately it’s all been clicking together - the ways they held themselves up as wonderful, dedicated parents. How “difficult” of a child I was (insert eye roll here). I look back and I see four children sitting around the dinner table, two of them adult sized and terrorizing the smaller ones.

"Guy supposedly loved me and made me feel safe after serious trauma, just to use and abandon me",7,mkav8f,8,"TW: mention of suicide

This is long as FUCK and I don’t expect anybody to read it, which is okay. Just getting my thoughts out kinda helps. 

I’ve been crying for days. I first met this guy in 2014.. we met at a concert and both made out and fought pretty much right after meeting the same night. I wasn’t expecting to see or talk to him ever again, although we did have a strong connection. My long term relationship I absolutely hated ended violently in January, so I’m quite vulnerable. 

We didn’t see each other again until the end of 2016, where I became his first love basically. He was my rebound, to be blunt.. I was staying with him a lot.. then I got back with my ex but continued to have a fling with him. Then he got hit by a train and not really expected to live and I was the only person to stay by his side at the hospital.. he could no longer be intimate, at least at the time and that was kind of the basis of our friendship so we agreed to go our separate ways. We had an ugly falling out.. before I attempted suicide the first time, I reached out to him because I wanted to make amends with him before I made the decision to attempt suicide. It didn’t go over well.

Fast forward to 2021.. a week ago he “found me” online after searching for me for a long time apparently, and I went to his place the next day to reunite. Well he decides he “loves me”, is “in love with me” and I’m “the one”. (I wanna add he first mentioned loving me before I even came over). He was so affectionate and loving and acted like no guy has ever acted towards me before. He passed me off as his girlfriend to all his close friends and family. He made me feel safe and like able to enjoy sex again and rediscover myself in that way without any pressure or safety concerns.. I felt like I was living in a prison being so afraid of sex prior to being with him again. I feel like I can live life again in a way.

This guy is a huge drug addict who basically lives in a drug house but I more or less looked past it and stayed there (kinda like in 2016 but it’s worse now).. I got pissed at him and walked out without saying bye which caused bad feelings. I wanted to try continue our friends with benefits situation (he wants a relationship, I don’t) and now he has excuses for not putting any effort in or talking to me (such as his main dealer went to jail and he was worried he was going to jail too) and like busy with that but it’s complete bullshit that he’s too busy to talk or see me cause of that. 

I just feel totally used, manipulated, lied to and a million other things. Yet I STILL care about this guy and feel like I love him as well.. although I refused to say it back cause I didn’t want a relationship or monogamy and I was worried it would mess with him. I feel like I’m 18 again when we first met (we’re 25 now) and feel like I’m hooked on getting relive the times that were a little more innocent again. I’m still crying over him and i hate it. He’ll probably come around again and just rinse repeat cycle. I don’t think he even knows what’s going on cause of all his drug use.

I KNOW what everyone’s gonna say, I already know.. I know I shouldn’t be involved with a drug addict who basically totally fooled me and lied about loving me. My aunt who I’m very close to is being judgmental as fuck and like guilt tripping me. I literally canceled plans with my best friend for an occasion I was really excited about last night cause of my misery. I stopped eating and just not in a good place.. I started to think some very dark thoughts yesterday and today’s been hard but my headspace isn’t quite as bad. I’m going to attempt to shower sometime tonight which I haven’t done in a while. :/

TL;DR former friend/lover from the past re-entered my life, helped me recover from my fear of intimacy.. told me he loved me and I was the one repeatedly.. now he basically stopped trying or giving a fuck and making excuses after I stayed with him a few days. I’m miserable over it and keep crying. 

Just needed to vent.. thank you so much to anybody who read this."
is depression a symptom/a part of cptsd ?,3,mkew2j,5,is depression a symptom of cptsd or would it be separate ?
I don't know what proud or accomplished is supposed to feel like,18,mk5byf,2,"For the past few years I've been killing it with academic achievements, growing in leaps and bounds, and even got one of the top work placement opportunities that involves a detailed background check.

I feel paralyzed, overwhelmed, like I've said the wrong thing the right way to have 'tricked' my interviewers into thinking better of me than I am. This is the most accomplished I've ever been, except it doesn't /feel/ like anything positive- it sort of feels like danger. Like they're going to find something in my background that disqualifies me (they shouldn't, but that doesn't mean I'm not afraid of that). 

Or that something even bigger and badder will happen to me to punish me for getting a reward/opportunity that I don't really deserve, as a karmic balancing function of the universe.

I would like to over ride this internal constant drive that's telling me ""you've effed up, you can't do this, it's just a matter of time before you drop the ball, they're going to see right through you, everyone hates you, everyone is angry at you, danger is coming"" with whatever proud or accomplished is supposed to feel like, but I don't know what that is. Because I can't do that, I'm stuck and doing a lot of procrastination that's making the negative drive into a self fulfilling prophecy. :("
Cptsd disability,9,mk9dyf,13,Has anyone here ever get disability payments for complex ptsd ? I feel so exhausted by all the trauma and feel like I’m unable to work .
How do I know when I’m overreacting?,10,mk81rz,5,"Would like advice, if anyone has it—wasn’t sure what flair to put here, but I have obsessive thoughts, which is why the anxiety applies.  
  
My whole life (~30 years), one parent frequently punished and shamed me for “overreacting”. I’m in therapy now, and I’ve been able to recognize that I was actually trying to stand up for myself, just not in a way that was comprehensible because I was literally flooded with feelings (emotional literacy is not my strong suit).  
  
I still haven’t found a great way to gauge whether my emotional reactions are valid or not—I’m working on this in therapy—but I’m realizing that sometimes it’s because I’m simultaneously learning what it means to let something go while learning what it means to stand up for myself *and* for others.  
  
I do a lot of amateur work in a field that tends to marginalize folks who are not white, not cisgender, not heterosexual (and more, but I don’t want to ID myself here). I am a queer white person—and it often feels like I have one foot in each pool. Important detail, maybe?: I am in a position of leadership, but we’re small enough that I work alongside everyone most of the time.  
  
Things come up: we are small, we’re underfunded, and things don’t always go our way—ergo, conflict. Some of my colleagues (usually the cishet white ones) will tell me I need to let things go; but when I listen to other colleagues (usually the non-cishet, non-white ones), I hear them saying that the privileged folks aren’t standing up for them.  
  
There’s a lot of nuance here, of course, as these situations are numerous and differing—but I don’t want to be someone who’s making a big deal out of something when it isn’t worth it. The thing is, I’m not only considering if it’s worth it for me; as a leader, I must also considering going to bat for my marginalized colleagues.   
  
Does anybody here have a tool or a series of steps they take to help them decide when to let something go versus when to advocate for or speak up about it? Sometimes “my gut tells me this isn’t right” is all I have to go by, and I just don’t know how to explore further. And many responses can be time-sensitive; so I can’t puzzle it out over a week.  
  
(I’m also taking this to therapy next time I go. I’ve tried to explain it to my therapist in the past, but this is the best I’ve ever worded it in the many months that I’ve been able to identify the dissonance.)"
DAE avoid things you enjoyed as a kid?,4,mkcazl,6,I get nervous just thinking about watching a show I used to watch back then or a movie. Sometimes even music. It feels like anxiety and extreme embarrassment sometimes
"Are there others out there who can’t feel sexual pleasure, a result of CPTSD?",13,mk6xlf,6,"I am a 23 year old woman and mother of one beautiful toddler. As a kid, a teenager, and young adult, I have never experienced an orgasm. Every time I have tried masturbation, it completely turns me off and I feel absolutely nothing. This goes for my partner as well when he tries to please me. Sex does nothing for me and my sex drive is as low as ever because of it. I’ve been to numerous doctors and neurologist and nothing is physically wrong with me. So it has to be mental right?

My childhood was bad. I grew up with a narcissist and emotionally/physically/verbally abusive mother and sister. I was never molested or anything of that nature. My mother never told me she loved me, never called me beautiful. She made sex and masturbation out to be something that was wrong or nasty. She CONSTANTLY slut shamed me while I was still a virgin. Always basically accusing me of being a hoe all while I was virgin in every way possible. She did very intrusive mean things. For example:

When I first hit puberty as an 11 year old, I asked her if I could start shaving my private parts as the excess hair made me itchy down there. She freaked out assuming I was doing it for more promiscuous reasons. One time I got out the shower, she demanded me to remove my towel and stand naked in front of her so she could see if I shaved or not. You can imagine that moment was very uncomfortable and traumatic for me. I told her I was uncomfortable being naked in front of her and she dismissed my feelings completely. This incident happened a couple times. 

Anytime I displayed a sign of confidence in myself, she would immediately shut it down and say I was being “vain” or “full of myself.” She would constantly keep in the house and I never really got have a childhood. My first memory of her as a kid was her holding me up my throat and squeezing while screaming at me. I came home from school one time dressed for “wacky tacky day” and she said I looked like a hoe. Mind you I was only 13 at the time. At 17 she desperately wanted to kick me out and had my dad not been there, she would have succeeded. I could go into more detail but you get the point. I felt a lot of shame growing up but I’ve overcame at the age of 22/23. I no longer feel guilty for loving myself or wanting sex. 

Could my childhood be the reason why after all these years I still can’t experience pleasure? People say sex isn’t everything, but they’ve never had to live without it. It feels like a black hole of sadness in my chest. Everywhere I go I’m reminded about sex. Movies, music etc. 

I try to focus on things I do enjoy in my life, dancing, being outside etc. but no matter what I still have this empty feeling. 

What could it be and how can I solve it? I can’t afford therapy at the moment."

"Small realization, practicing healthier coping mechanisms",3,mkdsxg,1,"Tw: mentions of arguments related to family/spouse, self destructive habits 

The other day I was spending time with my spouse when our conversation turned a bit sour but in retrospect, I didn’t help the cause. It started with my spouse stating I was interrupting him because I got overexcited and wanted to talk. Except I took it much more personally than Id like to admit. 

Im happy I now know what it is that Im experiencing, that him critiquing me talking made me feel like my family was yelling at me that I talk too much, that I ask silly questions or the feeling of them talking over me. I realize I was talking over my partner - but I was doing it aggressively because I often feel like I need to talk over someone just for me to be acknowledged.

After he confronted me, I immediately shut down. I felt like the world was against me, that I was alone and no one understood. Im thankful my partner noticed and talked to me, that he wasn’t mad at me and he knows what Ive been through. He reassured me that Im okay, and that its just something we have to work on together. 

It took me so long to finally be able to see it, that my destructive outbursts had a source. But most importantly, I am so unbelievably thankful to have someone in my life that actually understood and didn’t make me feel worse."
Do you recurring dreams?,15,mk404z,16,I often dream that I am chased by people. Or that they have power over me. I'm mostly alone in these dreams (in the sense that I have no one with me to help me).
What 3 months of diving into my own mental Hell revealed to me,4,mkbx7u,4,"For the last few months, I weaponized my tendency to fixate on things, and made that ""thing"" my recovery. I called upon every ounce of willpower that I could muster and started exerting it on this recovery fixation. 

In my mind, I had years of catching up to do, and I didn't want to lose any more time, friendships, or relationships to my trauma. So I told myself I could do this and completely re-wire my brain through neuroplasticity and sheer willpower and condense 3 years of therapy into 1. (you can probably tell where this is going.) I told myself that it'll at least get me functional enough to not fuck up any more friendships or potential relationships. 

Especially one friendship/semi-romance in particular that had gotten complicated fast. It got unhealthy and painful, and I won't speak for her side of things but I'll say that on my side of things, my trauma started to come out and I started drifting back and forth between narcissistic and codependent defenses in terms of behavior (as I had come to realize, I had been doing for years.) Regardless, I saw where things were heading and all I knew was for once in my life I would do things differently, and walk away before things got abusive/more dysfunctional for either of us, and that maybe that'll open a door in the future for a healthier re-connection.

I started going to therapy 3 times a week between two therapists (and I still am, but I'm about to drop to one therapist 2 times, maybe even 1 time a week but more on that later.)

I removed myself from a romantic situation (the one mentioned above) that was too triggering for me, because it had become unhealthy, too painful and in my mind, if there was any hope for it to work out in the future, I had to get my head right, and get out of her way and give her the time and space to do the same (she also suffers from C-PTSD and if it wasn't for her I'd still be flailing in the dark with no idea as to why I was suffering.) 

I listened to 6 different really eye opening audiobooks, some of which I listened to multiple times just to really soak in the knowledge.

I started finally recognizing and wrapping my head around the extent of my traumatic experiences, and to my surprise, how much of it came from childhood, starting from age 8 to 16.

I started remembering things that happened that I had blocked out, and how not normal those experiences were; how they were traumatic things for a child and young teenager to experience.

I started making the connections as to how those experiences shaped my perceptions and my thought patterns and behaviors.

I started recalling and recognizing times those thought patterns and behaviors cost me friendships, relationships.

I started making amends with whoever I could, and even helped a few people start their own recovery journeys because I recognized the symptoms much like someone recognized them in me and helped me see the truth.

More importantly, I started getting better at recognizing my unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors and interrupting them. I started feeling like I was actually starting to get a handle on things and I noticed myself being a lot less reactive, and I even started ""moving into my feelings"" and allowing myself to feel my feelings instead of just thinking about/intellectualizing them.

Eventually for a few weeks it really started feeling like things were getting better and I started feeling good. 


But nothing could have prepared me for the consequences of the one thing I had dared to challenge...

Time.

You see, I learned something important about how my brain worked. Because I had really started battling my brain by going against my own programming, which is to try to anticipate, predict, assess and manipulate, all because I was traumatized to rely on those things to create a sense of safety and conditioned to believe that to survive, I had to exercise *perfect* and sound judgement or I would be hurt or punished... Thanks mainly to my father, as well as elementary school and middle school experiences. 

Growing up, I was never given a margin of error, a mistake was never just a mistake, there were no explanations, or at best they were fear based explanations if I got one at all. Most of the time it was straight to punishment... And the punishment ranged from humiliation and bullying, to verbal and physical abuse. 

So when I started going against my programming, I only felt okay about it at first because I hadn't factored in time.

I didn't anticipate that the longer I went against my protective instincts, dysfunctional as they may be, that my brain would inevitably start fighting back, hard, because the danger signals would get louder and louder, because as far as my brain was concerned, I had completely disarmed myself and that was a big no-no. 

So now I'm three months in, two months specifically since I removed myself from the situation I mentioned in the beginning, arguably the very thing that started this whole journey for me...

And let me tell you. It's been really, really hard. Because I've been fighting so hard to ignore all these conditioned responses and impulses, feeling like my brain is on fire, hoping that soon enough the new neural pathways will form and bake into my brain and I'll start to feel okay with not knowing what's going to happen next, if I made the right decision by walking away from that situation, what she's gonna do, if I misjudged her or not... Because my brain is desperately screaming at me to slap a label on her, to make a judgement, to decide if she's safe or dangerous, so I can either continue to hope we'll reconnect one day, or block her and actively try to move on. God knows I've fought the urge to reach out just as often as the urge to block/burn the bridge.

But I've done neither of those things. And for me, that's real progress. The truth is, I really did learn a lot and make a lot of progress in just a short amount of time. 

But I also made things a lot harder for myself, and I'm absolutely exhausted. By stripping my brain of my trauma based defenses in such a short amount of time, and not giving myself time to figure out and integrate the healthy defenses, I created a much harder environment for myself that has been tormenting and heavy, where the best I can do in place of the unhealthy things is ""nothing"" and that in itself provokes a fear response because I still feel unprotected. It got so bad, I started losing my will to live because I started feeling pure agony. Using up every ounce of my willpower to keep myself from imploding or acting out one way or another. 

I didn't have to do this to myself. 

I stopped listening to audiobooks on trauma and self-help, and I'm about to reduce my therapy sessions to 1-2 times a week. 

I was humbled and forced to accept that this whole thing was just another way my trauma had manifested, just a clever way for me to try to feel a sense of control over a situation that frankly, had broken my heart. 

There are no shortcuts. There are no tricks. You can't outsmart your symptoms, you can't ignore the power of time.

 It turns out the best thing you can do for your recovery is to be kind and patient with yourself. Self-compassion really is a key. 

I know there's no profound moral here. I'm sorry if you read this far and this was a waste of time for you, if you already knew all this and if in your mind all I did was make a fool of myself.

But if you're anything like me, if you've ever been hard on yourself, if you've ever been frustrated because you felt you weren't making progress fast enough, that if only you were focused enough, if only you had more resources, that things would be better... If you've ever wondered about any of that... Then take it from me, after finding myself in a rare position to answer those questions from experience and not just hypothetically...

It's okay to take it slow. It's okay to have setbacks. You'll get there when you get there. Just be kind to yourself on the way. Because the people who you think are healing faster than you, the people who seem more focused, more determined? They're not getting there any faster by foregoing kindness and patience for themselves.

Thank you for reading about my journey so far. I hope this helps someone."
Seeking validation from guys?,4,mkbsi4,7,Why do I only feel worthy if a guy loves me? I feel completely worthless if I don’t have a boyfriend or it seems that no guy wants me.
Perfectionism as a defence against others trying to attach their negative feelings to your behaviour,30,mjz9fd,2,"Recently I started listening to Pete Walker's ""The Tao of Fully Feeling: Harvesting Forgiveness out of Blame"" audio book. As I was listening to the part on perfectionism, it didn't seem to explain my main motivation for perfectionism. 

It seems my mother always had a lot of negative emotions in her mind. Generally these emotions were about her life and her behaviour. But sometimes she tried to make them about things I did. Like, recently it seemed she wanted me to feel bad about not buying butter. She didn't need butter or want me to go back and buy some butter. It seemed she only wanted me to feel bad about not buying butter.

My father wasn't like this generally. But when interaction with my mother made him feel bad, he could act similarly. I remember as a child getting upset about her drunk temper tantrums and him telling me I'm as bad as her.

Perfectionism couldn't stop the emotional storm around me, but if the emotions being expressed weren't about me, that hurt less. It was more like unpleasant and annoying than like something that hurt me down to my core.

Ideally I guess negative emotional expressions which aren't about me could be met by support, but it seems impossible to make my mother feel better that way. 

Experiences with bullying probably also reinforced this, making me want to analyze potential expressions before being willing to express them.

BTW I wonder if this coping mechanism leads towards narcissism?"
Does anyone else’s parents say “look what you’re doing to her/him/them” when a sibling yells and you panic?,8,mk6n0z,2,"My parents were telling my brother the chores he had to do, he starts yelling at her, I start panicking, and she points it out and honestly makes it worse. How do you deal with it?"
DAE just kinda wants to watch everything fall apart and burn?,75,mjtgn5,10,"Not everything is related to my traumatic experiences, at least not directly. But does anyone else just feels so vulnerable and under attack like... Constantly. And it's overwhelming and depressing. Much of my trauma does come from deep social and cultural issues. I guess that's the case of the majority of people here. It wasn't an isolated traumatic experience or two. It runs deep and. That's why I'm posting this here. It has to do with cultural trauma.

I don't want to get into details, but this has to do with a few things. One being politics, and I'm just watching my civil rights under threat, my security, even my privacy. There's really nothing I can do about it besides watching people yell ""fake news"" and worry about irrelevant things.

Another thing is the loss of spaces where I used to feel safe and welcome, but now... They have become so toxic.

Everything seems to evolve into some sort of cult mentality. 

When did so many people became so stupid? When did logic, facts, science became offensive?

When did questioning something started meaning that you're offended because you're a snow flake?

At this point, I find the idea of the entire world simply collapsing in ways humanity has never seen before kinda comforting. The idea of near extinction sounds kinda good, for the sake of everything. 

If really is just what we see and there's no god, or if there's something big out there, humanity failed either way."
DAE not really learn much about hygiene stuff from their parents?,682,mji4xn,160,"I've been learning that I don't really know much about hygiene and such because my parents hygiene is... Questionable, to say the least. I'm pretty sure the last year I lived with my parents I could count the number of times my mother bathed on one hand...

Like, I struggle to shower more than once every week or so, partly because I'm exhausted all the time and finding the motivation and such to do it is difficult, but when I do I find that there's shit I don't really know how to deal with. For example, I don't really know how to deal with having a bunch of dead skin, especially on my face and neck. 

And I don't really feel comfortable talking about things like this with people I know, since I often feel like I'm really disgusting to everyone else, and it's just embarrassing being around people a lot of the time even if they're totally unaware and I'm simply being paranoid over everything. (So I usually stay in my room most of the time...)"
Today I’ve Been Pretending to Be Okay Around Others,5,mk8ecn,1,"It’s been an unusual day. I woke up feeling okay. I took a shower out of wanting to do so and not out of frustrated necessity. Some days are like this. Others aren’t.

I went to the park with a friend for a walk. I asked him if he’d like to go because we usually go on Sunday’s. It can be nice to get out of the house. It didn’t turn out as good as I was hoping.

I had a lot of anxiety being there. Usually I’m anxious in public, but it was worse today. I couldn’t think straight. So my responses while talking were boiling down to simple responses, chuckling or laughing to hide the fear, or responding too quick because of fear. If I’m relaxed, I will laugh too if something’s funny to me. Except I’m sure it comes through differently.

There are a number of reasons why this happens. For years as a young adult, teenager, and kid I was disassociated from reality. That’s part of a much larger story related to my trauma. A lot happened to me as a kid and it’d be too much to go into with this post.

When I was 19, I was recording replays of me playing video games with my friend I mentioned earlier. I put those together into highlight videos on YouTube.

When watching those videos, it’s staggering how different I sounded. My responses were extremely short. Like acknowledging what was happening. Or answering a question. Or again a chuckle. I was so disconnected. I sounded drunk all the time. I slurred my words. It’s astounding, and I had no clue until I began coming out of this disassociated stupor.

It seems I can still struggle to focus like this. I shouldn’t be hard on myself about it, because it doesn’t help me. But I do remember my friend would get frustrated over us playing together and me being the way I was for so long. When it was changing, he noticed it quickly. I would say playing together has gotten better because I’m not always so distant anymore. But there are still days like today where I may look like I’m somewhere else. It puts a lot of pressure onto me to try and not be like how I was.

Usually texting and writing is a good avenue for me to express because I have a lot more time and way less pressure to say what I want to say. While I’m not as deep in the disassociation like I used to be, I have a ways to go it seems.

There’s some other stuff that happened today that has been bothering me immensely. I’ve spent most of the day after the walk just in bed. My head is feeling like it’s tearing itself apart sometimes when thinking of things that bother me greatly. I will flip flop between trying to calm myself down and the fear and stress overwhelming me. The trauma’s and memories are causing a war inside my head. I can feel some sort of phantom pain coming from head.

I’ve been through a lot. I seriously hope one day my brain can stop running and running and just… relax. I don’t know how many years of my life have been shaved off from the constant and obsessive thinking I’ve dealt with for most of my life."
Embarrassed about abuse,2,mkdats,1,I got sexually abused by my sister when i was very young Ive never told anyone and dont ever want to i keep imagining that if i did my brother would make fun of me and laugh and ask me to tell him what she did. It sucks that im so embarassed because she gets to live on and never think about it a day of her life. Iwish i could tellsomeone
Abused as a child now I care for my abuser,3,mkb0of,3,In short myself and my siblings experienced an amount of abuse that by today’s standards would have placed us into gov’t care. We’re all grown up now and I have singlehandedly cared for my father the abuser as he’s suffered from a stroke and dementia. A large part or symptom of his dementia is aggression. He will bite kick scratch hit literally anything. I CANNOT seem to disconnect that this is the dementia and that I’m an adult. I’m really losing it.
Theres nothing special about me.,4,mk98gs,5,"Part of how I survived, was by making myself believe my struggles made me stronger and that it made me special in some way. 

It hurts realizing that I’m.... not special. I’m like everyone else only its just harder for me to function day to day. 

And the thought that I was special in any way was all just a lie I told myself."
I'm unable to become an adult because of my childhood trauma making me stuck in the past.,37,mjvqzd,11,"Hello,im here to share my life story and im looking forward to hear yours and how you have dealt with this situation,sorry for any grammar mistakes english is not my first language. 

I don't remember my childhood at all,i only ""remember"" things my mother told me that happened and when i look at my old photos.My memories start from the point when my mom overdosed on sleeping pills and i tried to keep her awake while my sister called an ambulance (i was 10 at the time),i had no idea what was happening at the time.I had to grow up so soon i had no childhood at all. One year later i started noticing what was happening at my home,there was police daily because of my father not wanting to buy food,pay for my clothes or give mom money for her medicine she needed so bad (she has bad mental issues aswell) so they always argued and my father has always beaten her up and then she called the police.(My mother is not capable of working because of her physical state so she cannot leave now or when i was a child).My father is strong alcoholic,egoistic sociopathic person with a god complex and my sister is just like him thats why she has no mental problems whatsoever and she literally supports him.After those things happening i started to isolate myself and entire summer break before my 12th birthday i didn't go outside and i was sleeping once in two days.After the summer break is over i developed DOD and i started to faint at the school because of it.They put me in the hospital for 1 month and checked me as the last thing they made me visit the local psychiatrist,i was diagnosed with ptsd and i started to take antidepressants.Half year later i wasnt capable of leaving my home so my mother called they psychiatrist and then she ordered for me to come to the hospital.I was there for one day and at the other they drove me to psychiatric ward for children very far from my home where i stayed for 3 months after ive left they put me to childcentre until my father was done at the rehab.Then i had the choice to choose if i want to return to my old home or i want to live with my mother in a flat.As an child with alot of friends i didnt want to leave them so i chose to return back home.And from there it went downhill,year after  that i had anorexia,then bulimia and binge eating disorder i started to harm myself and my mental health went completely downhill and my father returned to drinking.As now i am 17 and my mental health is still very not stable but thanks to my loving boyfriend that was my personal therapist for past 2 years i improved atleast a little bit.But i have a big problem that i cannot move on,i cannot think besides my trauma and my traumatic experience and i extremely self sabotage myself,i think i will stay like this forever i am chronic catastrophiser and i fear literally everything. I am planning to move to the school hostel after my 18th birthday but my mother is guilttripping me for leaving her with my father,that this entire thing was my fault because i was born,that she wasted her life in this hell to take care of me and this hell has gotten worse because i chose to return home instead to move to that flat.And i dont know what to do,my mind is completely stuck i want to leave to save myself but aswell i feel bad for my mother but i have no way of helping her to get away from this house.I feel like im still only 12,my mind got stuck at the year where the trauma got worse and i cannot function as normal person i cannot sleep well and then i have problem in waking up early,i cannot find an therapist because my mother taught me that asking for help is shameful and having mental problems is shameful and i should never reveal them..im sorry that it is so long but im looking forward to your responses."
I rarely see anything about other traumas,7,mk5v2f,6,"I always see things about family trauma and childhood trauma everywhere. I have some childhood trauma and one horrible thing that happened to me when I was 6 and my family is wonderful (not so much when I was little). My most traumatizing years were between the ages of 12-20. I know that plenty of people are in the same boat as me but I have never really found anyone who can relate to me on that level and I can never find anything about this online either. I just feel a little left out and alone in this. I know I'm not alone but it kinda feels that way.

P.S. I'm not trying to offend or shame anybody and I'm very sorry if I hurt anyone, I just want to find someone who relates and maybe answer why that's majority of what I see."
DAE struggle preparing for job interviews?,8,mk47qu,10,"Long time lurker here, trying to get into posting because I know there's no one else like this community that will understand what I feel. This bloody disorder sucks. 

So I have an internal interview next week for a job that I'm already doing. My position has been temporary for a while and this interview is basically to make it permanent. There's quite a few temporary staff also doing the same job as me but apparently there's also quite a few permanent roles too. The interview is just 30 mins. All sounds easy enough right? Should be okay for me to get that permanent job, yeah? 

WELL, god knows, cause preparing for this interview is agony.  Today I have compiled lists of questions they might ask me and following that I just broke into a crying fit. I have no auto biographical memory whatsover, so how am I supposed to answer any of the competenecy / 'describe a time when you....' type questions? I keep doubting my identity due to the abuse, so how am I supposed to answer things like 'where do you see yourself in 5 years' and bla bla bla. My inner critic/ my mother's voice is the strongest when it comes to my work/school achievements, so how am I supposed to sell myself to them and tell them 'im good at x,y,z' when I don't believe that most of the time?  It just SUCKS. I know I can do the job, i've being doing it! And i've had nothing but good feedback from all my management/colleagues. BUT NO, my brain has to doubt every single bit of myself. My brain has no useful examples to offer to the contrary because for some reason (which im sure is also trauma related) , I don't remember anything properly anymore!  My brain has to panic just at the notion of the question 'tell us a bit about yourself', because well, I don't know who I am really?!! 

I'm just so tired of having to work around this stupid disorder. It is so bloody frustrating dealing with this. I feel like I keep trying and making progress but then some new obstacle appears that just makes me feel like s\*\*t. It's really really unfair. I'm so tired of working so much harder than neurotypical people for the most basic/simple things.  It sucks and its such a lonely place to be in, because who would understand this really? Neurotypical people have no idea. I'm tired of my whole life just involving fighting against this seemingly undefeatable beast that is C-PTSD, when others just get to actually enjoy their life, lucky them. UGHHHH. 

I just needed to rant, i hope one or a couple of you can related and maybe offer a supportive word? <3"
Emergency allerts on phones,6,mk6lo2,6,"So I was on my phone listening to calming sounds and out of absolutely nowhere the amber alert went off on my phone (I thought I had turned alerts off on my phone for this very reason). I had the biggest panic attack I've had in a long time. I screamed so loud and threw my phone and physically collapsed (I couldn't hold my body up at all). It sounds dramatic but it was SO loud (I had earbuds in) and the phone was vibrating like crazy too all while I was in such a calm and vulnerable state. 

Does anyone else have reactions like this to extreme external stimuli? Like alarm systems or loud random noises? I'm always so hypervigilant but I was actually calmer than usual when this happened (depressed but calm) so it just really freaked me out... just wanted to write this out and talk to others about this because I feel kinda crazy atm. Like that shouldn't have had such a massive effect on me. I understand having C-PTSD makes your nervous system extra sensitive (I also have ASD so that doesn't help) but wow that was a lot even more me. 

💚 

Side note: I tired to change the titled but idk how to lol I spelt ""alerts"" wrong 🤦‍♀️ oh well lol"
I grew up with back pain if standing or seating for more than 30 min.,32,mjvz4y,14,"My parents thought I was faking to get attention and imitate adults... I stopped complaining before primary school started even though the maddening pain. 

I now know that my right leg is 1.5 cm longer than the left and I have scoliosis and Lordosis which explains my pain standing very long (without walking). I grew up thinking that I was weak and my pain enhanced by my nitpicking attitude. That everyone felt pain but only the weak couldn’t cope without complaints."
Middle School messed me up and I lost my highschool years to it.,7,mk54bi,4,"Hi.

Didn't think I fit into the C-PTSD category since I don't have any flashbacks based on all of the senses(touch, smell, hear ,taste, vision), but I read one of the sidebars and I fit the description of too many of the suggested traits. 


So, with that, I'll feel like I can safely post this here. Please forgive me if some of the things I say are silly, but this stuff happened and I can't keep ignoring the fact that it negatively affected me.


I am a teen girl with high functioning autism. I also have adhd. The thing is, nobody knew until 2 summers ago. AFTER middle school. The worst years of my life. I've always loved school. I enjoy talking with everyone and just the general structure. I am a very outgoing person and I'm creative and very imaginative. I'm also accepting and loving. And I still am. But that shit doesn't fly in middle school.


Please don't invalidate my pain by saying *oh it was just middle school, kids are so ~awkward~ at that time*. SHUT UP!!! Please just listen. I need someone, anyone to listen to me so I don't have to feel so alone with my thoughts and memories.

I'm going to tell you everything I can remember so sit back.


I went into middle school and I was so happy to see everyone and to have the opportunity to make friends, express myself, and have a feeling of responsibility. *I had none of those things*. I hugged people. Mistake. Biggest mistake of my fucking life. Middle schoolers are dumb and think hugging=affection=love=relationship=sex. They hated me. They were scared of me. 


*Everytime I stood near someone, they would physical step back*


*Don't touch me*


*Get away from me*


*You're sexually harassing me*


It made me cry. I didn't want to hurt them. I didn't want to sexual harass them(shit, I'm asexual!). I just wanted to show my appreciation. Nope. That's not how any of this works. I know that now. I knew that then. Every time I hear someone say those words I can feel my body phantomly falling down to the ground to cry in a fetal position. That's just what I want to do all the time, I'm so sad and lonely often. To see people running from me or walking away, even if they aren't bothered by me, makes me feel self deprecating and abandoned. I just want to spend time with people, but it always feels like they don't want to be apart of my life.


An awful trigger for me that just makes me want to scream and cry is when people reinforce my hugging behavior. They like to ""throw their friend into harms way"". They laugh to see their friends so uncomfortable with me hugging them. I want to hug but the person I'm hugging isn't happy, and then they hate me. This happens still in my everyday life. I hate it. I just want to explain to people that I have bad trauma from non-consensual hugging, but they won't take me seriously. It hurts so much.


One memory from 6th grade was I was sitting in my language class while the teacher was out of the room when I got too close(wasn't even touching them) to someone. They yelled for someone to grab a ""safe card""(anti bullying and harassment report slip). I ran over and grabbed the slips and threw them in the recycling bin and guarded them with my life, trying to defend myself by explaining I wasn't even hugging or touching anyone. The teacher came back in and made me put the cards back and didn't even address the situation. 


One time a teacher ripped a page out of my hands and threw it in the trash. I was writing my name a bunch of times to try to fill up the page with it. She scolded me for ""wasting paper"". Sorry for engaging in repetitive behavior, I can't fucking stop myself it's so comforting. 


A friend I had(who I will call CM) was a male and I had him in two classes. I also shared lunch with him half of the time. Issue is at this point(a month or two into 6th grade) I was already a social outcast with a terrible urge to hug everyone, and this made people ignore me or be scared/repulsed. I had little friends. So whatever friends I did have I only wanted to be around them and make them gifts and give them hugs. I became clingy. I don't want to be clingy, but I'm insecure. I don't get jealous, I just take any love I receive and hold it close. CM was one of the only friends I had. But there was one issue: his family were car dealers. Seems simple enough, right? This was CM's excuse, he was gone 2-3 days a week. This fucked me up and reinforced my developing abandonment issues. He never told me he would be gone, and would just show up without acknowledging his absence. My lunch was spilt. Because of my schedule, I ate lunch with 6th graders one day and 7th graders the other. CM didn't like me eating lunch with him and his buddies. He said I should sit with my other friends. *Who?* Then, February came. CM tells me not to freak out, but that he'll be gone for a few weeks. Okay. I'll just sit with someone else, I'm sure I can find someone. 


*2 months passed*


2 entire godamn months passed and I hadn't heard a word from him. Finally, he comes back for a few weeks in april. Then he fucking leaves again, doesn't even warn me this time. He doesn't come back until the end of may. We hangout in class and lunch and it's all chill. 


Then the summer comes. Isolation. I didn't have social media. I stopped existing for three months. This is a cycle for every summer. People stop contacting me in the summer. Of course I have social media later on, but I still get ignored then and to this day. If I'm not in front of someone then I don't exist. CM stops talking to me and I figure I just won't bother with him anymore. 

7th grade comes along and the impliment the shittiest system ever: Advisory. Hearing that word sends me spiralling into feelings of inadequacy. Three aspects of advisory bothered me. The basics of advisory is it is a 30 minute class period deticated to lessons about being self motivated, kind to others, making friends, and other bullshit perpetuated as healthy teen interaction, along with fixing missing assignments and goal setting.

*Goal setting*

God how much I hate goal setting. Yes, I am aware of short/long term goals in my own life. But they are simple things like ""make a blanket"" or ""become a tattoo artist"" but *no. You can do better.* Fuck. You. I am trying my godamn best and I don't need to level to your standards. Oh wait, did I tell you this class is GRADED? Oh and these goals, these *SMART goals* had to be acidemic. Holy shit, can I just pass? I want to pass, can I just pass? *No, what do you do to pass? Let's get those c's up to b's* NO!!!!! Leave me alone!!!! I'M TRYING MY GODAMN BEST!!!! I don't want to do missing work, I can't keep up with the workload. It's too much. That's an excuse, though. I can't. I can't do this. It's just a rambling mess when I talk about goals. 


During the summer, I aqquired a little lion plush I called 'Danny'. I consider him my son. One week, I lost him. I couldn't find him anywhere at home. I knew he was in school, so I put up missing posters. Useless. Fucking useless I'm useless-

Sorry got off track. I'm not being edgy, that just came out. I'm feeling a bit emotional right now. Anyway, I put up these posters and kids rip them down and throw them away. To get at me. One kid says that if he find Danny, he'll rip him to shreds. Others say they'll throw him away. Kids laugh at this notion. They don't understand that Danny is all I had. He was my son, *my child*. You don't want strangers or anyone to hurt your child, let alone mutilate them. I remember after someone threw a poster away I wrote on my locker in sharpie,""please find my son Danny, he is missing."" The kid stood in shock that 1) I just wrote on my locker, 2) I was this desperate over a toy. After two weeks, I finally found my baby boy again. He was in a basket in my science room with some fidget toys. I cried in happiness, quietly saying ""I found him"". One kid asked, ""what's going on?"" To which the teacher just told them to not worry about it. Hey, fuck you! This little toy is important to me, not like you would understand attaching to an object when you get ruthlessly teased, mocked, and ignored by everyone.

An event in 7th grade was one day, in the gym, I find this pencil. But oh, it's not a pencil, it's one of those *beefy mechanical pencils*. Girl notices the pencil and says she knows it's not mine, which naturally I say ""finders keepers, shouldn't've left it in the gym."" 

Next day, the girl the pencil belongs to confronts me. Here's the thing: that day, I was doing a character. And when talking with peers, I would be in character because it was fun to act that way (the way I was acting was actually just me being myself [didn't know at the time I was autistic], although one would describe it as ""retardation""). She keeps asking for the pencil. I say,""I don't have it, Harlee has it."" Of course I had the pencil, it was in the front most pocket of my back pack. But no, I wasn't about to give this girl her pencil back because it's a pencil, and I see everyone with this pencil so they're readily available. But this girl, this fucking girl is persistent. 

At lunch, she is joined by the girl from earlier and an additional friend. They keep trying to get the pencil from me, and I keep telling them I don't have it. At some point they literally circle around me. These girls were going to gang up on me *for a fucking pencil*. They say shit like,"" you better bring the pencil back next week or bad things are going to happen to you."" ????????????? What the fuck?!?! What are you going to do to me?? Some girl notices these girls being vultures and distracts them. I sat at the back of the black top until it was time to go inside. So I head back inside. 

The girls are now talking with the gym teacher. I just shake my head because this is such bullshit. I walk on, but these girl come up after me. They're all like,""we're going to tell more teachers-"" I snapped. I threw my shit down, smacked one three times, and grabbed another by her hair and threw her down. I don't know where the other one went, but I just picked up my stuff and ran to the phone. I was officially out of character. I am given ISS for the rest of the day and the next. Yes, I did indeed give the pencil back. That girl didn't bother me ever again.


And then 8th grade.

Dear God, 8th fucking grade. 

At this point, my memory is fried. Everything people say to me just blends together. I can't tell adults that kids are harassing me because I can't distinguish what is new, what is real, or what even happened. I'm being bullied. And the school likes to act like they're so *anti-bully*. They're fucking not. I was mocked, ridiculed, teased, and used by my peers for their own entertainment. 

I just- ""I wasn't being beaten up so why bother?"" Is what I always thought. The stupid stereotype that bullies are bigger, popular, male, and beat you up or make fun of your appearance is fucking appalling. It's a lie!!!!!!!! It's the biggest lie of my childhood. I didn't think there was anything wrong with people laughing at things I said. But there was this detachment. People didn't like me, and didn't want to work with me. In group projects, I didn't fucking exist. I hate group work because I felt inadequate. And people didn't hear my ideas, or take me seriously. My science class was the worst of it. They tormented me. But I was desperate for any positive reinforcement. So I went along with it. Teacher was fucking incompetent, swear he just did weird shit in the back room while leaving the class to handle itself. 

God I just want to cry, I feel- some sort of negative emotion. I can't remember half the shit they did to me. I can remember some, let's go with that.

One day this kid says I can't rap. I challenge this notion by writing a rap song and singing it at lunch. Kids ear this shit up like gold. They want more. Finally, I have a found a way to be accepted: friendly rapping about stupid shit. So my science class gets the idea that they're going to be my managers. So I'm like cool, I'll have back up dancers and we'll do shows and maybe I'll post the raps online (I did, they're under Lowlywoes by dannyandfriendsco on youtube). And I set up a concert date and concessions. No one shows up. These fucking people are so hype about me but they won't go to a concert? Fine, let's try this again. Next weekend only one person shows up. That's something, but God it was embarrassing putting so much effort in only for own person to show up. I went back to school and told my class they weren't my managers anymore and that I would be doing things on my own now since they don't respect me. That ended my career. I tired to work on another album but when I performed a single, someoen threw a snowball at me, so I figured that was the end of that. Frustrating thing was that people are still trying to get me to rap again, but I don't think people understand how tiring it is to put effort into being accepted only for it to fall flat when I want some leeway.

I showed up to school with a balloon that I wore in my hoodie as a head. Kids in class kept bopping at it. They kept taking the balloon from me to pop it. Teacher has us go outside to do... Idk some shit with liquid nitrogen or an icy explosion. A kid blocks me from going inside while one pulls the balloon from my head and pops it. I know it's silly, but I was just trying to have fun. They were actually pushing me around and trying to pop the balloon *because they knew it would make me upset*. 

I try to show someone a picture on my phone. A kid snacks the phone to the floor, and another stomps on it and slides it to me. WHAT THE FUCK?! And of course, I didn't get mad. Why? I was afraid if I made them pay for the phone (prepaid, $60) that I would be inconveniencing them. Later I did get upset and sent an email to the principal demanding he make the kids pay up. Ignored, not even acknowledged.

Two big events happened in second semester. The first, I had this crush on this kid. And of course, me being the person who trusts others, I tell these kids about it. I felt like I could trust them *because I had no one else in my life who gave me any attention*. They say the guy likes me back. Really? Wow that's gre- a fucking LIE. These kids were egging me on. I try to dance with the kid at passing time. He simply says,""let go of me.""

My entire world came crashing down. These kids, yes they were shitty but... Do they hate me? Yes. They hate me. The first thought in my head was how much of liars they are. Liars, liars, lairs. That's all I could think about. I don't want to be around them. I'm stressed. I just don't want to be in school anymore, but I'm 13. So I figure ""hey, why don't we just *burn the entire school down?*"" In my mind at the time, it made sense. I would be a criminal and they would put me in jail. If I'm in jail, it makes sense why people are mean. And why people hate me. It would all just makes sense. So I packed a lighter and some yarn and went to school the next day. 

I left in the middle of class and went upstairs. My science class wasn't for another two hours, but I didn't want to do gym on my last day. So I just tied yarn between two lockers on either side of the door and pulled out the lighter. Now, I can't use a lighter, I was inexperienced at the time. So I about rub my fingers raw trying to get a spark. And when I finally do, I hold it to the yarn. Looking back, my mind was so fucked. Around the yarn was all solid material. The yarn would not reach the door in any way. I could've went about it a million different ways, but the way I went failed (thankfully). The yarn caught the flame.... and it brown apart. That was it. The yarn was burned at the ends but nothing else. That was good enough for me.

I ran out. As I ran, I actually threw up. Probably from guilt. I walked for a while. I felt free. What I really needed was fresh air. I calmed down and turns around. Boy was I a happy camper when the fire alarm wasn't going off. I came back inside, my teacher worried about where I went. She sent me to the counselor (big mistake, CONSOLERS ARE FUCKING INCOMPETENT). I told him what I did and he didn't bat an eye. I told the principal/ ass. Principal what happened. They didn't care. WHAT THE FUCK? DUDE! I literally tried to commit an act of violence and property damage. People get truancy for etching dicks into a computer, but NOTHING happens when I try to BURN DOWN A FUCKING SCHOOL?! I isolated myself for the rest of the day and went home. 

Now, you would expect my parents to be pissed off, right? No, and here's why: *the fuckass school did not call my parents at all*. That's right, I was not punished for my actions. Maybe I should just be happy to not have anything happen to me, but I feel upset. These are the people who want to say middle school is so great when I felt like shit the entire time. I return to class the next day, letting everyone know what I did. They just say that's so metal and move on. Great, what did I fucking expect.

Oh, but my parents did find out. It was a month later, I can't forget the day. February 21. Monday. The memory is foggy.

It hurts to think about.

I just want to cry.

But I need to say it so someone can comfort me for once.

I was in science class, we were all up and about. I can't remember what we were doing, but I think I was trying to socialize but was either getting ignored or picked on. Teacher tells us to sit down. As I do, this kid whispers something at me. I snap. But this time, instead of violence, I use my voice. I stand up. I can't remember what I said. Something along the lines of, ""you guys are so disrespectful to me, you lead me on, you only like me because I'm funny, you popped my balloon, you stepped on my phone, you treat me like shit-"" and this part I remember clearly:

""I hate your fucking guts.""


...



*and they laughed*

One girl started laughing, and the others joined in. Everything hurt and at that moment I died inside. Everything hurt so badly. I finally let everyone know how I feel and it's a joke to them. *I'm just a joke to them*. I ran out of the room and sat in an open locker and contemplated suicide. Idk, guess I'll drink mouthwash and throw myself from the top of the school, that's gotta kill me. So for the rest of the day, I don't care. My mom picks me up, and she's upset with me. Says I'm being moody. Don't care. Wants me to clean my room. K. Wants me to give her my phone. Shit. The messages I sent to my cousin are on there. I had told my cousin(a cousin who sexually/physically/emotionally abused me and then manipulated me by telling people I raped her) prior that I was going to burn the school down, and she said I should bring a knife and rape my family (both things I didn't agree with, I know I was sick but I have standards). My mom sees these messages, and gets pissed. She writes an email to the principal, very angry. She asks,"" are you suicidal too, should I put in there that you're suicidal?!"" No. Not anymore. I snapped out of it the second she mentioned it. 

School year goes on. God I'm so tired right now. There's a few more things but I've been writing this for 7 hours. Just... Whatever man. Say whatever, I just had to get it out. I just want someone to see me."
Stupid phone doesn't block dad's texts,7,mk3zch,5,"I don't get it. It says he's *blocked*. I can click to un-block and then re-block him. But even when he's *blocked*, he can still text me whenever. It drives me crazy. =("
i don’t know what to do,4,mk7t3s,2,"tw: suicidal thoughts and self harm

i’m in the worst mental state of my life. i have never been as depressed as i am right now. my life has been going downhill since december, and i don’t know what to do to make myself feel okay. i just want to be okay. i can’t escape my past. i can’t escape my life. i want to end my life more and more every day. i’m scared of myself and i’m scared of what i might do to myself. i started cutting again. a lot. i’m fucking terrified. i didn’t ask for this, i didn’t ask for the trauma, i didn’t ask for these mental disorders. i don’t want to live like this and i can’t find a way out. i’m losing control. i just want someone to talk to, someone to hug and someone to tell me that i’m loved and safe. but right now i don’t have anyone. i feel so alone. it’s pathetic, i’m pathetic. i know i should just get over myself but it’s so hard, i just don’t know how."
What I realized getting a pedicure for the first time,101,mjqflj,17,"For the first time in my life a few days ago, I got a pedicure.

I’m a woman by the way, but I was never taught self-care by my parents. No matter how I dressed or presented myself, I was always their ugly daughter.

I was also always worried about surviving so I never focused much on beautifying myself. I thought it was a useless thing to worry about because I was preoccupied with making money so I could survive on my own.

As an adult woman, I’ve picked up a few beauty skills but I have still have so much to learn.

When we started the pedicure, I realized that it was a foreign experience for me because I wasn’t used to being the one getting care and being focused on.

Having someone cater to me and carefully clean me
up nicely was so alien. I noticed I had a little bit of anxiety, but I’ve learned to become more comfortable with myself recently and it wasn’t awkward at all.

It was a nice experience and it encouraged me to start doing nicer things for myself like that. I always considered it a luxury but once in a while is nice.

Being gentle and kind with myself, pampering myself and treating myself, celebrating myself...

It’s a good thing. It’s not something to be ashamed about."
Gender and CPTSD,4,mk6bh0,6,"I’m seeking advice on the relationship between gender expression and CSA specifically and wanted to know if anyone experienced the same thing? Also, I’m sorry if I offend anyone or use the wrong language just let me know and I can make edits or delete

So I was born female and was SA by a family member from 6-13 years old and during most of this time I heavily expressed myself as a guy to (I think) avoid my abusers attacks against me. He was very outwardly homophobic but regardless of what I wore it never mattered to him. I came up with a male name for myself and wore my brother’s clothes and if anyone didn’t already know me and asked me I would say I was a boy. I got bullied pretty heavily for this and by 8th grade I started trying to present more as a girl. It was pretty uncomfortable but now as a 22 year old I present as a girl for the most part but I’m still really uncomfortable wearing really “feminine” things like dresses, makeup or purses etc. I get defensive if people suggest I do more feminine things but I do feel more comfortable with people referring to me as a girl. 

Now with me learning about trans people over the past few years I’m not sure what I am or if it really matters. Being called a guy now triggers me and just reminds me of my abuse and the terrible bullying. However, I’m still not completely comfortable in my femininity and often feel very ugly and out of place around feminine women. I want to bring this up to my therapist but I just feel so ashamed and confused and I’m not even sure they’d understand. I also don’t want to explore too much and end up tacking on a gender dysphoria diagnosis to the growing list on my chart. Would this even be gender dysphoria?"
Feeling depressed and mistakenly expressed this with my family,2,mkbazs,2,"Potential TW:

I've been having a really hard time this past year - broke off an engagement with my ex-fiance, got kicked out of our house and had to move to an apartment in the middle of COVID, been completely inundated with work to the point where I've developed anxiety and my resting pulse has become higher and higher. Throughout all of this, I've had my waves of depression and feelings of hopelessness and lately feeling like I just don't belong anywhere. I'm floating around in space with no purpose and nothing really to look forward to in the future.

Long story short - growing up was ""ok"" with the exception of being emotionally and sometimes physically abused by mom and aunt for pretty stupid stuff. It's weighed on me a lot in adulthood and it's definitely affected the way I deal with relationships, social situations, and just...well myself. I've been seeking therapy for the last 6-7 years so I'm leaps and bounds better than where I was at the beginning but I have my moments of struggle...

I spent this afternoon with my parents for dinner - and everything was going well until around dinner when I just got the feelings of depression and anxiety pretty bad and I just blurted that I didn't feel like I belonged anywhere. The response I got from my mom and aunt (my dad is in the picture, aunt lives with them) was negative - I got called a nut/psycho, ungrateful because I was ""raised well and didn't grow up poor"", weird, etc. I also supposedly ruined their night because I hit them with a ton of bricks with that statement and I've essentially turned my back on the family... 

My birthday is next week and I already spent last year's pretty much alone (my first night alone in my apartment) and I definitely didn't want to spend it the same way now. Well now because of my ""weird attitude"", I've been told that I'm not welcome to celebrate my birthday with my parents until I start acting normal again - I've apparently ruined that day for them. And then I'm being asked why don't I ever tell them how I feel and I told my mom ""this is the exact reason why I don't"" and then I'm being told to keep it to myself...

I've been lucky enough to brush off these moments in the recent past but I'm struggling bad in dealing with it - I made the mistake of opening up and now it just hurts.... reinforces everything I've been working through in therapy about them. I don't know, I just needed to let this out somewhere because I feel like there's no one else out there to share with anymore..."
i cant move on,5,mk70x1,4,i don’t get how i’m ever meant to move on from what happened. today i found out my sister was abused by the same man that abused me. justice will never be served. he lives in peace rn for the awful things he did to both of us meanwhile both of our lives are in pieces
Some of the most dehibilitating trauma I've been through was emotional abuse at the hands of an emotionally immature parent.,43,mjt6sy,15,"HUGE **Trigger Warning** for emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse.. The list goes on.

I have been fucking r*ped and groomed, drugged and taken advantage of. I have cared for people who in return beat me to within an inch of my life. I've had harsh corporal punishment used against me at the age 3 to 5 by someone who wasn't even a parent, just my mums boyfriend at the time. So many things, blatant abuses and fucked up situations I should of never of found myself in.

It all hurts. It all keeps me up at night. But yano what really messed me up? I mean *really* messed me up.... Having an emotionally immature dad. Growing up with a manipulative, insensitive, fragile ego'd man who would tear down his own children before admitting his own guilt or failures.

Nobody teaches you how to deal with that kinda thing. Nobody was there to tell me that I wasn't a messed up kid, that I wasn't ""emotionally blackmailing"" my dad at 13 years old, by cutting myself. Every horrible lie and fucking manipulated truth, the way it weighed me down like an anchor. I truly believed every word he said. I thought it was my fault. I thought I was ""too emotional"" and even manipulative for seeking his comfort and care. I couldn't speak out against him, or he'd blame it all on me, harass me with horrible messages, over and over again. The confusion and sadness I felt while he bombarded me with messages about how fucked up I was. That was my first experience of being gaslit, to my knowledge. At 13 by my fucking dad.

The people who r*ped me and drugged me, who groomed me and passed me round like a dirty sex doll, I know that they're bad and they're wrong. It is easy for me to categorise them as people who hurt me and would hurt me again. People who are bad and scary. Black and white. No in-between. But the emotions that come along when i think of my Dad are so far from that reality. There's no black and white. No bad and good. Just a huge fucking mess that's left me second guessing myself for my entire life. I will ALWAYS feel like I'm trying to manipulate someone if i ask for help. I will ALWAYS struggle to get the help I need. I will ALWAYS fucking hate myself and blame myself for the fuck ups in our relationship.

And now at 23, I am no contact and have been for years. Still to this day does he say bad things about me and I still can't contact half of my family because of him. How can a bloody man child do this much damage????"
Anyone took psychedelics for therapeutic purposes?,6,mk3xsg,10,How did it go? Did it help in the long run?
Psychological chills? Physical chills? Body shakes/shudders? What is happening to me?,5,mk3kn3,5,"You know when someone says something that deeply resonates and it gives us goosebumps? And sometimes when one listens to a story we shudder physically? I really don’t have the words to explain my experience, but I feel a sensation in my chest that makes the centre of my chest shiver almost as if there is some stuck energy trying to get out and maybe this is a placebo but I feel like when I feel that weird shaky feeling I can feel myself de-numb, and if I force myself to feel that sensation, then I feel present but if I avoid it I feel frozen again. It feels so weird because sometimes my body will move a little in person, like in a way when someone tells you a scary or even extremely wholesome story and you shudder & get goosebumps? Like I am supposed to be shivering but don’t feel cold at all? I am so confused, this is not a chest issue because just last month I got my chest xrays done, so I don’t think it’s anything medical, and going to the doctor again I’d feel embarrassed because how would I even explain my symptoms? 
Just wanted to ask has anyone experienced this? And does this sound normal or should I immediately consult a physician?
Thanks!"
"My parents are emotionally abusive, what do I do to not become like them?",10,mk0zmj,3,"TLDR: My parents are emotionally abusive and they’ve been yelling everyday at my brother for the past four months without fail. My trauma gets triggered and I start to yell at my brother because of what my parents do to him. I don’t wanna be like my parents, what do I do? 

———

All my life my parents have been very emotionally abusive. They always shout at me and curse me for every little mistake that I make ever since I was a kid. It got so bad too the point that I thought yelling was a normal family behavior. I don’t have any idea how I put up with all the emotional abuse for 18 years without telling anyone, not even my bestfriends. I was too embarrassed to tell, it felt so lonely. 

When I moved out for college, my relationship with my parents slowly got better because they were nicer to me since we don’t see each other a lot. I started to appreciate them and look past what they did, because as a Filipino, families are very sacred. It was toxic for sure, but at the time I was just really glad that I got my freedom. My parents aren’t only emotionally abusive, but they’re also very strict. I basically didn’t get to enjoy anything when I was kid. 

But then, COVID happened. I had to move back home and it was a nightmare. I wish I can live in a dorm again, but because of health issues and the fact that I don’t have my own money. I had to suck it up. I thought that after a year, everything will be back to normal, but I was fucking wrong. I’m still stuck with my parents and I hear them yelling every single day. It’s a nightmare. I have my own room, but it still doesn’t feel like a physical safe space. Because everytime there’s an argument that doesn’t include me, my mom and dad will surely find a way to shift the blame of whatever the fuck they’re fighting about to me. It’s tiring. I hear them yelling at my brother or to each other every morning and every night. 

On the first few months of lockdown last year, I snapped because they were yet again violating my privacy and confiscating my gadgets at 19 years old just because I pissed my dad off. Their reason for doing so is because I live in their house and I should abide by their rules. I told them that they caused me so much emotional trauma from all the verbal abuse and that I’m scarred for life. They got so irrational and started to gaslight me, because they think that being a good parent is just about providing. 

I tried to rationalize everything and my brother cried as well, telling us that he felt the same thing. We were all crying at this point and I told them that we needed therapy. Unfortunately, we can’t afford it, but my mom told me that she’s gonna make an effort to yell less. I thought everything’s going to be better at that point, but who am I kidding? 

Fast forward to today, my brother is slacking off in online school and I’m pretty sure he’ll get kicked out soon. Remote learning is so fucking hard and I understand where he’s coming from. Because of this, my mom and dad with no fail, have started shouting at him every single day from morning ‘til evening about not doing well with school for four months now. I repeat, four months.  It triggered my childhood trauma that I’m still experiencing to this day. 

My parents have also blamed me for my brother failing although it’s not my fault. I hate being responsible for other people when I can’t even do it myself. The emotional abuse has also gave me a hard time focusing with my requirements and with sleeping. It made online classes harder. Because of this, I started to unknowingly blame my brother for all the yelling and for all the stress that it’s causing me even though it’s not my fault. Every time I get annoyed, I can’t stop myself from yelling and cursing at him too. I know by now that he’s going to hate me forever. 

I don’t want to be like my parents. I don’t want to traumatize other people. What do I do? 

Ps: My fucking situation wouldn’t be this bad if it wasn’t for the failed pandemic response of the fascist Philippine government."

Is this a form of dissociation triggered by being emotional?,9,mk07hq,4,"TW: mentions of self harm / dissociation? 
.
.
.
.
.

Often when I get upset, I go from zero to 100 in the sense that I dont “just get sad” - I am ugly crying for hours, I see red or black and white. My partner could mention they forgot to buy milk and I can feel like the world is falling apart or that Im being attacked. I know it doesn’t help that growing up, every time I showed any signs of sadness - I was interrogated or made to feel bad about being sad. I am a very emotional person but id have to hide in the shower just to cry, or at its worse I just had to stop feeling on some level. 

most of the time the only thing that calms me down immediately is self harming or forcing myself to sleep it off which that alone can take a long time. However, i noticed after I take a nap, self harm or just in general after im upset - i get a huge headache sometimes and then I go blank. As if I dont remember why I was upset or why my partner not buying milk bothered me so much. I have had full blown arguments with people, and I come back oblivious that we were ever fighting. I rarely hold grudges because its like i emotionally forget all the pain I was just feeling. And the times that I do remember the argument, I immediately want to fawn over the person and make amends because the weight of the argument/what happened is too much compared to silence. 

Is this a form of dissociation? I always considered myself just someone who doesn’t hold a grudge, but I feel like its more than that. I watch other people get into arguments but the aftermath is not like mine.

Can anyone else relate?"

!!! Easter Weekend Executive Dysfunction Bonanza!!!,5,mk2ask,1,"It's what passes for a ""nice day"" in this shite part of the world (everything grey and brown and nothing alive or blooming, dust and mud everywhere, but the snow's gone and it's not freezing out). So everyone and their dog, literally, are outside. I can hear all the neighbors and their happy families laughing and talking and I just want to die. The sun coming through my windows hurts my eyes, but I don't want to punish my plants for my trauma-induced depression, so I feel like I can't close the curtains. I have the worst headache but I just started antidepressants (doing nothing so far, too early to expect anything) and although I want all the pain to end, I don't particularly want it to be via brain bleed, so I can't take the bunch of extra-strength Advil which normally would kill the headache eventually. I can think of a list of things I could do to feel less like dying (yoga, a bath, a nap, short guided meditation, some hygenic self-care, make some healthy yummy food and eat it, take a walk where there aren't too many people, watch a movie, read a book), but I literally can't do any of them. Today and most of tonight's going to pass in a haze of dissociating looking at my phone, alternating with monologing aloud (I'm alone) about all the ways in which my existence is horrid/ past trauma, and scream-sobbing. And I'll wake up tomorrow exhauated after a couple hours of sleep hating myself worse than today, and I'll have to go back to taking care of other human beings (my kids, with their other parent this weekend) who deserve way better than my wrecked-up ass. This is supposed to be my ""self-care weekend."" I fucking hate life. Anyone else?"
Anyone else here have BPD comorbidity? I seem to fit a lot of the criteria,3,mk571h,7,"Wondering if others here has both CPTSD and BPD. I have been diagnosed C-PTSD but I seem to fit a lot of the criteria of BPD, specifically fear of abandonment.

My first question is - can fear of abandonment a symptom of CPTSD as well? I did have abandonment trauma as my dad was on drugs when I was a kid and mostly absent in my life and my mom was an emotionally absent narcissist. 

I notice the (possible) BPD symptoms are most prevalent in my relationship...I feel highly hyper vigilant and even paranoid. If he starts using his phone a lot I start to feel like he’s cheating or that I don’t trust him. I constantly have really dark intrusive thoughts about him being unfaithful or just feeling generally highly untrusting if I am triggered.

Would like any insight from people who have BPD as well! I don’t want to further stigmatize those with BPD, but thinking about having they makes me feel so much shame. I’m not sure if my symptoms are CPTSD related or not. 

I will absolutely bring this up to my therapist as well."
DAE feel super sensitive to others moods and feelings but at the same time you can’t imagine how they perceive you as a person,399,mjeihz,34,"It’s a weird feeling that I always had.

I can sense super well how the other person feels and which mood they are in, but I just can’t imagine how they must perceive me. I’m not able to see myself through their eyes. I can’t imagine what goes on in their minds when they see me and talk to me. 

Is it maybe because I have never felt seen by my parents? They were very narcissistic and self-absorbed. 

Also, they were happy to see me being sad, they were laughing about me and mocking me about it and so on.. (they are very very immature). I assumed that they didn’t notice that I was sad. I tried to overplay it but in reality they still noticed and laughed about me, I just didn’t know. 

Now I really have no idea if people can really see who I am and how I feel."

How to value personal time?,5,mk32bx,1,"So I'm in therapy, and I've come a long way. But I struggle with anxious attachment/people pleasing/codependent behaviors. 

Does anyone have some advice for learning to feel like I'm entitled to my own time?

I struggle to self care and have boundaries, and even when I do, I generally am killing time in a way. 

Today my husband is working on a home improvement project. He loves doing them. I told him I need a rest day today, we've had a lot going on and I need to only do basic house things and rest. But when I'm trying to I feel like I'm just waiting for the day to go by. I feel guilty because he wants me to help clean up some of the construction supplies but I'm trying to enforce my own boundary of resting today. 

I guess some of it is I don't know what I want. Knowing what I want is dangerous. I'm just sitting here stressing, which isn't helping me rest. But I know doing what my husband wants me to is going to burn me out more. 

I'm trying to think of my stress reducing actions and I'm just feeling like I don't have the right to do them. Which really isn't healthy but I don't know what to do with that."
I finally found words to explain how masks have impacted my ability to interact socially,10,mjxyur,2,"Yes, wearing masks is important to stop the spread of Covid-19 - but that's not what this post is about.

Since mask mandates started going into effect about a year ago, I've noticed that my social anxiety has become even more pronounced and I finally found the words to explain why and felt the need to share. For me, being able to read people's facial expressions is a big part of how I establish my sense of safety when I'm navigating around the world. If someone is displaying an emotion I perceive as threatening I can avoid that person (go down a different aisle in grocery store, for example). There are warning signs in a person's body language before they become violent. If I can see and recognize those signs, I can dodge the punch - so to speak. However, with everyone's faces obscured it is far more difficult for me to get a read on people. So as a coping mechanism, I err on the side of interpreting ALL faces as threatening. 

My PTSD brain is interpreting the world as constantly being full of threats when I'm in public and my method of mitigating that (reading faces) has been taken away because everyone is wearing masks. This has led to me feeling extremely exhausted after outings. Often, I avoid going out altogether by having my necessities delivered. Thanks for letting me share. I'm surely not the only one who has been affected this way by the pandemic."

Noticing bad parents is ruining some of my favorite movies,748,mj9lxb,155,"I’m wondering if other people have the same issues when they start getting help for CPSTD or emotional neglect.

Yesterday I had The Secret Garden (1993 version) playing while I was doing housework, which had been one of my favorite books/movies growing up.

But as I was watching it, I started to become so irrationally angry and felt real hatred towards the father in the movie.

Your wife died, so you were so “hurt” and “afraid to love your son because you had suffered to much already” so you didn’t interact with him at all for ten years? You let him stay in bed and so he never learned to walk? He never went outside once? He never had a friend his own age, or any other companion? You were just going to let him live his life in his bed without ever looking into it?

Then you got custody of your niece who lost both her parents, saw her once, and took off?

He is presented as a tragic figure and forgiven at the end, but all I could thing was wow, you are a shit person and shit parent, and so self centered and selfish.

As I work through these things I hope that this mellows out somewhat... I don’t know. It feels like wasted energy to be angry at a movie but I feel like I’m noticing this stuff everywhere lately.

Edit: wow, such interesting responses and discussions, thanks you guys! So thankful there is a forum like this to talk about and think through/feel these thoughts and emotions with people that understand and have such insightful perspectives too"
I did something stupid and made my cptsd so much worse,4,mk20eg,1,"Sorry just want to vent but trigger warning just incase it is a trigger 
Paranoia about people breaking in
Rescue cat
Balaclava 


So I ended a friendship and burned that bridge in spectacular fashion by getting my cat back from them without them noticing (I let them look after the cat even after the friendship was strained and then find out the cats being neglected and I suspect abused as she's flinching when I stroke her sometimes). Ever since I've then my occasional paranoia I think it's classed as that to be honest I don't know all I know is normally at night some sounds make me think someone is trying to break in to bring me or my animals harm. Those issues only happened maybe once or twice a month but since getting the cat the paranoia has come back ten fold and  im so paranoid a man is trying to break in and he has a balaclava on and it's happening during the day and so many more sounds are making me jump and then setting me off, several times a day im being triggered and I manage to calm myself down after a few minutes but I'm exhausted. It's not even the ex friends that I think are trying to break in when I'm home but when I have to leave the house I'm then worrying the whole time that my friends will break in to get my cat (although I rationally know they wouldn't).

My brain is getting so over run with irrational thoughts im really struggling to keep myself stable and I even have started getting triggered when my boyfriend is staying over where as before I felt 100% safe when he's with me.

When it's at its worse and I think someone has broken in I either panic and drag my animals to the bathroom and lock us in or I go around every room with a knife and kick the door open so I can surprise the intruder.

I dont even know who I can contact for support. I'm with a mental health team but on a long waiting list for therapy so no help from them for a while.
Im uk based if somehow someone knows any suggestions.

The rest of my cptsd is thankfully it's usual self which I think normal people wouldn't think was good but it's a blessing as I couldn't cope with that acting worse too."
"DAE ""make up"" personalities in your head to deal with abuse",52,mjozkp,20,"I remember I would conjure up another personality to take some of the verbal abuse I received. When it happened, my world would get blurry, I felt very spacey, and sometimes my body lightly sways. I would imagine up a tougher, more hardened version of myself to receive trauma, and I would imagine they would be there in my body while I watched from the sidelines. I (?) would think ""I have to keep (my name) safe, this is my job, I have to do this."" They would also sometimes offer comfort to me when I was upset. But only sometimes.  
Does anyone else experience this as well?"
The Bad Dreams and Nightmares Never Stop.,5,mjyhuk,2,"I've been prescribed anti-nightmare medication to deal with the constant bad dreams I get every night, yet although I don't really wake up in a burning sweat from nightmares like I used to, almost every night is entirely of horrible things my parents do to me all packed into a dream, and it's been like this for a really long time. Only now did I get prescribed medication for it. 

I keep constantly having dreams of being screamed or yelled at by my mom, dad, my mom's abusive boyfriend, or my dad's ex-wife who I grew up with, with the rest of their kids around me laughing at me and mocking me. There are dreams I would have where I'd be getting yelled at and I'd spend the entirety of it having a mental breakdown while defending myself and telling them off. 

Then I'd have the really severe ones, like the night before, where I had a dream that my mom's ex boyfriend threatened to break my legs, because I didn't want him around anymore, and I was screaming at him to do it (he constantly made show-off-y threats but never actually owned up to them) and he started attacking me. 

Last night was a dream about my stepmom flipping out at me and calling me an ungrateful bitch because ""she raised me"", while I was upset and planning on leaving her home, because of the mistreatment I kept getting. It was a yelling fest from hell. 

I don't even enjoy sleeping anymore. I always wake up feeling upset or drained from the bad dreams I constantly fight of my parents lashing out or bullying me. I can't tell you how many times I've had the same dream of my dad kidnapping me and yelling at me through an entire car ride while I couldn't escape. It just never stops. 

I wish I could just live like a normal human being and not have to he constantly reminded me of the trauma I dealt with years ago."
DAE not like playing games?,2,mk5brr,2,
DAE have aphantasia (inability to picture things) that seems to really intensify emotional disconnection?,3,mk11re,3,"Hey, I came across this community looking for some book reccomendations and wanted to ask for some advice. I'm a 21 year old trans women with aphantasia - I realised I differed from other men when I was very young, and my dad especially had specific view of expected masculinity. I felt like I couldn't talk to them about anything, internalised the feeling of needing to ""earn love"". I was pretty insecure, depressed and emotionally dissociated a lot of the time growing up - but I've been really fortunate to have been on a positive path for the past couple years. I'm working with a therapist, going through books + workbooks and redefining my relationship with myself through self compassion. I still struggle a lot with feeling safe, but I'm growing a lot more aware and feeling significant progress in understand the ways I reinforce those feels of fear and anxiety.

I think I could picture things as a kid, but I can't now (not sure and it doesn't really matter - if I could it's something that may come back through healing but I'm trying not to get too worried about it, it'll be okay either way). A lot of exercises talking about healing dissociation, reconnecting with feelings use visual imagery in a way I can't really - and it can be quite confusing and worrying but something I am able to navigate healthily. It almost feels as for some mental imagery can act as a sort of pinboard, where if they're distracted for a second they can look back and it's still there ish, but if I get overwhelmed by anxiety for a second or distracted in some other way I almost feel like I've lost where I was (I also have/ am medicated for ADHD)? I'm comfortable in being able to try and keep up healthy practices, but I was just curious if anyone here had experienced anything similar and could share any tips / point me in the way of any useful literature? Thanks a lot, and thank you if you've taken the time to read this!"
A deadline for healing,13,mjt94o,11,"My (24f) partner (29m), have been together for 7 years, wants to break up with me next year if I havent improve myself by then. 

We have a good relationship in general. We had bad periods and good, like all relations. 
Ever since I know him I have been doing better. I started work, quit the work because I got triggered, recovered for 2 years (so 2 years workless), then got a job again and we moved in together (bye bye abusers!) and then had a breakdown again, lost my job, now jobless for a little over 2 years again. I have no income. My partner pays for everything since two years. I slow him down in his dreams: buying a house, going on holidays.

Since january I had a giant breakdown over covid isolation and trauma that is linked to isolated feelings. I have had several panic attacks from january until february. Ever since february my doctor prescribed tranquilizers. Now I just cry instead of panicking all day and he cannot see me like this anymore. 
In 2-3 weeks I will be hospitilized for CBT treatment. The residential treatment is 12 weeks. The training is around 6-8 months. In total its a little less than a year.

My partner told me today he wants to be able to buy a house before his 35 so he told me if I don't improve after the hospital, he might break up with me. He will still be here for me but we wont be a couple anymore. 

This news devastated me. I understand his feelings though. I have been a very hard person to deal with due to my trauma.
I feel like a bad person now. I really want a future with him together yet I am still lingering in my past and the trauma's of the past are consuming me and demanding all my attention.

I don't know how to let go of the past. Everyone says it, but how do I actually manage to let it go?!
And I feel scared to let go of my trauma because I don't know who I am without it. I fear the future. I fear I wont be able to find myself and become my true self. I fear losing my partner. I fear my physical sensations. I fear my emotions. I fear other people. I fear being alone but I keep isolating myself and ending up alone. fear life itself!  

I fear dead. I fear my heart stopping suddenly or my brain crashing suddenly. Somehow I sometimes dream of being dead. I

I am so scared and lost. I want my abusers around me to feel some kind of ""home"". I know it's wrong, it's dead wrong! But I am so lost. I feel like a little child. I don't know how to adult. I fear being an adult. But I must become an adult in order to live my life. I am scared to be an adult. I want to be a little girl and get all the attention a child needs, no responsibilities, get all the help and support I need.

Am I beyond repair? I feel so broken and like an alien. Is my brain okay? What do I need to do to fix myself? Can it be done? Can I live a normal life?"
Unexplainable sever itchiness when dissociating?,2,mk30rj,4,"Been meaning to ask this for a while. I've got a lot of common symptoms of CPTSD like muscle armoring and tensing up subconsciously throughout the day which causes me chronic pain. But one thing I have yet to see someone mention is extreme, sudden itchiness. It's always in the same spot, my legs, and randomly appears sometimes when I dissociate. It's strong to the point of pain. Itchiness that makes me want to cry and makes my desire to self harm sky rocket because I just want it to go away. I'm proud of mysrlf I never have but I just want to scratch to the point of cutting myself with nails.

If I ignore it and just suffer it eventually fades in a few minutes and it's as if nothing happened. But if I give in and touch it, not even scratch just massage the area, I get a rash. The few times I have scratched it results in a rash that almost looks like a scar and lasts for weeks. Is this somatic pain? It just feels like my body is malfunctioning and over reacting over nothing. Its not my environment like I'm allergic to something because I can go weeks sometimes without it randomly flairing up. And if I just suffer it's gone within minutes. But it's so strong I can barely walk. My entire body just tenses up as I try to fight the urge to touch and just suffer.

I hope I don't sound crazy. I suffered physical abuse as a child and am a CSA victim, can this be a symptom?"
Just realized I’ve been raped multiple times when I could not remember,28,mjp96a,1,"It started when I was really young, like my earliest memories are from when I was 2 with this babysitter. Over two decades later, I just put it together that she was making diaper porn of me and doing stuff I don’t remember in bed. 

Now I’m realizing multiple people since, including my ex I dated for several years, have drugged me, raped me and filmed me. They would not have done it when I was conscious because I would have fought back. Now it’s too late. 

When this first came up (my friends told me they were raped in the house I was living in and I stood up for them, resulting in a ton of bullying), I thought my trauma was secondary. I think my brain was protecting itself because it was too painful to think my ex would have done that. 

I had a breakdown and went to the psych ward. I am almost certain I was raped there too when I was restrained because they drug you hard and take you to a private room, and I just woke up feeling different. 

I lost some time to psychiatric trauma and forced medications. I think because my abuse started so young it made my family resent me on some level because my mother is super narcissistic and neglectful and treats me totally different from my sister. They are incapable of giving me the support I need, and I was the one who initially brought myself to the psych ward. 

It happened again very recently but in a way I’m glad because I did not deeply trust the people who did it this time, and it made me realize what happened in the past. 

But I am so terrified and isolated and I do not know what to do about it. I can’t believe how many times I’ve been violated, and I hate that I will never really know the extent. 

I’ve been treated like I was insane, but all I’ve ever known is abuse. My mother set me up to get in abusive situations by mistreating me my whole life and financially abusing me (she literally starved me). And then I was drugged and raped by people I thought I could trust. 

I don’t think I’m crazy but no one can deal with my life. I am so alone and scared of everything. Trauma has prevented me from doing the things I want, and I don’t know who I can trust."
Coming to terms with the true extent of my trauma for the first time. I don't know who I am anymore.,13,mjsnjv,1,"I have always had issues connecting to others and trusting them. Even those I care about, I'm constantly afraid that they'll betray me in the future. I'm always thinking about scenarios in which they try to slander me, hurt me, or tell everyone about my trauma. It's hard for me to be open, and when I am, I immediately regret it. Now this person has something to use against me.

The worst part is that I can't tell anyone about this, either. How would my friends and family feel if they knew I couldn't trust them and was always questioning their intentions? I feel like everyone is trying to hurt me. Everyone. I try to act like I'm fine, but I know me having friends that care about me is too good to be true. And some of these friends, who I've known for years, have seen me at my worst. They've seen me as a cringy, angsty teenager. They've seen me make mistakes, lash out, have mental breakdowns, and attempt suicide. They've seen me back when I was much more reactionary and emotional and I'm terrified that one day that they'll tell everyone what a horrible person I really am. And I'll deserve it, because I am a horrible person. That will be the only version of me people will remember. 

Even admitting feeling this way is hard. I feel like it makes me inherently guilty of something. I think I'm a bad person, and not in a self pitying way. I try asking myself, ""Why would your friends hurt you?"" And the answer is always, ""Because you're a bad, toxic person, you make everyone around you miserable and everyone should know about it."" When I try finding specific instances of me being a toxic person, I think of a few social missteps I made during adolescence, as well as friendships I've ended during mental breakdowns (thinking they're better off without me and ghosting them - and now I'm terrified they're out for revenge), but nothing beyond that. And then I think, ""Youre lying, you're more toxic than that. You're just trying to manipulate everyone into thinking you're innocent."" I start to panic and question whether or not I'm actually manipulative or if it's all in my head.

I can't tell if my perception of myself is distorted by CPTSD or if I really am an awful person. I don't like hurting people and I always try my best to support my friends, because it makes me happy to see others happy. But do I really feel that way, or am I just manipulating myself and others into believing that? I don't know anymore. I feel like I deserve the bad things that happen to me, and that I'm completely unworthy of love, empathy, and forgiveness. How do you admit something like that to someone, unironically? I'm so ashamed and embarrassed. How do you even begin to heal from feeling that way all the time?"
Someone I went to treatment with killed herself (TW Suicide),36,mjn08l,5,"We weren't close but we were in treatment for 45 days together. We lived in the same house, we ate meals together, we were in the same therapy group. It's scary that someone who was out of treatment and looked like she was doing so well, just boom gone. It scares me because I thought I would never attempt again after that treatment program, but just a few weeks ago, I was close to attempting. It just is so fucking sad that like an alcoholic will always fight their addiction, me and the women I went to treatment will have to fight the urge to self-harm and attempt suicide. It just makes it like it could be a real possibility for me one day. I'm fighting to use my skills from treatment every day to stay alive."
Anyone else have a negative emotional reaction to guided meditation?,51,mjlbxi,20,"A while back, my therapist sent me some guided meditation recordings, hoping they might help me. And I've read about the benefits of mindfulness meditation, and it seems like it should be a healthy practice. But as soon as I start listening to anything like that, it's like my anger switch flips on, and I want to punch the person whose voice I'm hearing.

""Close your eyes."" 

""You can't make me."" 

""Take a slow breath in, and hold it for three seconds."" 

""No! Shut up."" 

""Focus on tensing and relaxing each muscle in your body, starting with-"" 

""I refuse! !@#$ you!"" 

That's basically how it goes. Not very helpful after all...

"Writing the memories down? [TW abusive relationship, sexual assault]",2,mk132e,1,"I recently got out of a toxic and abusive relationship and the patterns of behaviour in the relationship dynamic absolutely echo previous traumas. Particularly in terms of my emotionally, verbally and physically abusive father. I'm also dealing with beginning to process a number of sexual assaults I experienced going back many years. 

One of the things my ex told me was that I am unloveable. He retracted this later but it cuts so deep to the core of why I downplay my memories of trauma. I feel like I did deserve everything. Now, I have done a lot of work in group therapy and before this relationship I had gotten to a pretty good place in all areas of my life although was still learning how to manage my ADHD and anxiety and episodes of depression. But this has set me back big time. I'm having constant emotional flashbacks, regular flashbacks and am regressing to all the awful things I believed about myself.

I'm journaling a lot and sifting out reality from beliefs and I think it would be helpful to sit and actually write down my traumatic memories in as much detail as I recall in order to show myself that it was actually real and begin to challenge them. To put distance between then and now. My big concern is that this risks becoming emotionally overwhelmed and retraumatised in a way I can't contain by myself. I am doing lots to take care of myself atm, sleep, meds, meditation, hobbies etc. But I can't afford therapy although I find helplines quite useful when I'm desperate. It's all just swirling around in my head constantly and I want to get it out but I don't want to open Pandora's box and not be able to close it in order to carry on functioning in day to day life!!

Would love literally any advice or tips about how to approach this. I think it would be really therapeutic but I struggle with pacing myself and not getting totally overwhelmed."
DAE feel like their life is in danger when they have a flashback? Or that someone is trying to hurt you?,42,mjlqe2,13,Sometimes when I get a strong flashback I become convinced that I literally need to hide for my life. I go into a closet or under a bed and if anyone comes looking for me I can't speak because some part of me is convinced that if they find me they will kill me. Is this a normal flashback? Why do I get this feeling? It is the most paralyzing and terrifying experience and I don't know how to break free when I fall into that mode.
Huge panic attack and feeling trapped,3,mjxyco,1,"I like a boy but my anxiety is too severe to meet him. I canceled so many times and I feel horrible. I can not meet him. I also missed a grooming appointment because I was too anxious and started dissociation. It's Easter, and my mom's birthday. This is an extremely hard day for me. Usually I would just melt in my bed all day and be depressed so badly that it hurts. But I have my puppy here, someone I need to take care of. She is an attention whore. So everytime I hyper focus on my computer to write my feelings, or everytime I move- she follows me. I feel like this should be comforting. But I see it as, she wants something from me or needs something from me and I feel the pressure to attend to her, entertain her. I never have any time to myself. I feel bad for being annoyed at her but I feel like I need fucking space on this day I am crawling out of my skin. She had off leash at Central Park all morning, playing, running with dogs and people, walking all over. She went to bathroom. She ate an extra yummy breakfast for Easter in a puzzle. I gave her more treats in a sniff rope. And she has been resting, staring out the window and following me since. And I can't meet this guy I really like because my body. I'm so fucking anxious."
I need help/advice. I have a serious conflict with my neighbors and my ptsd had become wrapped up in it,9,mjs8ro,3,"Short shory: 
My neighbors are antagonizing me so badly im triggered all the time; they pick on me until I snap. My trauma therapist wants to stop doing trauma work with me bc he said he can't do trauma therapy when I'm in a triggering, hostile environment. I'm at a loss and afraid to turn to the landlord or the cops.

Long story: 
Tonight at 2 AM my neighbors lashed out at me, slamming doors, kicking my wall, and yelling. They slammed the door a 2 ft section of plaster came down and kept it up for over a half hour. 

This has been happening for over 6 months, but this is the worst its been.

It all started during lockdown. My  walls are apartment very, very thin. I guess my neighbor's girlfriend herd me masterbaing  - its not like I was being loud, frankly I can hear have sex upstairs and just ignore it. Like insaid paper thin walls.

She flipped out and had her bf and his friends come to my door, pounding, calling me a pervert, a freak, a weirdo, etc. 

You see, when I was a child I was violently abused for masterbaing, and also raped, so this was a huge trigger. I ended up in a ball crying.

Since then ANY noise I make, they accuse me of doing something perverted and try to start a fight with me. I know it sounds crazy, but this is what's happening. Its a nightmare for me.

For the 6 + months since they have been trying to pick a fight with me. Calling me names, insulting me, slamming doors, refusing to lock the door (intentionally leaving it open bc I asked them to lock it) kick and stomping at my exterior apt walls. I tried to leave them a note, and they torn it into pieces. 

I've been trying to ignore it, but a few months ago I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't sleeping, I was triggered 100% of the time by them yelling, stomping, calling me names every other day.
They've continuously escalated their hatred toward me, calling me crazy, saying ""cuckoo, cuckoo!""

I'm not 100% innocent.  I've snapped at them and threatened them, cursed them out and slapped my door back at them. I try not to, but they get me so angry and triggered sometimes I get angry back. I struggle to sleep bc of them. I'm scared to run into them in the halls.

I've been too afraid to tell my landlord becasue I'm scared he'll think I'm crazy and side with the neighbors; he's kind of a slum lord, not very understanding. I'm scared to call the cops becasue they are so violent in my city. 

I'm in trauma therapy rn, via telehealth, but my therapist doesn't want to keep doing treatment becasue he says I'm in too triggering an environment  with the weekly antagonism I face and my apt isn't a safe space for therapy.

Im at such a loss and can't sleep. Idk what to do."
Why are relationships so hard. [TW: Rant/Vent],5,mjw6og,3,"Romantic. Platonic. Any kind of relationships are impossible to keep up and just be stable. 

Everyone in my life, everyone I have ever confided in or trusted with my inner personal thoughts have betrayed me. My family has betrayed me, my past romantic partners have. I'm so desperate to have a connection with someone and for them to try to understad why I act like this.

I got diagnosed with CPTSD last November. I am 16 and I have no clue what my life has been or what it will be. I dont remember my childhood apart from bad moments, yet that barely is anything. 

I try to be better and be nice and I tried to be a good friend or partner. But i always fail. They always leave me even if I caused it and it was deserved. I can be rude and a downer to be around, I'm so terrified to be replaced when I'm friends with someone, I get upset when they are with someone other then me and I feel so worthless and alone and just not worth anyone's time. And I try to be better, I tried to be better but it never works and I'm so tired of being abandoned.


I get this feeling when I'm at my best, this weird hyper and childish feeling and I feel like I'm fine. Not euphoric or on cloud nine, just fine. This numb steady feeling that makes me live in the moment and feel like life is worth living. That I'll be okay.

But for some stupid stupid reason I get upset over the smallest things. Little things that should be fine and not even sensible to get upset over. A heavy ball forms in my chest and its hard to think and focus on anything and I feel so small and so alone and so unloved by everyone around me because it's stupid to be upset over any small thing.


I always went back to this one person, a off and on relationship of a friend. We knew eachother for 4 years. Even if his past ex when they were together told me I was horrible and threatened me, and he never took my trigger to their name seriously after, I would go back. Even if he sent me videos of songs about how he didnt care for my existence after a arguement. I would go back and let him love me and call me baby.

I finally blocked him permanently 3 days ago, after 4 years. After we started talking again after 3 months, which I had texted him in a flurry of emotions, we made no romantic advances. I was okay with him being more distant, because at least I had someone to talk too. It was going well. I got to have deep conversations with him and told him about my diagnosis in depth.

I had a month treatment at a centre thingy to get my diagnosis after some bad incidents, and read him some of my papers and my experiences. He knew I was insecure and had low self esteem. He knew me for 4 years and knew how i was about being disliked. How I was so scared he was lying to me the whole time about loving me. 

April 1st, he ignored me all day then he texts me ""sorryy. was hanging with a friend who doesnt like you all day, didnt want to be nagged about talking to you."" 

I was calm at first!! I tried to be light and cause I was better, I wanted to be better. I was trying to be better. I wanted a friend. I wanted someone I could talk too and hang out with. I didnt even think I was good enough and that stupid little text made up with 1s and 0s made me feel blank. 

The whole time ive told him our whole relationship that I was rude and toxic and was just scum in general. That I was gross. ""I'll always love you"" was his response. He would say he didnt care and would change the subject. 

I spiraled in self deprecating texts, it wasnt too bad considering how horrible I felt. I just replied that a past ex's mom also hated me, which was true. He said his mom also hated me too. I've talked to his mom, I've texted her when I was worried about him.   

I said no one likes me and he said hes no one? Then I rephrased it and said everyone except him hates me but with some swearing. I felt angry and hurt. I was hurt.

Then I realized he did this to get a reaction out of me. He was GLAD it did 

I tried to tell him that I trusted him and that I told him how I thought I wasnt worth anyone's time or my life wasnt even worth the space. How I thought no one truly loved me or how I thought I have no home or family to go too in need. 

I guess he had enougn of my shit cause he told me to stop throwing a pity party. A fucking pity party cause I sounded like his sister who he hated and loved to fight with. 

He said hes better then me and that i am a cunt. That I ruined it. I thought we were going well, we had set boundaries and being friends. I thought I finally was going to have someone. Even if he never cared.

My last attempts at this being not true I asked if it was the friend and asked for proof. He just sent a picture or himself with a wide happy smile. 

Ive been through this in many different forms [mostly family and abuse] so I had stopped crying and was just kind of. Texting him for some soft of feeling. I asked for him to ""tell me more about myself"", since I ""would take anything by now"".

Blah bahn I'm a monster. I blocked him and his family. 


I got off track. Why are relationships hard. Why am I not good enough. I go to counseling and meditation is being worked out but I'm never good enough. No matter how good I feel or how good I act I'm never enough for anyone's standards. 

That's all. Sorry for this pity party or like victim thing, i overreacted and just needed to ramble."
How do you guys cope with toxic shame?,82,mjh1ki,24,"So I haven’t been doing trauma work for a very long time now, maybe a month or two, but I think I just came to the realization that when I’m stuck in freeze (nearly 24/7), it’s mostly always bc of the shame I feel. For needing, for wanting, for existing... I even feel shame for not being ashamed. What do you guys do when you feel consumed by shame like this? Both in the moment and long term"
I once stabbed a son of a bitch and it hurts me...but also I don't see any other way I could have handled it,2,mjwu3y,12,"And I say that as a non-violent person. But it was also very liberating that I knew I had that kind of violence in me...don't fuck with me.

I got horribly bullied for all of my existence in the school system. Inside the school, outside their jurisdiction with kids who went to the same school system, my childhood ""best friend"" was a frenemy who fueled it as well, Felony Phil.

I never wanted to be a violent or scary person. BUT, the kids would just incessantly from every angle, fuck with me, and could force any non-violent person to be violent. Toy with me. Torment me. Make fun of me and treat me as underneath them.

Even from the confines of my home, I wasn't safe from these horrid people.

They actually home invaded my house 4x, and vandalized our house, between 30 and 40x, doing $thousands in damage.

I like knowing, that I had that violence in me, I will by any means necessary, fuck you up even if I don't know how to fight. I don't need to know martial arts to use a weapon in that moment.

Because I ran into this problem where if I did other means to stand up for myself, the bully would act horribly indignant and be crueler because I stood up for myself, ""omg this wimp is standing up for himself, let's be even WORSE to him to remind him he's beneath me"".

ANd this one kid, Mike...dude he must have thought I'd just fume being angry and not do shit, and he'd laugh at how angry I was, and that'd be that. I don't want to tell the entire story, but I had these brand new shoes, mom bought me that I loved because of how horribly treated I was at school, it was a bright spot in a dark world, it's still a dark world for that matter. I'd tooth brush clean them, put the laces in a water bottle with detergent, and white the sides, to keep them nice. Brand new. And even though I tried to look nice, bullies would ruin my clothes just to be cruel, I had one dig through my lunch and full force throw my caprisun packet, blowing up all over my clothes.

I may have been autistically ranting a bit too much about my stupid shoes that day, fair enough. Mike dragged his foot across my new shoes. ANd this was my moment...I wanted to lay down a boundary, and enforce it. ""Mike, I'm a funny guy, goofy, not very threatening. I like you even. But DON'T DO THAT AGAIN"". I FIRMLY communicated that to him. This is a boundary and I wanna have a good day, in spite of you dragging your foot across my fucking new shoes. And bell rings...classroom clears out. I'm packing bookbag, and from the sides, Mike walks up and drags his foot again across my brand new shoes.

My eyes filled with pure fire in rage...I'd never been so pissed in that moment...I grabbed a pencil on the fly. And he got defensive, and asked if I was gonna stab him? I stabbed that son of a bitch in the hand with a pencil.

Later on it got infected, he needed surgery.

And btw...I know the school system could have handed these bullies their asses. Because I got suspended a full fucking semester for standing up for myself, I did more to instill fear in bullies in that school, than the adminstrators, and I'm the one who got punished for it.

This isn't games, you severely violate personal boundaries...he knew I didn't know how to fight, but that doesn't mean I can't fuck them up. I could bring a tire thumper in my backpack or mace canister. These aren't games anymore.

If I ever apologize to him, I would apologize to him that I somehow did not more FIRMLY COMMUNICATE my boundary. That's the only thing I'd feel sorry for. Apparently the very important communication didn't get through his thick ass skull of his, this is not a fucking game this time around.

I dunno, it hurts me that I had to be violent, but it was very liberating too...I know I can be violent if necessary to establish I will enforce personal boundaries with violence if needed, these aren't games any longer.

Edit: I notice someone was quick with the downvote. Violence is wrong...I agree, that is a good position to have, and it's because of that shared view we have that I don't feel bad. Because no one is obligated to practice nonviolence with violent people, FULL STOP. That is non-negotiable. And these were violent people right out the gate, so you're gonna be profoundly quicker to downvote them by default and above and beyond all else before you even get close to downvoting me. Violence in response to violence, is not the problem. Because I tried as you would advocate, just sitting there angrily fuming and eating injustice after injustice forever on end, no one was giving them some HARSH consequences, and from my point of view what you advocate for, that wasn't a real option either. I have to ask...if I had more effectively instilled fear in my enemies, would that have made them not want to fuck with me? Because that would have been very welcome result in my childhood."
How do you make people understand your cptsd? What has worked for you?,51,mjjcam,8,"The past years have been heavy. I could never explain to people what was happening to me and how much I was hurting. Getting this diagnosis made me feel so good, because it explains everything. But I still struggle with feeling like I cant make people understand. I want my boyfriend to get what I am going through. I want my friends to get just the heaviness of this. Because I feel like I don't get the support I need. But I don't know how. I really dont know how.
Also I have always down played how badly I was suffering and now that I am finally admitting to the amount of pain and trying to explain, it feels like people wont believe me, because I seemed to be so okay for such a long time. But I just didn't have the words to communicate it yet and have sat through it without saying anything. I feel really lonely with this. I feel like I am carrying so much on my own. 

Whats your experience with this? Any ways that have worked well to express all of this?"
So so angry that my abuser got away with it,43,mjk078,10,"It just really really hurts, I lost most of my teen years, a relationship, several friendships and very nearly my fucking life more than once thanks to my abuser and yet she never got *any* sort of comeuppance for doing what she did not only to me as a kid but I recently found out other kids as well. She just got protected by the headmistress of my school cause they were both jesus freaks then ended up moving to another one and undoubtedly went on to abuse more kids. No comeuppance, no justice, no regrets on her part, nothing. 

And yet *I* have to deal with so much pain and hurt and anxiety and regret over lost years thanks to her and it's not fucking fair. Literally for want of a nail I could have had a normal stable life if only I'd been put in a different class in my school at the age of 5. It's something that little that changed so much of my life for the worse and I feel stupid even being upset over it as it sounds silly. And now I'm saddled with so much pent up anger and rage that has nowhere to go and it's not fair. I'm sorry for the ranting, I just needed to vent, I'll delete this if it's inappropriate."
Is C-PTSD real?,2,mk3flq,11,"So I googled and the DSM doesn’t accept CPTSD as a real disorder, i’m not invalidating any of our struggles or pains but a therapist on instagram said that what people with “cptsd” have can be childhood wounding, bad childhood experiences, depression or an accumulation of lots of such things, but when we use the term “ptsd” for our situation we rob those war veterans and others of language to use vocabulary to make sense of their situation. No I am not asking anyone to diagnose me or minimise or question the validity of their own pain. I just wanted to know what are your thoughts about this statement? I feel I have it because when I heard about this, all my other issues made sense. Let me know what you guys think, I don’t want to dismiss my own experience because of what that therapist said, any input would be appreciated.
Ps. If this feels like it goes against community rules I will take this post down. Let me know."
Is it too soon in my recovery to watch the tape,7,mjtfsz,6,"Hi everyone, I was diagnosed with C-PTSD 4 and a half years ago. My story is kind of complicated. I found out I have C-PTSD after I voluntarily commited myself,from having what I now understand were debilitating panic attacks and night terrors. I have sought therapy, but I quit going after two things happened, one my psychiatrist fell asleep during an appointment (pretty sure he was on tranquilizers) and then a few months later I ended up finding out he was going to prison for insurance fraud.The whole thing turned me off to therapy and for the past 3.5 years I've been self medicating with alcohol. I'm on day 12 sober and I am without a doubt an alcoholic. Recently I just so happened to meet a lady in the program I am in and she recognized my name. She worked with a lady who interviewed me when I was 3 years old. My meth addict of a Dad was molesting me and this lady was trying to get me to elaborate further so my Nana could press charges and throw my Dad in prison. Any ways the lady in the program told me I could watch the tape if I asked for my records to be pulled. I know ya'll aren't experts but I need advice do ya'll think its too soon for me to watch these tapes? I know trauma leads to substance abuse and the not remembering  a lot of what happened eats me up inside. I feel like I have a hole inside me and I keep filling it up with all the wrong shit. I know I might not have some epiphany or even get answers,but now that I know there are tapes. I feel like this is the closest thing I can get to closure."
DAE have to pay for their parents neglect?,16,mjokdc,12,"My parents never enforced/taught how to brush my teeth. To make things worse i had supernumerary teeth and a small jaw. Got 2 teeth pulled so i look somewhat normal. Getting braces soon but it’s a deposit of $2000 to get started then $10,000 + over 2 years. I have met someone i really like but i’m embarrassed about my teeth. I was looking to move to get away from my parents but i’m going to be in debt and set back 2 years more then my peers like i have been my whole life. And they won’t even offer a cent. Stupid teeth"
I'm in a flashback because of my counselor,13,mjotxv,10,"I tried to come out as lesbian to her and told her I would have to hookup w a woman and she (knowing I have religious trauma that we have recently worked with where I was shamed for my very being and sexuality), told me that she thought I was just confused. She stopped me from continuing what I was reading to her and said ""I've heard enough. You can stop."" 

Shes literally told me ""it's okay to make mistakes and explore"" and now that I was wanting to try to be with a woman as a hookup, she told me I might be confused from my trauma which is sexual. I told her I understood where she was coming from but that I felt so much lighter and freer and I had been so much happier since coming to terms with this. We talked in circles for about a half hour. 

She asked me, ""Do you value your body?"" I was like ""what?"" She was like ""do you value your body or find it sacred?"" I was like ""not really. It does what I want"" 

She was getting mad at me for wanting to explore and j was getting pissed off. We had JUST BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW I SHUT DOWN AND GOT TALKED TO FOR AN HOUR BY MY DAD WHEN I NEEDED SOEMTHING. then I brought this up, that I needed her to hear, and got shut down again.

I feel so hurt. So invalidated. And so sad.. I've been with her for 3 years and I am in absolute fear mode right now. Shes the only person I have and now I'm shutting down and it feels like theres no one there for me. I already feel myself shutting down. I want to kill myself. I'm in a flashback. I have a job orientation coming up and I'm PISSED AT HER FOR FUCKING PUTTING ME IN A FLASHBACK. SHE OF ALL PEOPLE SHOULD NOW HOW FUCKING FRAGILE OF A STATE IT IS TO BE IN WHEN YOU HAVE CPTSD. FUCK HER I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER I HATE HER. I WANT TO HURT HER AND CUSS HER OUT (Just anger but I'm pissed) this all hurts so bad."
Tired of Being Mature,86,mjdon5,11,"I'm 13 almost 14. Most of my childhood I've been abused. Being hit whenever almost everyday whenever I made mistakes on the piano. Being molested at 10 by father. Getting insulted and emotionally manipulated my whole life.

My parents tell me that I'm too immature. So I try to act mature. But now that I'm almost turning 14 I'm starting to realize that I never got any time to be immature and childish and innocent. My parents stole my childhood and... I'm tired. Just tired of trying to act like an adult. I wish I could be a child again, but the lost time cannot be restored.

When someone says ""She's almost 14. She should be able to manage that."", it hurts me. I don't know why, but it just does. "
I just heard my father be an asshole to a salesperson and realized it's not about me...,102,mjbydt,18,"I heard my father berate and be unreasonable toward a door-to-door salesperson today. The poor guy was just trying to do his job, make it in this difficult world, doing a difficult thing, and he received the completely undeserved cruelty of my father. My father did this because he was embarrassed by being taken advantage of by salespeople in the past, but that doesn't mean he should treat a completely unrelated person with disrespect. 

And then I made the connection that my father is unreasonable asshole to many people, and they didn't deserve it. He has anger issues and poor emotional intelligence. And that his behavior toward me throughout my life was not my fault either. It seems obvious in retrospect, but I have ""personalized"" his abuse toward me: I always interpreted it as if I deserved his behavior toward me, that I did something wrong, or that I *was* wrong and deserving of his abuse. The mind of a child tries to rationalize the behavior of their parents. 

I hope that poor salesperson isn't too negatively affected by my father's behavior and it doesn't cause him too much pain. It's not about him. It's my father."
"Struggling tonight to get some sleep, could use some advice.",3,mjupht,7,"Currently seeking a therapist after uncovering some distressing memories from childhood (and being reliably told by a witness of distressing/traumatic events that I have dates for but cannot remember at all despite the events being significant). Identifying a lot with cptsd symptoms and patterns but I've been unable to afford a therapist currently.

One of the biggest struggles I'm having currently is excessive ruminating/spiraling, especially at night before bed. I've tried every coping mechanism I can think of from previous therapy but nothing seems to help me settle. 

Can anyone offer any advice/tricks/coping tools that have helped them? My poor sleep patterns (not helped by my very late [3am] work nights) are definitely worsening my mental health and quality of life. 

Thank you in advance~"
What do normal people talk about for so long?,88,mjcs9h,24,"I don’t understand, what do they talk about? I exhaust my topics for conversation pretty quickly. When I’m with a person who makes me feel safe I might have a connection but that’s usually from me listening to them talk. I never connect to people when I try to be the active one in a conversation and it’s rare for me to have a conversation where we both talk and listen. Has any of you figured out conversations?"
Is anybody else not really career-driven?,18,mjm6yb,9,"All my life, I've been a pretty good student and I would say that I'm pretty damn good at math. I love learning, too. Despite this, I never really had a huge interest in scoring an interesting or well-paying job. I'm currently in college to become a math teacher because I want to build up my social skills and have people to talk to everyday, when I could've gone for more mathematically challenging jobs like computer science, engineering, medical field, etc. I feel as though I may have ""wasted"" some of my potential, but at the same time, I don't really care, at least not at this time in my life. Hell, I'm even fine with the idea of working a generic boring office job, as long as it pays the rent.

How does this relate to my childhood? Well, like almost all of us, I've always had a terrible home life, a terrible/nonexistent social life, and low self esteem. I want to have better self esteem, a good social life, and a good home environment (aka my own apartment) more than ANYTHING in the entire world, which puts my career on the back burner.

I've spent my fair share of time working a mundane job at a movie theater. This job was almost NEVER the cause of my emotional distress. If anything, it was a nice escape from my problems. My poor mental health has ALWAYS had to do with my poor self-esteem and personal life. Obviously, if you're working a terrible job that's affecting your mental health, you should try and find a better place to work ASAP, but what I'm saying is that for me personally, working an uninteresting (but not necessarily bad) job doesn't seem to be the problem here.

Maybe once my personal life DOES improve, my desire for a more fulfilling career will grow, but for now, I could care less about where I work because there are other things in life that I want way more than that.

Anybody else feel this way?"
Dissociating and trying to take the other person's perspective during social situations...? (Fawning and people-pleasing),8,mjpxbk,2,"I've realized this is something I do, I think I've done it most of my life, and it's kinda horrifying. 

A lot of the time when I talk to someone, it's like I can feel my attention changing in a way where I start almost observing myself somewhat in 3rd person. Especially if I've been alone and relaxes and then go to talk to someone, it's like I tense up and can feel the sudden shift. My focus shifts, and rather than being able to just be me and focus on my thoughts, I'm literally trying to figure out what I think they're thinking and how they'd want me to be, and ofen end up acting that way. I'm spending most of my brain power trying to figure out what the person thinks and what they're thinking of me, and sometimes my brain takes the thoughts as fact even if they might be inaccurate. 

The reason it's so horrifying is because it's like it  shows part of how I feel like I don't get to exist in the world as my own person. It happens so naturally to me around people. It's like the 1st person view, my sense of myself as an independent existing person and everything is just suddenly swept out from under me like a rug. Most of my own thoughts leave my mind, and I'm trying to act like this little puppet and please the other person. If I try to fight it, try to be myself and just not think about this at all... well, at times it's just impossible to do, and it feels so intensely anxiety-inducing that I have to dissociate and people-please again to keep from going crazy with anxiety. 

I don't know whether this is a people-pleasing, fawning type think, or whether it's masking (from ASD), or what.

Does anyone else do this?"
For anyone who needs hope,168,mj7v1v,26,"I posted a couple of months ago when I was (finally) diagnosed with having c-ptsd after years of therapy and having every symptom imaginable- constant anxiety, panic attacks, dissociation, insomnia, ticks, physical numbness, burn out depression....

I had to face the reality that even to this day, there was an unhealthy amount of enmeshment with my family: parents and 3 sisters. My dad is unmedicated bipolar and potentially schizophrenic, in and out of psych wards throughout my life. My mom has the beautiful narcissist/borderline combo (I also worked with her for 8 years, which broke me, she has no soul). They are emotionally abusive, and neglectful. 

My 2 younger sisters are narcissists in the making, raging, and abusive in other ways. They make crazy every chance they get. My closest sister is a gem, but she struggles to regulate her emotions, they’re explosive and usually attention seeking (she was in a bad accident, traumatic brain injury survivor).

I think I reached a point, perhaps considering my age (33), that I had no choice but to fight and finally face the family drama machine: calling them out on their shit, cutting ties, blocking numbers, creating boundaries.

I feel GREAT. I went from being a shell of a person, having never “individuated”, a lost sense of self, full of fear, to flipping my life the fuck over. 

I spent the first few months in therapy crying, having panic attacks, video journaling, writing, posting here, not leaving the house, not sleeping, a fucking mess of emotions daily: I couldn’t look at myself in the mirror, I don’t know why I deserve my husband and how he stuck around.

I woke up each day a fraction more strong, slightly more settled, and then one day I started doing things for me. I blocked them all, no warning really. I finally put up my portfolio online, created my website (after years of being a ghost graphic designer). I started and Instagram account to promote my work. Any place online that made sense to put myself out there on, I did it. And holy shit. Similar to the supportive world here on reddit, I found it in the designer corner. I’ve met so many cool people, my works been featured, I got 10 requests for work, a ton of new followers. I wake up excited about the day, tapping into a new energy source. I started to take care of people in my life that don’t cause me grief, friends/my husband, and got all the love I need back. I feel finally a sense of freedom and I can feel my feet on the ground when I walk.

Even if it’s uncomfortable, I suggest you go for it: something that’s yours and yours alone, just pour yourself into it. I don’t know how I found strength in this. But I’m much happier and I have so much more hope. 

Sending all the love to everyone here."
I never got to be a kid,16,mjlwmn,4,"I recently turned 15, and all I wish is that I can turn back time. I remember being punched and slapped if I made a mistake on the piano, and my parents making me skip dinner if I didn't win at a competition. I remember having to play with sprained pinky's during a competition because ""it was my fault I broke them right before an important competition."" While this was happening to me, my friends were hanging out at malls, going to each other's houses, playing outside after school. I remember going to school the next day and hearing about how much fun they had at sleepovers while I had to pull an all-nighter to practice piano.

My parents forced me to do piano since I was so young, (I guess it's an asian parent's thing) and it's all I have memories of. Just practicing until I fell asleep at the piano. Being woken up at 3-4 am to practice again. Being told I was lazy if I wanted to sleep in or play with friends or have fun like the other kids.

I just want to turn back time. Some people say ""I want to go back to when I was a kid and experience it again"" but I don't have any memories. But I want to try it once. I want to go shopping with my friends, have sleepovers after school, things like that. I don't want to feel left out whenever my friends talked about how much fun they had that weekend. I feel like I was never a kid, I just kinda skipped past that stage."
"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just replacement of one one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""",1610,miwsf7,91,"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

Borderlines are highly stigmatised in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. I posted it on r/BPD first ([here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/miwc67/please_do_yourself_a_favour_and_replace_the_word/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) and now I am here: the place where I feel the most understood.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.

*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**"
"Always feeling unsafe, no matter where I am. [TW: Scary/Stalking/Abuse]",16,mjlfks,7,"So, this is the year where I went no contact with my father for 10 years. Yay! But I got triggered by something (my own fault), because morbid curiosity got to me. This might be a bit jumbled, because I'm really tired.


I never feel safe, anywhere. In my own house I constantly have nightmares and intrusive thoughts about what scary people can do to me. And I wanted to vent a little bit about this.


My father was (is) a very controlling man and he went crazy lengths to limit the amount of outside contact we had. He stalked me whenever I was gone from home, but also within our home. When I was at school or at a friend's house, he'd follow me secretly to check if I'm actually still there. He'd stand outside the door, staring through the window of my bedroom door in the middle of the night (absolute nightmare fuel) and I have vague memories where he's standing in my room at night just staring at me. 


After my mom and I escaped, the stalking did not end. He'd monitor my school for years, hoping to kidnap me. Follow my mom around attempting to find our address. Patrolling the streets day and night just to find us. I had his license plate memorized, just in case I had to hide. He'd interrogate and threaten people that knew me or my mom to give him our address. He'd track down all my phone numbers and seemingly asked other criminals he knew of to track me down. He even had people at facilities that help abused women leak information about my mom and me. 


Once he found us, pulled me in his car and attempted to murder my mom and my sister by hitting their car at max speed. The only reason it failed, was because I jumped out of the car.


He stopped for a few years, until he one day randomly showed up at our front door when I still lived with my mom. Usually, I'd hide under the bed whenever he attempted to barge into our house. But this time, he saw me through the front window. He forced himself into our house and tried to touch my face. When I refused and told him to piss off because I'd call the police, his pupils dilated immediately and he attempted to attack me.


I never felt safe anywhere and I still don't till this day. Especially because police did absolutely nothing for us.


A few years ago, my father tried to bribe me with paying for a drivers license. He communicated via my mom and promised her he wouldn't seek contact. I was very apprehensive, but my mom said to take the opportunity because of financial reasons. Claiming she'd protect me from him. I quickly found out that he manipulated the driver's instructor to give him information about me, despite me strictly instructing them to NEVER give any details to him. It was a big mistake and I won't ever do that again. My mom also recognizes she made a big mistake and being absent from him for years, made her feel like she could protect me from him completely forgetting that he is genuinely insane. Realizing she had been manipulated into this as well.


I also found out that he has photos of me that he only could've gotten from immediate friends. I grew very paranoid, because all of them swore up and down not to have sent him any pictures.


And these are only my stories. He does the same to my sister. He used to stalk her at her job, allegedly mapping out where the surveillance cameras are, so he could avoid getting caught. The only reason he stopped, was because one of my sisters coworkers threatened to throw boiling oil over him.


My father is a master manipulator and a very scary individual. Police does absolutely nothing. I was watching documentaries about cult leaders and my father has always had a similar way of indoctrinating people. He starts out very nice and slowly physically and mentally abuses them more and more. He's very charismatic and manipulative. Almost every person I've known in my life that also had contact with him, betrayed me in one way or another. It's genuinely scary. Why is he allowed to walk around freely?


I never feel safe anywhere. My fear is not necessarily my father, but people like him. They're out there and that scares me. He isn't the only one."
I hate people to feel sorry for me or worry about me.,27,mjhme2,10,"I know it’s a sign of people caring about me and just want to make show their empathy, but I find it pointless because it doesn’t help instead makes me feel bad like I’m a burden or something. 

Maybe I’m looking too deep into it but that’s how I feel about it. I had too many experiences with people who felt sorry for me to make me feel like I was inadequate or inferior.

Don’t  feel sorry for me instead help me. Sorry venting 😅"
"DAE get tired of living by the standards of the world, and actually allow yourself to just give- up?",15,mjldmu,10,"I’m tired of living by the demands and standards of graduate school. Life is too short, the pandemic has shown me that. School feels like a waste. I’d rather be happy than conforming constantly and working myself to death.

I have been bumping through PhD school now for a while, 3 years, and I have ideally 3 (maybe 4) years left. The expectation for everyone is to work around the clock, all weekend long is not something I want to do anymore.

I stopped myself from doing this for a while, because I decided my health was more important. But now, I am back to working at my two jobs, reading, and writing for PhD school 7 days a week. I had great weekend/ evening boundaries. Now it’s turned into only seeing my husband at night for a few hours to eat right before bed, and early evening to bed time on the weekends. 

The program said that we would be working through every weekend. I didn’t believe that was healthy, and decided to discontinue that practice as a disabled person, but I am again. I am also under a lot of external stressors, economic, as well as familial things going on right now, too. 

I often feel as if PhD school is not meant for people that have lived through things, and/ or come from backgrounds like mine (poor rural working class, QTPOC, disabled- adhd, chronic pain/ illness disorder, CPTSD). Especially with my program existing in NYC, a city with a culture of hyper production. The expectations are to constantly work, with no economic support, no healthcare provided by the school during a pandemic, working multiple jobs, and to  just keep regurgitating. I have two months left for this semester. Then one- two years of course work (depending on if I do full loads each semester), couple of dissertation years. So, almost halfway done. But it’s been a hard several years. My health and consistent tragedies in my life have resulted in them providing even less support, among other things.

But, I think I’m done. I haven’t been able to do my self- care in weeks. I can already tell a difference in how I feel. I was doing such a good job managing my self- care, listening to what my mind and body needed. Now I’m just focused on producing for everyone, and my needs have went to the side, again. The conditions feel fertile for a flare with the high levels of stress. 

I feel trapped in academia. The economy has tanked, there aren’t any jobs, all of my work is connecting to some sort of academic something, things that I know I should be grateful for, but they are several small ones, so it’s constant working for no money. I feel like I’m trapped in suspended in animation with the PhD hanging over my head. While also dealing with disrespect and being treated poorly by people in my department for not producing like everyone else does as rapidly.

I wanted this PhD, but not now, i am honestly not sure what I want to do with it. Be a tenured professor at an institution that will perpetuate a system of over- production and disavows the care of people like me that aren’t often in PhD programs (disabled, QTPOC, working class), and other marginalized communities?

Does anyone else ever just get tired or having to be this? To be this constantly producing this/ that/ the other or you aren’t enough? Do you ever just say “I don’t care this much” and walk away? And at what point? I can’t figure it out. I won’t get this work done by the end of the semester unless I work through every weekend to the end of May. That’s two long months of not taking care of me."
Here’s why I don’t express myself to other people,17,mjk8ml,21,"What if I’m just being an asshole and getting angry over something dumb? Even if I were to express myself I don’t know how to verbalize how I feel without sounding like a dick or a robot reciting the therapy phrase “I feel x when y happens.” 
Like for example today, my friend forgot it was my birthday. I was upset about it but didn’t say anything because I felt self-important for even getting mad about it. So I was passive aggressive and quiet, which is lame also, I don’t want to be that way but I just *can’t* be direct and call people out without feeling intense shame. When he realized on his own he forgot and apologized I wanted to say “I was hoping you would’ve remembered” but then thought no, you’re just being a dramatic entitled asshole, he probably is just scatterbrained, it’s nbd. So I swallowed my anger and said nothing. 

This is a repeat root cause of a lot of relationship issues I’ve had. I don’t want to build up resentment for anyone but I just can’t seem to express any anger or hurt without feeling shitty about it. 

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you work around it?

Thank you in advance"
Can't function after retraumatized by medical issues,31,mjgb9h,6,"TW: medical trauma, suicide, fear of death and suffering, existential crisis, drug addiction

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This is going to be long, I apologize. If anybody can lend any support or words of wisdom, I would appreciate it. I need it very badly. I think I also just want to get my story down on paper because at this point it's too long and complicated to explain verbally and I just want to get it out somewhere. TLDR because it ended up being even longer than I expected: life was severely fucked up by medical issues, I've been clawing my way back ever since, medical issues are back and I am mired in a severe existential depression and can't escape constant intrusive anxious thoughts about future inevitable suffering and death.

So I am a 36 year old woman living in the US. My adult life has been defined by a series of serious medical issues: when I was 18, I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and struggled with that hard (in a single year I would have multiple hospitalizations due to flares) through my 20s. When I was 25, I had a small bowel resection that left me with an ostomy (this was reversed in three months thank goodness). Before and after the surgery I was on Remicaid, which is a biologic IV drug that suppresses your immune system and helps some people with the Crohn's symptoms. Unfortunately this drug was most likely why I was diagnosed with leukemia when I was 27 as leukemias/lymphomas are a known side effect of the drug (I was aware of this when I was on it but was desperate to control my symptoms and my doctors said it was a good option). I had chemo and a bone marrow transplant. 8 months later, while I was doing better but still recovering, I developed a neuromuscular condition called Guillain-Barre syndrome and lost my muscle control up to my chest - I wasn't on a vent and could still use my arms, but couldn't turn over in bad, was incontinent, had to relearn how to walk. I was in the hospital for months recovering from that.

Ever since then (until recently) I've been physically healthy. Mentally I've been a fucking mess for the last ten years. While all this medical stuff was happening I was actually pretty stoic but it has all completely changed the course of my life in a way that I don't think I'll ever recover from financially or emotionally: I was in my last semester of law school when I was diagnosed with leukemia and I managed to graduate and even pass the bar exam while I was recovering from the transplant. But I've never worked as a lawyer (why will become clear shortly) and I am in hundreds of thousands of dollars of educational debt. I'm positive I will die still owing this money.

I came out of the hospital for the GBS completely emotionally dependent on oxycodone. I see this addiction as being 100% my fault. I knew I ""liked"" painkillers because I frequently had to legitimately be on them for my Crohn's flares and for me they had the nice side effect of euphoria in addition to managing my pain. I'm not sure how they ended up being ordered for me during the GBS hospitalization because I don't remember being in pain or complaining I was, but I was offered them everyday and I took them with kind of a ""why not"" attitude because they made it easier to zone out and relax and be content doing nothing but sit in a hospital bed and read or cross stitch. When I was discharged I was given a huge bottle of them and continued to use them in the same way, until I started getting rebound headaches which were horrible. I ended up flushing them one day during an argument with my boyfriend but it killed me to do it. We broke up shortly thereafter and I had the great idea of starting to strip - our upstairs neighbor was an ex-stripper and made it sound great and like i'd make a ton of money, finding a professional/legal job felt overwhelming with the huge gap on my resume and I didn't want to sit in an office anyways, and yes I wanted to get my hands on some more oxy.

I ended up stripping full-time for two years. I enjoyed it the first year but I had absolutely no mental health care during this time and relied extremely heavily on alcohol, coke, and oxy to self-medicate my anxiety and depression. Eventually I burned out and managed to get a good job at a consulting firm doing database work. I was able to put down the coke, the oxy became a once in a while treat. I had a good year doing this, then my boss left at work, they brought in someone new who I found extremely difficult to work with, I broke up with my boyfriend, and my mental health crashed hard and fast. I found a therapist and a psychiatrist, but I was in crisis and my workplace made it so much worse by being extremely unsupportive. I was told I was abusing the sick leave policy, I was called in for a meeting where my manager questioned my ability to do my job because I ""seemed so unhappy all of the time"", and I was eventually put on a performance improvement plan. The PIP was too much and I quit very shortly after that. Within the month I was in the psych ward for the first time because I was suicidal.

The next few years after that consisted of a downward slide that I'm still trying to climb out of. Basically I moved home, my relationship with my narcissistic mother and enmeshed siblings came to a head, I returned to the psych ward twice, was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, went to rehab for substance abuse, and cut off contact with my family while I was living in a sober 3/4 house and trying to do NA. I had to cut them off for my mental health but it has been very very very hard to function with no support network and grappling with my mental health and substance abuse issues. I did not have a good experience with the 12 steps: I left the first 3/4 house because they were bullying me for my sexuality and for dating a trans guy, moved in with said guy only to get locked out by him in the middle of the night, went back to rehab because I had nowhere else to go, and then was kicked out of my next 3/4 house because I missed a house meeting because I was in an urgent care after getting heat stroke at work. I crashed with an acquaintance for about a month after this but the situation was unstable from the jump and I ended up leaving for a bed at a domestic violence shelter. This turned out to be a blessing because they were able to get me into an income-based apartment, where I still am to this day.

As you can probably tell, I haven't felt safe for a very long time. I have been clawing so goddamn hard to be stable again. While I was at the shelter I got a job waitressing at a local diner chain, did that for two years (including working overnight shifts which were not good for me), and then was able to get a REALLY good serving job at a fine-dining restaurant...two months before covid hit and the restaurant was shut down. I delivered for Amazon for a year after that which was horrible for my mental health. Once I moved into my current apartment I've been seeing continuously seeing therapists and psychiatrists in an effort to get control of my mental health with basically no noticeable results. I have not really had space to heal or come out of crisis mode and I have not been lucky with finding a therapist skilled enough to help me navigate this process. The borderline makes it extremely difficult because I'm frequently in a huge amount of emotional pain and the only thing I'm capable of doing when I'm like that is dissociating on reddit for hours at a time. My current therapist suggests ways to ground myself and various DBT skills but none of them are helpful during those periods where it feels like my skin is on fire and I want to explode into a million tiny pieces with the rage, frustration, and fear I feel.

Ok so now we come to the present: three weeks ago, I am relatively happy because I have found a job working from home as a paralegal and worked my last shift at Amazon ever. I had had a weird day of crampy stomach pains that worried me because it reminded me of Crohn's pain but i tell myself to not freak out because it's probably just something I ate. I sip on clear broth for a day and the pain passes. Unfortunately, the crampy stomach pains return a week later, become worse throughout the day, and around 11 PM that night I am in intolerable pain and vomiting. My SO calls the paramedics and I am admitted to the hospital. The next day I'm told that I'm obstructed and I need another small bowel resection.

I cannot describe what a nightmare this hospitalization was. The doctors were cold, robotic, and completely unempathetic. The first thing they told me was that my Crohn's was back and after the surgery I would need to go back on medication ""and probably biologics"". I FREAKED out and asked them if they were even aware I had a history of leukemia??? ""Yes we're aware."" I was terrified and panicking. The nurses were completely overworked and burned out. Nobody seemed like they communicated at all, doctors would say one thing in the morning, something completely opposite in the afternoon, and when I said ""but Doctor So and So said this thing that's completely opposite???"" they would just be like ""oh we didn't know that, ok we'll have to talk to him."" So what would have happened if I hadn't said anything??? For two days they said there was a chance I could avoid surgery by getting an enema and doing a balloon procedure to blow up the obstructed part, then the day it was supposed to happen it did not happen because there was a ""miscommunication"" about the enema I was supposed to receive the day before which I did not receive, and because of the miscommunication they couldn't do the procedure and oh well now I'm definitely having surgery. Which might leave me with an ostomy, they couldnt say for sure (I did not end up with an ostomy thank goodness). And this whole time I have a huge gauge NG tube in to suck the crap out of my stomach which made it virtually impossible to be comfortable or to sleep. I had that damn tube in for six days until I finally snapped and insisted they take it out. The first two days it was in it pressed on sinuses so badly I was in 8/10 pain and couldn't do anything but lie in bed with an icepack on my face. I BEGGED the doctors to do something to make the tube more comfortable and they just said ""we know it's uncomfortable but you need it."" finally they agreed to switch it to the other nostril while i was under for surgery, lo and behold no more sinus pain when i woke up. they could have switched it the whole time, they just didn't want to be bothered. It took hours and me losing my shit at them after surgery to get the PCA pump set up for my pain control (i had been assured before my surgery that that was how my pain control would be managed, i had been really worried because they were not taking my pain and discomfort seriously). I was in there for a week and the entire time I was just suffering through these horrible feelings of nonstop panic, isolation, trapped in my body, trapped in the hospital, and the thought that NOBODY could or would help me. My heart rate would randomly spike up to 130 bpm. i had ativan ordered but it barely took the edge off.

anyways I got out of the hospital a week ago and I have been a mess ever since. The surgery went well and my wound is healing. They saw no active signs of Crohn's disease but I've been to see the GI they set me up with since then and while she doesn't think I need to immediately jump back on medication, she does think I need to be very closely monitored because I am at high risk for developing more problems. The inside of my head is an absolute hellscape. All I can think about was how helpless and trapped I felt in the hospital and about what kind of similar suffering awaits me and my SO in the future when we become sick and ultimately die, I have especially fearful and intrusive thoughts about us developing a devastating degenerative illness like ALS or Alzheimers or Huntington's or something like that. I'm terrified of the possibility that things might get so bad I might need to choose between suicide or extreme physical suffering, and how to make that choice because I'm terrified of death. I've struggled with this kind of existential panic and dread ever since I had leukemia but it's never been this bad.

I have no appetite and can barely eat, anything I try to eat is disgusting to me. Obviously I've been retraumatized and my anxiety is out of control but I don't know what to do about it. I saw my therapist last week and she was completely unhelpful, just offered the same old shit about how i should try to be mindful and ground myself by doing stuff like ""petting your cats and focus on how soft their fur feels, listen to some relaxing music or a guided meditation"". I told her I didn't think those tools were powerful enough to help me and she just told me ""they are, you just might have to practice them a lot at first"". She is supposedly extremely trauma informed. I've tried them and they do NOT work, the intrusive thoughts and panic are too strong. I've called a few other therapists, including people out of network that do stuff like somatic bodywork, biofeedback, and polyvagal therapy, but no one has called me back yet. I have another bottle of oxy i was discharged with and I haven't taken any for the past four days because I haven't needed it for pain and I know better than to use it to self-medicate, but I want to so goddamn bad. i feel...not just dead inside but like i'm crushed and rotting. i'm so so angry that this is happening to me after everything else i've been through.

if you made it through all that, thank you for reading. i am very grateful i have a place to come where people understand."
Daydreaming as a coping mechanism due to abuse.,34,mjfq8q,10,"After a lot of observation and meditation over my daydreaming habits, I've come to the conclusion that they're there exclusively for comfort. From the moment I wake up to the moment i go to bed, they ""activate"" to soothe. Like, I know it has to do with my inner child.

Dayreaming is my earliest for of a coping mechanism. Even before I got so anxious to have panic attacks, I was already daydreaming about things I wanted in my life but somehow couldn't parse that then. They started out as me with my ""tribe"" of sorts, then they turned me into a character I liked and related to and their relationship with their ""tribe"".

Lastly, I 've noticed that thinking about my daydreams as coping mechanisms makes me feel extremely, extremely sad. The other day I was listening to Arsnonist's lullabye by Hozier (one of my favorite songs of his) and reading an analysys of the lyrics. The writer said that the character ""needs"" the lullabye (the song) to fall asleep and be calm and that realization sent me into a crying spell.

I don't know what it is but i wanted to include that here. Maybe I feel a lot of pity towards that kid back then. There's something about adults using ""kid things"" to cope that make me emotional: stuffed toys, normal toys, lullabyes, drawings, poems, blankets, nightlights, comfort, favorite foods, special items, bracelets, you name it. Or maybe my inner kid wants those things, feels comfort in seeing other people struggling crumble in such vulnerable ways too. The tenderness, warmth and softness in such a hard, cold world makes them want to reach out maybe.

Anyway, I found that certains times of the day and events trigger them. We have:

1. waking up: I daydream a bit about waking up happy and warm next to someone i love, or something nice through a character. This way, waking up isn't as daunting and painful as it is if i just get up get up wihtout the emotional help. Getting up makes the daze dissipate and I forget I ever daydreamed.
2. Helplessness: Sometimes, I feel like what I'm doing is wrong. Not necessarily because my inner critic is telling me so but because what I'm trying to achive doesn't come out the way i want it to. Maybe I feel dissociated and it's hard to talk. It might just be my freeze response so of course I start daydreaming almost involuntarily, like breathing shallowly while anxious. My daydreams here consist of a character doing either something unrelated or going through the same thing and being comforted by others. in short, they aren''t hopeful in tone. Can become self-loathing fests.
3. Going to bed: I have a feeling this is about processing what happened during the day. If i learned something new, I'm going to have a conversation with a character or through a character and come to my own conclusions. If i feel like crap over my inability to do something or not ""making enough progress"" the daydream will become about my character being from mistreated to being punished for doing questionable to evil things. Tragic villain kind of things.
4. Writing. Ususally fueled by things i watch and things i learn. I start to incorporate it into my characters and worlds and make something else out of that. I ususally try to put them to paper but don't always succeed.

I don't know if this post will help anyone. Frankly, I just want to reach out and see if anyone has a similar experience. Daydreams are so intrinsic to how i interact with the world it scares me, because it's not good or bad, it just is and it's never been less than that. If anyone took it away I'd feel defiled and wrong. I'd feel vulnerable and weak.

Maybe i should bring more outward tenderness to my life, maybe that can reduce my reliance on conceptualizing a happy world where my traumatized body swears there isn't one."
"At almost 29, I finally have the courage to separate from my toxic family.",84,mj9x92,13,"Yesterday was a really big moment for me and I felt like I should share. The words that I said to my Mother yesterday have needed to be said since I tried to take my life as a teen as result of her physical and emotional abuse. I never said anything though because I’ve always felt like she didn’t think what she did was “bad” or “overboard”.

So I just decided I was gonna be a good daughter and just love my Mom unconditionally anyways. After all, she had a rough upbringing too and damaged people damage people. That’s the excuse that I’ve been telling myself this whole time. I’ve been so afraid to leave the 3 remaining family members that I have that I’ve never held anyone accountable for their actions around me. I’ve always been afraid to be honest with her because she would hit me over the littlest things- she was diagnosed with BPD by 3 doctors but never sought real help or took her meds. 

But yesterday was different. Yesterday she tried to tell me to my face that “children remember things a lot more dramatically than what actually happened”, and that “back in the day getting spanked with a belt or hand was just normal”. But she didn’t do just that. She hit me for consecutive days, pushed me so hard when I was 8 that my small child sized head made a hole in the wall behind the couch, she told me that she “didn’t remember” dragging me down the concrete steps of our CO home by my hair when I was 9 and just so many other instances where she went wayyyy too far. 

Basically what happened after the argument was the typical scenario where no one asked me if I was okay, just coddled the crying abuser. So I left and now I’m crashing at my only friends office! And I can’t tell you guys how well I slept last night despite feeling like I ruined everything yesterday. 

I have (1) friend, my BFF, and she happens to be amazingly supportive and has always validated my feelings. Guys, I CANNOT stress how important it is to have at the very minimum just one person in your life who validates you and you can talk about your feelings openly with. I honestly don’t know if I would’ve been strong enough mentally to leave this situation and I know that just having that one good influence has made a world of difference for me. 

I say if you need to say something to your abuser and you *want* to... do it!! They deserve to hear it and be held accountable. And if they choose not to become better people with the information given to them then we just have to walk away and live our own lives. I don’t feel angry that my Mother pretends like what she did was okay. I pity her because I know that the soul cannot grow without admitting your faults. Thinking of it that way has helped me tremendously. 

Idk where life is going to take me but I trust in the healing process and I know that a big part of self love is surrounding yourself with good people who don’t gaslight you or try to make you feel dramatic for feeling pain. This month I ditched an emotionally abusive ex, told my Mom how I felt finally, and I couldn’t feel stronger or happier than I do right now even though I’m the most alone I’ve ever been. 

To all my fellow humans on here: You CAN make it without them. You are good enough, smart enough, and talented enough. What you do with this life is up to you and no one can take that from you!! You are a resilient fighter and even if you have no one currently in your life that’s good for you- we’re here for ya! 

Thanks for reading, stay strong everyone 💚

How have you coped with realizing your family never honored your truth?,44,mjdzkg,8,"Hi, friends.

I've come to the realization over the last couple of weeks that my truth was rarely, if ever, honored growing up and even periodically in my adult life.

I'm realizing now, at 32, why I get so quiet at family functions.  It's because if I ever spoke my truth or let an authentic part of me show, it was invalidated.

I have one aunt and one uncle who were particularly damaging.  I majored in music education in college and I currently have a very rewarding career as a band and orchestra director.  The aunt once got in an argument with me because I told her I didn't particularly like one style of music.  She also chastised me, once, for not wanting to perform on demand.  She also once argued with me about my musical knowledge.  This aunt is a lawyer who has her own issues with having to be right about everything... 

The uncle refused to respect my boundaries around sharing my coming out with my grandmother.  I set a clear boundary saying that I wanted to share this with my grandmother when I was ready and he got angry at me when I told him that it wasn't his place to share.  When my dad defended me (yay dad!), he said ""fuck you both"" and stormed off.  This was at my cousin's wedding.  I spent the rest of the event in a dissociative rage and I truly don't remember that day as a good day, which is a shame.

I'm realizing that my family is made up of very judgy WASPs.  I have another aunt that once got annoyed at me for not putting tortilla chips in a decorative bowl for the homemade dip I made for Christmas dinner.  Seriously petty bullshit. 

I have another aunt that never once came to one of my performances in undergrad or to one of the performances of the semi-pro group that I play with, but the second her daughter-in-law (who my cousin later divorced) played a recital at Carnegie Hall, she was there.

This is also compounded by flashbacks of my ex who was truly manipulative and preyed on my innocence.  He was gaslighting, character assassinating, and awful to me.  Truly, he was a predator of my innocence.  Any trait of mine that was valued and loved by my friends (and even loved by my whacky, dysfunctional family), he shot down and attempted to invalidate.  Thankfully, I cut him out.  I broke my attachment to him, blocked him on all platforms, and asserted my deserving something better.

At first glance,  the family things all seemed to be innocuous irritations to me (the ex was definitely serious emotional trauma).  But, over the last few weeks, I've realized that all of this has been extremely damaging.  Couple all of this with my mom being simultaneously narcissistic and enmeshed with me and the work I've had to do to deconstruct the walls I used to protect myself from that whole mess, and I am exhausted.

I feel like I haven't been at peace since I started to unpack all of this and its impacting every facet of my life.  My Critic, installed by my judgy, WASPy family, and bolstered by my awful ex, tries to tell me that I don't feel the right things for my partner (which I do, because I have felt all the ""correct"" emotions and accompanying physiological responses), that I'm a bad teacher (which is crap, as my groups consistently earn top marks at performance assessments and my marching band is a state champion group), and that I should be ashamed for feeling this way and for developing cPTSD when compared to my partner who does not have cPTSD but had a similar difficult upbringing.

It also externalizes in the form of jealousy for people with ""normal"" families.  I see families having meals together, having fun on vacation, enjoying funny family group texts, and people genuinely looking forward to family events and instead of feeling happy for them I feel jealous.  It's just GROSS to feel this way.

I'm very slowly unpacking this with my therapist and through my own work in journaling and somatic awareness.  I had a really great 3 weeks where I felt content and at peace, and then I had a flashback.  I'm trying not to let it ruin me, but, man, do I miss that peace and joy I was feeling just a few short days ago.

Does anyone have any advice?  I'm working to not let the Critic self-punish but, my god, is it difficult and exhausting.

Thank you in advance for any advice, friends."
Feeling pressured to heal in a timeframe? (Pandemic-related),42,mjdoim,9,"(This is a throwaway account!) Does anyone feel pressure to ""heal"" or ""resolve their issues"" by the time COVID ends? The pandemic has been terrible, but it has given me the opportunity to rest and heal my nervous system as I *just* barely get by on unemployment. Now I feel like I have to get my stuff together before it runs out. 

Also, I've been on an immunosuppressant during the entire pandemic and I've been diligent about keeping my distance from others in our high risk area. I feel once summer comes, people are going to want to be social, celebrate, and spend time, but I'm realizing I might not be ready.

I've spent the last three years physically destabilized by work on my C-PTSD, and along the way picked up a diagnosis of MS, followed by severe case of PNES and other somatoform issues which have caused me to live on day-to-day basis. Thanks to serious work with a two therapists and a neurologist who works on somatoform disorders, I've gone from having trouble forming sentences and sleeping 16 hours a day to what is starting to look like a normal life. I've made so much progress during COVID. However, there is still SO MUCH more to be done. I am just now stabilizing, and the phase of remembrance and grief has just begun.

Part of me feels like, ""you've had three years of illness–wrap it up and get it over it, already!"" But I am scared of having to heal within the hustle of normal life."
I finally think I'm going to be okay!,15,mjjuvo,6,"I've been in counselling (for childhood SA) now for 14 weeks (1 hour a week) and up until literally this week I was starting to lose hope a bit and it didn't feel like it was going anywhere. Like I was finding it helpful to work through other childhood issues but not the the actual reason I was there.

Then I had a memory come back, which is the first time it's ever happened to me and it's essentially me telling someone for the second time that something was happening, I mulled it over for the entire week before I saw the counsellor again and gleaned all I could from it, or so I thought.

It was the longest and deepest discussion we've had to date and it was incredibly helpful. He helped me see the significance in trying to tell someone for the second time (first time went terribly, think lists of anger and no talking), that I mustn't have been happy or wanted it or been a willing participant if I tried to tell someone for the second time what was going out despite how the first time went.

For the first time ever I said the words ""maybe this means it wasn't my fault and I didn't want it, maybe I'm not bad"". While I know there's a maybe in there and I'm not at a stage where I could take that word out, it's the first time I've ever dared to think that and for the first time ever I actually think I have a chance to heal and move on properly from this.

It's very cliché, but I've felt a lightness in my chest since the session, and I've been able to make steps to talk to a friend how I've found the session and it's almost like the massive ball of shame I've carried since I was 5/7 (I'm 24 now) is finally getting a bit smaller and I honestly didn't believe I'd ever get here or that it would help this much.

Hope that all makes sense! I've just felt so positive about the progress this week and just feel like I could shout from the rooftops that maybe this is it, and maybe everything is gonna be okay."
What is trauma,0,mjwjfi,3,
Should I ask my parents?,1,mjwi9l,1,"I’ve been having a lot of emotional flashbacks lately and nightmares too, and I feel like I’m getting closer to the root cause of everything. Opened up in therapy and what not, found a couple of triggers I have, you name it. But, I cut contact with one side of my family, that I believe are the cause (well my parent, even though their relatives weren’t the best either). But I’m scared to ask my other parent about my childhood. They say they think it was okay, that it was a good childhood, but then, I wouldn’t be like I am right? Something was wrong, but I can’t name it. So I would like to know, if you guys were in my place, would you try to ask your parent about it? Not just general questions, but I have some concrete ones to ask. I’m just afraid."
"I had a ""set back"" recently which has brought back so many feelings and thoughts that I realize I'm not as far in my recovery as I thought/would like.",4,mjqiek,8,"(update below post :-))  


It's okay and I'm using the weekend to ground myself into the present. It's working and I am so grateful. Life is good right now and I am doing the best I have ever done.  My set back was really an emotional flashback and I was triggered by someone I really look up to.

But damn, did I get thrown through a loop and did I start digging up the past to help explain my intense reaction to a normal conversation.  I think I figured it out but then I was left with some feelings of guilt (over my reaction) and sadness (for all that I have been through).

The triggering event was a critique I got on an assignment that I worked very hard on.  The past includes lots of emotional abuse and neglect.  So many times I was made to feel like I wasn't good enough but I got through it because my emotions were shut off.  Fast forward to the present, I feel.  I feel good, mostly.  I was so surprised when I felt so hurt and betrayed with the feedback and how quickly I abandoned my own critique of how I did well and how intensely I focused on the negative points.  It scared me that a kind, nice person that I look up to was able to trigger such awful feelings of inadequacy from within.  I feel bad for making them feel like they did something wrong when it was the abuse I endured and how I'm not completely ""over"" it and how I'm still working on healing.

I've worked hard in therapy to get to where I am now and WHAM. Not a slap in the face but hit by a truck. Now I know why I was nervous about the assignment -- it made me so vulnerable.  By the way, it was a presentation.  After years of getting picked apart by my parents, but my dad was worse, I still am so insecure.  I try not to be, I try to build myself up, I try to be kind to myself, and I am still successful (in general)... but this. this was so hard.  Even though I did well, I only heard negative comments.. I felt myself going to a negative place and asked for reassurance.  Reassurance came in the form of annoyance.  This person had NO CLUE what I've been through and didn't realize how much that would sting.

I hide so much.  I want to be ""normal.""  I don't want my past to haunt me nor hold me back. I don't want to dig through the past to explain why I am this way today. I want to be able to receive criticism knowing that I still did a great job and the criticism isn't about being inadequate but a way to be better although not completely necessary because if I gave the same presentation again it would still be good.

When I explained, they were kind.  They asked how they could help. They were truly understanding (as much as they could be) and they honestly tried.  This is not how my parents would have handled being confronted with ACTUAL abuse.  I have always tried to go and figure this out on my own (possibly to my own determent) .  They thanked me for sharing information and brainstormed ways to work with me in the future.

I am fortunate and grateful I am in this place today... and I'm adult who can feel and reflect on their own emotions.  I can have open and honest conversations with people who are not abusive.  I am closer to my goals than ever.  I am doing so well and I only continue to grow and become more loving toward myself.  I will get there.  This was a reminder that I can be more kind to myself especially when I'm in a vulnerable situation.  


\*\*UPDATE\*\*    
After ruminating but keeping afloat with grounding.. through questioning my every interaction with everyone since childhood (okay, not really -- but close) over the weekend, I had a scheduled therapy appointment today and OMG I feel so much better.  Not quite 100% yet bc I still feel a little embarrassed about getting triggered in the 1st place but it was a really good appointment with my therapist.  

Therapist agreed that it brought back so many feelings from childhood and she pointed out that I look up to this person like the father I never had but needed.    


I feel much less sad about the emotional abuse from childhood when I realized just how fucked up my dad was, how he blamed me for his shortcomings, how he never owned his shit, and how he abused my mom(his 2nd wife), his 1st wife, stalked a young woman, but yet made himself out to be some great amazing guy that everyone else loved (even my brother I grew up with thinks he was the most amazing person on the planet).    


When I think about how awful my dad was in general, I realize just how innocent I was.  My therapist asked if I thought about writing a letter to the younger versions of myself about how we're doing okay and we've come a long way and that we're safe now... it made me tear up.  To think that I could let my younger self know that she isn't alone made me realize just how alone I felt then.  There is so much pain packed away here.  


Up until now, I've focused on my dad's episodes of psychosis and how frightening it was to be in his care during those times.  Now, I realize that the lasting pain I feel today is less about a handful of instances where he was off his medication, but the majority of the time when he was picking me apart and convincing me I was to blame for his negative and abusive treatment toward me and that I would never be good enough.  


I am happy to say that today turned out pretty good.  I have work to do on myself but I want to stop the cycle of my dad's abuse so much.  I don't want him to haunt me -- he's done enough damage.  I'm ready to face the world unhinged from my shitass dad, lol, and I deserve to be free from the inadequacy he instilled upon me.  
"
is there still hope for me?,3,mjrbzt,3,"trigger warning for all types of child abuse, drug use, and poverty

so, i was abused from when i was baby up until i was fourteen. mainly my mom was hopped up on drugs most of the time so my step dad could get away with pretty much anything he wanted- there were few nights where i wasn't bribed into touching him just so i could finally eat something- i can't remember going to sleep without wondering if i would wake up to him on top of me

we didn't have a lot of money and we lived in a shitty little apartment where all of this occurred. he was also a narcissist and every conversation  was dominated by him, i never got to have my own opinion and if i tried to i'd be shut down instantly. i was neglected as well, as i was barely fed and wore the same clothes day after day, even to school. my parents never bothered with affection and never cared for my interests, and even made me sleep on their floor if i ever had a nightmare, rather than in bed with them. the only thing i ever remember getting from my parents that was remotely ""expensive"" was my ds, other than that they always found a way to be cheap with me, even on christmas and my birthday i would always be dissapointed. they made me feel guilty for wanting more from life, whenever i was provided almost no enrichment whatsoever- i had not a single family trip or expirience with these people. we barely got out of the apartment and i was stuck there most of the time. 

i got out of there and my mom didn't believe anything i told her about what he did to me, and she tried to make my blood family shun me for it. she made it seem like i wanted to tear our family apart, whenever i was just desperately trying to get her help.. but now that i'm older i'm starting to realize she probably never really loved me at all, not in the way that a mother should. she gave me less than the bare minimum and now, i get to deal with severe mommy issues on a regular basis.

i live in the same small town as them still and neither of them faced any legal consequence even after two years of me desperately trying to get justice. i gave up, because unfortunately the system is just not suited for survivors, and it was not helping me to heal at all.. i think it really hindered the process actually. please do not comment about me taking any legal action, because that's not what i'm looking for. i just want to feel better.

i feel so tired nowadays, i'm seventeen and i've barely progressed through recovery. i'm in a better home now and have been since i was fourteen, but i'm terrified that i may not be able to progress in life in general because of this massive weight on my shoulders. i have to graduate late because of this too, because my focus is so thrown off that even the smallest assignment exhausts me. it takes hours sometimes to do them, and i just.. cant.

i haven't been able to talk about anything specific to any therapist or anyone in general without choking up and hesitating, and i've only ever told one person any specifics. i cant even remember most of it because i was so hungry and tired and dissociated all of the time that it's all just so blurry..

i got into using drugs to numb my pain recently, however i got caught and now i'm suffering with withdrawal as well, which really sucks honestly, i feel somewhat worse than before i started using and i regret it. but i just feel so helpless that i didn't know what else to turn to- i have support people but as i said i've rarely spoken about any of this to any of them, and i don't know how i could now because i'm so secluded that i barely even talk to them anymore..

is there still hope for me? am i a lost cause? can i really heal from fourteen years of repetitive, daily child abuse?"
How does anyone successfully date?,23,mjg8zn,7,"I have PTSD, not sure about CPTSD but the other sub auto-deleted my post. Anything can set me off . I have hyper vigilance and I can only sleep alone. Lately I've had to deal with guys who get hurt feelings when I don't want to sleep over, don't invite them over my apartment or want to become a part of their life early on, and it makes them think I just want something casual. I don't want something casual, I just don't want to get hurt again. I need to take things slowly. I try to explain it to them in a simple way but I'm always scared of over sharing and they just brush me off. Guys ask for Instagram and social media which I don't have and they don't know how to respond when I can't give them my profile. Sometimes a guy from online dating tries to invite me to a party when we barely even met, and the guy who raped me did that. I'm so suspicious of people who invite me to parties or to meet their friends. Then when one tiny argument comes up, those same people are willing to throw me out like garbage and never speak to me again. How can they have the audacity to invite me into their life and pretend like they wanted me? I wanted to be open to letting people in again but every time I try it takes too long for them and they become tired of me, I start to resent them for being all the same and I can feel their annoyance with me. It's exhausting trying to be happy around somebody all the time. No one wants to be around a miserable person but I'm not happy when I feel pressured at all. How did you find someone who respects you and your boundaries who you can feel safe around?"
Tips for coping when hyper-vigilance is triggered?,13,mjje39,3,"Hi guys,

This is my first post. I am in therapy but obviously, with the long weekend, my therapist isn’t available until Tuesday (when we have our regular appointment anyhow). 

My hyper-vigilance surrounding death got triggered last night and today I am just completely drowning in that feeling one gets after experiencing trauma. (**TW: suicide**) A lot of my trauma comes from having found my mom mid-suicide attempt and saving her life, I only found her cause I got a “bad feeling” and went to check on her. Obviously this created years of hyper-vigilance, worsened by my OCD, and I’ve worked hard to overcome it. Last night that hyper-vigilance was triggered again, not regarding her but another even more dear loved one (my very old dog), and I’m a bit lost on how to cope, with no professionals to discuss tools with for a few days to come. Edit: I was able to overcome my past hyper-vigilance by processing the trauma that caused it — right now I’m so overwhelmed that I can’t even remember if I have any actual tools or strategies. 

I have some responsibilities and social obligations to attend to tonight and over the weekend. Does anyone have any tips for coping with an extreme sense of being triggered and hyper-vigilant?

Thanks so much 💖"

"TW- starting to get suicidal thoughts again, I think",7,mjml36,3,"Hello all, hope you are doing well :)   

I am currently not in a good head space right now. About two months ago I had some pretty bad suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life. Ever since then, I went to an inpatient facility and got on some medication for depression, and the suicidal thoughts went away.

Now, it's been roughly a month since I was admitted there, and I think I'm starting to get them again. I'm not actively thinking of them, nor do I want to do it or have a plan for it. However, my interest and attention towards suicide have recently increased, and I sometimes get intrusive thoughts of when I used to have those suicidal thoughts. 

I am not certain what I aim to accomplish with this post. I am trying some coping methods, like listening to music, going outside, exercise, reading, etc. However, they haven't really been helping. I think the only way things will change soon is if I were somehow able to drop everything and go somewhere else, preferably a place that is full of nature. Albeit, it is not possible for me at the moment.

If any of you have any advice for coping with them, I would appreciate it. I don't really respond well for some reason to sentimental posts or posts of encouragement. Not that I want to, of course, but it would seem as if my mental faculties, while capable of processing them on an empirical level, simply cannot internalize them, so they kind of just go overboard.

Thanks once again for any help, my friends! I hope you yourselves heal well in this crazy, short, and chaotic time and space we call life :)"
The experience of taking my inner child to Wilderness Therapy.,54,mj9v6k,3,"A few years ago I went to train as a Wilderness therapist in the Southern U.S.. I sort of felt guilty though because I wasn't going there with intentions of taking the job. I was going there because I wanted to have the experience of getting therapy for my inner child.

For our first part of training, We would spend three days deep in the woods of North Carolina experiencing what it would be like for the students. For those three days, I was able to be 12 again.

During the training we learned how to make a fire using only wood, how to create a flint stone, how to properly Leave No Trace, how to use the environment as a tool for therapy and so much more. I was paired up with two other trainees, and one of them was named,and I kid you not, ""Destiny"".

I also made many mistakes during this trip and I was shocked to notice that my trainer helped me through things and didn't make fun of me or ridicule me....Maybe making mistakes is part of the learning process, and that's how you get better.

The most important steps came at the last day. There was trouble back at base camp and our trainer had to get back ASAP. The only problem is we were a good nine miles deep in the woods, it was pouring rain and we had a ton of gear to bring back.

As we were starting to head back, it began to pour. I'll never forget my trainer turn to me and he had this big smile and said, ""You have no idea how good this is for you!""

I thought he was out of his goddamn mind and was actually a little scared. How could walking 9 miles in the pouring rain with 50 lb of gear be a good thing???

When I got back to the base camp and collapsed on the floor, I kind of realized where he was going. We had just overcame an incredibly difficult thing, and we did it as a team. We didn't let anybody quit and we supported one another. And when we got back, we shared some ice cream and huddled up by the heater. It was just Breyers, but it tasted like Carvel from Heaven. I swear I could taste each individual vanilla bean. It was so sweet to appreciate something after going through a difficult process, especially with support around me. We all fell asleep on the floor in our sleeping bags and it was one of the most peaceful nights of my life.

Before I left the owner pulled me in and told me that originally he didn't think I was going to make it or that he would offer me a job. He said I was a bit awkward and attention-grabbing at the start, and I appreciated his honesty because no one has ever done that before with me. Constructive criticism can be a good thing, and I took his words to Heart. I turned down the job offer, but I was so happy that I got to give my inner child some therapy and experiences that helped him grow and be nurtured."
Just screaming into the void.,9,mjku1l,5,I feel so alone and wrong and out of place. I wouldn't wish any of this on my worst enemy.
don't know if I have CPTSD but it seems a good place to post to,1,mjv1om,1,"and I've been thinking a lot about stuff that happened in my youth. Every time I do that it makes me want to cry. Also that voice in my head saying I'm exaggerating and then trying to think about other's childhood, trying to convince myself mine was different and not normal..  thoughts like ""what did the girls in my highschool did by then? Did they experience the same shit I did? like being in the street all day, hanging out with bad people, even rapists? Is that normal? Having a devastated home?""

And then I think it all boiles down to my need to be acknowledged, that people acknowledge the pain I've been through.. I believe the only remedy though is me recognizing the amount of shit i've been through and being compassionate towards my anger and sadness. It's the only thing that can help as there is no one really that hasn't been through some shit.. I tell myself I need to remember that pain is something we all have in mutual.

But what is the difference between regular stuff, or normative stuff, and abusive, scarring stuff? What portion of the emotions and anxiety I experience is ""normal"" and what stems from past trauma? And how can I get closure? I truly want to remember everything that happened to have this closure. I'm upset I can't remember and I don't know if I should try to write and remember more to face these past events. Is this something people do? Is it worth it? kind responses are much appreciated.

Btw, I'm a 29 yo female, have been in therapy for 3 years now, had Anorexia and have OCD which i'm sure is a cause of a bunch of traumatic events, taking a small amount of medication and smoke herb regularly.

Thank you"
Anger Meltdowns with CPTSD?,7,mjm5oy,2,"Trigger warning: self harm, suicide 

I'm in need of advice. I don't know if this is something others with CPTSD deal with or if this is just some other issue I have separate. 

I don't get angry very often, at least not angry enough to let it manifest into anything. But slowly over time, I seem to build up this anger and finally something small ""sets me off"" and I have what I think is a small anger meltdown?

My brain turns off. I'm numb. I just sit in one place and stare into nothingness for about 5-10 minutes. I isolate myself completely. I start thinking of ways I can self harm, which is something I have a history of. I start thinking about suicide. 

Then I began to cry, throw things, break things, etc. but only for about 10 minutes. Then it's over finally. Then I kind of feel numb again. 

Can anyone relate to this? I feel lost. I'm just now realizing this is a pattern."

Healing has me feeling like I'm going to die,61,mj8e7p,27,"Lately I've been releasing a lot. Crying, sobbing, screaming, wailing – the release I've long for after years of emotional shutdown and unavailability has been hitting me in cycles of monstrous waves. It feels like I'm finally able to grieve and there's just so much to let go. I keep going through layers and layers. 

While I thought this would feel good, in some way, I wonder if it will ever end because I can't sleep or rest enough to recover from these storms. My five-hour-a-night insomnia – and sometimes even less than that – coupled with all this crying feels so destabilizing. I feel nauseous, unsteady, I'm shaking constantly. I've lost so much weight. Getting up or turning over in bed sends my heart racing. I feel raw and also terrified. 

I know this terror is what was underneath my numb, frozen exterior. I know I asked for it to be melted and to get to the pain beneath so I could begin processing. But why am I not sleeping more? Why do I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack before the healing is over. I'm trying to keep it together and do things that'll bring me some comfort like reading, playing my switch, yoga, meditation. I've heard that not sleeping is a huge impediment to healing grief and trauma. I feel so much sorrow and fear that I'm going to destroy myself before anything good comes of this newfound opening."
Annoyed at people overusing the word trauma?,26,mjdfoj,19,"This is something that I feel guilty about at times but I'm wondering if anyone else feels the same as me and if not, I'd really love to hear other opinions. 


I can't decide if people (in certain circumstances only), either in real life or online, saying they are 'traumatised' is helpful if not. I have two ways of thinking about it, 

1.) It's really great that people are talking more about trauma and being more open about it. Plus who am I to judge what does and does not traumatise someone. At times, a reeving engine (a benign example on its own) takes me right back to horrible memories of my mother so I get that. 

2.) I get the impression people are using the word very fucking liberally and what at times seem, incorrectly. And it annoys me and I wish it didn't because I see them saying they are traumatised but very much getting on with their own lives and I'm here traumatised and just fucking barely able to stay alive. Is it 'trauma' or just... Something else? Maybe jealously is informing this thought also and I'm aware of this. 

This is very difficult to explain and I'm really sorry if I'm not articulating this properly but it's a thought I wanted to discuss with others in the same boat but basically there's a part of me that's almost sceptical (in certain situations only!) when people say something like ,""lol and that's on childhood trauma 🤪""  and they seem, tbh, grand."
How to talk about or acknowledge when your flashback puts strain on your relationships (trying to make this a win!),2,mjrgt3,1,"So I’ve been working really, really, really hard for a long time in with myself and in my relationships to recognize my flashbacks, find constructive and clear ways to talk about them, and then move forward with trust/reduced inner critic voice. cause I really value the relationships I have now and I want them to stay healthy. 
Buuttttt This summer I went back to my childhood home,  where most of my trauma occurred, for an extended period of time and it’s taken me about six months to un-dissociate, come back to myself and re-recognize a lot of my own patterns. Basically to come out of like a 6 month flashback. I know there were some moments that were really tough on my chosen family and friends and i know my self neglect (physically, emotionally, hygienically- the whole 9 yards) has been pretty out of hand. Does anyone have any tips for acknowledging this in these relationships so they can move forward? I know a lot of that is just me course correcting and taking care of myself, recharging my batteries and reestablishing healthy boundaries. but I also know accountability is an important part of communication and valuing the other persons experience. And an important part of being honest with myself! But also- sometimes actions speak louder than words. Do I even need to talk about it, or just change?  

TL;DR 
I was emotionally triggered super hard for multiple months and it out a strain on my relationships. I want to support, listen to and respect my friends needs, goals, and ambition  more fully than I’ve been able to do in flashback mode. I want to hold myself accountable. Does this require conversations in those relationships, just a behavior change, or a little of both   (Depending on each relationship’s vibe)?"
Weird to think this is life now,1,mjtvtp,3,"This is how it’ll be for now. This is what I’m at for survival, and it’s bizarre.

There’s no return, no going back, no use once it’s gone. Child-like naivety was so nice. 

In a way, this is a gift. I see the ways that humans interact with one another when it comes to love, pain, hurt, curiosity and I can anticipate a lot. This is how I stay safe.

Survived physical abuse at the hands of countless adults through my childhood, as of now outlawed medical procedures and trauma, made it to adolescence with just a pediatrician’s diagnosis of depression that my family ignored for 2 years until my “depression” deteriorated enough to bypass all attempts at therapy and jump straight to medicating me out of the absurdity of my condition. Survived children’s residential treatment center and the troubled teen industry in my childhood, to go on to be raped a few times. Survived a physical abusive relationship with a pos and a bunch of polite dating of predatory men I didn’t even want to be talking to but I’m too attuned to how to fawn towards people who can’t take no for an answer. 

Of course I can survive human trafficking. Yeah, completely and seriously by myself with not a fucker in sight — has there ever been anyone there for me before?

Coming to terms with the fact that your childhood savior was also abusive,7,mjgzir,2,"Something new im dealing with in my quest for healing.
Actually looking at the situation from an adults perspective.

I always saw my grandmother as my savior,  she rescued me from my abusive parents.

But she also raised one of those parents.
And she didn't keep me protected, she just kept me alive and with the abusive parents.
Keeping the family together was important to her appearance,  but our family should not have stayed together.

She knew what was happening and spoiled me when I was with her,  I viewed her as the only person who loved me.

Now I'm remembering begging that person not to take me back home, offering all the gifts back. Telling her I didn't care if Santa couldn't find me.
No matter what I begged, id always be taken back to that hell house and told that it would be fine,  just 5 days and then I could be loved again.

By someone who clearly didn't care what was happening those 5 days 

She just let it happen while making me think she was saving me from it"
Was reminded of the where to turn for grounding. Writing.,2,mjo2cx,1,"The rise of the sun,
the setting moon bring me home,
home to reality. 
Grounding when falling into the abyss. 
Reality falling from the face of the earth. 
This mind melts from this shell of a body.
Would follow the sun for a million years to bring this body home to their peace. 
A friend, family of home where there is none. 
Could stay in their presence for the rest of eternity, only for time to move forward, 
the day moving forward, until we meet again in another morning, 
saying our hellos once more. 
The sun and moon reminding this body and mind the home and safe place it longs for. 
Reminding this shell of a body it's more 
and it's ok to be less."
Fake Crushes: Did anyone else do this?,6,mjiw61,2,"I'm in my 30s and I figured out a long time ago that most of my crushes in my teens and early 20s were forced or fake. I would notice that a guy seemed fine and would probably be my type and just pretend that I liked him. I think I only had 3 genuine crushes until well into adulthood. 

I recently admitted this to my therapist and my husband. My husband was surprised-- and I assured him I actually liked him from the beginning, and it wasn't forced-- but my therapist and I had a really good discussion surrounding it.

I was sooooo shut down, that I couldn't really allow feelings. And then there is the vulnerability of allowing yourself to like someone.  Just spent a lot of time detached."
DAE not want to be helped?,13,mjd4xc,2,"I have been severely abused as a child and I dealt with it all myself. I didn’t tell an adult, I didn’t get therapy, I didn’t even tell my friends. I just lived with it all by myself, and I’m proud of myself for that.

If someone popped up in my life, offering unconditional love and support, I think I’d hesitate to accept it. I just don’t want to be dependent on others for support. If I can deal with it myself, I will do that. Getting other people involved with my demons seems a lot harder than just taking them on myself."
"People who have flashbacks, what do they look like for you?",10,mje4ei,11,"Apologies if this has been asked recently. Last night I was in a flashback for about an hour. It has been a couple years since I’ve been stuck in one so long, and didn’t know where I was/how old I was. It made me very curious to know what other people go through when they have a major (or minor) flashback."
"Didn’t go to my abusers baby shower, despite receiving abuse in the process of not going.",4,mjjtet,1,"My sister is one of my abusers. I still don’t have it in me to forgive her or just “forget” the things she’s done. I’ll also add she’s done absolutely nothing for me, and would probably skip my baby shower if I hypothetically ever had one (which I won’t). I resent the fact she’s being thrown this lavish fancy shower when in reality she’s the last person to have a baby, and it wouldn’t surprise me if the state takes it away, given how unfit she is to parent. Her child really doesn’t have a chance in this world. Plus I have no reason to be part of it anyways. Also with my severe anxiety, I can’t handle really overwhelming shit like that.

Of course, my mother is trying to make me out to be some awful person. When my dad finds out I didn’t go, he probably won’t help me pay for housing in the process of trying to move away from my abusive mother (he’ll claim I’m too mentally ill to live alone if I was too depressed to go to the baby shower). I’m going through a pretty bad heartbreak and literally can’t even get out of bed because I took an extra big sedative last night, on top of depression. I canceled plans with my best friend to do something tonight that’s actually at the very top of my bucket list and have been wanting to do for my whole life.. that’s how seriously bad off I am right now. Normally I wouldn’t miss that for anything. My anxiety is off the fucking charts, particularly from worrying about my fathers reaction and the way I’ll probably be punished. I hate this. Ugh :("
Burning the bridge to my homeland,9,mjg9sk,19,"I despise my home country. Civil war torn and had to flee as a kid. Even before I was born, it was violent and corrupt. Even to this day; it’s a broken country of broken souls. I hate it. I hate everything about it. It’s language Arabic. It’s religion Islam. It’s culture. It’s belief that mental health is the work of jinn and devils and demons. It’s such an awful place and hate having to bring it up when someone sees my name. I was to “burn the ship” and sever the ALL ties with it. It produced a violent dad that beat us mercilessly all our youth. I want to renounce him and everything he is and our country. I change my name to an something Westernized and American, make a new happy story to tell people (a lie) rather than the sad song I have to give each time now.

Am I only hurting myself more making a new identity and persona? Or is it a true resurrection from the ugly ashes of fire consumed life?"
Just Tired,1,mjqw2c,8,"I don't know anymore, man.  I've gotten to the point where I feel completely hollowed out, apathetic, expecting only the worst.  Decades of relentless childhood abuse and constant reminders that my abusers might find me again and show up unannounced.  No feelings of safety anywhere.  No money to afford a place of my own.  No job from poor people skills and too depressed to keep searching.  Dozens of lost ""friends"" who spread rumors, betrayed my trust, manipulated me in ways that damaged me forever.  Laying in constant fear of even the slightest movement outside or the sound from the apartment above like someone is going to come break through my door.  I'm not sure if I'm just naturally unlucky or cursed to have a shitty life.  Even if something good happens, it never lasts.  Seeing the way the world is slowly growing worse through idiotic teenagers on the internet screaming at each other without a shred of empathy doesn't help, but even after cutting social media from my life, I can't ignore that these kinds of people, all too similar to my abusers, are growing in number.  

I fucking hate this world.  And being forced to be alive is a never-ending torment.  I once heard a former therapist, current psychology professor say that too much trauma is irreparable.  He said it with such apathy that I wondered if it were really true.  Is my brain so badly fucked that I'll never get to experience the elusive thing people call happiness?  Is it only downwards from here?  As a society, I don't see much changing for the better.  And that only makes me more inclined to close my eyes and never wake up."

Were you manipulated into not telling anyone?,30,mj6vfy,15,"Growing up, my parent used all kinds of techniques to stop me saying anything to anyone about the abusive environment caused by them and my stepparent.

\-If you tell them the truth, they'll find out how bad you are and that it's all your fault.

\-You're a liar and an attention seeker - that didn't happen.

\-You will get your siblings taken away forever.

\-You'll end up in a foster home which is worse.

\-No one will want to talk to you, everyone will look at you like you have problems.

\-Nothing is really wrong, it's just little mistakes, and if you just learn to behave it will get better.

\-Things are getting better, I've thought of X,Y,Z way to calm (stepparent) down so it won't happen again.

It's so frustrating to think about how scared I was to trust and talk to anyone. Just wondering if any of you also experienced this?"
Body flashbacks,2,mjn2jn,4,"Recently I've been experiencing a lot of body flashbacks/sensory flashbacks of one of my sexual assaults. It'll happen randomly during the day and interrupt my daily activity. I'll suddenly smell the playground I was at, and I'll feel every sensation I felt a decade and a half ago. This has happened before, but it's happening much more frequently lately. I thought when it started happening less frequently, I was moving on. Guess not."
Is this a trauma response?,9,mjdz4a,4,"I've noticed that whenever anybody touches the space between my shoulder blades, the muscles in that area all tense up like crazy for a second or two. Even when I'm feeling safe and happy. It's been happening since childhood. I can't control it. I don't feel panicky or anything when it happens but my muscles react regardless. I can't remember any trauma involving that area. I thought it was just a sensitive body part for everyone but my girlfriend got really concerned when she noticed it."
Why are every single one of my relationships so difficult?,3,mjkjqa,7,"That’s it. That’s the post. 

I can’t possibly be picking horrible partners every single time, can I? 

I’m so tired of fighting. So tired of the racing heart. So tired of wasting my entire day because I’m too exhausted from my emotions. So tired of missing my workouts and canceling plans. So tired of telling people at work that things are shit.

Tired is spending thousands a year on therapy and pain management. So tired of ruined holidays. 

It’s like we just make ourselves relive everything we already went through in our childhood. Do we do this subconsciously? 

I tried to pick a better partner this time, I really did. Am I the problem?

I've always found it hard to move on. To let things go. To forgive. To let things BECOME better... Isn't that just balls out weird? The things that could literally save my life I am in a lot of ways right now actively trying to avoid? Trying to hold on to unhealthy familiarity... 

I frustrate my own damn self with that kind of reaction. I guess I never learned how to deal with the trauma all that well. I guess I am this way cos of all of the guilt, the shame, the neglect, the abuse and the pain... 

These bad habits have me convinced I need to stay where it's ""safe"" where I have crawled into a cave and tried to bury my past... But I have to come out into the light some day right? **I HAVE TO TRY!**

It's hard to STAY positive about much these days because I don't have many things going for me at the moment... I'm clinging on to the hope that I will rise from the ashes like a phoenix but it's like the burning of my soul never ceases to end! Just when I think I'm improving and getting somewhere, someone or something tries to prevent me from elevating to another level. The slightest upsetting thing can send me spiralling and also I go back into hiding, isolating, distancing myself from the world cos it has so far been a big disappointment. 

I can't even say I'm cautiously optimistic right now. But IF ANYTHING I want to be present and available FOR ME! Nobody else will be and nobody else HAS BEEN so I want to not ghost myself and FINALLY take the steps, no, the leaps and bounds I need to climb into a new kind of existence; one I can be proud of... 

I'm going to need all the strength I can muster. 

But I take this journey on in the face of pure terror.

So....I noticed a pattern with my anxiety and depression spiking after dark,11,mjcad6,11,I’m almost never anxious or depressed during the mornings or afternoons (unless it’s a huge episode lasting multiple days) but I often get anxious once the sun sets.

DAE get intense hyperfixations?,56,mj3mct,11,"First post in this subreddit (and reddit as a whole actually!) Hope it’s relatively coherent.

I have dissociative tendencies and fiction has forever been my main escape route when everything else has been chaotic or upsetting. I tend to “binge” on media I find comforting or interesting for days on end instead of addressing other, arguably more important things. 

Sometimes I’ll get properly obsessed with a franchise, and I’ll have difficulty focusing or talking about anything else. More specifically, I’ll get obsessed with one character within the franchise.
Hyperfixations to do with specific characters are a lot more intense and visceral, and I feel like I’m in love (whatever that’s supposed to feel like) with this idea, this concept of a person.

It gets painful sometimes, and I’ve have (or almost) cried for the sole reason that they’re not real/ not happy/ dead. I sometimes separate myself from the people around me because they’d take me out of the fantasy I desperately wish to live in. I don’t hate them, not at all, they just don’t fit.

I’m currently in the throes of another fictional crush right now and I wanted to know if it’s normal for people with cptsd or just another part of being a teenager."
How do I overcome my trauma bond and stop the attraction to abusers?,21,mj76sj,3,"Looking for advice on overcoming my trauma-bonded attraction to abusive people?

I have been diagnosed with C-PTSD. I am in treatment and I feel like I am learning to understand my condition and move forward. The one thing that I cannot seem to make any progress with is my attraction to abusive people. 

I grew up in a violent home and went on to have violent relationships. Learning about C-PTSD and the reasoning behind my symptoms has improved my life in all but one area: the trauma bond. All the reading in the world doesn’t seem to stop me from fixating on seeking out the approval of people who treat me badly. 

I am consistently drawn to intimate relationships in which I find myself trying to earn a partner’s approval. I cannot make any sense of this because it does not seem to follow any pattern. If I date a person who treats me badly, 99% of the time I will just stop seeing that person because I recognise that they do not treat me respectfully and that there is no point in pursuing the relationship.

However, the other 1% of the time, the person will hold some kind of mesmerising power over me where I find myself preoccupied with earning their approval. This never, ever ends well. It always ends in exactly the same way: I keep seeing the person who treats me badly and that person continues to treat me badly. I end up feeling terrible about myself, yet I am drawn to this person by an insatiable craving to earn their approval. The illogic of my attraction is compounded by the fact that there is nothing special about the people whose approval I am obsessed with: on the contrary, the abusive people I am drawn to tend to be less successful than other people I am not drawn to. It makes no sense.

I believe that I am living with the effects of trauma bonding. I am at a complete loss on how to stop fixating on abusers. Can other people give me some advice on how they overcome their trauma bond?"
advice on letting something traumatic go? finding it hard to just look to the future and move on,3,mjj33i,4,had a bad experience recently and it's rattled me for months. I've talked about it ad nauseam - I explained the whole story to someone today again months later and honestly I feel like I just relived it all and I feel worse. How do you let something go and stop obsessing and bringing it into your future. It's making me feel a bit hopeless.
SAAM and a trauma anniversary are quickly wearing out all my self-soothing mechanisms,7,mjd78h,7,"I'm stressed and feel like I'm falling apart. My college campus is big about putting up posters and displays for SAAM, and several of the areas they put these up are nearly impossible for me to avoid, I'm talking the dining hall entrance and fields in front of buildings I have class in. The 18th will be 2 years since I left my abusive ex. The flashbacks and guilt and pain have already picked up again, going from 2 flashbacks or less a week to multiple a day. My last therapy appointment was the 23rd and my next isn't until the 13th because my therapist is on vacation. My support system isn't good on quick response, so I'm left trying to soothe the flashbacks myself and while I'm okay doing that when they're less often and I have time to recoup the emotional energy between them, right now they're quickly outpacing my ability to cope."

Ruminating on CSA memories,1,mjo7qi,1,"I have put really bad memories of what would be considered CSA in the back of my mind for years now. My dad didn't give me any privacy as a kid, frequently walked in on me (and my sister), and violated my bodily autonomy by not allowing me to perform basic hygiene myself. Off and on through my life I've questioned whether or not this was CSA, felt very uncomfortable for a few weeks, ignored my dad or limited contact, then went back to talking to him. But this time... I had a long talk with my sister that put a lot of pieces of the puzzle together and I was reminded of things, and had my experiences validated, and confirmed that yes those experiences were NOT okay, and instead of maybe him doing those things to me without knowing what right from wrong, maybe he did them intentionally to me. And by having that discussion with someone else instead of just in my mind and thoughts, it has made me even more uncomfortable that I am not sure I can ever go back again to having a relationship with him. Bringing myself to believe that what happened to me was some sick fantasy to fulfill sexual desires just makes me feel disgusting. I'm very confused on how to handle a future relationship with him, after a long period of time where seemingly nothing was wrong. Can anyone else relate?"
"Feel suicidal after assessment, realising I live in denial about how bad it really is",4,mjg5xt,4,"I had an initial psych assessment for community mental health team (UK) few days ago. It has left me feeling empty, alone and suicidal.

I think I live in denial about the extent of my MH issues. It is only when I have to speak about all the shit that has happened to me and all the shit I have thought, felt and done over the years to I realise the extent and gravity of how truly fucked up I am.

When I was younger and had periods of stability I truly believed that I was somehow magically better, and that I would never have another mental health problem again. Unfortunately this has been an ongoing and severe issue that has plagued me for the past 14 years - half my life. 

It seems that as time has gone by my periods of stability have gotten shorter. 

I've been thinking about suicide a lot recently. And not in the way I usually do, which is just hair trigger ideation. It's becoming expansive. I've thought about it most days for about a week now. 

I don't think anybody would even find my body until the smell of decomposition got so bad."
Books around regaining trust post-trauma,10,mja7bz,6,"Hey folks,

I've been chattering away to my therapist and it turns out CPTSD is a thing. Mine's leaving me with some gaping holes in the old 'trust of other people' area in my life and that's a serious bummer.

What does post-traumatic growth mean?,3,mjh17j,5,"**TW: mentions of grooming, csa**

This is my first reddit post here so bear with me. 

TL:DR; What do you \~do\~ with trauma? If you can't tell other people, how do you deal with the fact that these horrible things occurred and you just have to move on. 

In general, I'd say I'm confused. I've been in therapy for a year at this point but I can't seem to comprehend what to \~do\~ with my trauma. For context, my mom showed me some home videos and I saw instances of my abuser beginning his grooming. I immediately went into a flashback. I'm better now, but I suppose I'm confused because this is what's going in my mind:

I am so bitter that these awful things happened and every detail is so fresh and vivid in my mind that I can't help but want to scream it at anyone that will listen; at the same time, because it's so awful and disgusting, I don't want to tell anyone. They don't need to know and they're probably not equipped to deal with or help me after knowing that knowledge - in my mind, someone saying ""I'm sorry that happened to you"" really doesn't make me feel better. Like, if I tell them what happened and I recieve that response I might get those horrible details out but I'll still be empty and unfullfilled, if that makes sense. So I'm at the point of thinking of what I want. What I want to is to yell at those who harmed me, to tell them that they're a horrible person - but that's not an option either. 

So that's why I'm stuck on this question of post-traumatic growth. I can learn flashback managment to a tee, I can practice mindfulness until it's second nature, and I can learn every skill to manage my symptoms if I work hard enough. But at the end of the day I can't help but but be stuck with this thought - **that all these horrible things occurred to me, that it didn't mean a signle thing, and that I'll just have to carry it until I die**. I suppose I understand that post-traumatic growth can give me gifts of patience, empathy, and what not, but I genuinley do not know how to \~deal\~ with the knowledge that I was abused for years and I just have to keep moving. Do yall have any thoughts? Is there something I'm missing or is this just a reality I have to accept?"
Tremors,11,mj8ukd,9,"Hey y'all, I've always experienced tremors where I would shake involuntarily and have either full body or hand convlusions. I would never loose consciousness during any of these episodes. I discussed this with a neurologist and he told me that these are common amongst people with aspergers. After posting in r/aspergers, a user told me told that this is a common occurrence amongst people with cptsd and suggested that i make a post here. Does anyone here deal with this?"
Cup analogy?,3,mjh0ox,1,"I think  it’s been a long while since I posted here, but I had a small breakthrough in therapy today I wanted to share. I’m not sure if this idea has been here before-if so I promise I didnt mean to steal it. 

I often feel worn down and just can’t fill my cup, and I realized today that it’s because my cup is just bigger than other peoples. I’m spending so much of my day working through the trauma and dealing with the circumstances that my trauma has created, on top of everything else that’s already difficult in life, with less coping skills than people who didn’t go through trauma and were able to learn to function normally. Sort of like spoon theory I guess, but to me this explains why I always tend to withdraw."
"How can I make progress in a new, healthy relationship after leaving an abusive ex?",6,mjdo3v,1,"I’ll try to keep it short and sweet: 5 years ago, I left a toxic relationship where my ex would constantly r*pe me - he even once attempted to murder me in my sleep but when I woke up in panic he told me that he thought that being randomly choked would have turned me on. 

Anyway, it took me all those years to muster up the courage to try dating again. I was lucky enough to meet the most wonderful guy ever in the last few months. The problem is whenever we sleep together, the following morning my anxiety goes from 0 to 100 real quick. My symptoms are so bad that I become physically ill (upset stomach, excessive sweating etc). Is it my subconscious trying to keep safe despite being in good hands? It’s really bothering me because I want to be able to stay at his place without having a full blown panic attack. The symptoms seem to subside as soon as I’m on my way back home. 

I’ve only told my new bf about my sexual abuse, so I suppose I haven’t completely processed it yet."
I feel horrible,3,mjgvjr,3,"Using a throwaway account. Not sure how to even flair this. But this will be full of trigger warnings of various family abuse, dissociation, and minor drug use. 

Hello. I’m 24 F. I have ocd and gad. And just recently diagnosed by my therapist as having cptsd (or ptsd like symptoms). I’m at my wits end. I’ve been on Prozac in 2016-17 for mild depression. I wish I’d never taken it. It neither hurt nor helped. In 2018 I received the depo shot which flared up my dormant ocd that I never knew I had. Fucked up my hormones bad, got on Celexa. Once again never hurt nor helped. I never addressed my underlying mental health so that’s probably why. I gained a lot of weight and had zero interest in sex. Which sucks, because I’m in my first ever serious relationship. We’ve been dating since we were 21. Had another ocd flare up, figured out it was ocd in 2020. Got put on Wellbutrin to fix all of the other shit the SSRIs caused. It worked very well. Until I got covid in December of 2020. That’s when my life changed. I had an extremely mild case. I recovered well, so I thought. Until February. I had a massive panic attack at work. And I’ve never been the same since. I quick tapered/cold turkey the bupropion because we thought that might be agitating it. I was having panic attacks almost daily. I turned agoraphobic, which is unlike me. Doctor switched me over to Effexor to battle the panic attacks. I took one 37.5 mg dose and had an adverse reaction. Was told to come off of that. It should be noted, before the Effexor debacle I took a cbd gummy with thc in it. It was independently sourced. For reference, my pothead boyfriend and his friends can eat 4 and get high. I’m extremely sensitive to thc. I didn’t know either that you couldn’t really take cbd with bupropion. It was marketed to me as just cbd. I took it, got pretty bad body high. I thought I was going into psychosis. I remember everything about that night. How helpless I felt. How horrible I felt. How scared I was. I remember sobbing to my boyfriend and telling him that this set me back. Anyway, took the Effexor three days later and had that reaction. It scared me from ever taking meds again. I didn’t want to feel like that anymore. 

Everything triggers me into fight or flight it’s like it’s stuck. I went back to my family home and have pretty much become bed ridden. Dissociation has taken over my life. My family home isn’t ideal because it resurfaces unresolved child hood trauma. Especially considering my dad is a narcissist and my mother is extremely passive and doesn’t understand anxiety/mental health.  But I was scared to be alone, and being alone made me feel like I was going to lose control. I went to a cardiologist, am in a heart monitor for 14 days. I still need to find out my post covid issues. It’s apparent it’s long haul. I have to see a rheumatologist because my ANA came back positive which could explain why my body is stuck in fight or flight. I need to rule out autoimmune now. I’m chronically stressed. I can hardly get into cars now much less drive. I have so many things I need to do. I can’t even work right now, I had to take another leave. I’m in my last semester of college, and I can’t even see the future anymore. My psychiatrist wanted me to get my ocd under control so she prescribed Zoloft. It sat in my cabinet for weeks because I was frightened to take it. Well, I took it four days ago and the side effects were horrible. I came off of it after two doses. It increased my dissociation. I was crying all day for no apparent reason. I had my first suicide thought. Not to mention it ruined my GI. Thus, triggered my first major ptsd attack. It started last night. I felt out of it all day. My dad was mad at me and said someone would check me into a psych ward. He’s very impatient and a poor listener/communicator. He likes to do “tough love” when he doesn’t understand that’s not a thing. Well, later that night I felt symptoms from the night I took that cbd gummy. I felt like I really needed to go to the psych ward. Even though I was in my rational mind, I felt trapped in the flashback. Which is what happens now since that day. I remembered every emotion so clear. I felt like I was high again even though I knew I wasn’t. I was so scared that I thought I might need the actual hospital. I could hardly calm down. I got a migraine afterwards and felt so heavy. Today I’m having residual symptoms. I feel dissociative, unwell, and I’m scared that I’ll feel like that again. My brain keeps bringing up the flashback. It doesn’t help having ocd because it agitates the problem. I feel so sick. I know some of it is from the Zoloft. Maybe SSRIs just aren’t for me. I have my first EMDR appointment next Wednesday. I just want my life back. I’m terrified of medication because of one night. I should have never taken it. I should have gotten help all those other times I was on medication instead of being lazy. I have a lot of unresolved trauma and I guess that cbd gummy was enough to break the camel’s back. I’m so tired. I’m so exhausted. I don’t know what to do. I can hardly take a klonopin without being triggered back to that one night. I want out of my childhood home. I want to see my boyfriend again. I want to be able to work. I’m exhausted and scared. I’ve had flashbacks before but I normally think of the memory in third person or I dissociate myself from the memory. My therapist says I have an overarching diagnosis. I’m just scared. It’s like my brain is stuck right now.

I just want to recover, but I don’t even know where to begin. Or what to do. The list just keeps getting longer and it seems like my life is getting out of reach."
Kleptomania?,4,mjedwy,5,"DEA had a time in their childhood when they were stealing things? I am very ashamed of this and I really don’t understand why I was doing it, but there was a time I was stealing. It was compulsive, I was unable to resist. And I felt horribly guilty afterwards. I would never use the things I stole (I would hide them, give them away or simply throw them out). I usually stole small things, like toys and stuff. I suffered a lot of trauma and was also severely emotionally neglected, but I feel like this is a cheap excuse for such behaviour. I still feel like there was something really wrong with me or I was demoralized. I feel horrible about this, I was one of those kids who lied, stole, did strange things and I don’t know how to process this..."
Is self love something people feel all the time?,1,mjmkl4,2,"This is most likely a dysfunctional and weird question but *do people love themselves continuously*? As of this week I -for the first time- am able to trigger bouts of self love,care and compassion for myself. Now Im left wondering if ""normal"" people need to trigger these emotions as well or if it is something they feel all day,every day? Does anybody know?"
"Tried to watch some Youtube videos on C-PTSD and couldn't get through them because it hurt so much, but I can spend hours on this subreddit. Why is that?",3,mjfly6,5,"Was it the audio? I'm confused. I can talk to my therapist ok and go on here to chat, but when I try to watch youtube videos on the subject my brain gets super heavy and I feel sick. Why?"
My middle-school bully,2,mjhztp,5,"I recently, through a series of coincidences, reconnected with one of the boys who treated me so badly in middle school. I was a very shy, traumatized girl (from trouble at home) and the boys in my little group were merciless, teasing me about my weight and my crummy clothes, etc. We all went to the same school and church and dances. None of those boys would ever ask me to dance, which made me hate myself even more. My best friend was the cute girl, and I was the punchline of all the group's jokes. I know it's not like today's bullies who lure kids into the woods and kill them, but social exclusion is a form of bullying, and it left me feeling suicidal. So now I'm able to talk by text with this guy, and he totally remembers our shared childhood differently, like we all just hung around and had fun together. I told him that I didn't like myself much back then, and that I think I was picked on because I was so shy. He replied, ""But you overcame that! Good for you!""

So ... should I tell him that he was abusive to me back then? Would it help anything? Does he deserve to know, and if he apologized--I don't know that he would--would that help me feel better? I'm seriously ready to stop thinking about middle school, but here it is in my face again."
If someone (important to me) doesn’t tell me something (that I think it’s worth sharing) I feel like I’ve been abandoned by them.,15,mj5mhm,10,"As title says, this is happening a lot lately with a person that is important to me (I also know that I’m important to them because they told me and I trust them). 

I think it is also increased by the fact that we can’t see each other since a month and for the next 5 months. Because we are in different countries. 

If anyone has also felt like this, please share :)"
Does anyone have experience with the Complex PTSD workbook?,3,mjdh0q,4,I was recently rediagnosed with complex PTSD and my therapist recommended I buy the Complex PTSD workbook. Does anyone have experience with the book? Just wondering what it’s like before I make the purchase.
"I grew up abused all my life,",10,mj7ktb,2,"I'm not even sure if I have CPTSD but I'm pretty damn sure just haven't been to a specialist yet but I'm all kinds of seriously fucked up. 


I was sexually abused, mentally abused, physically, etc and have been all my life, all by people I trusted and thought were good people.


And now I'm worried I'll be like this the rest my life"
I’ve been feeling down and emotional the last week or so...,4,mjcm8g,11,"I was recommended this sub from r/Healfromyourpast. I am not sure if I have CPTSD, but I guess this sub can help with some of the emotional issues I’ve been dealing with. My emotions just come at me out of nowhere, or sometimes, like now, I’m just sad and constantly overwhelmed even when nothing is going on. It’s incredibly distressful and frustrating"
DAE feel like you need to “buy” love?,43,mj0vmp,13,"Ever since I can remember I’ve felt like I need to give *something* (sex, drugs, money, presents, whatever) to people in my life in order to make them stay. Even if it’s not asked for, I still feel like I have to because I don’t know what it’s like to have someone just love me because of who I am, not what I can do or give them. I don’t know how to make it stop. I want people to just love me, to care just because they care, but I’m too afraid to try and have them leave so I’m constantly doing whatever I can to make sure they want me around. It doesn’t matter how damaged I get in the process, as long as someone wants me around for something then that’s enough right? It doesn’t matter how exhausting it is for me, how much I give up, how much it hurts, it’s better than being alone"
what do you do to actually feel safe when you are actually in a safe place?,4,mjbq9x,4,"I did a lot of hard work cutting some people out of my life and I’m in a much better, happier place. I love who I’m with now and I’m working hard on loving myself. question is, even though I’m in such a safe and loving place it can be really hard to feel present because I feel like I need to be on alert and make sure everyone’s feelings are okay and also be on alert because I’m unsafe even though I’m not. do you all have any tips on how you gently coax your mind into believing your space is safe when it is? thanks- i hope you all are having the best day!!!!"
"After an entire lifetime of abuse, I have finally severed all connections and ties to those that have hurt and used me.",708,miitaq,59,"I for a very long time figured that the abuse I had suffered only extended to my family, but this whole time I've also been a part of an extremely abusive friend group. After months of feeling ashamed, feeling guilty, seeing myself as worthless and wondering constantly why I'm just not enough, I realized I will never be enough for any of my friends, and they would all sooner see me die than give a shit. I attempted suicide 5 months ago, and afterwards got told by my friends that they ridiculed belittled and shit talked me behind my back, and that's what they had to do to cope with my wanting to die, like it was my fault for ever making them feel like that. Another one of them called me while I was in the facility, and told me point blank that they won't be there for me. Another directly made promises and plans with me to keep me safe, kept missing and bailing on those promises, and in response to my getting upset at him told me ""You're to fucking much. I can't deal with you right now."" and abandoned me at my weakest and most vulnerable, and fed me silence until I was compliant to the silent abusive ""truth"" that I was wrong and that I deserved to be treated that way.

I genuinely cannot believe how much I've let myself put up with against garbage evil people. They are horrible, and I am so glad that I see it fully now. It wasn't my fault they didn't care enough to be there for me, they really couldn't have given a shit whether I lived or died. But they made sure that I constantly felt bad if I ever dared speak up for myself.

This has to be one of the biggest milestones and victories for me over the past bit! I have finally realized that all of my friends were abusive assholes too and it almost killed me this year. But I'm actually smiling because I feel a sense of freedom and liberation I've never known before in my life"
Can cptsd make you transgender?,5,mj9wft,4,"My whole life I've gone back and forth about being trans, to the point of transitioning once, detransing, then retransitioning. I've struggled so much being dissociated from my body and not feeling like I belong in it. Transitioning helped... somewhat. But after reading both Body Keeps The Score and Pete walkers book I'm realizing that sense of dissociation/depersonalization is common in abuse survivors. I grew up in an emotionally abusive house and dealt with extensive homophobic bully from extended family and community. Just wondering if the dysphoria and alienation I feel could be from that instead of being trans? Anyone else struggle with is or have thoughts?"
anyone else deal with nerve/rsi issues?,1,mjiluf,2,"ive been an artist my whole life but starting when i was like 15 i started to get carpal tunnel a lot, and recently ive had cubital tunnel syndrome/ulnar nerve issues for, like, 3 months straight now. it seems the worse my anxiety gets, the more persistent my rsi issues become."
Not sure if this symptom is correct but let's try anyway,1,mjijuz,1,"My bfs kid loves to be super personal with me and constantly gives me hugs nearly always right next to me if not on me. I just feel like I have to put on a happy face, but it's exhausting. Most days I try staying away in my own world, but it won't matter. I feel ambushed when she comes for hugs and today I nearly froze. 

I don't remember what happened when I was younger than 10, but dealing with kids has always been too much to handle for me because I have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any advice for getting used to children coming up for constant attention and hugs? I'm not a super touchy person unless it's my S.O. I try making sure I spend some time with her, but I can only do it for so long before the 9 million questions start getting on my nerves and I just don't have it in me to say anything that will make her sad."
Hey,3,mjak5j,1,I'm still in contact with my parents .. even though they hurt me and I can say I don't love them  .. and the only reason for that is my youngest siblings. Cause I know what it's like to lose someone close when you are young .. and I really don't want to but them through that ..but after getting a nasty txt from one of the older siblings I feel like I have no other choice but to pull back and slam walls up . Cause when I read it i couldn't control my and was crying infront of people cause I can't take it anymore ... .. what do I do ? Yank back or do nothing ..
Anyone else thinks they are very unfunny/ annoying/ odd?,19,mj1r1s,5,"This is connected to my trauma. I’m very hesitant to speak freely about my ideas and thoughts and especially to joke around. I have so much shame connected to my sense of humour. I know it’s unreasonable because gaging from other people’s reactions, I’m pretty funny, but anytime I make a joke and then realise it’s not the funniest or don’t hear anyone laugh, I get a little bit triggered. My initial trauma stems from the neglect and abandonment in my family but I was traumatised again at the age of 12-13 when I lost all of my many friends at school when people started telling me I was too odd and unfunny (which was more because of ADHD hyperactivity and lack of awareness that came with CPTSD at the time). Whenever I’m being funny, or laughing, or sharing my thoughts, I always get fearful at the back of my mind. I get scared that I’m unlovable at those times and I need reaffirmation from people that I’m okay.

It has gotten much better over the past few years though. I used to never express myself through humour and very rarely speak my true thoughts. Now I’m much more brave when it comes to expression and sometimes I really don’t care what the other person thinks because I’m just having fun. At the same time I’ve become a little more socially aware, so it helps to sometimes stop myself from saying something that doesn’t fit the situation."
"Does anyone feel safer in little, dark spaces?",18,mj297l,15,"I used to hide in small spaces for fun as a child (I felt safe, and I made lots of sheet tents), during the bad years I used to hide in the bathroom, I feel safer in darkish, closed little spaces, to the point where I'm seriously thinking of making a ""panic closet"" when I live on my own.

I dunno if anyone else feels safer like this, or how can I reproduce this in my room(I don't have space in my closet), or why I feel safer when I do feel claustrophobic in some spaces(it has to be the ""right one""."
My Mind is Crowded,13,mj3oc8,4,"There’s so much that goes through my head as I’m trying to fall asleep. Every night is a fight against calming my thoughts. A fight to to get a good night’s sleep. Most days I wake up groggy and my brain is foggy.

Yesterday was different as I woke up with a clear mind and unusually high energy. I felt good. I made sure to get as much done as I could before I eventually succumbed to triggering thoughts and my mind trying to defend itself from past threats it thinks are real.

I haven’t moved on from my mother’s death yet. It happened when I was 12. I’m getting better, figuring things out. But I still seem to be stuck on many things that happened to me. Working through it is difficult. Worth it, but admittedly very tiring.

I hope I can eventually go through most days without being on constant alert. I hope my brain will be clearer, and I can focus better. At some point, I’m sure…"
Angry with my parents,1,mjg1t6,2,"In January I told my parents that I didn’t want to see them this year. 
When I was in middle school, my mom went bank to school and checked out. From really 12 on they were both checked out. This part isn’t so bad. 
I came back from college during the recession. My mom took her stress and anger from her insane accounting job out on me. Screaming, yelling, demeaning, bullying and insulting me regularly. My dad supported her. He agreed with everything she said, enabled her bad behavior, and told me I deserved it. This was over household chores. 
I leave for grad school, and want able to get a job immediately after so I don’t know where to go and come home. I get an internship and then a part time job, living at home for another year and a half and their treatment resumes. They want to move and I am taking up space. I am forced to consider homelessness twice as an option and perhaps I should take taken it. 
I get engaged to a man that isn’t white, they tell me that I can’t marry him because it would be embarrassing for them, we fight it out. I should have just told them them to duck off but I also wanted to keep up appearances for my new family. 
My parents vote for Trump. We keep fighting. I tell them off this January. I asked them if they had any regrets and they just tell me why they did it.
I will get no empathy or love from them. The anger is eating me alive and I needed to talk about it somewhere."
trying to make sense,1,mjfwqk,1,"I think this is kind of weird, but I also just need to take steps to accept it and accept that these things happen. 

I met a guy online who I became extremely close to really fast. He pretended to show a romantic interest in me and misrepresented himself and many details of his life in an attempt to get me to meet him in person. I  initially declined several times because I am not the the of person to meet an online stranger in real life. I’d never met an online friend in real life before, and I mostly do not date because it’s very hard to get me to be interested in building a strong enough connection with someone past friendship. Friendship is a pretty formidable and rewarding enough goal for me that I don’t aim past anything but that, and usually anything more is too much for me to handle, though now it even seems potentially perilous to attempt at friendship as well. 

I tried to turn him down and insisted that we get to know each other better before we met. He kept insisting to give him a chance and wanted to meet as soon as possible. I told him I didn’t feel comfortable meeting him yet and that I also had plans in my life that I was pursuing and that he was welcome to visit me to meet up IRL while I pursued those. He was super kind, accommodating, and patient and not at all angry, impatient, or offended at me, which I greatly appreciated, but continued to press scheduling a date in the near future to meet each other, to make sure that I wasn’t leading him on or anything. I ended up having to make plans to visit him IRL (shitty boundaries) which kept falling through because I didn’t feel comfortable flying out to meet him yet. He ended up having to pay for several plane tickets for me to see me and he did not give up or even care how many times I failed to make the trip. 

I’m trying to come to terms with the truth that this guy has been attempting to traffic me. It comes at about the same time and with striking similarities to someone else recently in the news for similar things. 

It was just a couple of weeks ago he was emailing nude pictures of girls he was talking to online (he was nothing like this when we first started talking, he presented himself as a completely different kind of shy and quiet and demure kind of personality when we first started talking). He recently sent me emails telling me my offspring would have been deformed and genetically defective (he had frequently mentioned marriage to me and said he wanted to have children with me).

He sent me really inappropriate amounts of money that I have repeatedly asked him to not send and to please let me give back to him, because we broke up after he started threatening to harm my family if I didn’t do what he said. I told him it was no longer appropriate for him to try to send me gifts of any kind, because the relationship was over. Months after I tried to break off all contact with him he still sent me money that I told him I didn’t want. 

There are a lot of details... I don’t really know what to do with this experience that I’ve had to have and live through. I don’t know how to make any part of this experience something more meaningful than just predatory traffickers exist and I guess maybe your ex-boyfriend does fit the profile, especially given that he ended up being radically different person than you initially thought he was.

Sorry that I’m still here. I think it just really hurts to understand that there really are real people out there for who people just don’t have any intrinsic value as people, and do very much see you as worthless and replaceable, easily interchangeable. And that they never had a true human interest in getting to know who you are or understand where your true values lie. It doesn’t seem like it was ever about that, but just plying me with greater and greater lies administered with the frequency of brainwashing to get me to misjudge the reality of who this guy really was and what his intentions with me truly were."
Most people haven’t felt creeped out by their Dad?,122,miofhg,72,"I just had a therapy appointment and am now processing the fact that most people don’t feel creeped out by their dad... this is an odd concept for me because I have always felt creepy around him. He was yelling at me to pick something up when I was 12 or so and all I remember is sobbing, not wanting to bend over in front of him and I don’t exactly know why. 

My therapist said she has been doing her work for over 30 years and has spoken with so many people. I’m summarizing— but she said it is not typical or common for Dads to give daughters this creeped out feeling. 

I’m creeped out all over again now but it was a great appointment. She reminds me that before things get better in therapy, it can get hard and messy. Things get all stirred up which is so true. But it has already been sooo worth it. 

What knowledge/insight/experience do you all have with creepy Dads?"
I had the worst meltdown ever yesterday.,7,mj4h28,3,"One of my brothers blindsided me, my other brothers support him. As a result my job is in jeopardy, we (4yo and me) may lose our home, at the very least I'm going to be about £1.5k in debt by next month, rising every month after. I'm going to have £25 to pay bills and buy food for the next 8 weeks. Its not doable. This after I paid £600 I didn't have for his therapy to help him get where he is.


So I fucked them all up too. Let the council know one of my brothers is a convicted paedophile and there's supposed to be stipulations, he's not following them. 


I let the landlady of their establishment know that the other ""partner"" in this business has been left off the loan applications, because he's an alcoholic that has embezzled thousands, most recently two weeks ago, the embezzling two weeks ago ended with him driving across several times while drunk as fuck, nearly killing himself and others. 

 He's got an arrest sheet as long as my entire body and isn't allowed to be running a business, obviously. I also sent in tips about the fraud they're committing. 


It was a bad meltdown and I will probably feel awful for it later. But not that awful, because I'm facing serious debt thanks to these guys."
DAE have PTSD dreams even after hearing the smallest disagreement?,3,mj7wj3,2,"I haven’t had a dream for maybe months? It’s been so strange, somehow they just stopped. Yesterday I was on the phone with my mom and she and my dad had the smallest tiff (though I could sense the tension was building and cycle had already started). 

And then last night? PTSD dream. Even when I lived at a home stay a few years back, two people (not the parents) would fight at like 9pm and I would hear it, and then... trauma dream. 

But I haven’t been to my parents house in nearly four months. So it truly is wild to me that I had a dream after the smallest interaction. 

Anyone else experience this? Anyone know what makes the dreams stop? I am afraid they’ll be back for good now."
DAE get overwhelmed by too many options?,198,mikbxi,44,"If I have too many options for books, podcasts, TV shows, etc, I freeze. If I have 30 minutes of free time, I'll spend 30 minutes trying to settle on what to do and still never decide. Is this common? Does anyone have any practical advice for how to short-circuit this problem?"
I don't know if this counts as cpstd,1,mj9gr4,2,"TW: Ableism, sexism, sexual assault, workplace trauma 

In 2019 I got a job in CAMHS. Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, a part of the NHS Mental Health sector for young people. Although the job itself had its emotional and physical trauma for me, the most trauma I received came from my boss. 

Just a little background on myself, when I found and applied for the job I had just turned 21. I was diagnosed with Hip Dysplasia at the age of 18 so I had issues with pain and my hips. I had major surgery in 2016 to try and ""fix"" my dysplasia. Whilst in hospital I experienced a lot of physical and emotional trauma. After I came out of hospital I developed agoraphobia and was unable to leave my house for 3 years. In January 2018 I started graded exposure therapy to get me out my house. That February I met a boy, we fell in love and since then he's been the one main person to support me and help me with my recovery. A big part of that recovery was getting a job. January 2019 I found a job description for a Support Worker in a childrens psychiatric hospital.  I looked further into the description and discovered that its in the hospital I went to as a child for therapy. ""It's a sign"" I thought. So I applied and got the job. And obviously in the job I had to disclose my disabilities and any longstanding health issues. Which I did. 

The first few months of my job my boss loved me. She would talk to me and encourage me and help me. And then it all started going down hill when I  had an incident. I was on the ward and my hip popped out spontaneously.  I was walking down the corridor and it just went. I tried to play it cool and not bring attention to myself by propping myself up against a windowcill and beckoned a colleague over. My colleague asked me what was wrong and subtly I said ""I've popped my hip out help"". All my colleagues knew about my disabilities and were always super supportive. She then went and got one of our on site doctors to talk to me and give me advice. All that we could do was take me to A&E. This was when all the staff started to notice and the kids started to ask what was going on. I ended up having to be wheeled out in a wheelchair and spent the next 8 hours in hospital. 

The day after, my boss summond me to her office. ""What the hell"" she said ""why didn't you just work, you never told me you were disabled"". To which I said ""I definitely told you, I distinctly remember talking about it in my interview"". She then started to gaslight me and talk about how unprofessional I was being. She started to ask if I was really disabled ""you don't even look disabled"". I was the diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and told her immediately. But she called me a liar. 

This is when she started ignoring me at work and talking about me in the office. 

A few weeks later I had my first night shift. That night, I was sexually assaulted by a member of staff. But I was ashamed and scared of what would happen. So I didn't tell anyone for a long time. 

Over the next few months my boss refused to talk to me. She wouldn't even say good morning or good afternoon to me. She wouldn't acknowledge me. She would badmouth me to staff, talk about me as though I wasn't there.  

About 8 months after my S.A I finally told my boss. She sat there and just laughed. She laughed straight in my face and blamed me. 

So I decided that from then on I wasn't going to tell her things and instead tell HER boss (who was the matron). The ableism she showed me continued over the next few months. 

On another night shift, something traumatic happened with a patient and I ended up sitting in her room with her for hours, covered in her blood. Obviously I can't go into specifics with that because it's not mine to tell. But it was emotionally traumatic for me. And obviously told my bosses immediately. Then it backfired. They blamed me. ""How dare you say that about any of my nurses, I don't think they did that, I think you're lying"" Is what the matron told me. 

The gaslighting, ableism, disrespect, bullying, and horridness all continued throughout my work there. I wasn't given the same support, opportunities or respect as my other colleagues. 

The worst incident happened in June last year (2020). One afternoon my boss sat all the staff down whilst the patients were up in school with the teachers. ""We're about to have a new admission"" but she wanted to tell us some things before they came. Obviously I'm not going to mention specifics. But whilst talking about their case, my boss told us all that the patient was extremely violent towards staff. 
On the afternoon, right before the incident, the alarm goes off. And on the ward, if the alarm goes off you HAVE to run. So I ran to where the patient was. When I got there, I heard shouting and screaming. My patient was attacking staff. During their stay here I managed to get a good report with the patient. I was the only staff member they trusted and we did some great work together. 

However, over the next 2 hours I would deal with so much emotional and physical trauma. Over this time, the patient punched me continuously. They kicked me and at one point kicked me so much they dislocated my jaw. They also bit me on bare skin. And spat at us and even at one point spat at me whilst I was talking to them and it went in my mouth... And very almost stabbed me. But I don't blame them for what happened. And I still don't think badly of them. 

A few days later we had a debrief. Where we talked about what happened and anything we as staff needed to say was said. But our boss sat there and laughed at us. ""I'm so glad I wasn't there"" she sat and told us she didn't know they were violent or abusive. She laughed at us for over an hour. That's the horrid bit for me. 

I had to leave work 2 months later. I have Fibromyalgia and the attack was so bad it caused me to have a horrific flare up. Im now in a wheelchair and can't work. 

But I basically needed to tell people. So..here I am....telling someone..."
"DAE doubt their trauma was ""severe"" enough?",29,miwob3,13,"My therapist told me this week that I likely have CPTSD. This makes sense given my symptoms and the way I have generally lived my life for as long as I can remember. The thing is, I remember a couple of traumatic memories - a molestation by a 'friend' at the age of 5 and a traumatic punishment for having an accident at the age of 3 that my therapist says I likely processed as a sexual assault. I also have reason to believe there was some attachment issues/postpartum depression. I can't remember anything else in the ways of specifics though. I guess I am getting hung up on the way CPTSD is described as resulting from severe or repeated trauma. Maybe I just don't remember? Can anyone  else relate to this feeling?"
UK Q: does your GP know you’re getting trauma therapy / have CPTSD?,6,mj3z9w,4,"I minimised my trauma/mental health for so long, I didn’t want to be dismissed or invalidated any further when I finally realised I needed help, so I’ve been paying for private trauma therapy for the last few months.

I was wondering if anyone else in the UK has told their GP, even in hindsight? It makes so much sense of my medical history, I thought it might be useful for them to know, to help others spot patterns, or improve the way trauma is approached?

My experience is that not all GPs are trauma informed (...I wasn’t even trauma informed until 6 months ago) so I would never have said ‘I have trauma’, or been asked about trauma/life events. I’m so used to the efficient ‘ok, let’s rule this out / let’s do this test’ etc GP mannerism, it’s all added to my survival mode/I’m fine/minimisation.

It’s only when I went to a dentist recently and I said I hadn’t been for about 10 years (it was actually 18 but I was embarrassed to say that), she put down her notes, came and sat by me, made eye contact and said ‘ok, is there anything that’s happened that led to this. Is there anything you’d like to let me know about’ and I was like AHA! Trauma informed healthcare!! I cried on the way home out of pure relief of being asked!

I’m wondering whether to write out a trauma history linked to my medical notes and hand it to my GP just so they know the long term pattern that can be caused by CPTSD, and so there’s a record of the missed opportunities for seeing this kind of trauma pattern earlier."
"I am getting better. I am actually getting better! I am still far from feeling ""good"", but I'm definitely getting better!",216,mij19t,24,And that is something to celebrate. All the hard work is finally showing some effect. Here's to recovering!
"Sometimes I feel like I don't make actual progress in therapy, because so often I just spend the whole time crying",12,mj05a7,7,"Seriously, 90% of the time in therapy I'm a slobbering, blubbering, sobbing mess of a human. It's probably because she's one of the only people I feel safe enough to be that vulnerable in front of. I worry that with my other friends they don't have the emotional bandwidth to handle the intensity of my emotions when I'm in that state so I often don't share with them, I really only feed them scraps.

Also I'm at that point in my 12 step programs where I'm going to be making amends soon and I don't know how it's not going to be a self-degradation fest because man I am so fucking ashamed and resentful for the person I was when I was drinking and using. I feel like I've used up all of my emotional, financial, and adult help allowance from my family so I can't let them in on how bad things are getting.

I know I'm doing the hard work, I know logically that it's good I'm doing this grieving process and it's part of my healing, but I can't help but feel bad for my therapist for having to constantly see me as a mess. I get so tired of being in crisis. I just want like 3 months where I'm not in crisis, where I don't feel overwhelmed by all the ways my life is falling apart and how emotionally unstable I can be sometimes.

For the record, I'm on the best medication cocktail I've ever been on, I have a great group of friends and maybe theoretically I could lean on them or my family if I wanted, but I still feel I used it all up when I was drinking and drugging and I don't want to be anything like that person. I go to meetings, do step work/talk with my sponsors regularly, pray/meditate, read self-help books, and try REALLY FUCKING HARD to eat regularly (and things like home cooked meals instead of fast food, which is often a struggle). So I'm literally trying my best"
I just hate myself and am triggered,16,miyzvc,9,"So I saw a meme about cptsd and it was funny and then the rest of the day I spent time panicking and remembering a bunch of shit I went through. I’ve always hated myself, I think. I’ve never wanted to be me, always wanted to be someone else. I’ve always been depressed and anxious and always told negative things.

I’m just in a spiral and I’m tired and I’m trying to be positive and do the positive things but I really want to do the negative things out of anger. I just hate my face, I have never felt valued and I can’t value myself. I’m back to obsessing about my appearance and being anxious about trash night."
I’m letting my kids be kids.,18,miyaln,2,"So, I was diagnosed with CPTSD in late January. It was a shock to me. While I was being diagnosed I powered through complex PTSD from surviving to thriving and women who love too much. And it triggered me into a REALLY bad really long flashback (think weeks) where I was a mess. Functional, but a mess. 

Anyways, a lot of my trauma is from my mom. And two weeks ago I really hit the nail on the head that I never felt like my mother loved me. So I spoke through it in therapy and I’ve been reflecting. 

Anyways, my downstairs neighbor is my moms age. And acts just like her. We are all friendly and hang outside when it’s nice. But she’s also a drunk. And likes to pick fights. Last summer I was out of control and she picked a fight and it was bad. We didn’t talk for 9 months. 

Anyways, tonight while my toddlers were silently playing on their kindles sitting down she texts me about how loud my kids are. And it wakes up her granddaughter and it’s “knocking the paintings off her wall” and I tried to ask her when did it start happening (we rearranged some of their toys so there is a trampoline in the living room now. I thought it was that) but she was complaining about when we were jumping on a mat yesterday. Okay. So she’s really just not answering my question and just telling me my kids can’t be loud and this and that. And I instantly got mad. I stopped texting her because I knew I would blow up if I did. I just deleted her texts and moved on with my night. I was annoyed, sure, but I wanted to figure out why. 

It dawned on me as I was putting my toddlers to bed that what she said is something that my mom would say to me as a kid. Be quiet. Don’t do that. Don’t do this. Stop being so loud. Don’t you talk. Just everything to make me not be a kid. And I realized that I DONT want that for my kids. 

I’ve always had this like thought in my head about when the day comes and my kids act out in public and some older person makes a comment, what I would do. Obviously, my fight mode always comes out. But I realized that this situation is very similar to that thought in my head. 

So I decided that I’m not going to do anything. Am I going to continue to jump with my kids all over the living room? Likely no, let’s be real. I’m not that rude. But am I going to make them stop playing and screaming and jumping and enjoying themselves? NO! Why? Because they are TODDLERS. They should be allowed to be toddlers. Not only that, they should be allowed to be toddlers in their OWN HOME. 

So I’m giving my little toddler self a hug right now and I’m going to allow my kids to be kids because they deserve it. They don’t need to conform to societies standards of being quiet and well behaved all the time. It’s okay for them to be kids. 

I’ve had a lot of moments like this where being a better parent to my kids than my mom was to me triggered me into realizations. And I’m not going to lie, I’m so thankful for that. I may not be the best mom, but that’s okay. I’ll be a good enough mom."
DAE find nothing works?,5,mj3zsv,4,"I've been to therapists and I'm always discharged with a letter stating I'm 'psychologically minded'. No idea what that means. Theyre always pushing getting a job.

Basically I have my appointments we talk about my past etc but I dont get better. I'm not afraid to look at my past or bring it up. I never have been. I know it wasnt my fault but it makes no difference. I just have this constant sense of impending doom. Everywhere I see people I feel my survival threatened and get this strong continuous physiological response and its exhausting so I've stopped leaving the house and as a result i find i can keep my fight flight system in check. So here's the thing, all people are my triggers, men, women and teenagers. Basically the only thing that doesnt give me a fight flight response are young children and babies. .I'm hyper vigilant 24/7. You see there was no patterns to the abuse I suffered as it was continuous so clearly my subconscious thinks i need protecting 24/7. No amount of self talk helps. I can tell myself a thousand times no one is gonna attack me but it doesnt help. The trouble is its ruining my future. Exposure doesnt work. I need my cognitive centres back so I can study from home and  be able to work from home."
Mixed feelings about becoming an aunt,1,mjbvsd,4,"So... my sister visited with her husband. They revealed that they are expecting a baby come September. I am overjoyed. I just worry about a baby being brought into this world. I love that there is going to be a new life coming into the world. I am taking my role as an auntie seriously. I want to be consistently there for this kid as a kind auntie. I don't think either of them have c-ptsd. They are wealthy and very compassionate. I am just so worried... what if the baby triggers their childhood trauma and they develop c-ptsd? What if the baby has epigenetic problems from the trauma history of our family. What if the baby develops c-ptsd from other trauma?

I have also seen cracks in their relationship before. At times... I have thought her husband was abusive and he runs a high temper at times. She is a perfectionist and doesn't understand mental illness and victim-blames. 

I don't know... I just can't imagine ever having a child without at least a decade of psycho-education, therapy and self-exploration under my belt. It makes me nervous... 

I worry that they are doing this from societal pressures and out of fear of biological clock ticking and being alone.

I secretly wish that something will go wrong and this baby wont be born...."

Does anyone else get bad muscle soreness from being tense all day?,481,miepbl,101,"Yesterday was a bad day and I spent the whole day with my shoulders frozen up and now it feels like I’ve spent 8 hours in the gym or soemthing


does anyone have any stress management tips and healthy methods of dealing with stuff?

EDIT: apparently this bad habit is called armouring and is a defensive response to chronic stress; for anyone loooking for answers it seems that most people were helped by:
- ball massage
- roller massage 
- breathing exercises 
- yoga
- Epsom salt baths
- hot water bottle
- meditating
- regular exercise 
- setting alarms to remind you to relax
- acupuncture (sounds scary ngl)
- trigger point massage/deep tissue massage"
I don't know how to articulate what it is about how I was raised that was wrong or how it hurt me,4,mj3nud,3,"Edit: nevermind this is a rant
I'm looking for any articles or videos or just your own suggestions and comments on what to tell my mother to make her understand that what she has done to me is not okay (hitting me, lashing out in anger at me, etc.). She always uses the excuses that 

- she's a ""single mother"" to me and my younger sister(she's not, my dad is very much alive, we used to go to his place every other weekend before the pandemic, he pays child support, used to pay alimony, my mom has no job, he checks on us by text and actually listens and has apologized for being an alcoholic, neglectful, always at work when we were younger, acknowledged that he has hurt us), 
- how she's going through a hard time because she struggles with depression (so do I and my sister and my dad, I even used to cut myself, which she knows about), 
- how her mom just died two weeks ago (she was MY grandma and we actually had a good relationship unlike her and my mom and she raised my sister and I from ages 12~17 when the pandemic hit),
- I ""have an attitude problem"" since I was 13 (when I stopped being a cute kid that listens to whatever they're told and started to defend myself instead of just crying and taking the abuse because of the sudden realization that I COULD defend myself and wanted/deserved better)

et cetera et cetera. Sorry this is unorganized she just came into my room and we had a little ""talk""/argument. It's midnight and I can't talk about it right now, my brain is everywhere. I just want it to stop. I just want my ""good"" relationship with my mom back, even if it wasn't actually good and was actually abusive, but I can't go back to being that child that thought how I was being treated was okay and I just need to support mommy and she'll love me properly and take care of me so making her understand is my only chance. Please just help me. I don't care if it's advice or emotional support or you tell me the relationship is unsalvageable I just need something right now."
Falling apart after deleting email,1,mjbcih,8,"I’m trying to find a new therapist. I emailed someone yesterday to see if they were accepting new patients. They emailed me back last night but through some kind of secure mail system. I had to create a password for the system, and my phone created a strong password that should have been saved into my phone’s passwords... but it wasn’t. When I tied to reply later I was locked out of the system AND it deleted the email. 

I am a complete failure and I should be dead. There’s no way this person is going to work with me. I emailed her back (not through the secure system but regular email) to let her know what had happened and now I sound like a crazy person. It’s over before it even began. It’s been hours now and she hasn’t responded because she can already tell how awful and fucked up I am. I shouldn’t be alive. It’s not easy to reach out for help and now I’ve humiliated myself and will be rejected again.

Edit - I’m triggered. This situation is hard to deal with, especially the waiting aspect."

Is PTSD/CPTSD really common?,11,miz9ki,5,"Out of curiosity I searched ptsd and it said it’s very common. I find that hard to believe. If it’s so common, then why is it so misunderstood?"
Does anyone else have an inner teenager more than/as well as an inner child?,168,miimxe,37,"I think my inner child was able to cope better, early childhood was still bad, but my teen years were by far the worst. When I was 13 my Mum had a breakdown, my Dad got made redundant & could not find a new job which lead to some huge emotional instability for him, and my disabled brother became jealous & violent towards me. Plus my Mum pulled us both out of school to home school us so I was totally isolated in complete dysfunction & chaos. 

I've had trauma throughout my life, but the highest concentration was in my teens. In my early childhood I was tenacious & stubborn, if I imagine my inner child & inner teen, the child is definitely either comforting the teen or hands on hips yelling at those that hurt her. 

Anyone else have a similar situation?"
Do you feel you get harassed / sexually harassed more by men as a CPTSD individual?,5,mj42o9,3,"Do you feel you are targeted more for sexual harassment than normal healthy people? I have begun to think I am, definitely less able to get rid of them because of having poor boundaries, but somehow they are just immediately drawn to me / take me as a target over everyone else."
I feel completely disconnected lately and I dont know what Im doing wrong,3,mj55nt,6,"This last year has been a big healing journey for me, one where I feel Ive gotten very far, for a better life. But this last month Ive been feeling completely out of sync, dissociated and Im having alot of social anxiety, anxiety attacks and flashbacks. 
I wake up in the morning feeling EXTREMELY angry and it lasts for hours. The anger and the anxiety is the worst parts.  I dont look forward to anything, I dont want to do anything but doing nothing is terrible aswell, as I cant get a moment alone from my negative thoughts. Its frustrating - I was getting so good and turning my negative thought patterns into positive, healing ones.

I dont understand why its happening and what Im doing wrong. I dont know what Im so angry about all the time. I dont know if Im depressed again, I doesnt feel like it did before. I still do my school and my work. I still see my friends and my boyfriend. I just dont really enjoy it like I used to."
Does anyone else have substance issues?,10,mj0cqp,9,"I know it’s a symptom and stuff but how many of you guys abuse substance? It used to make me feel good and now it doesn’t make me good anymore and I can’t stop using it. Any tips? I notice that when triggers and stuff happen I usually instinctively wanna get high or drink sometimes

Edit: I want to add more emotion. I’ve gone through so many cycles of wanting to get high and then as soon as I get high I hate myself. It scares me because sometimes I see how much smoking hurts my body and I still can’t stop. There’s always an excuse and always one last time. My ideal self is sober. I’m not an adult but I certainly abuse substance all the time. I know when I get triggered or a flashback my instant response is to suppress it."
DEA feel guilty when using disability accommodations/resources even when told your CPTSD qualifies?,6,mj1cna,5,"I spent a year trying to get disability accommodations through my university and finally got them recently. All my requests were approved plus some stuff I didn’t even ask for so logically I know the psychologist at the disability office thinks my stuff qualifies. 

And yet here I am, debating possibly getting a D in a class instead of asking to take a quiz that I missed due to an anxiety attack a day late because I asked for a similar thing earlier this week and “I am taking advantage”. Am I the only one?"
DAE grow up with an inconsistent parent? (Possible TW?),6,mj1ay9,7,"My mom was my best friend a lot of the time, but when she was bad she could be pretty nasty to me verbally. I wish I could remember specific instances but I can only remember a few that stick out which is weird because I’m only 24.. I would be in my room after school every day and I’d judge whether or not I should come out and say hi to her based on how she responded to the dog greeting her at the door. Her moods were very unpredictable and it felt like a game for me almost, having to decide what to do and navigate around her. I was a very rude and rebellious preteen and teen though so I can’t say it’s 100% her fault. 

She also made things about her a lot of the time because she had an eating disorder and had to weigh every piece of food she ate, would only eat a few specific foods and would not eat anything that wasn’t from home. I think this caused me to act out a lot and want attention. All it did however was make her disapprove of me so I don’t know why I did it. Clearly it wasn’t working the way I wanted it to. 

We had a lot of great, funny and sweet times together but the other times were the complete opposite. I have fond memories of us having movie nights, comforting me when I was sad, her taking me to the mall to buy me the clothes I wanted and sharing laughs. I also have memories of things she said to me that still fill me with shame and anger. Her relationship with my dad is the same. Anyone else?"
I’m jealous of people who can engage during therapy and talk about things and grow,5,mj330f,8,"I’ve been in therapy for a decade. I really like my current therapist. She knows about dissociation and trauma. She should be able to help me. But... all I do is dissociate and struggle to verbalize my emotions and experiences. And I have heavy emotional amnesia unless it’s about 2am and I’m alone. I’m wasting her time. My trauma literally wasn’t even that fucking bad. I’m embarrassed about how poorly my brain is coping with it. I see everyone else here with trauma that’s significantly worse and then I look at myself and yeah. It’s just embarrassing. 

I feel like a lost cause."
How do I known if I’m in a healthy relationship?,22,mitfcm,8,"I grew up with emotional neglect without experiencing any sort of secure attachment to any person. I (literally) don’t know how to trust others.

There’s this random gut feeling that sometimes alerts me that something is wrong, and in those cases I have no idea if I can trust my own judgement. I can’t tell if I’m the one who’s in the wrong, if I’m demanding too much, if I’m doing too much, if I’m communicating poorly despite my greatest efforts. 

There are moments when I don’t feel loved enough, and it instinctively feels like I’m being neglected on purpose. It’s frustrating. But I also don’t know how to express the need for more affection to my partner because I don’t know if I’m asking too much from them. I don’t even know if it’s appropriate or normal to ask for more affection, or if this is just something that is meant to balance itself out naturally in a healthy relationship. And what do you even say in such a situation without making an accusation?

I feel like as a man, especially in a romantic relationship, I’m not expected to be insecure and excessively sensitive. I’m meant to be confident, mature, stable and have my life figured out. I fear that opening up too much or being too emotional will drive people away. 

I have no idea what I can expect from my partner in a healthy romantic relationship. I don’t know how to define boundaries. I feel like I’m not even made for relationships, but I also feel the urge to be close to someone. 

How do I know if a relationship is healthy? How can I tell if my behaviour and communication is healthy?"

What's the line between a normal and abusive home?,3,mj34rp,4,"I grew up in a severely abusive home but I was told the whole time that it was normal, to the point I grew up not having any idea why I felt the way I did - CPTSD, dissociation, amnesia, trauma, feeling separated and distant from others. 

Just wondering what you feel is the difference between a normal and abusive home? Obviously nothing's perfect, but where is the line drawn?"
My outsides don't match my insides,6,mj0qq7,2,"I'm having a hard time. 

I don't know how to ask for and accept help, so saying here right now I'm having a hard time is the best I'm able. I'm very much struggling with my self image post divorce. I'm not dating and have lost contact with most of my friends from a life long ago. 

I hear I'm pretty. I'm tall. I'm curvy.  I remember being talked about, but not to me... more like I was a topic of discussion to my parents. ""She's so pretty. So mature. She looks so much older."" As though my breasts and hips and ass were a compliment. Something I had earned. Something of merit. 

I guess I feel bad and wish that I had more advanced skills to soothe myself from this. Pardon the outcry for appearance based validation"
Silliness as a coping skill. Hear me out.,4,mj0qil,5,"I've got some pretty heavy shit in my head. I know you do too. It can be pretty dark and extremely stressful and full of despair.

You ever try to listen to something ridiculously silly while you feel this way? Something that you know will make you laugh?

I know you really don't want to when you feel bad because you're not in the mood...

But I want you to do something right now and just see if my stupid little coping skill works for you. I want you to go on YouTube and create a playlist of just a couple of things that you know will make you laugh. Watch it the next time you're having a flashback or just having a hard time and tell me what you think. I know it feels like it's stupid maybe a bad idea and goes against the grain because you really don't want to look at something funny when you're having a flashback but just try it out.

If anybody wants to know the kind of stuff that I watch or listen to that makes me laugh just let me know"
Sex drive is nonexistent and full of fear. Afraid it’s going to end my relationship of 3 years. Trigger: CSA,8,miy8z3,3,"Hi, all. Very sorry about the long post. 

 I (23F) recently started Somatic Experiencing treatment in January with a specialist and am seeking reassurance that there’s hope for my long term relationship to survive through the trials of trauma treatment.

 I sought treatment because 1 year into my relationship (summer 2019) I started having panic attacks during sex. This 1 year mark coincided with moving in together with my partner, which my therapist identified as a common trigger for people who have experienced CSA. My partner and I previously had an amazing sex life, frequent, intimate, passionate, etc. Suddenly the thought of sex started to fill me with fear. The panic attacks grew worse and worse until I began pulling away even from kisses, afraid they would make me have more panic attacks.

For concision purposes, I was diagnosed with CPTSD with multiple counts of sexual assault (one CSA) several months ago. I guess I had been suppressing it all my life because my sex life was “good” before the onset of panic attacks. 

My partner has been really incredible for these past nearly-two years since the surfacing of my CPTSD. However, sex has been a huge struggle. Before I began trauma-specific treatment in January, I had figured out how to skirt around some of my triggers. Sometimes we successfully had sex and other times I had a panic attack (60/40). Ever since starting SME, though, this has been on a steep decline. We’ve had sex 3 or 4 times since January, and haven’t at all in nearly a month. 
 
I am torn and don’t know what to do. I know treatment is the most important thing and so does my partner (he’s incredible supportive) but I can’t get past the guilt of not being able to have sex. I constantly tell myself just to get over it and DO it. I was able to do it so many times before, but I just don’t feel like I have access to that part of me anymore. I’m not asexual or anything — I have desire — but I just can’t get past the wall of fear and anxiety. I really do drive myself to the brink of exploding with shame and guilt.

My partner and I are very open and honest about how we feel. This includes his obvious (and very normal) frustrations with not having sex. He always says yes, I wish we were having more sex, but it’s more important that you get better. And while it’s reassuring, it does reinforce this pressure to “get better” unintentionally. 

But what if I don’t get better? What if this is where I’ll be stuck forever, able to flirt and sleep with strangers easily (because it’s easy and unnoticeable to them if I dissociate), but unable to substantiate sex with a long term partner? What if I lose the best relationship I’ve ever had because I can’t get rid of the fear? 

I’m just hoping someone can offer some hope, coping solutions, or, at the very least, empathy. Right now it feels like I’m living on an island completely alone."
I am free,8,mixi1o,3,"Yesterday I found some letters to/from the man that severely abused me from my teenage years until recently, I am now in my 30s. 

Reading how utterly desperate, confused, scared 17year old me was and how cunningly manipulative his responses were triggered a huge change in me.
I felt such sadness,compassion and love for 17year old me, I just want to hug that little girl and protect her. While I am much older now I want to guard my teenage inner self and with that I finally have accepted myself and for the fist time in my life I now know what self-love feels like. For unxplainable reasons my body and mind are now one instead of 2 different things that never fit together. 
This experience seems to have unleashed floods of supressed emotions, especially sadness - but the self hate,shame and guilt are gone. 
It has been the most beautiful experience in my life. The weight I was carrying around is gone, I am finally free.

The 2 Main Types Of Narcissism And How To Spot The Difference,3,mj2p2y,2,"Hopefully this is helpful for people who have been confused if their parent is a narcissist, because they don't display grandiose narcissist traits that mainstream media always talk about. I was confused at the beginning of my healing journey because my mother is a vulnerable narcissist and she didn't fit mainstream grandiose narcissist behaviours.

And hopefully this is useful for people who are living with their narcissist, so they can form different coping strategies once they can identify which type the abuser is.

triggers everywhere,9,miwnsu,7,"I want to cry. My triggers are everywhere. Sex is so common in society. 

Reading a Reddit thread? Sex joke. 

Seeing an ad? Half naked people.

Instagram explore page? The god damn news channel posts about sexual things. 

Outside? Faceless humans/masks. Anyone else can't deal with that? 

YouTube comments.

Not to mention the sound and smell flashbacks. 

My half naked father. 

And many more things. 

I am constantly getting flashbacks. I am stuck and slowly dieing. It is exhausting. I just want to forget the horrors. I really want to get away from all these triggers. 

I feel like I am in immediate danger and try to protect me similar to ocd. 

The true horror is when I can't do anything to protect me. Then I lay there thinking I should give up and that I will never be safe. That I was doomed or something."

I can't let love in and sex disgusts me.,54,mik2dk,9,"I'm 22F and I've had my fair share of abuse growing up from sociopathic NF. The abuse was so severe, I was basically a dissociated zombie for almost 12 years. Some of the experiences I've had are:

* Being beaten up for watching porn & getting caught when I was 12-13
* Have my bastard of a father play pornography on loud speaker to scare me after I did not do my homework. 
* Him saying that any man who marries me will be unlucky and that he would definitely divorce me because I'm a nasty ""monster"". I was 10. 
* Being called a whore and beaten up for eavesdropping on my parents use the bathroom. It wasn't a perverted thing, I was just really amused by the peeing sounds. Just childish immature stuff.

This and numerous other abuses destroyed me completely. I've managed to heal my cognitive capacity now (after failing out of college with a 1.9 GPA) and am on track to graduating from another college with a 3.3 GPA now. I've also healed my emotional trauma and it has significantly improved my friendships/career prospects. 

However, I just cannot seem to undo the sexual shame within. I definitely am not asexual and do get attracted to guys but often feel scared that they will hurt me. The thought of sex disgusts me and I am frightened of letting a guy love me. Which is why I will fantasise all day long about my celebrity crush but if a cute guy walks past in real life, I will run the other way. 

It doesn't help that most people consider me extremely attractive (I genuinely do not see myself in that light) so when I do get interest, it scares me even more. There's this discrepancy between the ""shiny"" exterior everyone sees and the ""ugly shameful"" person within. 

I just cannot let love in. The thought of someone loving me is disgusting and the thought of having sex with someone who loves me, makes me nauseous."
thinking of little me as another person has made me gain a lot of empathy for what she had to go through :(,682,mi7qty,33,"TW; CSA, abuse, etc

for a long time, i never understand “inner child” stuff. i still am not sure if i do as i tend to think very logically, not imaginatively. i am trying though because so many of us talk about healing our inner child.

i was sexually abused at 9 and kept the same perspective as her until very recently. i was so ashamed and caught up in that narrative that little girl believed: she was different, something was wrong with her, she’s worthless. i’m 20 and logically i have always known it wasn’t my fault but i really held on to little me’s beliefs about what happened. now i’m looking back and it’s so sad. she was completely innocent... and a man decided to target her for his own sick gain. 

i used to love webkinz, club penguin, etc. i LOVED bratz and barbies too! me and my similar aged cousins would play and have fun, but that changed as soon as it happened. it’s sad that he ruined her childhood innocence and joy. my family also helped squash it but he definitely left the biggest mark.
my heart hurts for her so much. 

he took so much from her/present me :(

I don’t know if I am the bad guy.,14,misqby,7,"Hello. 19/F - CPTSD, PMDD, Depression, Severe Anxiety Disorder

I am so tired of having arguments and disagreements with my partner and not knowing whether or not I am being too sensitive or if it really is him being a shitty person or if I am halfway sparking out and flaming shit up because it’s PMDD time. Regardless, he is able to move on about his day like it was whatever and I am always left with a seething pain in my heart and physically crippled from the weight of the depression I feel after we argue. I feel like he does not love me and simply wants to torture me and won’t admit it for whatever reason. Sometimes I feel like he wants me to give in and die. It just feels like he is an emotionless void of a human and does not care about me at all. My life is so lonely. I work 40 hours a week at a Taco Bell making shitty pay and dealing with toxicity from my coworkers too and doing my best attempts to hold in any outbursts. I have no hopes of ever being promoted because I built a reputation for myself of not having any confidence and I am incapable of being 100% professional and normal. Then come home and live this pained life where I don’t know if today we will love eachother or not. I wish he knew the pain I knew - or that I didn’t have to continuously know this pain. 

I was abused and neglected by my parents physically and verbally my whole childhood and teen years. I have a long list of men who have groomed me, sexually abused me, physically abused me, the list just goes on and on. I started being sexually conditioned by grown men at 9 years old. I could keep going. I was just recently diagnosed with PMDD and it just feels like a bigger death sentence on my love life. It feels like guys I meet want to run away from me or pretend they understand but then leave me with even more trauma. I have these moments where I can feel myself almost rippling apart and replicating what I’ve had done to me. I have these moments where I feel like if I could just scream loud enough and punch something hard enough it would all change. I am so tired of being a broken person. 

I have only been in therapy since September and we honestly don’t meet enough (we meet for an hour biweekly), and because I feel so bonded with my therapist I find myself omitting certain information from her that could probably be helpful because I don’t want her to think I am a bad person or it just hurts way too much to talk about yet. Sometimes I wish I could just tell her how absolutely empty I feel and how I am ready to give up but I have no insurance so I can’t afford to be forced into a mental hospital. I don’t have the drive to deal with whatever stack of paperwork I’ll have to sign for financial assistance. I don’t want to take the debt because if my credit tanks I sure as hell will never be able to make it out of here. So there are some barriers there. 

I have no friends. I believe covid is real so the only people I see are my family occasionally. I don’t really see my old friends from high school because they are all drama and toxic and party and I have been on a break from all substances for a year now and no one wants to respect that. 

I am so tired of not feeling like myself at all. I am tired of being the ridiculous one who feels too much. I am so tired of not being able to be the numb one who is able to just smoke a bowl and laugh on with my buddies after a tense argument with my partner. I feel like I am going to be stuck living this kind of life forever and I’ll never really know if it’s by my own doing or I just have this terrible luck of getting tangled up with bad men. I spend so much time thinking about my future and the plans I have but I feel like I’m destined to end up killed by a partner or by my own hands eventually."
DAE start grinding or clenching their teeth in their sleep YEARS after your traumas “ended”?,61,mij25o,23,"I’m 24F, experienced several traumatic events. Some subtle “slow burns” involving my childhood and teen years, one sudden and tragic. I moved out of my parents’ house when I was 19 so I didn’t have to live in that environment anymore and the tragic event happened when I was 17. Only last March did I start clenching and grinding my teeth to the point that they’re chipping, I constantly have headaches especially when I wake up and my jaw is always sore to open. I also have been having anxiety dreams consistently for a year as well. I’m thinking, why now?! Is this related to my CPTSD or totally random?"
There is no nostalgia.,3,mizxtt,3,"When you have no sense of a time before.

When Does It Get Better?,2,mj32gr,5,"Everyone keeps saying that. Everyone keeps telling me that it gets better eventually. All of my family keeps telling me to stick it out, that if I can just pull myself up and get working that it'll get better and every day feels so, so much worse. My friends say that to make things better I need to make major changes in my life but when I tried that I ended up hospitalized against my will and now my counselors think I'm crazy. My mom said she might need to get a guardianship on me, and I don't think I can stress enough how viscerally terrifying that idea is.

I was supposed to be on a plane today. I had a ticket to go to a friend's house and she was going to help me, and then everything happened and my mother said she'd get a restraining order on my friend and get conservatorship over me and when I tried to tell the counselors at the hospital how badly I needed to leave they said that I was a danger to myself.

I keep having nightmares and despite that I'd rather stay asleep because sometimes they really feel better than this does. I've tried so many different things and somehow it's all managed to make things worse. How did I fuck up so badly? How can I actually make this better? I'm so paralyzed by guilt and sadness and anger that I can hardly function and I'm so so scared that if I seek help they're going to put me back in the hospital but I can't keep living like this. I can't talk about this to anyone because I'm scared they're either going to use me and manipulate me or I'm going to be sent away again. I can't wake up. I can't even stand the thought of doing something with my life anymore. I don't know where to start to make any of this get better."
Samee!!,1,mj5r2v,1,Omg Ik 14 and I’ve been getting that exact same feeling at different moments in my entire life and I’ve tried to search this but nothing comes up. I remember when I was little I would get it get it so often out of nowhere. Usually it would be when I woke up in the morning and just feel disgust towards my whole family and it is exactly how u described when you said that it would be especially in the moments when you would feel close to them and it would last a few minutes. The best way I could describe it would be repulsion or like when people say they’re getting the icl to their partner except it would feel like that but it would be out of nowhere for no reason and towards everyone in the world but especially my close family members except they never did anything wrong so idk why. I would describe the feeling as when u eat something too sweet and then u feel sick. I would usually get this feeling on Christmases or Easter or days that my family just felt a lot closer to each other but I would also get it on random days too. A lot of the time I would get the same feeling when I’m talking to close family members about emotional things I would just straight away feel sick for a few minutes. The weirdest thing about it is that I get this feeling when my family feels close. And I just remembered this today because I haven’t gotten this feeling for a few years since I was little but I woke up with this exact feeling again and also it’s Easter and my family feels closer so idk if that’s why. If you know what this feeling is please let me know.
Looking for Treatments and Executive Functioning Advice,5,mixzw5,4,"Hey guys,

I wrote a huge thread the other day but its very long so I condensed it down to something important I wanted to gain some insight into.

For those of you who are healing/have healed from CPTSD, what treatments worked? I’m specifically wanting to restore/fix executive functioning and I’m looking into ketamine therapy, EMDR & neurofeedback. Eventually MDMA therapy but it’s not legal yet, unless I find an underground therapist. I've done a lot of work on my mind using psychedelics and educating myself, but the biggest issue right now is the impacts my brain is having on my day to day life.

I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD, but I believe 20 years of trauma has caused my brain to be completely fucked (to put I lightly). Executive dysfunction is crippling my life very badly and I wanna function ""normally"" so I can get things done in life.

Any pointers as to which kinds of therapies I should start first? Any stories to share around executive functioning coming back/strengthening with treatments?

I started looking into doctors and clinics today. Looking to take a few months off working ASAP to start doing a lot of healing.

Thanks in advance."
I didn’t do anything wrong.,8,mivtat,6,"I was just a child. I was never beaten or physically abused. But emotionally it was day after day after year of fighting and witnessing violence and being gaslit and there was no set way I could act that would satisfy my abuser. My parents weren’t emotionally equipped to stop the abuse (and in some cases brought their own abuse, though these days they’re much better, even if one is chronically fearful and the other is chronically unable or unwilling to show love). 

They should have thrown her in boarding school. 

So I’m just sobbing. It’s not my fault. It never was. Yet I’m caught up in alcohol (day one here, day two hopefully will begin around 3:30am) and it just makes me feel worse. 

I want to be emotionally resilient. Drinking provides the exact opposite plus a lot of other issues. 

But it’s not my fault. I am an adult now and it’s up to me to make life decisions. I can’t take away the past. But my brain neurologically is about 11 years old—it’s still stuck there. 

But like Matt Damon’s character in Good Will Hunting, it’s not my fault. 

Thank you for reading."
Musical brain orgasms?,118,mif7j8,61,"I found out tonight that having 'brain orgasms' to music is not what people mean when they say ""they like music"".

I have always had very physical reactions to certain music; opera, some blues, soulful singing, classical-that sort of thing. 

I feel the music like energy in a very visceral way and it feels like my brain is being massaged and its often...exceptionally pleasant. A brain orgasm. I have no other way to describe it. I become the music.

So now I've found out that this isnt ""normal"" and I've just realized that I DISSOCIATE, hard-core dissociation, in a really nice way (not like my pre-flashback, trauma dissociation) and that's why I get so much pleasure from my ""dance meditations"" which is what I call what I do most nights where I induce this purposely.

I know this isn't big or important or trauma but it feels like the more I learn about c-ptsd and my brain, the more I discover. I would love to know if anyone else can relate to this in any way. 

If this is a symptom then as far as symptoms go, this one is my favorite."

"intense ""waiting anxiety""",2,mj1q99,3,"every saturday i have a  class at 1 that my fmaily pays for and that im doing completely of my own volition. i dont need the class but im too scared to end it. even though i have normal class during the week, starting wed thurs or fri i start to get really anxious about it. this morning i have the day off but i woke up thinking it was saturday, anxious about this stupid hour long class. i cant relax right now because im thinking about it. i dont know why it being on the weekend makes it so much more stressful. how do i deal with this?? im not a busy person, my teachers cool (although im always scared im wasting her time and boring her), and i shouldnt be this fucking stressed about it. maybe im just constantly anxious and my brain needs something to cling to to be anxious about.

"""Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom"" ~ Viktor E Frankl",21,mimrvu,1,"I read a snippet in here the other day about how humans emotionally regulate each other as an evolutionary trait.  I thought this was an interesting point to keep in mind as we move through and respond to the world and people around us.  


We respond emotionally to other people's emotions, whether we notice our response or not.


I am still struggling with regulating my own emotions when others have strong emotions around me.  I thought perhaps others may be as well, and sharing my thoughts about how we can try to emotionally regulate ourselves while still being empathetic may be helpful to others.


Changing our emotional responses first requires recognition that they happen.  The only way to do this is practice recognizing body and mind's responses to what happens around us.  


I will warn you that in my experience this practice starts slow but builds quickly, and is incredibly uncomfortable for a time.  It got better when I started seeing and acknowledging when I was controlling my programmed responses and feeling a sense of victory in that.  Recognizing and celebrating growth helps us motivate to keep growing.


Examples of noticing how I react to to others emotions include that when someone around me is angry, I get anxious and flighty.  Every time.  This is because of people in my life who used their anger as a tool to get me to behave in certain ways.  There were often escalating consequences if I did not do or say what they wanted.


Also, when someone around me is sad, I tend to fawn because of people in my life who used emotion in a manipulative manner.  They weren't crying or expressing sadness because of genuine sadness, they were crying to try to get me to do what they wanted.  Now I often feel manipulated by people's sadness, even sometimes when it is genuine.  


I feel like I am getting better at recognizing manipulative verses genuine emotions, but that is involved and may eventually be another post.  I will say, watch body language and trust your intuition.  If an emotion seems fake to you, it may be, but use caution in calling that out, because it may not be for the reason you think.  It could be that person's trauma response leading them to deflect - meaning their emotion is real but it isn't about what they are thinking and saying it is.  Recognizing when we are deflecting comes with this practice as well.  And make no mistake, we do deflect.



Learning to feel my own responses to others' emotions, actions, etc was the first step to emotionally regulating myself despite outside stimuli.  It was hard, and the only recommendation I have for learning to do it is meditation, because that is what finally worked for me.  It is a constant practice, noticing what we feel and choosing what our response may be.   


This is where the quote in the title comes in.  I literally visualize space.  Stars, clouds, whatever.  This really helps me stop and create a moment for myself, instead of instinctively responding to things.


These days, when I feel myself starting to respond to something I don't want to respond to, like someone else's emotions, words, or actions, I can sometimes but not always slow or even stop my response.  Once the reaction stops, I can reason myself back to neutral and then respond dispassionately.   Or I can choose to respond with emotion, but appropriately instead of reactionarily and possibly disproportionately.


The last thing I will mention is that this is a practice.  That means you won't be good at it at first.  That is fine.  There is progress in simply recognizing where our reactions were not what we hope for ourselves, acknowledging to the people around us that we are trying, and starting again from where we are.


We have to forgive ourselves when we fall back into old patterns, and acknowledge that simply recognizing those patterns is growth.  Growth takes time.


Thank you all for being here, and for your posts and comments.   They help me figure myself out, and I am immensely grateful!


Edit: bc spelling and grammar are hard."
One of the reasons we need a safe space,5,mix5z0,1,"A lot of my healing journey has been breaking parts of myself down in order to accept help.

In my experience toxic people can be really good at getting and keeping you in your window of tolerance, when it's beneficial. This is one of the biggest draws of reengaging during a rough patch. It's difficult to go to a safe person who doesn't feel safe, which depending on your CPTSD can be everyone healthy. Or everyone.

This is why therapists start with slow boring safe spaces, so we can stay calm and start making the change ourselves."
Having a child with CPTSD,4,miwx4c,8," My partner wants a Child and wont budge on it. 

I can't talk her out of it.

We do own a house, our finances are decent. My partner did say she will wait 2-3 years more for me so I can continue work through my trauma/depression. 

I used to be ok with having 1 child but my depression resurfaced a couple years ago now.

I think my biggest fear is being anything like my Father to my child. 

I think depression may have warped my world view to be even darker.

I just have trouble wanting to bring another life into this world. It seems to be getting harder and harder to buy a house, cost of living goes up, salaries don't raise to match cost of living. Climate change on the horizon.

Greed is rampant - money and excess wealth often seems to make people uncaring and arrogant.

To me things often appear to be getting worse and worse with the world and economy etc. Higher stress more productive work for less take home pay and buying power then previous generations etc etc.

Maybe it's just we now have the opportunity to see all this injustice and suffering with the adoption of the internet etc? Maybe I just pay way too much time and attention to all this shit I can't control?

My partner thinks things will get better. She refused to change her mind and wants a child.

Am I just so fucking depressed my world view got warped again these last couple years?

Is the world going to get better? Should I just turn a blind eye to all that shit like everyone else seems to?"
Feeling unhappy in my relationship with a CPTSD person,3,mj0llf,2,"I've been dating someone with CPTSD for nearly a year now. Things were great when we were talking to each other online and even when we met in person, I thought things were fine. We moved in together at the end of last year but I'm not sure the relationship is working out for either of us.

The main issue is because of her CPTSD and perhaps some other mental issues, she doesn't seem to experience positive emotions very strongly at all, which means she's never motivated to do anything. She doesn't have a job and just plays video games all the time but never feels like doing much with me. I can't tell how much she actually gets out of the relationship. And because she moved to a different state to live with me, she doesn't have Medicaid and has no access to a therapist.

And because she has generally operated at a level of being emotionally numb for a lot of her life, I'm not sure she understands that I have emotional needs I want fulfilled? She's more lively whenever she drinks because I feel like it allows her to loosen up and experience emotions more freely but she's an alcoholic so I'm also in this position where I have to monitor her alcohol intake.

Overall though, I don't know if we're good for each other? She says I provide emotional comfort for her but also it sometimes doesn't even feel like we're in a relationship with each other.

I don't know if this kind of emotional numbness is common with CPTSD people but it just leaves me wondering if I'll ever be able to have a normal relationship with her. I'm just not sure how to help her. I feel like she had more support in her home state but I don't know how much she's attached to me? How do I even best help her?"
I am trying to understand why I am the way I am and I think it all stems from a childhood of traumatic experiences. (Trigger Warning: Family / Childhood trauma),7,mise0e,3,"I'm sorry. I really just need some insight from other people in a similar situation to mine. With the help of my older sister, I am starting to remember things my parents did during my childhood that might have been traumatic for me. They never did anything to me directly but I still feel it left an impression on me. 

I was just talking to my sister who is a lot older than me. About our childhood. If our parents also we're fighting constantly when my siblings were small. And she said that it wasn't as bad as when I was a child. 
And she also told me that when I was a child that my mom had an affair. 

She also confirmed that my parents never really cared for us. There was moldy food in the fridge. My mom smoked on purpose when she was pregnant with me and had a fight with my dad. 

Also, my dad always wanted a really manly son, just like him, and I guess my older brother wasn't good enough so he took it out on me

When I was a child (between possibly around age 4 until age 14) my parents were almost constantly fighting. And with fighting, I mean things like this situation:

About when I was 6, I was in between my mom and dad when they were having a bad fight, just sitting there and listening to them. My mom stood up and got a knife from the kitchen and was threatening my dad with it. Sometimes they punched each other and they were bleeding badly. 

Once it got so bad and I was so scared that somebody would die that I went to my siblings and told them about it. Afterward, my mom didn't talk to me for a few days.

They were constantly involving me in their fights. Asking me for my opinion, mind you, I was a child. I didn't really have a place to retreat to. So I was sitting there with them. I always thought it was normal. 

I really only have bad memories of my childhood. And the rest I pretty much forgot about. 

Sometimes I even get flashbacks to all of it.

Some of the stuff I remember more clearly has happened in the past few years.

My mother got diagnosed with kidney cancer a few years back. The day she got diagnosed, we didn't really know how bad it was. Most of the family was there. My sister with her sons, one of them 5 years old, were all sitting there, not knowing what's going to happen.
My dad was walking around and grinning, then he went up to my 5-year-old nephew and asked him ""what are you gonna do when your grandma is dead?"" and grinning and laughing while asking it. 

I think it was also around this time when my mom got pushed by my dad and fell toward the heating unit with her head. She had a really bad wound and needed to get stitches. 

It was in the middle of the night. I had to get up early the next day because of work (I'm still living in the house with them and have my own floor). 

She called me and told me I have to protect her from my dad and that I needed to help her. 

Even after that, they never divorced or started living apart. No, they are still living together and I think they are emotionally dependant on each other. 

About 8 years ago, when I was 20, I was moving out for a while and started living on my own. My mom asked if she could visit me and of course, I told her she could visit me, but I asked her if she could call beforehand so I know she's coming. She told me that she would rather not visit at all if she had to call me before. 

There are a few memories I would rather not go through at all cause they trigger me really badly. But this is basically the gist of it. This is basically what I was experiencing during my childhood and early adulthood and I think it is the source for all of my other problems.

My anxiety, the self-hatred, the depression, not able to have a functioning relationship, constantly hurting myself emotionally, and so many other things that I don't even know where to start and how to fix anything. 

A few days ago, I came out as trans to a few school friends of mine cause I thought they would hate me and I could hurt myself with it. (They were respectful, so thankfully that didn't happen)


Of course, I only told you about the bad things my parents always did. But they are also nice to me, which makes it so much more difficult to understand any of it."
dont ever put me in a situation,8,mirip9,1,"i know thats a meme but i relate to it way too hard. i only ever go outside to get groceries or to the dog park, but i always have to go with my aunt or my mom because every situation that isnt being in my room alone is entirely too stressful. not to mention being outside makes me dissociate? i have no clue how im going to go back to in person classes. everything is terrifying and i dont even realize it because im always avoiding everything"
"Despite having symptoms of CPTSD myself, I do not know how to support my partner when they have a traumatic response to a trigger. Advice wanted.",16,min14k,10,"I've done a lot of work on my own cptsd, but I still feel like I do not know how to support my partner when they have their own traumatic response to one of their triggers. They don't have a lot of triggers, but kitchen mistakes is the big one. For instance, yesterday, they were cooking dinner and nearly finished. When it was time to pull the dish out of the broiler, they reached in and grabbed it without oven mitts. They yelled when they realized how hot it was and dropped it. The dish flipped over and spilled the food all over the bottom of the broiler drawer of the oven and the floor. They practically ran to the other side of the room like they wanted to get away from me and screamed and started apologizing repeatedly and crying.

I can be calm and quiet and do what is needed materially in these situations, but I feel like I'm lacking emotionally. Like I was able to tell them that it was fine and a totally normal mistake. I gave them a job to keep the dogs in the living room while I cleaned it up. They were too upset to pay attention to the dogs. I really felt like it was way out of my league to deal with outside of holding them and telling them that it's not a big deal, I'm not mad, we can order out. They were really getting on themselves for being dumb, a waste of space, not worth the time. Everything that comes out of my mouth feels like all the pointless things that have been said to me by people in my life. I feel very helpless. I default to giving space and leaving the issue alone. I put on some Simone Giertz videos later for us to watch because I like how she shows that making mistakes, mourning them, and continuing on are all part of the learning process. 

They finally have health insurance again and have found a therapist that they want to reach out to, but it hasn't happened yet. I totally empathize with that situation, but it does mean that the kitchen mistake reactions are here to stay for a while. Are there any resources I can find so that I can be more supportive? I'm not interested in being someone's therapist, but I do feel like there's got to be something I can say or do that's better than ""you're okay, it will be fine, it's okay to feel bad, it's not a big deal"". 

I think it's so cool that they want to cook even though this kind of reaction is possible for them when they try. I wish I could say that in a way that reaches them without being infantilizing. A lot of my work on myself had to do with opening myself up to compliments/ praise without seeing it as pandering. I don't know if it's possible to do from outside or if it's even part of the issue for my partner. Really at a loss.

Edit: we did talk about it and my partner said I pretty much did what they needed from me. They really couldn't bear to look at the mess at the time so that was all the right stuff. It makes me feel better about what I did. It did bring up some stuff for me and how my parents dealt with mistakes, so I will be bringing this up in therapy for multiple reasons lol. I think my discomfort was mostly on my end and my own issues, not anything I was doing wrong."
First EMDR Session,17,mimu1l,5,"My therapist said I did really well and overall it was a positive experience.

...except it kind of rattled the cage that holds the beast that is my anger. And by ""rattled"" I mean threw it down the stairs and screamed, ""WAKEY WAKEY, EGGS AND BAKEY!""

So now I have this strangely calm access to my rage and nowhere to really channel it, and it's *exhausting* keeping it from redirecting at other people."
Does failing to reduce harm to others negate the efforts in trying to do same?,1,mj3d8h,2,"Not a day where im not trying. Not a week that im not in therapy or medicated. 

Does my failure to be a productive calm member of society mean i am failing?

Am i kidding myself when i say my maladptive coping strategies are better than nothing?"
My bf is struggling and isn't taking care of himself. How can I encourage him to get support?,8,mirmje,2,"My partner is currently not speaking to me and is in such a ""doom"" state about us that I'm not sure we'll be able to pull through it. Using a throwaway to maintain his privacy.

Our last fight last week was around how I'd like him to be more present with me, how it'd mean a lot to just acknowledge that he needs space, or acknowledge my feelings after he's gone silent. I don't expect him to be perfect, I just wanted him to verbalize his understanding of my feelings. I brought this up that Tuesday as empathetically as I could, but before we'd get anywhere, he'd say he was too upset and we'd talk later, but he'd never actually meaningfully follow up to REALLY try to understand me. On Friday I was really upset and cried, and that's when he disassociated completely. I specifically asked him for comfort and he said he just couldn't. Still, I made the effort to compartmentalize my hurt and told him it was important for me to support him, which in this case meant giving him space and acknowledging that pushing for a resolution when he wasn't ready made things harder for both of us. From previous fights I know that he won't likely use this time to self-soothe; he's trying to forget.

On Sunday, his sister (who lives in another country) reached out to me; this surprised me because we've never met in person and haven't spoken too much. However, she wanted to check in because he'd been impossible to reach in the last couple weeks and consequently thought I might be facing some challenges with him. She explained a lot I'd suspected already, though he never delved too far into the details with me - their childhood was difficult; emotionally absent parents in a toxic relationship that ended in divorce and a split home, a rejection of vulnerability and emotional expression, his father starting a new family focusing more on them, and any attention was typically critical/negative. Their mom was just burnt out from it all. In his last long term relationship, he unfortunately experienced prolonged infidelity while he struggled with seeing his father ill and in the hospital. His sis said that his answer to all this was to shut down and resist any feeling for days/weeks, explosive anger when he feels ""cornered,"" and a general resistance to vulnerability. My internet search landed me here, and I'm so grateful to have found this community.

My home was not without problems, but it was stable, happy. My dad is a grumpy man who sometimes has a hard time with me/my sisters' level of agency, but he never overimposed and was never absent. Any deficiencies as a father were balanced by his unequivocal love for his family - his childhood was scared and uncertain and he promised ours would never be that way. My mom is passive in her own life, but raised us to be assertive while kind/empathetic. All this to say, difficult conversations have never been scary or off limits for me, and I've always felt that fights/conflict are easy to compartmentalize and separate from my actual overall sentiment for the person (e.g., I can be mad about something but still have warm fuzzy feelings overall) I've found it incredibly hard to navigate this space carefully with my partner. My conversation with his sis helped shed some light onto what's going on with him, and she also said that she's seen a surprising emotional growth from him in the last year he's been with me, but she wants him to be more proactive in addressing his hurt. It surfaced more questions for me:

What's the best way for me to support him right now? Now that I know these behaviors existed outside of me, I'm a little less hurt by them and want to prioritize his emotional safety with me for now. I want him to feel supported and valued. Then, importantly, how do I approach the topic of his trauma without him feeling cornered? He's incredibly resistant to delving into his past and reliving certain memories, but I really think it's crucial to healing. Lastly, are there any tips you can give me for voicing my needs/concerns in a less triggering way for him? I've purchased some resources (body keeps the score, etc.) but any anecdotes from you guys are also very helpful.

**Tl;dr: My bf has a history of explosive anger and disassociation, and is resistant to fully feeling his feelings. How can I provide him emotional safety and encourage him getting the help he needs?**

I constantly feel that I am unworthy of living a life and that I better give it to others.,1,mj351i,1,"CPTSD has turned me from a human to a house-elf who exist only to serve others. We are so used to give away everything that we can't keep anything for ourselves, not even our own lives. I am coming out of a long battle with depression and finally at a place where I feel okay. Now my automatic response is to tell myself that probably some other trauma is waiting for me in the corner so I don't need to be complacent or I tell myself to rest because some time later, I might have to fight for some more issues."
Does anyone else have moments when their body spontaneously spasms?,58,mig8ob,51,"Imagine like a dog going to shake, a very rapid wiggle from side to side. I can't control it and it usually happens randomly- most often often talking to someone else. I'm guessing it's to do with releasing pent up anxiety or stress. Noticed it probably a decade ago. It really weirds out other people sometimes."
"How do you keep on course with ""doing the work"", whatever that work might be, when youre feeling okay?",3,mixd5y,3,"Basically, I am okay some of the time. My cptsd is always there. I am kind of always in a triggered state and, while uncomfortable, its easy to get comfortable feeling that way. I always feel a level of anxiety and depression and its become normal for me. 
There are days when my anxiety and depression are so bad that I contemplate suicide. Its in these moments where it hurts too much to bear and I usually do anything and everything to heal. I buy books, sign up for a program, talk with my therapist, write in my journal, reach out to people, etc. 

But as soon as I feel a little better, I get exhausted and stop. 

I'm sure most things are like this and I'm sure my energy is unusually low, but I want to actually heal this time. 

What makes you keep going? 

Bonus question : what have you found (program, therapy, friend, etc) that works for you?"
Why do I feel that my mother badmouths me in front of my family?,7,mistgd,6,"34/f Battling panic attacks, depression led me to learning about cptsd. Have been reading up and working on myself. I have this constant anxiety that my mother talks about me behind my back. She never stood up for me.. She didn't defend me against sexual abuse nor verbal abuse. Few months back when I told her about my cousin molesting me  when I was 6, she didnt say anything and just forgot about it. Now that I am working on myself and not fulfilling her narcissistic needs, she has become hyper alert. She gets angry when I don't call her everyday or don't pick up her call once. Whenever we talk on call, I have this constant fear of getting in her bad books. I am scared that she will talk bad and make fun of me behind my back with my brothers. I have seen them laugh at other's for their mental health issues... Calling them crazy etc. They ridiculed me when I told them about my depression. Once I had a severe panic attack when my brother verbally abused me in front of my parents. They didn't stand up for me. My brother kept telling my panic attack was a drama. I couldn't speak up as I was in the middle of the attack. Ever since I started working to set boundaries with them, I feel alienated. I fear that they might be scheming against me, calling me crazy.They might not me doing this or scheming but still I am just so anxious about it. How do I get rid of this feeling that they are gossiping about me? Is it some kind of paranoia?
 
I have a loving husband who understands and supports me so much. Still I feel miserable, abandoned and without a family. I am too weak to go NC. Any progress I make goes out the window when I talk to mother and brother."
"First try to describe the pain, this is what came out. Long read.",3,mix13m,1,"Today I thought to write. 
I asked myself one of the millions of questions I ask but never answer. I was thinnking about my life and playing out how I might explain my self medicating to the people I have known who assume the worst about me. And it hit me I still cannot describe the pain I was treating by getting drunk as often as I could.
 
I never liked being high or drunk. That is not to say I did not have some good times, but I can only count those on one hand. mostly the effect I wanted from getting drunk was what happened after I sobered up. That pain was diminished and receded into the back ground. 

How can I describe it? It was oppressive. I often feared I might start to spontaneously scream and scream and scream wildly. I knew I was not crazy I just didn't know where it came from or what it was. Even after I got sober for about 10 years it was there but greatly diminished. Then went out again for another 4 years, it was there but still small. Then I got triggered by the people at the treatment program I went through. I began to obsess about my childhood before continuous memory began at age 7. Eventually I had an epiphany about one the the nightmares that woke me up; It was  a memory not a nightmare! 

When I began looking for info I kept on remembering more and more as I spoke to people who still behaved in the gaslighty way they did when I was a kid. That is the connection to the people who triggered me, the similarity to the gaslighting me about empirical facts. Anyway the final straw that lifted that oppressive ball of pain that dogged everyday of my life was innocently asking an Aunt about a memory I had.  She gasped. Then unconsciously said out loud ""you remember that?"" (I was 2) when I answered her not yet realizing what was going on she attacked. She turned into an evil person speaking nastily at me (we were on the phone) Telling me no one would ever know and even if they did they would not care. Then she hung up and immediately blocked me from being able to call her number. 

I was confused and hurt. But it was that conversation which brought up the memories that finally gave me the reason for the oppressive pain. She was my chief abuser. She was the architect of so much torture, sex abuse, mental abuse, conditioning, grooming, and a plot to murder me which she told me about over and over again, in a staged accident so that she and her mother could sue the owner of whatever property they managed to succeed on. 

Two more things. I believe her resentment of me was directly related to her jealousy of her father, my grandfather's love for me. Every night when he came home he would carry me around and sit with me and talk to me. I wish I could remember what those conversations were. And I lost thing 2.....oh yea she and her mother my grandmother would tell people at these places they took me to stories about me that were obviously not true. They'd describe me as very active and desirous of climbing on things and how they worried I might fall. I would of course be very afraid and not do it for them when they prompted me to climb. Some lady they were trying it on noticed my behavior and realized something was hinky. I remember her confronting them about how afraid I was and how obvious their lie was. IDK if it went any further. 

I was also being starved by them to weaken me and ensure I got injured more easily. They'd lock me up all day in a cabinet so I couldn't get exercise by moving about. Auntie was in training to be a nurse and using that knowledge to design her tortures of me. The main one being stretching my neck to weaken it. She would tell me it was to make me taller. Everyday when she came home from HS she would do it for a while then sexually abuse me and do it some more. She was 16 when I remember her start sexually abusing me. It lasted until????

IDK when the murder plot began. But about then too. 
Still cannot describe the oppressive pain. I painted it once back when I got sober the first time. I woke up in the middle of the night and painted it. 

I'm not healed by any means but that oppressive pain I thought might kill me is no longer.

Edit- It just occurred to me that this impulse to explain is part of why we tend to doubt ourselves. I think the need to explain is an attempt to figure out our symptoms."
I'm scared of being honest,2,miz19r,4,"I've been in a relationship for two years with a wonderful woman. She's kind and cares about me for who I am. 

As I get healthier and more accepting of myself I have become more aware of the people I want in my life. I like deep relationships that have meaning. I like talking with people about real things.

During this pandemic season my girlfriend moved in with me and we have been living together for 8 months.

We're not physically intimate very much anymore and I'm not enjoying her company nearly as much anymore. I'm finding I'm not interested in her as a person. I don't respect her choices. We aren't able to go deeper because she doesn't want to discuss hard things in her life or dig in spiritually.

---------

I'm scared of being honest with my feelings. I'm scared I'll hurt her with my feelings. I'm scared I don't know my feelings. I'm scared I'm just in some kind of funk and I'm not thinking clearly.

I spent most of my life not trusting my instincts and not really knowing what I'm feeling because my feelings weren't allowed in my family.

I'm so confused about what to do or how to navigate this."
Something I realized hit me hard,9,miqcw8,3,"I've been having a rough few days. I told someone I love very much that I ""was tired of being sorry"", for things that I had to be responsible and accountable and sorry for. I'm not tired of being sorry, I'm tired of hurting people. I'm tired of being responsible for other's pain sometimes. I'm really trying to fix myself. I'm trying to work on my issues. I'm really trying to work on the things I'm doing and work on my trauma and I hurt. I really, really hurt, and I'm trying. I'm in so much pain and I'm so proud of myself. It takes so much time and effort for me to fix the things I was taught, the things that were done to me that I can't do to anyone else."
I think I’m getting closer to the buried memories and I’m overwhelmed by anger and rage and feelings of such intense loss.,2,miyuvp,3,"I hardly know how to put this into words. I learned I have CPTSD about 2.5 years ago and it’s been such a difficult journey of exploration and unearthing and acknowledging childhood trauma (spiritual, physical, emotional) that led me to where I am today. Over and over, it has been clear that I deal with so many of the classic signs of childhood sexual abuse...but I have zero memories of any such thing. It’s as though I live with the results but have no proof (even the slightest) that it actually happened. It’s been a source of incredible shame and self doubt and feelings of being an imposter. There have been people throughout my life who have noticed signs and asked me if someone hurt me, but I always felt like I must be somehow deceiving people because the answer was no!

But as I’ve continued therapy in a couple forms, something seems to have shifted recently. I’m having stronger bodily reactions to the subject of CSA, and the fact that it seems so likely something happened. I feel like something awful is coming. It’s hard to explain. 

Through tears, I blurted to my therapist this week that if this did happen, and whoever it was was standing in front of me, I want to kill him. I feel like my whole life was stolen. There is so much pain and trauma that I’ve struggled with, and it feels like I have no idea who I could have been. I’ve done my absolute best, but it’s like I am in a terrifying dark hole and could never get out. 

I feel sick. I don’t want to be scared. I just want to be free, and unafraid, and able to love myself and not feel so dirty and gross."
DAE has been living with existential dread?,3,miut8n,3,"Don't know how else to put it. I have been diagnosed with trauma related depression only, so I don't know much about anxiety symptoms and maybe this is it. But ever since I grew up I have had trouble going to sleep. I worry about anything really, but especially before I fall asleep I get so scared. Small things turn into nightmare fuel. I feel like my life is falling apart, and this has been a constant.

I don't know why that is. I have been taking sleep medication and it has helped tremendously. Also SSRIs. But the fear is still there. It still comes up. Always lingering. Like I am constantly in extreme danger. I have learnt to live with it and therapy certainly has helped, but it's never fully gone..."
I feel really defensive about the fact that I can't remember/freeze when trying to remember what happened to me and I just need to yell about it,7,miqx12,2,"I struggle to remember specific incidents from the years I spend growing up in an abusive household. And the years of deeply traumatic homophobic bullying/ostracizing by my community.  Like there's whole years of my life I have little to no memory from because things were so bad and I blocked it all.  Then there's all the times where I know there's a memory there, but when I try to recall it I just totally freeze and briefly dissociate and can't verbalize it.  Usually after that I end up saying some blander, safer and less bad memory instead of what I was trying to think of.  

 This has lead to so many people in my life not believing me, downplaying it, or outright gaslighting me into thinking nothing happened.  I gaslighted myself into thinking it wasn't bad and I was just weak and needed to get over.  My therapist, who has never given me reason to think she doubts me, asked me about the first time I remember being angry last session and I gave some bland, non abuse related memory and then went into this spiral of defensiveness about it and feeling like she was judging me (even though she wasn't asking about abuse necessarily!).  I indulged in that feeling for the first time and followed it and realized I have something to say:

It all fucking happened and I don't give a shit that I can't remember parts of it because I carry the marks of it with me every day.  I don't owe you or her or anyone else the details of it.  I know what happened to me and I know it was wrong and I'll be damned if I ever let anyone tell me otherwise again.  I carry the scars of my childhood, my body does keep the score and it's fucked up but I'm getting better.  I'm doing it mostly on my own, because so many people haven't believed me or just don't get it but I am going to get better because that judgment doesn't mean anything to me anymore and because I love myself and I'm fucking strong enough to do so. So there.

This has been going through my mind for the past few days often with less words and more raw emotion and I feel like I needed to put it out there for other people to read and not just say it to myself. So thank you for reading that and thank you for this community that I as a lurker have taken so much from.  I hope you all find that love for yourselves too."
"I want to acknowledge how much trauma I have in the interest of trying to develop some self-compassion, but the defensive mechanisms my brain uses to deny the sheer quantity of it are exhausting (and sometimes impossible) to break through.",10,miocrs,2,"I've been trying to do this recovery thing for a few years now. I can't afford a therapist due to financial setbacks in the last year, so I've been turning to a lot of literature on CPTSD/patterns of abuse. It's only been in the last few weeks that I've actually wanted to try healing again, but it's been so up-and-down. I'm not sure if this is a vent post or a DAE post or what, but I have a lot on my mind and I just wanted to put some of it out there since I'm not talking to anyone IRL about this right now.

I hope I can afford therapy again at some point in the next year or so. I'm so tired. I have these long-ass conversations with myself when I'm doing okay, and that's great, but it makes me feel crazy sometimes. I don't know. I don't really have a point here. It's just a lot.

I hope this wanting-to-try-again feeling sticks around for a bit. I was in a very dark place for a very long time over the last year or so and I am just really, really tired. Uh, if anyone has any reading/video recommendations I'm in a spot where I can look at that stuff again, so feel free. No pressure, of course."
What are some good books about CPTSD?,5,misceg,3,"PTSD tied to a single event is something I find less frustrating, even if still a major issue, and less embarrassing; I feel less like I'm getting upset over nothing.

I was diagnosed with CTPSD a year and a bit ago, and would love to read some literature about it - just to understand it a bit better, and maybe put some language to it. I've been avoiding it out of a longstanding worry that I'll just put someone else's idea of CPTSD in my head, accept it, and become less believable than I already am.

Any ideas? :)"
vent/ is this trauma?,4,mituix,0,"I am currently 15, and i have been battling my mental health since i was 11/12. I am constantly trying to find out what is wrong with my head and am always doing thorough research (no self diagnosing just lost and want answers) i am 90% sure i have trauma, and my school wants me to get tested for autism, SAD, and other things are possible.

When i was 12/13/14 i lived at home with just my mum as my dad worked away, my mum reacted badly to my self harm, the earliest thing i remember and one of the only things i remember is her mocking my self harm, physically and verbally, i hid in my bed and cried for her to not touch or come near me because she scared me i guess. 
From then on the arguments got very verbally and sometimes physically abusive. 
I cant remember a lot of it, but i know what was said and what happened.
i am about to list some of the things that happened/said, so if this could trigger you please don’t read this bit.
as of right now these are the only things i can remember:
•i once left blood on my bathroom floor from sh and i remember her saying ‘if you are going to slice open your arms clean up after’
•this is the only physical thing i remember, but she pulled my hair back while i was sat on my chair, she did this because i wasn’t reacting to what she was saying, so she got angry and ripped my hair back.
•She was particularly angry one day in the car on the way to school, so she started hitting me and grabbing my leg, she then started driving at high speed into school, this really panicked me and i went into school having a panick attack, to this day people driving fast still makes me anxious.
i remember a lot of the words she used and things she would say, evil, vile, attention seeker, she mocked me A LOT, she trashed my room, threw plates, wouldn’t leave me alone when i begged and cried for her to stop.

I now can’t have her touch me or hug me, whereas i am fine with affection from my dad (sometimes), i get anxious when she comes up the stairs, i panick when she raises her voice, it really effects my relationship with other adults especially female teachers.

i really can’t remember a lot of the last three years and it takes a long time to piece things together, the worst part is i told school and they got social services involved but my mum twisted everything so not much happened. 

I’ve had multiple suicide attempts that caused a lot of trauma aswell, but when i drink my first thought is my mum, i don’t remember much but my friends tell me i panick about my mum when i am drunk.
I want no relationship with her and i feel ZERO connection to her at all, no empathy for her at all, i feel so guilty but i just don’t love her in the way i am supposed to.
There is no way of me getting closure for certain reasons but mainly because she refuses to admit to any of it, and i’m so scared of telling school again incase i get out through what i did last time.

i also developed an ed a couple months ago, a lot of it was as a result of her and what she did, i wouldn’t eat if i did something ‘wrong’ as i felt i didn’t deserve it, i lost my hair because of it and that broke me A LOT.

There’s a lot more to this but there’s so so much to dig up and list."
How do you stop Your emotional flashbacks?,9,mio5mo,6,"**TLDR at the bottom** 

Ive seen every video, every podcast, every book (obviously not really but still) and they all have the same exact techniques. 

Which I do use! 

But

Mine is kinda weird and specific and the thing that usually triggers my worst one, last HOURS before the event is over and I know i’m safe once again. But even then I am burntout like hell for a few days. 

So the flashback is deep, gradually gets harder and deeper the longer the event (that I am no where near but worry is happening even if its not) continues, and by the time I recognize I am in a flashback, I am 2 full glasses of hard alcohol in, sleep aid in my system, crying profusely, all alone because I refuse to call anyone anymore during the highs of it (I do try but it doesn’t help much After the call and I resume being in the flashback), and so on. 

I am a damn mess and I have years of therapy to go. But rn I am here and everything kinda sucks bro 😬

Crippling loneliness anyone?,15,milgav,3,Just feel really sad and alone and like no one in my life understands what I’m going through often. I hate it
Sometimes it's hard to not get angry.,2,mixjpq,1,"I don't speak to my father because he is unpleasant, unpredictable and violent.

My mother is generally okay, now. Things were weird when i was younger.

But like I'm constantly reminding her not to talk about him.

And she does anyway, and sometimes I can let it go, but then she brought his like... sub-race or ethnicity or whatever into it and just every ugly fucking stereotype which...

Damn mom. That's my people you're talking about too. That fucking hurts, and kinda explains a lot of my childhood i like to pretend wasnt that way (namely that my mom and her family were less racist and stuck in the old country, not why the fuck they married).

I always knew my father hated me for who i am, among other things, but it's pretty awful realizing my mother blames my ""race"" or whatever the fuck for anything she doesnt like about me as well."
My parents getting along now makes me want to hate then,3,miv1dg,1,"Now that my parents are retired, they are getting along so much better. I get it, that as they got rid of all the work related stress and as all the ""difficult"" kids are out of the house, they have much less to worry about. But they were so fucking nasty to each other 10 to 3 years prior and it impacted me badly. 

It makes me so mad, that now I am sometimes tempted to drive a wedge between them, just to proove to myself that they still don't really get along. 

But the longer I stay at home at holidays, the more I recognize, that in fact they really do not get along. It's just the outer circumstances that changed and allow them less potential for conflicts. They still can't communicate wothout bickering and critizising, they still raise their voice over trivial stuff, still have this unempathic way of being. And that actually gives me pleasure, but not because I want them to feel bad, but because I am happy for having the gift of seeing this toxic behavior and for not perpetuating this behavior, at least I hope I'm not..."
Confronted my high school bully. Can you forgive in the absence of a real apology? I think I did.,22,miijzf,6,"TLDR: OP overcomes some pain and trauma by confronting her high school bully.

I decided to confront my high school bully via Facebook Messenger. I guess for closure after 15 years and because I wondered if I was ready to let go of my anger and pain. And, maybe, she had changed. 

Here is what I said:

Dear xxxx,

I am writing to you to ask whether you will consider apologising for your behaviour towards me during our time in year 7 and 8.

It is prompted by another apology I received some time ago from another person who bullied me in early high school.

My memories of that time are of the most profound and cruel isolation from my peers as a result of your behaviour. I was routinely mocked, ostracised, demeaned, undermined and treated in a way that no person should have to endure for a period of two years. Teachers, members of the school community and classmates were well aware of the behaviour and who was responsible.

The pain that I was caused as a young girl did not prevent me from becoming a strong, kind, compassionate, respectful, empathetic and successful woman 16 years later.

However, it left me with significant psychological and emotional scarring.

After 15 years, I do not understand why you chose to engage in the behaviour that you did. I do want to give you an opportunity to apologise (without reservation) for your actions, if you possess the insight and the inclination to do so.

....

She responded and claimed not to remember anything, but also explicitly denied 'going out of her way' to hurt me. She then did the classic 'im sorry if I hurt you' on the basis that her memory wasn't 'perfect' just in case she did something wrong. She then also states that she remembers enough not to have initiated the class bullying.

The truth is she drove all of it. Bitchiness, exclusion, taunting and cruelty because I was smart. For two years she was the ringleader. She was even suspended for bullying my sister after I left the school - hard to forget that, you would think. So I said:

""Thank you. I don't feel that you have taken responsibility but I forgive you despite your lapse in memory. I feel genuinely sorry for you given the amount of shame you must carry for how you treated me. I forgive you and I hope you have a fulfilling life""


I chose to give up the shame and self blame I have been haunted by for years. Forgiving means giving up the hurt - she can carry the shame instead."
Bad morning,10,mim420,6,"Woke up this morning thinking I was going to try really hard to have a good day. Had a road trip planned 2 hours away for lunch. I was about to leave and my cat had a seizure and I had to take him to the emergency vet. I had a bad panic attack and cried in the parking lot. Now I feel really dissociated. 


Things are okay now. They gave him some medication and did some tests and will get back to me in two weeks. I just feel on edge and weird now. My head feels really weird and I don't feel like my body is real. Have nobody else to talk to so I thought I'd post here. Idk."
Anyone with cptsd doubt their trauma,25,mihhwh,15,"I have the symptoms of cptsd and have dealt with it all my life. Am just lately having a language to talk about it. I dissociate frequently and feel like I have different parts. It’s hard to put words to but my self has never felt solid. 

But I often doubt that it’s real. Most people don’t see anything wrong with me on the outside and would be shocked if I said I had cptsd. They would ask what happened to me to cause this. 

I have always been really sensitive. My parents loved me but I often felt emotionally unseen. I think I had early attachment trauma but don’t have the direct memories from then to know. I went through a series of traumas to my body starting at age 9. Sorry I’m being vague but it’s something some people would find traumatizing and others wouldn’t. I had a hard time fitting in at school. Then I had an eating disorder and struggled with depression while a teenager. I felt lost most of my 20s. Much of my life I’ve felt unreal and I feel grief at time I feel like I’ve lost.

I struggle with doubting myself and even wondering if I can say I’ve been through trauma."
Recent diagnosis,2,mix4ar,2,"I was recently diagnosed with CPTSD and it was kind of surprising to me since I just assumed it was a bunch of other things and I always just assumed I never went through any trauma (spoiler alert: I did, I just always excused the other person and assumed I was over reacting) and I really don’t know much about it at all. Does anyone have any recommendations for books or articles about CPTSD so that I can learn more about it? And also some for my mom because she wants to learn more about it since I live with her"
Struggling with struggling.,9,miny5v,2,"Some days I feel like there isn't a single soul that understands what I am going through emotionally. I want so badly to just feel the joy I have in my life. I want to feel happiness without that dread of when will something bad happen.   


I feel like a failure as a person. Sometimes I feel like if my soul was just in another body I could finally be able to accept that I am safe now. I've been in weekly trauma therapy for over a year, I attend a weekly trauma group, I practice yoga, mindfulness, journalling, I've done Riki. I feel like nothing I do will ever heal this pain my body feels. I feel damaged beyond repair.   


 I just want to start this life over again. I am scared because I feel like I am losing sight of my sun. I can't accept all the beautiful things I now have in my life because I am just so scared of it. My abusers have made me scared to even be able to fully relax in my own home as an adult. I am sick of struggling with how I feel inside. I know this is all because of my childhood trauma. I have to keep reminding myself, none of this is my fault, I was a child. But it's so hard to keep telling myself that over and over, on top of trying to live a ""normal"" life.   


I usually talk to my husband when I am struggling like this but I feel like a burden. I don't want him to see that I am struggling another day. I don't want him to worry about me more than he already does. It is all just so unfair."

I’m angry my sister was judged and she feels unwelcome at family functions. 

I’m angry at my ex for leading me on, leading me to love him, and then breaking my heart.  I’m angry at him for manipulating me into staying in an unhealthy and one-sided friendship. 

I’m angry at the man I dated who wasn’t over his ex, lead me on, lead me to start liking him, and then ripped off the bandaid when I got close. 

I’m angry at the man that ghosted me when he went to renew his work visa. 

I’m angry that I’m in a healthy, loving relationship, and my inner and outer critic try to tell me that I don’t feel enough, don’t feel the right things, and would be better off single. 

I’m angry that I’m in a dance between dealing with cPTSD and the inner critic and keeping my relationship.  I’m angry that breaking up would give me relief but also profound sadness at the loss of love. 

I’m angry because I didn’t deserve this.  I’m angry because I have so much to give and deserve so much better. 

I’m angry that other people get to enjoy relationships and my relationship uncovers decades of family and relational bullshit. 

I’m angry that I had a month of feeling amazing and now I feel like I’m regressing back into a flashback. 

I’m angry that I know what feeling good feels like and that I’m stuck in a flashback because of other people’s bullshit. 

I’m angry and I deserve better."
My (27F) boyfriend (23M) had a panic attack at a social gathering at his house at 2 am and his housemates decided to get me out of the house without his permission which has severely triggered my CPTSD since.,1,mj0mub,13,"TLDR: My boyfriend of 2 years had a severe panic attack at a social gathering at his house that he shares with 3 people, they then decided at 2 am that he needed to be alone in his room, where at the time I was in bed, asleep so they came in and started picking up my stuff, woke me up and asked me to leave. I feel traumatised and am still having nightmares about it despite therapy.

Trigger Warning for a brief mention of rape and childhood abuse.

Okay so this situation is messy and the post is long, I'm sorry for that in advance.

I live in the same suburb as my partner who lives with 3 housemates, one of which is my good friend and the other two I get along with but one of them is quite cold to me sometimes. During COVID lockdowns last year things got weird and he said the cold one of them does not like me and that was what was making it hard to have me in their house or for him to visit me during lockdowns. I got really suicidal as I was alone in my apartment for sometimes a whole week with no human contact which was really hard when he lived like a 5-minute walk down the road (not hyperbole), but I would try my best to make do and failed quite a bit. I try not to be too hard on myself because I have CPTSD from childhood abuse and rape when was a teen. My boyfriend knows all about it. Sometimes I would call him up late at night crying because I started having these weird panic attacks, I asked him and my friend to leave me alone at times because I felt so rejected and scared, they came over a few times when it got really bad but were saying they felt they didn't have the capacity to support me. I was really confused as I was seeing a counsellor, meditating and exercising, and didn't want to talk about being depressed or my trauma or anything I just wanted to spend time with other human beings and like watch TV or play board games instead of just sitting on zoom meetings or talking to my cat. I felt like my traumas were coming out because I was alone all day and I think they tried to understand but felt it was a bit much I think. I think it was hard for me to understand because they were so close by.

My partner still tried to visit me when he could but would often have to leave at short notice if he got a text that there was a housemate dinner on or something he had to do the next day. I cried a lot after this happened quite a few times and I told him that this felt really ""fucked up"" to me. He has told me recently that was very traumatising for him. I feel terrible about that and have apologised. But after lockdown when I could see other friends and go back to normal a bit, our relationship became more peaceful and his love and affection for me seemed to deepen, but he still didn't have me over at his house as much as he stayed at mine (which in some cases was like 5 nights a week) which wasn't really that much of a problem but it did mean his housemates didn't really see us be couply I guess, and he told me not to come to some ""housemate exclusive"" events which I thought was weird just because they were like in public spaces and I never experienced that with past partners. But he insists that those relationships are important to him and he just doesn't want to make anyone uncomfortable. I don't really understand to be honest as they would sometimes invite me to parties or things of their own accord so I thought we were all friends.

I'm still traumatised by the lockdown and confused by all this dynamic though, I guess but I tried really hard to make amends if the error was on my end, after lockdown, I got everyone Christmas presents and gave everyone gifts for their birthdays, I helped out around the house when I was allowed over and on projects or things they needed.

But after a few months post lockdown and still feeling things were a bit strange, with his permission, I spoke to my good friend in the house and she said it was awkward as they were like a soundboard for our relationship so she felt like maybe that influenced them not wanting me around a bit, and one of them not liking me very much, but she could see how unfair that was and that she still loved me and wants to include me and support our relationship. I was telling her how lovely and supportive we had been lately and how I was in such a good place with him and so happy and in love in the relationship, to be honest, so the soundboard thing was a bit of a surprise to me post-lockdown anyway, she was a bit uncomfortable and shocked and said oh okay really? I blamed myself, as to be fair I did distance myself from her (and the rest of the house) quite a bit after lockdown and I apologised for that. She was so receptive though and said yeah that she did the wrong thing in lockdown letting me be alone in the apartment when they obviously could have just walked down the road or invited me over. I said hey that's okay, my mental health is my responsibility and you don't have to apologise for your mental health either. So things were all good.

My partner had been having panic attacks as well in January and February that they didn't like him and didn't want to live with him anymore, so to be honest, I sort of treated the whole situation as not my business as much as I possibly could and tried to support him while still distancing myself a bit from them. I did tell him though it's probably not normal to be this involved and this bothered by your housemates and their needs, he is close friends with them though so I understand how that complicates things. Further, in January his parents announced they are getting divorced so that really took the wind out of his sails.

Then a month and a half ago my partner, while at a small gathering at his house, started to hyperventilate big time, his eyes were like rolling around in his skull and he was saying he couldn't feel his body, and complaining that everyone hated him in the house and that he had to leave. I asked him to stop drinking alcohol and come and sit in his room with me, we sat in his room and I rubbed his back for him, gave him a kiss on the forehead and asked if he wanted me to leave him alone or to stay with him if I needed to go turn the music down if we should leave, go for a walk, go to my place, whatever he needed. He basically was unresponsive, so I just went and turned the music down and told the one who is cold to me, who is closest to him in the house, that he was feeling unwell. She said she understood and was supportive of me getting people to leave him alone. I brought him some food and water and he seemed to want me to leave him alone so I did. Then I couldn't help but be anxious about his panic attack, like the physical symptoms of it, so I came back and asked him if he wanted to go to my place or go to bed, he said no and he then got up and left his room and went out and said he should be fine now. I then asked if I could lie down as I was tired and go to sleep and he said sure, I'll see you later.

I lie down on the bed and google his symptoms and debated calling an ambulance but was so anxious, I didn't want to embarrass him or make a big deal though, so I then just fell asleep. I woke up and one of the party guests was rubbing my back and said I had screamed in my sleep and she just wanted to see if I was alright. I had no memory, or idea of what was going on and said I must have had a night terror, I hadn't had one for years, the last one was in 2013 when I was with my ex-partner so I was pretty shocked. She just laughed and said oh you're alright then and gave me a hug and turned off the light and left again. I was a bit anxious as I didn't know where my boyfriend was but was so tired I just fell back asleep. The next thing I knew the housemate I am good friends with is shaking me awake, she is quickly gathering my things from the floor and said 'hey, your boyfriend needs his room right now okay? you need to go home now'. I was bleary-eyed, straight out of deep sleep and asked what was going on, she seemed to get frustrated and just said 'you know this is his room, and he is allowed to want to be alone, so if he needs it then you need to leave, okay?', I started to cry and I said 'hey he is an adult, can he just come to talk to me first?'. She said 'I know he is an adult but he has a right to be left alone' and so I asked her to leave me alone to gather my things, she had brought another party guest, another good friend of mine, with her and as I started crying as she walked out and my other friend came up to me and whispered to me 'oh don't worry your boyfriend is just passed out somewhere I think, we're all going home now I think that's all'. I asked her where he was and if he was alright and she said 'yeah he's fine I think he's just fallen asleep somewhere in another room'.

I felt so overwhelmed, I got my stuff and searched the parts of the house I could access and then when I could see them coming towards me trying to hustle me out, I walked out to the front yard and then onto the street to start walking home. It's 3am, but I'm so overwhelmed and scared right now, adrenaline is starting to pump, tears are pouring down my cheeks, I just decided the best thing I could do was get out in case I was making things worse by being upset. My good friend went out to the front of the house and yelled at me from the front porch 'I really care about your safety please let us drive you home'. The housemate who is cold to me came out and yelled 'can we just let her go, she can just text us when she gets home'. I was really scared. Everyone had been drinking and so I didn't want to get in a car with a drunk driver so I just said 'it's all good, I'm walking thanks!', then one of the party guests (the one who came in and checked on me after my nightmare) asks she can walk with me, I say yeah sure. So she takes my hand and walks me home, I asked her what happened while I was asleep, she said she doesn't really know what is going on but that my boyfriend was having another panic attack after I fell asleep and was sobbing about his parent's divorce. She said she really didn't feel like this had anything to do with me and that my boyfriend flipped out basically and she said hey it's okay that you're upset, just go home and have a cup of tea.

When we got to my apartment building, the housemate I am good friends with, the other housemate (not the one who is cold to me) and my other friend were in a car out front, staring straight ahead, they didn't get out or see if I was alright they just were staring straight ahead. I went up to them and my friend rolled down the window, they then asked if I 'wanted anything, if I was alright', and I just asked like 'I'm sorry for being upset but like I don't understand what was going on, like why did this happen? is my boyfriend okay?' and the housemate I am good friends with just yelled back at me 'I just did what I was asked to do okay? I didn't mean to upset you okay? this isn't my fault'. Then I said 'hey look, I'm really upset by this okay, like why is no one telling me what is going on, I don't know what is going on', and then the other housemate said 'hey look let's just go to sleep okay this isn't really the time'. I said I was sorry, and I stood back, the guest got in the car and I sat on the curb and started crying and they drove off. I sat there for a good while until about 4am and then got up, and went upstairs. I messaged my boyfriend to just send me a dot or an emoji if he was still okay and that I loved him. I couldn't sleep though.

I've had no sleep and then at 1 pm the next day he comes over and he gives me back my apartment key and says he needs to take a break in the relationship to focus on his mental health as he had a ""manic episode"" the night before and flipped out. Said he isn't happy with himself or the relationship right now. He said he fell asleep in a housemate's bedroom, the one who is cold to me, on her floor after having a panic attack which was made worse when he heard me scream, he said he had a long chat with her then he was asleep so missed out on them kicking me out. Said he had nothing to do with that and did not ask them to do it. I said um okay, I'm traumatised, can you please go see a counsellor as I don't think we can be in a relationship or even friends without addressing this incident as that was one of the most bizarre experiences of my life and I've experienced some bizarre stuff already. Since then I've been having nightmares of being like thrown out of buildings or seeing him getting murdered and not being able to help him. I've tried to distance myself from my relationship with him and his housemates but I still see him a couple of times a week to have dinner. I don't consider myself in a romantic relationship with him anymore and he agrees that yeah it isn't going to work if these things are happening. But we still tell each other we love each other and support each other quite a bit emotionally, just no sex or romance of course though. I'm concerned that he still hasn't gone to the doctor or gone to therapy. I've told him he needs to go soon and he agrees.

The one who is my good friend, when I've seen her at events we've both been invited to since, and she has like come up to me and said hi, she even got me an easter egg. She said she loves me so much and is sorry that she 'isn't the friend I need right now'. But I haven't really talked with her about it, I just apologised for upsetting her. Interestingly the other two housemates have ignored me completely at those events. I'm just going to say in case someone asks, they seem fine, happy, all have jobs, go out, see friends, exercise, a lot of social media blabbing about friends and loving each other and all that stuff. It was my boyfriend's birthday a few weeks ago and they threw him a party and invited me but I didn't go as I didn't want to upset anyone. I don't have their story but other people at the party say that they were complaining about our relationship and asking him to break up with me because they are sick of him ""using them as an excuse not to hang out with me or be supportive of me"". That made me really uncomfortable to hear as I'm not sure where that would be coming from or what they meant by it or why they would talk like that. And I also would rather people not be having a running commentary on my relationship, even though I know these things are somewhat unavoidable, people comment on their friends all the time.

I've said to my now ex, that if we are going to continue in a relationship even just as friends that I would prefer if he stops speaking to them about our relationship and to not invite their opinion of it ever again, especially the cold one, who was the most vocal that night about getting me out of the house apparently. I asked him to seek out his other friends or his family for a sounding board and support and to please, please see a therapist. He doesn't agree that he shouldn't speak to them but he does agree that he should see a therapist. He doesn't think the cold one (or any of them) would try to hurt me. But I don't know what to think. Last night an acquaintance who literally met us all once before, asked how our relationship was going and as soon as I said we weren't together because of a lot of different pressures right now, this person of her own accord brought up the cold housemate's name came up as they said oh his housemate, she's a bit mean to you isn't she. I think it was because yeah she does say mean things sometimes and it is noticeable. But she's really protective and a good friend to him and to others, so I don't feel comfortable asking him to distance himself from her. I've never had problems like this with partners friends in my previous long term relationship so yeah I don't really know what to do about her other than be nice.

Why this is still my problem is my friendship groups are all mixed together, close friends of mine are close friends with them so I have to see them at things. And I keep having panic attacks about that night despite seeking therapy, it's not working yet. I even have small panic attacks at events they aren't at sometimes because someone mentions one of their names. I'll just silently start crying and have to excuse myself and go cry in the bathroom or my friends will cuddle me. My close friends who are friends with them just say they made a mistake, they aren't bad people but they just made a mistake and I just, like I don't understand how you make this kind of a mistake unless they think bad things about me to some extent. I've asked my now ex-boyfriend for answers and he says he doesn't understand either. Says they were trying to do the right thing, seems like a miscommunication happened. And I've said that I would really appreciate him digging deep and figuring out what went wrong as I don't think what happened was the right thing for him and I, and our relationship as people. He said he feels that it isn't that big of a deal though and says maybe it is just an incompatibility thing. I'm not so sure. But I'm patient in letting him try to figure it out. He says he wants us all to be friends again, and for me to form a bond with his housemates but he doesn't want to force anything, of course, and I said look that is all up to you from here on out.

I think this triggered my cPTSD a bit hence the nightmares and panic attacks and sometimes agoraphobia, but yeah I hope I am doing the right thing in giving him the benefit of the doubt here.

TLDR: My boyfriend of 2 years had a severe panic attack at a social gathering at his house that he shares with 3 people, they then decided at 2 am that he needed to be alone in his room, where at the time I was in bed, asleep so they came in and started picking up my stuff, woke me up and asked me to leave. I feel traumatised and am still having nightmares about it despite therapy."
Relationship trauma: I get immediately suspicious if my partner shows sudden seemingly uncalled for happiness. I feel so guilty. Does anyone else experience this?,8,minra3,1,"Relationship trauma and abuse can really f*ck with your head for years after, and safe relationships after the abusive one are an unfortunate breeding ground for anxiety and post-trauma symptoms. I feel so guilty for the gut reaction of suspicion when my partner is showing sudden high levels of happiness. Like my brain is seeing it as a threat. My abuser was the type who would show love and happiness, then take it away and show abuse, then show love and happiness, then take it away back and forth. And he was extremely happy when he was hiding malicious things like lies, cheating, and eventually using private videos and pictures of me on porn sites without my knowledge. It f*cked with me and now my brain takes my current safe partner’s happiness as a sign of an impending threat. I hate it and I feel so guilty for it. Does anyone else experience this? I know it is tied to trust, and my trust was shattered time and time again. Building it back up is so hard."
I was trying to get better.. instead I'm seeing my ex tonight,2,miwu2s,9,"I hate myself so much and I feel so ugly that I'm going to get all ready and be super pretty so I can go hate F my ex. He cheated on me, lied to me, yelled at me for it, and said there was no point in apologizing. I always fawn so I didn't even say anything nasty. I just cried. He'd always yell at me, and say terrible things, and manipulate me, and gaslight me, and guilt trip me.

I tried to tell him last night as I was crying my eyes out. He didn't care. OF COURSE HE DIDNT CARE. It was just ""I never said that"" and ""I didn't do anything wrong until then"" etc. and he just focused on irrelevant stuff. I went 2 weeks with 0 contact. Unblocking him and trying to tell him just hurt me even more. I'm so fucking broken, and I hate him so much, and I hate myself so much. So of course instead of saying I don't deserve that, and leaving again, I'm doing this. I hate myself even more. Which makes me want to do it even more.

I've spent so many years just fawning, and never being mean to people, and trying so hard to be perfect. I don't give a fuck right now. Fuck it."
"Please! Help me, mental and physical health have tanked, just getting worse.",2,miwpof,1,"I desperately need some help. 

I have always suffered from anxiety throughout my life, as well as brain fog and depersonalization. I attribute a lot of this due to having an undiagnosed sleep condition (probably sleep apnea). 

For instance, in high school I would get 7-8 hours of sleep, yet still wake up unrefreshed and anxious.

My grades and social life suffered throughout those years and I was in a constant haze (brain fog). 

However, I stayed home my first year of college, taking online classes, with the added benefit that I would be able to sleep in throughout the week. 

That entire year, it was as if the fog lifted, and the anxiety significantly decreased, my grades improved and I became a while different person.

Due to this change, I decided to live on campus and with a roommate (who I did not know). 

This is when my nightmare began. 

At first things went well, but then, throughout the quarter, my roommate would wake me up multiple times a night, claiming that I was making too much noise while sleeping, and claiming that I was purposefully disturbing his sleep. 

This harassment went on for two months, during which my sleep schedule tanked, as well as my grades and mental health. I basically feared going into my room and into my bed. 

After months of inaction, the university finally kicked the roommate out, and for the last few days of the quarter, I had the dorm to myself. 

After the quarter ended, I came back home (because covid), and for the first night slept well. 

The second night it was as if a switch had gone off. 

The moment I hit the bed and got into a comfortable possible, my heart started beating rapidly, and my body tensed up. It was as if the roommate was still in the room (obviously he was not), I wasn't able to sleep until 2AM, and the sleep was fragmented. 

The past ENTIRE year, from March 2020 to March 2021, I have been suffering from this shit in agony, my body is constantly hyperaware anytime  I lay down in a comfortable position, my heart starts beating rapidly. It has just gotten worse. I don't remember the last time i sleep well. 

My mental and physical health is suffering, I couldn't even diagnose my underlying sleep condition at the sleep study, as I didn't fall asleep due to my hypervigilance. So much money wasted. 

I was a straight A student before, and now I have been suspended from the university due to my poor grades. 

Due to the lack of sleep I can barely function, and have turned into a vegetable really. 

Can anyone please please please help me with this hypervigilance issue??"
feeling emotionally disconnected from people in my life right now,3,mity6o,1,"I'm just feeling mad at everyone and resentful and alienated and just basically emotionally removed from everyone in my life right now. I feel exhausted by all of it. Part of it is I get such intense social anxiety from being on zoom calls with people I don't know very well, where I just replay and obsess over the call afterwards and pick apart what I might have done wrong or said. I was in a ""conscious menstruation"" zoom workshop over the past few weeks, and this past week was the last session. I just couldn't wait for it to be over. I felt so disconnected from the other women in the workshop. That surprised me and made me sad. 

Now, 3 days later, I'm finding the same feeling carrying over. I feel resentful towards my mom for being so critical of everything, towards myself for bringing her same habits into my relationship and criticizing my partner, towards my sister for being flaky, toward my friend for not texting me back, toward my partner for coming home drunk last night (he at least admitted his fault today). 

I'm still not sure if this is related to a potential for having BPD (I don't have a diagnosis. my dad had BPD tho), or my PMDD, or my bipolar2, or my trauma stuff. I just want to understand WHY this is happening and what triggered it. 

It's not quite dissociation, but it feels sort of like it. Like when I think about those people, I just feel a wall and a sense of cutting them out. 

Do other people have this experience?"
Advice on how to approach therapy,1,mj050f,3,"Hey. I'm going to be starting therapy soon (hopefully after paperwork and all) and was wondering if you guys had any ideas or suggestions on how to appraoch this. I hear that I almost have to interview them to get an idea but all of my past therapy attempts were so catastrophic of failures that I feel like taking my own advice would be a bad idea, especially since the bar is so low that simply a bad therapist is already fantastic enough in my book (which certainly would explain the viscous cycle). I've been in and out of therapy for awhile now because I have to recover after being dehumanized each time. I'm pretty sure it has to do with my schizophrenia co morbidity and the stigma attached that is leading to the dehuminization problems. Are there any cptsd specific questions I should ask? A problem I seem to run into is that my past therapists claim they can help me but then aren't able to do anything about any of my problems that I'm seeking assistance with. They never refer me out and instead just sit there like a brick wall and hope that something positive happens. Below I have some brain storming questions:

Do you know how to treat cptsd?

Are you able to work with someone who has medical trauma? 

Are you able to help someone with lifelong emotional neglect? 

I know this is truncated since I have a whole lifes worth of blank spaces to fill in but Is there anything else you guys would add? Brainstorming ideas on how to approach this will also work as well considering the missing whole life story part and all. Thanks! 💕"
"TW :: Abuse, Suicidal Thoughts, Drugs.",12,mikkrs,3,"I'm just gonna say it; FUCK PTSD.

I'm so fucking sick of it. I was diagnosed around four years ago and it's made my life a living hell. I can't sleep. I get audio hallucinations and it scares the shit out of me. I dissociate a lot. It feels like I'm not in my house half the time, but instead I'm back in my abusers house.

I was abused my multiple people throughout my life and I remember it as if it happened yesterday, sometimes I can feel it and it's making me loose my mind. I'm going to therapy for this but nothing's working. Nothing ever works.

I'm on medication for it but I'm not even motivated to get up and walk to the chemist to grab the meds. It feels like such a hard task when it's literally just a five minute walk up the road.

My mother left me three times for a long period of time. She left me for a few days but for the 3 times it was for months, years even.

The first time she left was when she dropped us off at my grandmother's. I felt like my whole world started falling apart that day. I sat in the garage and cried my eyes out, wk seeing what I did wrong and why my mother just left us there. Eventually she came back, weekly visits would turn into daily visits then back into weekly visits. It was nice living with my grandmother, I won't lie. I still love my grandmother to death. But she wasn't perfect. She yelled a lot. I'm not sure if it was because of her epilepsy but it was terrifying. She still does it to this day. She used to just loose it; pulling drawers out and spilling the contents into the floor, banging the cupboard doors repeatedly for ages, screaming and yelling at everyone. Sometimes she'd even put holes in the walls.

I don't blame her. Suddenly she was living her life then her stupid daughter just dropped off three kids and left. To be fair, we weren't easy to handle. We didn't listen half the time, sometimes we even mocked her. We weren't good kids but we've gotten better. My brother was never rude to her, but me and my younger brother were just stupid. I still apologize to this day for being a cunt to her.

My younger brother and I also fought a lot. Stressed my family out. I dunno why we fight so much. I'm trying to build a relationship with him but it's hard and I can't tell if it's my fault or his.

I remember my mum came back because she wanted us back. I was so happy I nearly cried. I thought we could just leave then and there. I was wrong.

We went into foster care for a while. We went to two homes. The second lady was lovely, but the first was disgusting.

She was nice for the first few weeks. Asked us how school was, what we wanted to watch on TV. But something was wrong.

My siblings and I lived there with two other people, a five year old girl (J) and a 17 (I think) year old boy (M). J was a spoiled brat. She was very rude to us and got us into trouble a lot. I remember once we were playing at the park and she was stressing my older brother out a lot and he started crying. We had to go back and J told our carer (B) and she wasn't happy. I stead of getting upset for making my brother cry and told him that if he cried again she'd hit him and we wouldn't be able to go and see our mum again. Our mum wasn't good but she was better than her.

So basically we weren't allowed to cry. It was just used, too. J could get upset and so could M but as soon as we did we'd get hit.

Something that really fucked me up is what J did to me. They had a small white dog. We were going on a trip and J tied the dog up to the door. The door was leveled a meter from the ground on a porch so I tried to untie it as we were leaving because I knew the dog wouldn't want to be tied up on such a small leash. Keep in mind the dog wasn't wearing a collar so J just tied it around its neck a few times to keep it secure. J stopped me and told me if I untied the leash she'd get B to bash me, so I didn't. We left for the day and when we came back I immediately went to let the dog off the leash because it would've been thirsty but when I got out the back it was dead, hanging off the back porch. Everyone came outside and B asked who did it. I tried to say J but she immediately said it was me. Now, I never talked back to B because she was fucking terrifying, but I fucking lost it. I started yelling, telling B that it wasn't me. I told her what happened and B turned to my siblings and asked if J really did that. They said yes. I don't know why. Maybe they thought I did it, maybe they were just scared. Maybe they knew if they said no she'd still believe J.

B lost it. She starved, beat and yelled at me for a week. She told me how worthless I was and that I didn't deserve anything. She even got her husband to hurt me. We got out once I told my mum about it.

It's been eight years and I still can't forget about it. I'm scared of dogs now and I can't go near that part of town again without freaking out.

My mum tells me to get over it because it happened years ago but fuck it's so hard to. I can't stop thinking about it. I can't stop thinking about what she did. Sometimes it feels like I'm back there again and I hate it.

I can't go outside by myself because I'm so fucking scared of people. I get scared when people look at me and I can't look people in the eyes.

I fucking hate everything.

Fuck this shit, I hate feeling like this.







I'm sorry for the long ass rant , I just can't stop thinking about it. I'm too scared to tell my therapist about half the shit that happened too. Fuck fuuuuck!

God I wish I was dead, then this shit would stop happening. I'm probably gonna delete this later because it's stupid. Sorry."

High school bullying has ruined me,17,miimc6,2,"p.s english is not my native language

Before I am going to explain everything, I would like to mention that I have been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I have been to therapy and it really helped, but I have a feeling that I also have PTSD and that it might be the root cause of all problems. 

I got bullied throughout my high school years and always tried to find ways to ""fix"" myself so the bullies would not pick on me anymore. After high school I totally lost myself and didn't even know who I really was as a person, because I was so used to changing myself for other people.

At school the bullies would laugh at me and I was always excluded in project groups. They also made comments about my mustache, my nose and ethnicity. I felt extremely ugly and would cry myself to sleep every single day. Eventually I transferred schools because the bullying made me sick and after transferring the new bullies would also pick on me. I made some really good friends on my new school, but the bullying never really stopped. 

And to be honest I sometimes did understand why they were bullying me, probably because they sensed that I was acting fake. But there were times when I didn't understand it, because they would just make comments about my face and it made me feel extremely ugly. I remember this guy in particular, he said something to me that I could never forget. He said something in the lines of ""A person like you will never succeed in life"" and ""Don't look at me with your ugly face"".

Fast forward after high school I found ways to make myself look pretty by using make-up. Besides that, my facial features slightly changed throughout the years so that really helped. I suddenly got a lot of attention from guys and didn't know how to handle it and I felt like an imposter. I didn't know my own worth and was extremely insecure. 

After that I met my now ex-boyfriend, I was 16 and he was 21 years old. He used my money and abused me mentally and physically. We would do almost everything with my money and I feel so stupid and naive for allowing him to do so. 

I could never talk to him about my problems. He would abuse me mentally for addressing issues in the relationship. He would always say things like ""It's not easy to find a guy like me"" and ""No guy will ever love you as much as I do"". Now remembering this it makes me cringe so much, because he was the complete opposite. They guy also had some anger issues and choked me a couple of times. Besides that I always felt ugly, although he never told me that I was ugly, but the high school trauma made me feel like I was. 

Now two years later I am slowly recovering from everything but because of the relationship I developed an anxiety disorder. My anxiety gets triggered especially when someone is ignoring me, because my ex-boyfriend used to ignore me for days if I did something wrong in his eyes and when extremely mad he would send texts with really hurtful words. I never really felt comfortable when not wearing make-up. My ex-boyfriend never called me ugly without, but there was this time when I was late and I ran to the train station without make-up, and accidentally saw a couple. They didn't really like my ex-boyfriend and started to take pictures of me. Not sure why they were taking pictures, but I strongly believed that it was because of my face without make-up and this was a trigger for me. 

At the moment I am working in a project group at university and I am working with some people from another university. And I feel so uncomfortable working with them, because they tend to joke a lot. Sometimes they make jokes about me or make fun of other people from other project groups, especially the people who are less attractive, which is pretty fucked up. When they were joking around it triggered my PTSD. Once I came late for a meeting the girl told me ""Well, I guess we are going to kick you out of the group :) hahaha""  and told me that it's a joke afterwards but it triggers something in me. It makes me want to vomit when they're joking around. It feels like I am reliving high school all over again. These people are bullies, but they are the adult version of bullies so the bullying is less intense? They are not picking on me all the time, because when it's time to work on the project they are serious and act normal like everyone else. 

I am just so damaged and confused at the moment :( Would appreciate any advice."
I’m shaking uncontrollably with anxiety all morning. I need some help.,5,miq5uu,2,"The AH father has been using the stalking method to make me feel on edge all morning. Watching me angrily when he knows I can feel it. Throwing shit around to make me jump. Yelling at random things or about random things to no one to make me nervous.

I have the shakes and I keep trying to meditate to calm down, but my body is literally so tense. I’m hiding in the basement in the dark. Every time I try to calm down I keep imagining them breaking down the door and screaming at me.

Adrenal Fatigue?,6,miopwm,11,"Hey yall... gotta question. Has anyone dealt with ""adrenal fatigue"" or similar symptoms?  The description by many sites says it's a layman's term, and it feels very... naturopathy to me., which I'm not a fan of. But I don't know what else to ascribe my symptoms to. After a long day at work, or ESPECIALLY a good workout, about an hour or so later I get indescribably cold, sluggish, and sleepy. If I work out at 6, I could easily be asleep in bed by eight. If I stay awake, I'm almost drunk, groggy, and at times slap-happy. I drink plenty of water (60-80 oz/day) with a cup or two of coffee a day, and even have taken to drinking post-workout drinks like gatorade or other electrolyte beverages. I occasionally deal with intermitent unexplained hypoglycemia, and my blood pressure tends to drop significantly after pausing exercise. However, no nausea/vomiting/weight loss or the like.

&#x200B;

Caffeine and electrolytes seem to help a little but it's INFURIATING as someone who is required to work out for their job, I can't function like this. I've been struggling with it for years, but my doctor said my thyroid is normal, i'm only slightly anemic (like 11% when anemia is marked as 12) and I have no markers for autoimmune diseases. Doctors have sort of just... shrugged at this and told me to take it easy when I need to and pop a jolly rancher when I get hypoglycemic (thanks!??!) I really haven't had a lot of issues with it the past year because I basically stopped working out with COVID stress making it too much for me, but now that I'm back to trying to get back in shape, yesterday was awful. I did sprints for like 20 minutes, and afterwards I was like sitting in front of a heater draped in blankets, too weak to really want to move, and bordering on wanting to sleep at 6pm. Like... come on?!? Has anyone else dealt with this, and figured out how to alleviate it? I'm on mental health meds, which seem to help some in all aspects EXCEPT this."
"I feel so ashamed, I can use some advice on how to deal with this and in need of some ""self compassion inpso"".",3,mite6f,5,"Hi, I don't know how to deal with this and I'm struggling with this for a long time now..

(Tw; sexual abuse and eating disorder are mentioned)

This maybe sound a bit silly, but for me it is a huge stress factor in my life. I have this weird coping mechanism that I am ashamed of and it's a bit of a mess and I feel judged for it.

I have a problem with finding the right clothes for me.. (yes, like I said, it sounds like a silly little problem I know), for multiple reasons including a sensitivity on my skin. Somehow I get physically and mentally overwelmed when my clothes are irritating or something is to tight. I think it has something to do with trauma that I am so sensitive to that, it's just a HUGE trigger for me. 

Also, I have had eating disorders including anorexia from age 10, and now is the first time in my life I am doing really really good and my weight is going up in a slow but steady pace and I am really happy with that but feelings of being dirty (from the sexual abuse ) and feelings of being ugly from the bullying are getting triggered by getting more womenly curves from the weight gain, even though the body immage is getting a little better.

I still don't feel okay in my own skin and I feel like I want to jump out of my body, that's what it comes down to, and having comfy but nice clothes helps me sooth that a little. I don't think I have a shopping adiction (I have this ""episode"" 2 times a year and don't spend a lot) but it definitly is a coping mechanism.  I also find difficulty decision making very stressfull so that's why I don't like to shop that often.

So, all that said, I am ordering a lot of clothes lately, because all the other clothes are the wrong size, worn down, or don't feel comfy anymore, but I return most of the clothes I order because I also struggle with finding what looks a bit nice on me now that my body is changing.

I feel frustrated because of this, but what's the most stressfull for me is the shame I feel. I feel like the whole street is judging me for ordering so much, and the delivery guy made a comment today about my shopping habits ( not meant in a malice way, but still feel shame about that comment). Also when I return it I feel like the lady at the post office is thinking:
"" there she is again,  gosh! she shopped AGAIN?""

I got some delivery today, but almost nothing feels right, so I'm already shopping again but dreading the moment I need to open the door for the delivery guy.

On TOP on all of this, I also feel al lot of guilt for spending money on myself, because my narcissistic father didn't want to spend money on me and became angry when he needed to, so now I still feel like I'm doing something wrong. 

I know on a intellectual level that I shouldn't be so bothered with al of this, but I am.  
I know I should have compassion for myself, but how do I do that? Can anybody give me some  ""self compassion inspo""  or something.. :-)  or advice on how to deal with these kind of things. I feel so torn and overwelmed with this."

Stellate Ganglion Block in AL/TN/GA?,1,miyz7l,3,"I am strongly considering getting the Stellate Ganglion Block, but the one place I’ve been in touch with so far (called Stella) is located in FL and Chicago, both about six hours from where I am in NE Alabama.

Also I have heard that some folks have been able to get insurance to cover it at least partially, any advice about that would be most welcome. I’m not even sure if it’s possible since I am on Medicare and Medicaid but if anyone knows otherwise please let me know!

- I’ve not been formally diagnosed with any type of PTSD, but fit allllll the specs for it and plan to follow through with a new psych & therapist and get formally tested
- I have Alabama Medicaid secondary to Medicare through Humana PPO"
my experience with Narc Mom,1,miyu3n,2,"I’m a currently college student, living mostly by myself, but soon to be back at home for the summer. I recently started therapy and am not diagnosed, (so I will not say I had CPTSD), but I feel as if I do relate to the symptoms of CPTSD sufferers. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells around my mother, and I couldn’t make mistakes or I would not only be attacked for what I did, but also personally attacked and put down about irrelevant things, including that no one would ever like me, or she wishes I wasn’t her child. I feel like I’m constantly being gaslighted by her, but I typically deny it because she's never neglected me and does provide food and shelter for me, and at times seems caring. It gets to me that she will typically never back down, and even though I've gotten used to and try to ignore her attacks, she continually tries to get under my skin and pick fights over the most insignificant things. Just today, I had to go finish projects for school and couldn't (nor did I want to) leave to go on a walk with her. Because of that, I was called fat (I'm below average weight...), I'm disgusting, that no one likes me, that I would never be pretty enough or have a likeable personality where someone would ever want to get married to me, etc. I'm 20, and have lived without them for about 2 years, but when I'm home, I'm not allowed to leave the house, talk to friends without being shamed, and I'm constantly location tracked. It's as if she has to have control over me, and if I try to break free from it, I'm irresponsible and selfish. I've confronted her about it, but then I'm crazy, don't know what I'm talking about, and that I'm being too sensitive. I feel a lot of guilt due to that, as any time I think I'm being dramatic and hurt by things she does and says, I think about how she has never left me to starve and helps financially with college (actually, she doesn't but my dad does). He enables it, but does not contribute too often; however, had tended to side with her more often than me as I've gotten older. I've talked to friends about this family dynamic, and have been able to tell myself and believe out that it's a part of manipulation and gaslighting, and feel like it's less of my fault. However, my instinctual emotional response or feeling extreme guilt, over apologizing, and fear when making mistakes or expressing my emotions has also bled over into other relationships. Any time a friend expresses that I could improve on something, or even just if I make a small mistake, I feel extremely amounts of guilt and my emotional response automatically makes me feel like I’m a burden to everyone around me. I have bouts when I have no motivation to do anything because of feeling worthless. I have not been diagnosed, but I have also struggled with what I strongly believe to be OCD since I was young - particularly contamination OCD. I have not been diagnosed, but I feel like I live in 2 different worlds and have daily anxiety over what things I can or can’t touch, and like I have different zones where things are safe to touch vs not safe, and the zones can’t cross. If those two zones cross, I fixate on it until I'm able to relieve the anxiety by giving into my compulsion to reverse it, and that typically will involve cleaning. Most of this time, it doesn't cause extreme anxiety since it's easily relieved of by cleaning, but it is something I do on a daily basis. I also tend to avoid going out to public places at times due to this fear. This has always been a part of my life and is pretty much a normal occurrence, but something I'm working on managing. I moved out and lived with them over the summer and am back home this week due to some family gatherings. This next summer, I will have to move back in with them while I work. I decided to reach out now because the last few days have been kind of low points, as I've just felt extremely on edge and anxious. I rarely get anxiety to the point of not being able to fixate on anything else, but it's gotten to me. Every time my mother even walks past my room, I find my heart racing a little bit and feel nervous around her. My suspected OCD also seems to get worse whenever I'm home, probably as a result of being in an environment where I'm not very comfortable. I've found myself getting more anxiety over my ""zones"" crossing, and it's been adding to my deteriorating mental state. I've always been hesitant to get very vulnerable, but I feel like I really need the extra support right now."
DAE Need a Hug?,58,mic0ze,25,"TW unworthiness:
She/her 34

I feel unlovable and desperately lonely. For many reasons, too many to get into here (see Trauma)

The short story is: I need a goddamn hug. Seriously, I keep spinning in circles trying to find appropriate places to get hugs and it makes me super weird. And it gets me in trouble. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Am I crazy? Like I haven’t been touched by anyone in days, possibly weeks. It makes me super anxious and sad. Touch is such a healing form of communication. If anyone has solid advice about how to get a need like this met or how to resolve  the anxiety created I’m open to hearing it. Ideas and reassurance needed."
"DAE's partner ignore nc requests? If so, how do you handle it?",3,mirr7s,9,"Tldr; my husband has repeatedly ignored my no contact requests for my father. I'm not sure if we can get past this? I now see it as my husband is okay with seeing someone repeatedly disregard my feelings. 

As title and tldr state,  my husband has repeatedly ignored my requests for no contact for my father.  

Recently, I've been evaluating my life.  I'm still not quite sure if it's a breakdown or a breakthrough. Maybe a midlife crisis? But I've started to address some issues that need to be addressed.

One of the things that I've been thinking about is my marriage.  Been together 20 years,  married for 5. Outside of our kids,  he's the best thing that happened to me.  I think he's saved me, in multiple ways.  

But,  there's issues that I've been ignoring, so they've gotten worse. 

One of the issues is I've tried going no contact with my dad,  numerous times.  But my husband & dad have a relationship. This relationship usually leads to re-engaging with my dad.  It's kind of hard to not speak to someone who's in your kitchen,  drinking coffee on a Sunday morning.  

My dad & I were never close,  never had much of a relationship with him.  He's a narcissist,  and my brother is and always has been the golden child. My dad has always helped him out, which has had disastrous effects,  long term. He's very critical of me - my job,  my hobbies,  my appearance (Sunday morning coffee leads to him making comments about my apparel,  stating he hopes I don't dress like that for work - while I'm wearing sweats and having bed head because I just woke up). 

My husband asks me to do our not do things, with the assumption I'll listen / comply. For example,  his dad reached out & sent gifts from our registry when I was pregnant with my first.  He's never had a relationship with his dad, but has an awesome step dad! He asked me to stop talking with him.  Although we're still Facebook friends,  I don't message him,  post on his wall,  comment,  etc,  because he asked me not to.  But I don't get the same respect.  

Told my husband I wanted to go no contact with my dad a few times.  One was when we moved, because my dad was being an ass (rented from my dad for 12 years before moving). Prior to our move,  it was difficult to go NC with him,  being his tenant.  But his boundary crossing was insane at the time.  He'd go so far as to bring friends to our apartment when we weren't home.  

I also asked him to go nc before our wedding.  When I asked my dad to contribute to the reception, I was called an entitled cunt for asking him for money.  Even though we didn't ask him to contribute to our wedding at all.  By the time the reception rolled around (a month after the wedding), my dad and his girlfriend were in attendance.  We still weren't talking much.  He *did* give a fairly large (in my opinion) monetary wedding gift,  which ended up being our budget for the reception.  (*yes*, *I'm* *petty* *like* *that*). 

But what still hurts,  5 years later,  is that he physically gave the gift to my husband. When I wasn't there.  To me,  it screams of dowry or bride price,  or something along those lines,  which hurts.  And to be honest,  I really don't know if he *actually* gave my husband the money,  or if my husband just said that,  to smooth things over.  

I've realized that my dad likes the warm & fuzzies he gets from making offers or promises.  Getting the accolades & seeing the happiness of the person he makes the promise to.  He's done this with trips (multiple times), money towards a down payment for a house,  etc.  But with me,  he. Never. Follows. Through.  So, it is quite possible the wedding ""gift"" never happened.  

But anyways. 

Within the past year or two,  my husband has purchased one of my dad's properties on a 10 year contract. I told my husband not to do it,  because my dad doesn't do anything unless it benefits him. The building is in disrepair.  My dad doesn't have anywhere near the skills my husband does with fixing things.  So there's a lot of work that needs to be done,  inside and out. It's a multi unit building.  Essentially,  my dad gets one of the rents. He decides who's in there.  How much the rent will be,  etc.  But my husband is responsible for repairs of the unit still.  If my dad dies,  the contract passes to his girlfriend to fulfill / pay.  

I told my husband not to buy the property.  Obviously,  that didn't work . With the 10 year contract,  going nc is difficult.  And I think my husband will end up paying more than my dad would get selling it, because of the work that was/ is needed.  And my dad benefits because he just transferred ownership with the deed,  so he won't have to pay capital gains because it's a rental.  

After bringing to my husband's attention that I stopped contact with his dad when asked,  over 15 years ago & stuck to it,  my husband's solution is that *now* he will go no contact with my dad.  They were talking multiple times a day and usually seeing each other at least a couple times a week.  So the sudden stop was noticeable to my dad.  Which led to a very uncomfortable conversation with my dad. There's been a few recent incidents with my dad that have left me hurt & angry.  Nothing super major,  but it is what it is.  In just tired of him (my dad) hurting me.  

I'm a realist.  I know my husband & dad will talk.  I know he'll be in my house.  My husband said he'd stick to no contact. But if calling me an ""entitled cunt"" wasn't enough to stop talking to him,  I'm sure my bringing the difference in our actions related to speaking with our dads won't.  I've asked repeatedly, what his line will be,  if calling me an entitled cunt wasn't enough.  

I'm not sure this is something I can get over,  to be honest. Essentially,  I realized that my husband is and has been okay with seeing me repeatedly hurt or angry.  Anyone been through something similar or have any advice? After some discussions with my husband,  he's worried it might be relationship ending."
Dissociating While Eating?,19,migqpe,10,"This is happening a LOT to me lately, and I was wondering if any of you could relate. I just go into auto-pilot and eat without tasting anything. Then it feels like I just blinked and suddenly, all the food is gone. 

It's like: *""Oh, wait what? What's going on? Oh, I'm done eating? What did I even eat? How did it taste?""*

It's stupid, but I've accidentally eaten spoiled food several times without even realizing because of this. (I'd find out later because someone else will point it out.)"
How to escape your freak parents?,4,mipjg7,2,"My parents are both narcissists, 4 year old fuckers in adult bodies trying to prove to the world how great and nice they are and how ungrateful, lazy and evil their son is. Even if i was all that its still their fault but  people are just stupid to realise this. Nobody believes me so i am isolated and bored in my room. They try to abuse me emotionaly but its not working i cant even take them seriously anymore. However i dont know how will i escape. My brain is rotten from the venom they poured in it. I have learning disabilities and i cant get a job or a degree. Atleast not now while my brain is fucked. I swear the same thing cigarettes do to lungs is what these freaks do to your brain. I am healing pretty fast to be honest but idk if its gonna be fast enough. In 1 year i stopped having panic attacks, i have less anxiety and stuff like that but its still not enough. I am 19 and i must get out of my parents house. I tried rewiring my brain from the root and it seems to be working but slowly. Those learning disabilities are caused by an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, (us with cptsd have this problem) a part of the brain.  I was hoping if someone has some advice for me and how i can escape this nightmare and go live my life finaly."
How do I stop misdirecting my feelings and emotions?,4,miow5h,3,"TW abuse talk
It's been about 2 years since I moved out of my abusive mother's house, this August it will have been 3. I still have to talk to her because she pays bills that I am legally unable to take over (and she feels guilty so she pays them for me).

My mother has always been neglectful, narcissistic tendencies but not a narcissist, guilty in denial, abuser. She wanted everything to be normal and enabled her husband to abuse me because she was too scared to stand up to him and he made me the bad guy. A kid. And my mom believed it at some point. Telling her I was angry at her got me nowhere. Telling her she hurt me got her thinking, but after a while she excused it. She cut off her entire family because they told her and her husband that they were abusive and abusing me.

Now that I'm an adult I've been trying to work through my trauma. I did intensive group therapy, I'm going this week to see a new therapist who specializes in trauma/PTSD. I am making a routine for myself to hold myself accountable for my actions and behaviors towards others, and myself. Even if it is hard I am still brushing my teeth every day, proper hygiene, saying sorry when I need to, working on issues with others, trying to reduce self destructive behaviors, etc. But I still have this issue of misdirection.

When I am mad or upset or sad about something, others have noticed I tend to misguide my feelings and put them within different issues. This causes a small issue or a workable issue, to be bigger than it is, more intense, or more hurtful. For example I realized yesterday that the reason I'm mad at my boyfriend was because I feel like I couldn't talk to him- when really I was taking the emotions I had towards my mother and contributing complex and painful emotions and feelings onto a workable issue. So then it blew up and I thought the best outcome would be ""let's break up with my boyfriend"". I feel horrible, guilty, awful about it. I am so ashamed and I didn't even realize I was doing it until he pointed it out.

I do this often and don't know how to not mix up all of my emotions and feelings towards other things. How do I fix this? Any therapy resources?"
The system failed me but that's not my fault,35,midq1k,4,"Didn't know how to flare this as a few fit

Growing up i did report my m*m, I was just told she loved me. No one ever did anything. And I just realized that's not my fault. To quote Picard from Star Trek Next Gen, ""its possible to commit no mistakes and still lose."" I did what I was supposed to, it was up to the adults around me to take me seriously. Their failure was not my fault. I was a kid, it was up to the adults around me to keep me safe. It was up to the system to step in to keep me safe and they didn't. Realizing it wasn't my fault has been a huge weight off my shoulders. I did report her. My family even said they knew. The system just told me they couldn't do anything and it wasn't my fault. Neither was my family's inaction. Those aren't my burdens to bear. 

If you've read this far, and can relate, you didn't deserve it either. I hope you realize that."

It's really hard for me to talk to them about anything because they always criticize and never try to help me.

I feel guilty for the way I must have treated other young people growing up because of the abuse I was experiencing,233,mi2hzz,35,"TRIGGER WARNING ABUSE

I have 2 younger siblings and a twin brother. I started babysitting them at 11, and other kids at 13. I look back at the way I treated them and interacted with them, and I know it must have really affected them, they could hold trauma today because of the role I played in their lives. 

I yelled and screamed, I made them sit in a corner for hours when they would act out, I would tell them how horrible they were being, and even went as far as threatening to hurt them and actually hitting them when things were going way south. 

I know I was taught to handle things this way, as that's how me and my siblings were raised by our parents. I know I was just a child myself and had no business taking care of my siblings and other people's children. I remember my parents and other parents not really caring that I treated them this way. I guess they thought it was normal or okay too. 

I really regret it all. It was straight up abuse. I'm terrified and mortified at the memories they must have of me and the scars they may carry. I wish I could go back and change it all. I wish I had known better."
how is it like when you dissociate?,6,mimibe,7,"I know quite a few people who have trauma and dissociate and for them, they feel disconnected from their body and can’t feel anything or they don’t feel real, but I know dissociation can look different for everyone, but for me when I dissociate, it usually happens if I get triggered by something and I‘ll relive one of my traumatic events or sometimes I‘m not reliving anything and I didn’t really get triggered at something and it happens anyway, and I always say that I „leave“ because when I dissociate, I‘m reliving a traumatic event or just feel like I‘m somewhere else and when I come back, I have no memory of what just happened and I heard nothing. One time I dissociated while in German class and someone translated something and I left and had no memory of it happening and also when I was cutting potatoes and while I was in the shower that I literally almost forgot that I was taking a shower when I came back to reality lmao"
DAE feel guilty for not working due to anxiety/depression that originated from trauma,165,mi3v6e,39,"I left my last job a couple months ago due to a string of anxiety attacks and disputes with my boss because she didn’t care about hygiene (masks) and once made mustard gas (she liked mixing ammonia and bleach; she got mad that I refused to enter the area and convinced the younger workers not to either until it dissipated). I had a series of panic attacks while trying to work with processing my trauma with a therapist and medications. I couldn’t take it anymore after 3 months of working after I moved to my current house.

I haven’t worked since November, and the pandemic makes it more acceptable to stay home. My husband works at a job that provides housing and really good healthcare for us, and mathematically we don’t necessarily need me working to be fine. 

I still feel guilty though. I’ve been working on myself and have been doing coloring projects and large puzzles to keep my mind on the path to recovery. But I still feel like I’m not recovering fast enough. I hear about other people here who work, have a family, and are juggling their trauma on top of that. I know I am privileged and don’t feel I deserve such nice treatment from my husband. 

I’m scared of being considered disabled by this. Is this just anxiety, or am I truly not recovering fast enough?"
I moved out from an abusive household and told the abuser she's an alcoholic,11,mihsju,1,"I have since a year back lived with a emotionally abusive alcoholic roomie, whom I couldn't move away from due to lack of money. It tore me down, gave me depression and triggered lots of old memories of childhood abuse. Today I moved out, taking her neglected cat with me (I pay for the cat's insurance anyway) and I told her she's an alcoholic, blocked her after she berated me over not saying goodbye.

She has kept me up by partying on workday nights, got so black out drunk she has entered my room while I slept several times unless I lock the door, made me take care of her dog and gotten mad at me when the dog loved me more, stolen my alcohol and just been a very mean drunk. She's a false person who lies and scams people and is an avid alcoholic in denial who mix pills with booze. I will never look back. She's blocked and out of my life.

I have adopted her cat and the cat is the love of my life, so despite living in hell for a year it was worth it, but damn, hope the next roomie is an alcoholic asshole just as her."
childish anger,46,miav99,5,"(I know this is my 3rd post in 2 days and I promise to chill after this. I am just having a Really Hard Time™️)

I am angry about the fact that I have to reparent myself. An extremely childish part of me wants to scream and yell that it’s not fair, that I want someone *else* to take care of me for once. I have been so emotionally alone for so long. Everything I’ve ever learned about emotional regulation has been so filled with shame and hatred - I had to learn everything the hard way and it has fucked me up beyond even my own comprehension. B/c of that, I have coped in ways that were damaging in the long run, but still it was always ME. The loneliness at your very core. I have no idea how I will ever be able to let go of that pain. It seeps into every part of my life.

At the same time I know that I naturally shut down at anyone who tries to help. Nobody out there, not really even my parents, will ever be able to give her what she needs. I catch myself often wishing it could be my therapist, but I know that she can’t do it either. And even if anyone could, I have learned from my earliest memories that being vulnerable is not safe. It will either lead to being violated or rejected.

Like I want to be cared for so badly, but I know it’s never going to be the way that I want it to be. And I know nobody else can do it for me. What a bitter realization."
Hyper focusing on a hobby,1,miw8gl,2,"Firstly I want to explain that i can’t choose when this happens. It just does. I also have ADHD. I think this is some combination of cptsd and adhd

Ever since i was young and my home life became abusive and traumatic, i have hyper fixated on hobbies to escape reality. I honestly had no grievances with this coping skill, outside forgetting to eat, drink water and use the bathroom. In highschool, I started dating a very narcissistic individual who used the same manipulation and abuse tactics as my family. He was more of the subtle and emotional abuse type, although he did break stuff and occasionally shove me. During this relationship, i started getting so hyper focused on hobbies during stressful time periods in the relationship. The worst of it being beginning of march last year w COVID lockdowns. I couldn’t sleep, and went periods of 4 days without sleeping (i’m not exaggerating, no sleep whatsoever for 4 days). I was escaping my problems by getting really into video games. My memory got really shitty from the lack of sleep and I wouldn’t remember that i played a video game for 10+ hours at a time.

Ever since the relationship ended, whenever life gets stressful, i sometimes hyper focus on a video game. I sleep well now, and have been for almost a year. however, i only have a faint memory of what i did when i hyper focus. it’s the same kind of blurry, fuzzy memory i get when i disassociate and try to remember what i did while disassociating. I have a vague memory but nothing specific and i feel confused.

It’s almost like the hyper fixation has become more than just an escape, it almost feels like a dissociative experience. However, when i experience derealization or depersonalization, i feel nothing but panic and confusion during it and feel like i’m going crazy. i genuinely enjoy hyper fixating, i have a really good time enjoying my hobbies. (it’s just a little excessive) Idk it’s weird and i wanted to see if anyone else has this"
support group european time zones?,7,mijjul,1,"I saw that somebody from the usa posted a ptsd recovery support group in one of the ptsd subs thats being held through zoom once a week. I think thats really wonderful, but I was wondering if something similar exists for europe timezones. Staying up til 2 just isn't an option for me. If anybody knows anything I'd appreciate a quick comment :)"
"After a decent spell of UP, I'm now crashing DOWN again. The pain is almost unbearable",3,mioibf,2,"Since the repressed memory of my CSA resurfaced in Fall 2019, my life has been quite up and down. The discovery of useful tools and concepts to aid my self-therapy helped with the ups, as did finally finding a therapist I like (after trying way too many).

While up, I've been doing everything I can to help others, including a number of supportive comments in appropriate subs to reassure others who seemed to be doing worse than me (at that time).

But today I've had some upsetting messages from my family who I cut out of my life, full of blame, criticism and guilt-tripping.

Intellectually, I know I'm not a bad person and that I can move on by switching to another email provider and then they won't be able to reach me again.

But emotionally it's a different story, and honestly, right now, I hate being me and just want to lay in bed and cry all day.

The thing is, I can't. Still I have this horrible block when I want to cry. I try to let go and all that happens is my entire skull aches like I've been hit round the head with a bat.

If I had strong drugs like codeine or something like that, I'd just take a bunch and wake up in 20-30 hours feeling much better.

But I have nothing and feel nauseous, don't wanna eat, just want to not be here anymore."
I was taught to be suspicious of people who cared about my well-being.,102,mi5vmg,12,"When I was a child, my mother warned me away from associating with certain family members. In particular, I have an aunt, a child psychologist, who seemed concerned about our homeschooled, insular upbringing. Now, I disagree with this aunt in some ways, and she had noticeable flaws of her own. However, she became one link in a chain of adults that my parents nursed a sense of paranoia around, and fostered this same unease in us as well.

As a young adolescent, our insurance provided access to one doctor, a woman who not only asked about our physical needs, but psychological and emotional needs as well. This doctor appeared particularly concerned about my sister, who rarely, if ever, smiled. My mother despised this, saying, ""She's trying to trick my daughters into saying they're unhappy.""

Questions about well-being seemed to be viewed as a ploy- a ploy to what end, I'm not entirely certain.  Looking back, these conversations seem strange- what parent wouldn't want to know that others are looking out for their children? Am I alone in having this experience, and am I correct in feeling like something here was wrong about this situation?"
DAE feels Like they haven't talked to anyone their whole life?,102,mi5jmt,19,"I have had conversations, listened to people and responded to them. but I feel like my whole life this one part of my being has been doing the talking. It's the part that everyone around me likes to talk to, tell things, and get responses from. But reflecting on each and every conversation I have had in my life I came to the realization that I haven't REALLY TALKED to anyone. Never expressed how I truly feel, I am not complaining but it fascinates me that how I've spent 22 years of my life not talking to anyone. As I'm writing this post it almost feels like I'm floating and all that pressure of having a controlled, mature, and pleasing response is not there anymore. I just jokingly said to my coworker that I feel like I have never actually talked to another human being in life and she got a bit uncomfortable, but for the first time I felt like I talked."
I'm so angry at myself for making a mistake!,2,miqltu,2,"I don't even know if I should tag it as ""rant"" or this! I'm sorry! I'm dumb!

I'm clearly a fucking idiot! What the fuck is wrong with me! I *KNOW* paying the bills and rent takes priority! I was taking care of them at all times! It was always me who made sure they were paid! And then I left! And my mental stability slid so bad I couldn't move! And suddenly! I can't do shit! I don't fuckign THINK! WHY. I hate this.

I KNEW that buying myself a phone (because my current one is a hot garbage, the android is so old, most apps just won't run on it anymore; not to mention the battery - the powerbank just slows down the leakage of power, doesn't make it stop, or better) and weighted blanket will be my ""big spends"" for this month (I'm poor, leave me alone). I KNEW that afterwards I won't be able to buy anything else, except food. I was okay with it!

But *why* I didn't take into account that I was on fucking *sick leave* for two weeks! That's 80% of my base pay! And I skipped all the overtime too! Because my sister got corona and we had to quarantine! And it was nice! I got some rest, even though my mental state went into shambles again! but GOD. What the hell! I KNEW all these things were happening! Why did I still try to do the big spends! It made no sense to do so!

And I only realised that AFTER buying! So now I'll need to get into a long and tedious fight to get my money back. Because of course they took the money immediately, but now it's weekend and then easter and then what nots and it'll take AGES to get that money back. FUCKS SAKE WHAT WAS I THINKING. I WASNT! THAT'S THE THING! WHY WASN'T I THINKING!

STUPID FUCKING IDIOT."
What is a good way to deal with trauma if you have no access to group therapy that provides CBT and EMDR?,6,mij7ch,3,"I don't have access since such groups and psychologists usually cost a lot of money. I feel deadly jealous at people who can afford therapy and to talk to someone, because I have talked to a psychologist but like month and a half isn't enough to solve my problems. I barely keep my s\*\*\* together since university is beating my butt with tests and paying them and I don't have a job at the moment but am looking for one. I get envious when someone is in therapy and has this luxury. how can I therapitize my self at home? Are exercise and yoga enough? What else can I do?"
is this a flashback???,1,miugqv,3,"hey y’all. im not formally diagnosed with anything trauma-related, but i do relate a lot to some of the stories on here, n i show some symptoms of cptsd so i think this community is best fitting for this sort of inquiry lol
  
i sit next to a window in my sixth period class which borders the courtyard of my school. the faculty was blaring music for an event that was being hosted inside the courtyard. the bass of the song was radiating through the walls kinda (as loud music tends to do lmao) and it reminded me of when my brother slams his hands on the walls or hits things during fights with my mom or my family in general
when it happened it started to take over my mind in a way, like it was all i could think ab, and i couldn’t focus. the teacher was speaking but it went kinda in one ear out the other bc of those thoughts.  
this isn’t the first time this has happened, either, loud talking tends to make me think about my family’s fighting, and alcohol makes me think about my dad bc of his former alcoholism. it does that weird thing to my focus every time too. does this constitute a flashback? is it cause for concern?"
What to do about brain fog?,4,mil5eq,3,"I have bad brain fog very frequently. Usually when it's time to get to work and do something for someone else it lifts, but as soon as no one will be bothered by me doing nothing it comes back. It makes it so hard to work towards personal goals.

Anyone got tips on how to snap out of it? Or how to still *do* stuff despite the brain fog?"
Thoughts on treatment/recovery and medication,3,mimxqw,2,"TW: mentions medication usage (pro/con), alternative treatments, sexual frustrations (possibly medication related or trauma?)

I have been on antidepressants since I was 9-10, I had been experiencing depression for two years prior to then but I absolutely had anxiety my entire life. I was told that antidepressants would help with my mood swings caused my hormones, that itd make dealing with my ups and downs more manageable/less noticeable and i had the illusion that id feel normal for once in my life.

At age of 18 i quit antidepressants cold turkey because I was tired of feeling either absolutely nothing, not even a tear during a funeral. The medication made me nauseous, made me feel nothing, etc - and yet i still feel depressed/moody due to hormones. 

I decided to give medication a shot again (22F) as my flashbacks have been getting worse, Im still depressed / have issues with physical anxiety, and I just want to find any way of feeling normal for once - except im 3 months in to receiving medication and I feel just the same as last night except this time my sex drive is nonexistent. I mentioned this to my doctor but his recommendation is to increase the dosage but Im not sure. 

Im not sure if this is a rant or looking for advice, just a bit tired of medication being the first line of defense. I watched my father slowly waste away on the medication meant to help him and I just worry about being the same. Im currently trying to change my entire living situation to something more inviting, get a pet to help brighten my mood (big pet lover), and trying to get outside more.

I know medication IS needed in many situations, Im just tired of seeing no results as of late. On one hand I feel like no one takes how debilitating this is when I refuse medication, but i just dont see the results. Hoping PTSD specific therapy and my life changes will help better than the medication, I often feel like im running out of options sometimes. 

TL;DR: been taking different anti depressant medications my whole life but dont notice a difference, feeling frusterated and looking for alternative treatment methods"
DAE HATE april fool’s day?,101,mi43ys,28,"I never participate. Like I already don’t trust anyone, pls don’t make it worse"
Feeling drained..almost wish I never started this healing journey...need support,5,mikpma,4,"So I'm new to being diagnosed with cptsd. I saw a psychiatrist 3 weeks ago and started the lowest dose of Zoloft 3 days ago. I think I might have tried to expose too much trauma on my own. I just feel like my anxiety is worse. Like now that I know I have a problem, I'm more aware of it...I can't ignore it anymore like I used to and it feels unsettling. In a way, I just want to go back to the me who ignored it. But I know that's only temperary. I didn't realize this healing journey would be so hard and painful. I am going to start cbt therapy soon. Idk what else to do. I just want to feel okay again."
"My brother has brought a girl over tonight and I’ve felt what I crave but I don’t have: intimacy, human relationships",9,mih0oi,1,"These 2 days my parents are out so I’m home alone with my younger brother (he’s M21, I’m M23). Last night he brought a girl to spend the night with her here. The 2 times that I’ve physically seen her have brought me feelings of butterflies in my stomach: yesterday night when she came and right now as I’m having breakfast as she left. These feelings have been uncomfortable, they mean that there’s something I crave but I’m not getting.

It’s a mix of feelings that I understand come from childhood trauma. I would like to have sex and intimate with a woman too, but I never relate to any. What I’ve learned over the past years is that for an intimate relationship to happen, there has to be an emotional bond that makes the 2 people get closer. It doesn’t happen because of logic, or because one member convinces the other. But because both members feel attracted and let themselves be carried away by their feelings.

When I was with my ex for 4 years (my only intimate relationship), I could never have sex or let myself be carried away because I was 100% repressed by the unconscious trauma I carried. Now I’m less repressed, I can do the intimate thing.

It’s alienating that I haven’t spoken face-to-face with any girl since the pandemic started more than 1 year ago. The longer this goes on, the more alien I feel to the notion of intimate romantic human relationships.

I crave intimacy but I’m not finding people who I relate to. I almost don’t even relate to my friends. Not only people but activities too. All my activities are solitary. After all the childhood trauma I’ve been through, I feel alienated. I’ve always felt like that, but now I’m more conscious. For the past year and a half I've only related to people when I’m here in /r/CPTSD or similar spaces on the web. *The sexual tension between me and no one*.

What has increased my feelings today is that this girl who has come home is not only attractive, but physically looks like a crush I had 3-2 years ago. She was the last intense crush I’ve had, and it stopped when I started discovering CPTSD. Since then my focus has shifted entirely to myself to heal. I haven’t had intense crushes since then.

**I want to spend time with people in person and create meaningful relationships, but I have no idea of where to go/what to do to find like-minded people.**"
Grieving what I lost,5,mii6d1,3,"Where I live, people have started to celebrate the Easter Holiday. I see my friends with their families on social media, having lots of fun. I am not saying that they shouldn’t have fun. It hurts to the core that I am living all alone and I don’t have anyone to spend the holidays with. I am soon 21 years old and I feel like I have lost so much and my peers can’t understand me. Around every holiday I feel this sadness. Grieving never ends, that’s how it feels like.

I went no contact with my biological family 4 years ago. My foster parents are okay but we  don’t spend so much time together. I do prefer living alone over with people because I feel so much safer this way. I just want to have a loving and supportive family. Is that too much to ask for? I wished that I could call and the person answering would be a mom or dad and their voice would be soft and warm."
Compulsive urge to SH everyday,2,miomob,1,"TW for descriptions of self harm
(TLDR at end of post)
Hello, I have been abused since I was very young. This caused a lot of issues for me with being compulsive, especially developing OCD at about 12. After about the age of 12 I started to get into self harm and after a year or two, I started to get into really heavy self harm and self mutilation that was weirder and heavier than a lot of people's harm I've seen. I did not do it for validation, and didn't often do it for any type of attention. I did it to see how much I could hurt myself. 

And now that I'm 19, I very lightly self harm about once a year. I recently did it again and I told my roommate what was going on because he was worried about it. I told him I have a very high urge to self harm every single day- because I want to hurt myself, and because it looks pretty to me. And I understand it is selfish to not care about what others think of my self harm, I still want to do it. The only reason I only do it once a year is because  I don't like other people getting freaked out by it or telling me they care about my safety. I feel selfish but I don't want to and can't stop. 

My roommate told me it wasn't normal to want to self harm every single day and wanted me to tell my therapist or psychiatrist. I've only told one therapist in my life because what are the rest going to do? Tell me the consequences and why I shouldn't do it, tell me they care and that I need to stop? It wouldn't make me stop. And they've tried medications for it too, nothing has helped a ton. Even after making a huge accomplishment of getting my OCD to extremely severe to mild/moderate I still have the same urge, same intensity, everyday. What's the point of getting help when I already tried? What's the point of stopping? I know the risks and repercussions and how people will react. And sometimes I even feel proud of self harming. I don't know how to change these feelings, but I am aware of them. I just need advice.

TLDR don't want to stop self harming, can't stop, and I don't care that much of what others think of my self harm and will do it anyway. I am resistant to changing these feelings but am willing if I can find the right motivation. Advice?"
This is my story. I would need to share it so awareness could be spread.,11,miftu7,1,"**T**hroughout my childhood I was exposed to numerous bad things. Most of them came from the worst person I've known to this day, sadly it is one of my parents - my mother.  
I was constantly shouted at, screamed at, beaten, kicked and manipulated. As some know, I go to hospital every two weeks for blood transfusions, due to anemia. This is since 2010. I got diabetes in 2015.  
My mother would always manipulate the people around me so they think she is caring and a ""good"" parent, which she is definitely not.  
I have been abused verbally and physically so many times. I found a good job in 2018, in a call centre (my first call centre). I met my love at work in January 2019 and we were together until Feb 2021.. when we broke up. (Things weren't going as good as before, so.. we decided to become friends and see if things will work out in future.. But.. she found a new partner and yeah.. she doesn't want anything at all now.).. This is not the important thing.  
In November 2020 I moved away from my mother as I used an argument (which she started) against her. She told me to pack my things and leave ""her"" apartment, which I paid rent for at the time, as I didn't ""trust"" her. My mother started calling my previous manager (woman) and asking her when will I get the rest of my money from my salary as I didn't get the whole sum. The manager wasn't in a good financial situation back then and it was really f..ed up from my mother to disturb her. And.. next morning after the call with my mother I went there with my (now ex) girlfriend and got my stuff. I lived with my girlfriend until Jan 2021. I moved under rent in that pretty good apartment and recently got a cat.  
I am so afraid to let my mother know about what happened and that I no longer live with my girlfriend, as my mother is awful. She will always turn things around against me and will start shouting, making accusations.. I am afraid that she will do something bad and will force me to go back to live with her, which I don't want AT ALL. I don't want to live in such toxic environment. She is an alcoholic and smokes a few packs of cigarettes a day. She is an excuse of a parent. And.. there was a period (a few weeks before the time I moved out from my mother's place) when my gf suggested that I contact the police for further assistance, but I was too afraid to do so.. My parents had a divorce since I was 5 and my father is in another city (my home city). I see him rarely, but we have strong bong and we text every day. My mother would often use ""I will call your father"" as a method to turn him against me, which is super toxic and awful.   
I went to my gf's place a lot before (like 4-5 days a week I stayed at her apartment and 2 days at my mom's apartment) and I felt comfortable there. Like in a safe haven. Now I am so afraid that something might happen to me if my mother finds out. If I suddenly disappear or never reply again, please be aware that something seriously bad happened. If you can, report this to someone. I can give details about my mother and all the necessary info.   
I feel threatened and I don't know what to do. Just being in the same room as my mother made me feel so anxious and depressed before, I do not want to go back there.

Negative associations based on lived experiences,2,minv4l,1,"Hi everyone. Reaching out here hoping someone may be able to help. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD a couple of years back. I was detained and abused by my family for 5 months for going against cultural norms and wanting to marry someone outside of my culture. After I managed to escape, I went through a long process of healing, the immediate diagnosis was PTSD, and after over a year of therapy, it was categorised as C-PTSD due to events that took place throughout my life that I learned to cope with to survive my environment. 

Now I’m married to the person I love, estranged from my family, moved to a new country and continue my recovery. I found out I’m pregnant, and it was very much planned and I was looking forward to it. To my surprise, instead of being happy, I went into deep depression the first couple of months. Now in 2nd trimester and feeling much better and started to feel excited and joyful about it and have a lot of anticipation. Then I realised, every time I feel excited, I have an impulse of ‘shutting down’ the excitement to avoid getting too excited. It hit me after a while that I associated excitement with things going wrong because my now husband and I have planned our wedding twice before and each time something went wrong; first time I was severely abused by my family we had to cancel, the second time I was detained and again had to cancel. Both times, I was so excited and looking forward to it and had my friends excited about it too, so now when I feel excited about the pregnancy and when we tell friends and they get excited too, a sense of dread hits me. 

Has anyone experience such emotions while recovering from PTSD? How do you deal or cope or manage this? 

Thanks"
"Nightmares, he has APD, im terrified",3,mil6j4,1,"I've been having awful nightmares since I came back home. They all go the same. He (scary ex bf) kidnaps me in Florida where I go to school, does a lot of terrifying things to me that feel super real including removing my larynx (wtf), which causes me to hide my ability to sign so he doesn't cut off my hands. I'm then struggling to communicate because my family can't sign, and for some reason I end up in group therapy and nobody believes me or anything, despite one of the therapist showing a recording of his trial. He then gets fired and then everyone is mad at me for getting him fired. Eventually the interpreter stands up and is like ""Guys, I interpreted for her when she was in the hospital and the nurse told her she could die. I saw her struggle to try to talk. You guys are just being bullies"" And then I wake up. It's just weird because dreams usually don't follow rules, but this did?

I think this is popping up because I'm back home. Where he lives. And I've been thinking a lot about one of the last conversations I had with him before blocking him everywhere. He told me doctors are trying to figure out how to treat him, and if his bipolar is related to anti-social personality disorder. Later, this was confirmed. He didn't know quite what that meant when he first told me, usually when he was playing doctor google he just looked up ""psychopathy"" and didn't pay attention to the name of the disorder. Now, I know not everyone with it is a monster who hurts people for no reason. But he is. And I remember a conversation I had with his mother shortly after breaking up with him. He was initially gracious about it, as long as we could still be friends. Later, He told me he was suicidal, and kept apologizing for hurting me, and generally going on about his problems (a habit that definitely didn't make me want to keep in touch). So, I rushed over to his house and stayed with him until his parents showed up. I showed his mom the messages. When I left, she showed me out and once we were away from him and his dad she asked me ""did he hurt you? What did he mean?"" and I said no. Telling a mother (and she is super sweet and kind, I respect her a lot) that her son is a monster doesn't sound like fun to me. 

I'm rambling. Idk I'm just scared. I need to talk to doc about going back on prazosin, but generally my anxiety has been insane. Usually I have more issues with depression, but this is worse than it has been in a while."
DAE have a hard time letting go of anger/resentment?,45,mi7tds,12,"I’ve been working on healing for a over year but have a lot of trouble with this. I can easily get wrapped up into thinking about how someone has really hurt me and I’ll imagine these fake conversations where I’m confronting them about it, but nothing ever gets resolved and the anger is still there. It can consume me for hours. It’s such a waste of energy but I can’t help it. I wish I could just move on and stop thinking about these people!"

Like whenever something bad happens, all I could really say is ""that's sucks"" I can't even bring myself to manifest any sort of emotions into it, and I feel bad because I feel like it comes across as I don't care.. and it's weird bc it's very different from my past self who can come up with a more supportive response..

DAE Have a hard time finding music that isnt upsetting to listen to?,32,mi83c8,20,"I’ve never found anyone else who relates, and even my therapist is a bit baffled by this problem I have. I enjoy music a lot— I even co-run a small record label.  But it is SO hard for me to find stuff to listen to that doesn’t upset me in some way or another. Anything sad will absolutely wreck me. Anything too happy feels “wrong”.  Things that are too high-energy are often anxiety-inducing.  Anything too sleepy makes me sad.  It’s truly INFURIATING and has caused real problems in my life; I’ll often want some music on in the background while I work (because silence also feels wrong) and I can‘t count how many times I’ve wasted literal hours trying to find something to put on that doesn‘t negatively impact my mood.  I have had mental breakdowns as a result of the frustration this causes. I like audiobooks and podcasts a lot, but they aren’t great for more focused work. 

I know this sounds crazy and is a fuckin weird problem to have.  I wonder if its CPTSD related b/c a lot of the music I find difficult is difficult bc it evokes memories of trauma.  Anyone else deal with anything like this?"
Trauma change sexuality?,4,mijf5c,1,"Hi, does anyone feel that his/her sexuality has changed due to traumas in his/her life span.

For me (20m), I always been attracted to female always, and still do however, I been through 3 sexual assault, plus some unsolicited nudes that been sent by males, and some other small situation, at some of the situation I felt a sense of arousal, now I know it's normal and doesn't mean I liked it, and I actually get angry when people send unsolicited nudes ""all males"". But I think it affected my sexuality, sometimes I told myself if they want me to be gay, I will be gay. Now I am mostly attracted to females, but there are some days where I crave seeing gay-anime nudes. I love watching them at the moment, but after I finish I feel sad and feel disgusted. I watch them like once a month, one pic and it does turn me on so much. But I hate it afterwards.

Why can't I cry?,27,mi74ze,8,"I don't know if anyone else can relate but every time I start to feel that pressure behind my eyes that comes before tears start forming, my mind disconnects and my body immediately shuts it down. I start to feel some tingling in my body and then I go emotionally and physically numb. 

It feels like there's this solid mass or *thing* in my body, resting from the front of my chest through to my back between my shoulder blades. It is like a boulder. Solid. Impenetrable. Heavy. As long as it holds together I'm safe. 

Sometimes I notice little cracks forming like a spiderweb across its surface and I have the fear of knowing that if it breaks I may never be able to put myself back together again. The cracks are quickly worn smooth, erased from the surface like they were never there.

Another part of me, small and quiet, wants nothing more than to cry in wracking, breathless sobs. This part of me knows the tears will release the pain and anguish I constantly hold inside from decades of trauma that began with the day I was born. But I can't do it, even when the only person in the room with me is just myself. 

The boulder is too solid now, another organ in my body that's attached to my heart allowing each breath. I'm afraid that there's nothing in me left that can destroy it without destroying myself."

"Carbs trigger flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety ?",3,mih8jj,6,"⚠️ As it was pointed out to me, this post might be triggering to those with ED


Hey, 

So i noticed something pretty damning for me that I want to share. English isn't my language so bear with me.

Carbs have been my main (if not only) source of food for years.
2 months ago, I did a long term fast for a few days, and noticed very encouraging results on my ptsd symptoms such as nightmares, flashbacks and anxiety. They weren't completely gone but wayyy toned down and actually manageable. Then when i started eating again, i focused on healthy food, fibers, healthy fats proteins and the improvements i had noticed were still there.
A couple weeks later, I had a slip up and started eating junk food again. Bam, the anxiety and flashbacks came back with a vengeance.
Did another prolonged fast, which calmed the symptoms a bit, then immediately started eating a diet mostly consisting of bread and cheese (i am a frenchie after all). You guessed it, symptoms came back like crazy.
So I did a third 4 days fast again, ate healthy again, symptoms gone.
Just yesterday, i had a binge of junk food and now i'm feeling like shit, flashbacks won't leave me alone.

Doing research, I couldn't find any study or evidence of the correlation between a high carb diet and ptsd/cptsd although there's a link between it and symptoms of depression/anxiety. 

But from my short term experience, the correlation is pretty damning. It's obviously not a miracle cure, nothing is, but it is really a huge difference.
My symptoms can be very much debilitating and with fasting or low carb diet, they are very much manageable.

I really suggest all of you to try avoiding carbs for a week and please if you do, share your results.

**tl;dr** : Carbohydrates might play an important role in cptsd/ptsd symptoms and avoiding them, in my experience, alleviate those symptoms greatly while high carb diet makes them worst."
I really hate having feelings,11,mibpcz,3,Because no one cares about them
DAE just feel angry at everyone sometimes?,120,mhvkd8,39,"Sometimes I look at my friends and all I see are privileged spoiled girls who haven’t faced an ounce of true hardship in their lives. For many of them, the worst they’ve been through is drama with friends, some micro aggressions, or the occasional divorced parents. For me, the worst I’ve been through is growing up with abuse and being raped.

They all got to have these luxuries that I never got to have. They all get to whine about petty stuff, while I have CPTSD and panic attacks. It can be very irritating. My friend literally cried once because she wasn’t voted captain of her basketball team. Some of them are just so sensitive. It makes me half annoyed, but also half concerned. God knows what would happen if they ever faced real abuse one day.

I realize it’s not their fault that they’re privileged. Hell, if I grew up in a loving household, constantly being showered in hugs and kisses, I’d probably be crazy sensitive too."
How can I help my bf understand?,8,micguf,3,"Hi everyone,

I'm 47, my bf is 56. We've been long distance almost 1.5 years.

Recently my ex (7+ yrs divorced) involved my older kids in a violent upset that resulted in a restraining order for me and them. But he has now contested the order and I have had to appear in front of a judge 3 times. The 4th and final time will be in June. He never shows up, just sends his lawyer.

It has been incredibly stressful for me. I'm not intimidated by the judge but it's the rehashing of everything I went through (those 18 yrs of marriage) to establish ""an escalating pattern of danger"". As you can imagine, there has been affidavits, accusals and denials on his part. This has left me triggered many times. I wear a PTSD bracelet since diagnosed 6 years ago.

The most overwhelming trigger is feeling unsafe. Brain fog, wanting to run, uncontrolled crying, sleep disturbance, etc. The good thing is, my turnaround time is much quicker now. For a few years there, it was calm seas, so as you know it feels defeating. But I have hope. well...That is, when I don't want to run so far away, nobody will ever find me except the animals in the woods where I survive and thrive alone. It's just abject fear.

How can I explain this to my bf? He is kind, wants to help over video (thx, covid) and I cannot explain it to him. I try and try and he understands it's stressful but literally cannot understand the physiological drain to me. He cannot understand how those moments strip my confidence and worth, he asks how I can doubt his love and when I say I don't he says, ""but you feel unlovable so...""

He's European and PTSD is not widely known outside of military terms. But he wants to listen and help. I don't want to wreck this relationship. It's taken me so long to trust someone again. It's still in process for me.

Has anyone else found a way to explain this clearly and simply to their partner? I really need advice."
I just lashed out at my SO and let my anxiety win,12,mi9eku,3,"Im new to this sub and have only rly just begun my CPTSD healing journey. I’ve been trying very hard lately to work on myself and my attitude towards my SO. Hes always been ridiculously supportive of me and always there for me. 

About 6 month ago my father passed away suddenly in a car accident and I basically lost my mind and all the trauma of my childhood plus watching my dad die in front of me sort of drove me insane over these last 6 months.

I developed and incredibly bad attitude towards my SO as he was always just trying to be there for me and make sure I’m okay, but every time he did i just got mad at him and told him to leave me alone. He didn’t understand but respected my wishes. Well after 6 months of that he is understandably upset and feels rejected and unloved. 

I have been doing my best to be more aware of my attitude and how I am being towards him but it’s so hard. I generally am still quite angry and want to be left alone, but i know deep down i don’t want him to go away, but i keep pushing him away. I have no romantic desire for anything or anyone anymore and i have to constantly reject him. 

Tonight i came home with the mindset of being just kind and hanging with him. I had come back from the gym and he was cooking dinner. He mentioned “why don’t you shower while I cook?”. To which i replied “well i just got home and want to chill for a sec since dinner will be done soon and I’ll shower after”. He insisted that i should just shower now and get it out of the way etc and i was just like no it’s fine i just want to chill and it’s no big deal I’ll shower after dinner. ...well he continued to insist and didn’t understand why i wouldn’t just do it now😰 i begun to feel attacked and freeze up which unintentionally gave me an attitude towards him and i spat back with a very fuck you attitude that I’m going to shower after dinner. And he immediately shut down said whatever i don’t care and ignored me while finishing cooking. 

Then i came to the table and tried talking and he wanted nothing to do with me. I pushed and he was just completely shutting me out. I began to panic and feel angry and i have absolutely no idea how to be angry and it bubbled up and i just exploded and screamed at him “ i fucking hate you! You’re an asshole you piece of shit” etc etc... i don’t mean any of that i jsut didn’t even know what was going on. I threw the dishes in the sink was going crazy and just ran to the bathroom locked the door and took my damn shower ...

I’ve tried to go to him and explain how i felt and I’ve said I’m sorry. But he has nothing to say to me. I think he finally has lost his patience with me and my messed up head. I feel awful. I just don’t think i can even be in relationships anymore. Nobody deserves to have to deal with my shitttt Uhg

How to accept that it might never get better?,2,mih67h,5,Is it even possible to heal? 
Set a boundary expecting rejection and it was met with acceptance and affirmation.,154,mhsdis,17,"I've been seeing this guy for a few weeks now. I wasn't looking for anything emotionally serious on our first date, just sex, but afterwards we actually hit it off and have been texting everyday (which is a huge deal for me, I hate texting most people). Due to some past sexual trauma (some of it VERY recent) I sometimes have difficulty with sex. On our last date, we had planned for him to stay over at my house, but I had been having a very triggering day in regards to a recent sexual assault. I told him that he was welcome to stay, but I didn't want to even fool around, maybe light kissing and cuddling. Not only did he completely respect it, when we were cuddling in bed and I was feeling on high alert, afraid that he might try something, I spoke up and said I was having a hard time relaxing. He gave me space, but still held me and asked me what I needed. He gave me several options on how we could proceed: sleeping in the bed, but no cuddling, him sleep on the couch, or him leaving entirely. He didn't make me feel guilty for it and was reassuring me the whole time that he was just happy to be hanging out with me. I asked him to stay in the bed, but was still fearful of what might happen once I fell asleep. I fell asleep and woke up in the night and had forgotten he was there, which just doesn't happen. Usually I am hyperaware of a person in my bed. I rolled over and saw he was sleeping on the edge of the bed, giving me as much space as possible. He wasn't trying to grope me in the night, he wasn't grinding into my back to try and start something sexual, he was simply respecting my space. 

Our next date is at his place and again, we had planned for me to stay over. I thought that maybe I had given enough time to reset and maybe find my sex drive again, but it just doesn't seem to be happening. I was feeling pressure from myself to go and have sex at his place anyways, feeling guilty for not taking care of ""his needs."" It was a big topic of discussion at therapy this week. I have a hard time being honest and expressing my needs, but my therapist encouraged me to do it. I messaged him, fully expecting this to be the last straw and for him to want to just cut ties with me for being so fussy. Again, he was very supportive and said some very nice things that I won't get into, but I just feel validated and seen. I hope that he can walk the walk because he can definitely talk the talk. 

Speaking up and not just fawning is really hard for me and sending that text was terrifying. I was expecting the worst and I know that I would have been okay if it had come, but it's nice to stand up for myself and have it be celebrated."
A thing choosing bad relationships in adulthood taught me...,77,mhw0k0,25,"...is that I was my own abuser.


When people around us say things similar to our self-talk, we believe them, even when it is not true.  We are already used to how they treat us because we are programmed to treat ourselves the same, and to believe we deserve it.  I think this is why I stayed too long in bad relationships.  I now think that in a weird way, I needed them to teach me how mean I was to myself.  I didn't need how those relationships interrupted/ruined the life I was trying to build, but I also think I would have sabotaged myself in some other way without them.

 
You deserve the benefit of the doubt, kindness, and understanding from yourself and others.  Believe it, because it's true.   💕"
"Thoughts on ADHD, and seeking perspectives on its relation to CPTSD",15,mi75im,13,"I recently came upon a TED Talk called Failing at Normal: An ADHD Success Story

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JiwZQNYlGQI)

I found myself crying in recognition of the ways in which her story was eerily similar to my own. I spoke with my mother who confirmed that yes, I was diagnosed with ADHD in my early 20s, but it was left untreated due to her fears over the current of addiction that runs through my family and her reluctance to have me taking medication. Since then I have been looking into this disorder and find my symptoms to closely align with many typical ADHD presentations. I also have a host of other diagnosed conditions, as is often the case with both ADHD and CPTSD. I have taken ADHD medication on and off throughout the years after moving out, to mixed degrees of success. 

The problem is, I have also been diagnosed with, and am being treated for, CPTSD (well, PTSD is the diag b/c DSM, but my therapist understands). Her take is that we treat the trauma and ""see what's left after that"". As I have come to understand it,  leaving ADHD untreated results in a myriad of comorbidites and worsening of quality-of-life, which checks out for me. I'm left wondering if I should be in therapy for my ADHD alongside my CPTSD.

Some suggest that ADHD is directly caused by trauma. Others posit that they are different and or different origins (biological, hereditary), all of which also sound a lot like the mechanisms of CPTSD (lineage trauma, executive dysfunction, etc. ) Even Pete Walker names how before there was a diagnosis of ADHD available, he was treating patients for trauma who's symptoms were identical. All I know from my limited research is how collectively little we know for certain about all of this. 

My symptoms are ruining me. My days are full of suffering and my life is in pieces that seem to be too slippery to pick up and reassemble. One school of thought suggests I continue to treat my trauma and ""see what's left. Another suggests that I find ways to cope with my ADHD symptoms through various top-down modalities to improve my daily functioning. I see pros and cons to each, but I am unsure which direction might be best.

I am curious what sorts of experiences y'all have had in this realm? Does anyone have both diagnoses? Have you learned about functional differences? What is your understanding of the connection between them? Have you tried different treatments for either or both, and how did it go for you?

Thanks for taking the time to engage, looking forward to the discussion that may arise here."

POTS,2,mid7iw,1,"Has anyone here ever been diagnosed with POTS (postural tachycardia syndrome)?  I just got diagnosed and some of the symptoms sound a lot like CPTSD related physical symptoms discussed in The Body Keeps The Score.  I'm wondering if POTS is more common in us, if maybe it's related to childhood trauma?  It is dysregulation of the nervous system which would kind of go hand in hand with the neurologic changes seen with CPTSD.  Just curious."
How do I exit a conversation I don’t want to be in and never wanted to have?,6,mic0jx,2,"My mom told me she had covid, again. I’ve already gone no contact, and I honestly felt pretty indifferent about her latest covid declaration, but I replied to her message anyway cuz I was pressured by family (and my own basic human decency) to at least feign moderate concern. All I did was ask about her diagnosis and how she was doing but she’s trying to use this to reinitiate contact and is now asking me personal questions about my life. Oh, and she doesn’t even have covid. Granted, it’s not her fault that the test she took came back positive and that probably freaked her out but she was literally just sick. The “covid test” that she took was apparently just that forehead scanner thing which tests for sickness/fever/temperature/etc - it’s not exclusively looking for covid, yet she tells me that she tested positive for covid before taking an actual covid test. 

This is a mirror of what happened last time; she was just sick and she decided to weaponize her illness and act like she definitely had covid right up until she received her negative results. She milked every second of it (she decided that her roommates should cook and deliver every meal to her bedroom, made them do groceries, made them run back and forth through the house doing other random shit, etc - this might not sound so bad except she expected me to do on a regular basis for her when I lived there and she was perfectly healthy). Honestly, I’ve never witnessed someone get sick so proudly and it’s weird. I’m fucking pissed and I’m stressed out and anxious for the first time in months. I don’t want to tell her about my life or tell her where I’m staying so that she can ambush me by showing up. She doesn’t get to reenter my life because she got sick. I was enjoying my life and now Im back to feeling the same, gross, perpetual anxiety that I thought I’d finally figured out."
Handling Chronic and Constant Anxiety,3,miebyh,2,"I have been living with constant anxiety for a long time. I am a victim/survivor who has always had a high level of anxiety. Experiencing calmness isn't completely uncomfortable or unknown but still an infrequent occurence. Panic attacks sky rocket at random and usually last for an hour or more. Its debilitating and emotionally draining. It sucks to feel okay and than wham. Feeling dizzy, nauseous, sick, and crying so much because it feels so horrible. Like my body turns on me regardless of how good I am doing. 

I wonder if any other people in this sub have found unconventional methods to help manage or reduce their anxiety. The more conventional methods don't work for me since my normal state is high anxiety. Any advice, support, shares , or resources is great. Also just knowing I'm not alone with this is also helpful. 

Thank you"
"Does anybody else lose themselves for hours a day in video games / TV? I've been doing this for over 20 years, and I'm wondering if it's a CPTSD symptom.",569,mhkdzk,82,"I'm an only child who grew up with two abusive parents with prevalent mental health issues. I was very softly spoken and introverted, so I used to hole myself up in my room reading, gaming, and watching TV. Now as a 30-year-old, not much has changed. I spend most of my time when I'm not working losing myself in games, books, and TV. This can be up to several hours a night. On weekends, it can be 7-8 hours. I find myself on autopilot a lot of the time and thinking, ""do I actually want to do this? Am I having fun?"" The answer is often no. I'm also finding that I'm isolating myself and avoiding social interaction because I'm too tired, so I'd rather just sit indoors and lose myself in escapist things.  


I wonder if this is a maladaptive coping mechanism. Has anybody experienced this too?"
Shaking,9,mi859i,5,"Not sure this is quite the right tag, but I'm hoping someone can shed some light on an issue I've been having.

I started doing TRE every once in a while maybe a year and a half ago, and I pretty quickly got to a point where I could just ""breathe into it"" and shake spontaneously even without doing any exercises beforehand. I've noticed some positive effects, but I've also noticed that I'm pretty much just shaky as a person now. It's pretty distressing in certain interpersonal and social situations, and it affects my ability to do my physical labor job as efficiently as I used to. I feel like it's honestly causing more distress than it's alleviating, currently. 

Has anyone else experienced this and found a solution/comfort? Does anyone know if I can reasonably expect it to abate at some point? Will doing more TRE and similar exercises make it worse, or do I just need to ""get it out of my system""? 

I'm so conflicted, because I think it does help my body relax but I don't think I can deal with being permanently predisposed to shaking like a leaf anytime I get anxious or try to exercise. Any insight would really be appreciated."

"My boyfriends best friend messaged me to tell me I'm a burden to my boyfriend, I'm holding him back. I broke up with him.",35,mhz8qo,10,"The 17 part message basically said:

-He's running out of time to do what he wanted in life

-I'm stopping him from growing and holding him down

-If I loved him I would help him

-I'm dragging him down, would go to therapy if I cared about him (haven't been able to afford it since last year)

-I'm faking the panic attacks and manipulating him into staying with me

-Draining his potential future

I have CPTSD and am considered disabled because of it. I feel pretty pathetic about that but. Well last night his friend and 2 other friends came to talk about work because they work together, and my boyfriend has been struggling. I guess the conversation turned from that to it being my fault because I overhear

-she's selfish

-she's probably schizophrenic, one day she will kill your family at night

-she doesn't care about you or she would help (I destroyed my education and little mental health I had to support our family and him when he was too depressed)

-insults about self harm scars 

-all these deep, personal issues talked about among a group of people insulting me 

After this I started crying. Didn't know they could hear as I was hiding in the basement. He said I'm crying now to be extra and if my bf wants to get away he will put him in a hotel.

I broke up with my boyfriend. I think it's true, I am a burden. Sometimes it is true. I'm unhealthy. I feel so shocked. I just told him he can stay here as long as he needs to find somewhere else, that I would be alright so don't stress about me. I woke up this morning and remembered it all and I felt overhwhelmed. Kind of broke down. Afterward he said I being a burden to the family for crying. I hate that my disability makes me a burden. I hide in thr laundry room when I have the flash backs or attacks but they still hear me cry I guess. I don't even know how to continue. I hope I can learn to not be like this."

The concept of nostalgia makes me sad. I don’t have a happy childhood to pine for because mine was stolen from me.,835,mhhl06,83,"I’m in my late 20s and it seems like a lot of people my age love looking back on their childhood fondly, remembering all their happy memories of being a carefree kid. Playing with friends, having no worries. They talk about wishing they could go back to those days and feeling nostalgic for simpler times. 

And it just makes me sad because I can’t relate at all. I don’t recall ever being a carefree child. I have always been plagued by anxiety and trauma and loss and fear. Family stuff, then bullying which developed into social anxiety which developed into panic disorder.... I’ve had to carry the weight of the world since before I could even articulate what the world was. People who didn’t know what was going on would call me mature for my age but it was the constant anxiety, even since elementary school. 

I missed out on a happy childhood and never got a chance to be carefree. Now I’m missing out on getting to be nostalgic too. And it’s really hard to function as a responsible adult when you never got a chance to be carefree as a child."
"What are boundaries, how to set them and when to oblige?",9,mi7fud,6,"I've been a LTL here and really appreciate all the support in this dub!


An issue I've found is that lots of places always say to set boundaries, but if you've spent your whole life having your boundaries ignored, or feeling like your responsibility is to lower your boundaries it can be really hard to even start to establish them.


I don't even know where to begin - counsellors say to learn to say ""No"" and to ""make time for yourself"" but I don't even know who myself is outside of ""carer, achiever etc"" that I feel like I don't have my own identity.


All my friendships fall apart so I rely heavily on my dysfunctional family and it seems like a vicious cycle. I don't enjoy anything that people suggest to help, other than reading but I feel like I can't relax. Ever. It's exhausting and I just don't know where to start.


I've tried so many methods but none of them ever stick for long enough to make a difference. Everyone seems to have SOMETHING that they have to relax so I just feel like I'm all alone.

Anyone else? Any help?"
"Dissociation, possible DID",5,miadoq,3,"I’ve been going to a trauma therapist for about 4 months.  I’m a male in my 40s and done therapy before but never focused on trauma.  Holy crap she is really helping me.  One thing I’ve learned about is how much I dissociate and how this has been a defense mechanism since was a kid.  She has been gently letting me know that I may have some degree of DID or dissociative identity disorder.  This was pretty scary at first but I’m thinking that she may be on to something.  I don’t have multiple identities on the outside that anyone would notice, but it’s clear that my childhood trauma caused me to have splintered off parts of self that have never been integrated.  Those parts of self are in regular conflict with each other and the result is anxiety, depression, and panic attacks.  My life fell apart a few years ago and lost my business of 15 years and almost burned my marriage down.  I somehow survived long enough to stabilize and now I’m doing the work to process my trauma.  It’s scary but I’m still here. My therapist thinks I’m almost ready to start emdr.  I’m slowly starting to have little glimmers of hope."
How to be a better friend/person when you’re absorbed with your issues?,9,mi5r4t,8,"My friend vocalized to me that I have been really unresponsive when talking about herself and her issues, but more than responsive when we dive into mine. 

It feels like I’ve become the person that I never wanted to be: ungrateful and self-absorbed. I feel like I talk too much about myself and my problems. I used to be a rock to my friends and family, but that shifted since I started working through my issues a couple years back. And honestly, I think I prefer being the old me who could be there for everyone. 

Now I’m nowhere close to there. I guess I’m wondering if anyone else has had this experience. And how to stop hating yourself tbh"
does this sound like hyperarousal?,2,mieg1v,0,"i wanna preface this by saying i havent been diagnosed with cptsd. i still live with my parents.

i am not sure if i really am, but it sure feels like im constantly anxious. i wake up and there's my heartbeat. i cant sleep in. my heart will often have some combination of racing or pounding. often these are in the still moments. ill be sitting in my zoom class, and ill have a brief thought or emotion that will trigger a wave of anxiety to run through my body, leaving my heart pounding. when i try to sleep it also beats. there's often a feeling of there being no ""floor"" under my heart, like its going to fall, just that physical anxious feeling in the center of the chest. i cant focus on tv shows or movies because of this. youtube is better if its comedy, but it seems like sitting still and focusing and watching something is the hardest. i read a lot of fanfic and i can focus much better on it than videos, but there's often something thatll ""set me off"" and ill have to take a break and look at twitter to make myself calm down. it doesnt feel like anxiety. similar but different...its like this itching, an unease but not quite. the only thing that really takes my mind off of things is drawing and sleeping. i think im constantly in some kind of state of derealization or depersonalization (i havent felt real for years, constant visual snow, etc) but somehow that dissociation never eases my anxiety. because of it i cant even nap. the first time i napped since i was a baby was a couple months ago when my family left for a few days. it was incredible. i felt genuinely refreshed from being dead tired.

during these periods of days where im constantly uneasy like this, im extremely productive art wise, but school assignments become even harder to do because the stress of having to do something assigned is so much. im not usually such a procrastinator but its gotten worse the more i consider the possibility of cptsd and think about my entire life.

most of the time im in this uneasy, extremely productive state (yet will still be exhausted all the time) but sometimes there will be a crash, where i lay in bed for longerthan usual and dont draw and just. wallow. for a couple days. even though its that empty sadness it finally feels like my body and brain lets myself rest. i can finally sleep without intense fear creeping up on me for no reason, and hearing what may be hallucinations or may be my insanely sensitive ears, and seeing the shadows moving. i can fall asleep easier. just now the atmosphere around my ears changed and the air moving from the fan sounds really strange and scary and im suddenly pretty scared right now. typing about this kinda stuff always makes me dissociate, so ill stop here.

oh also, my shoulder and neck muscles feel like rocks and i always hold tension in my jaw and eyebrows. i also seem to be quite prone to repetitive strain injuries? the ones with the nerves, like ulnar nerve issues and carpal tunnel"
Yesterday I finally was able to recognize an emotional flashback,13,mi3njg,3,"Or was I? 
I started the day with a email asking for
me to do a task at work that I was supposed to do anyway and I felt gilt and shame at first but, then almost immediately I became more and more upset in a way that my chest feel tight, light headed, wanting to cry without being able to. Automatically I become quite and unable to say how I feel. As if I’m not really feeling I’m just faking it so I should just shape up and not bother anyone. 
So while morning goes I’m doing nothing but send shit email apologizing and setting recurring emails to myself to remind me of my duties.
On lunch time I am just trying to keep myself going without crumbling. Everything is just hazy and I keep thinking that I am just a fucking idiotic bitch for taking things personally..... except... ta da dah. I’m not I didn’t take it personally, feeling gilt or ashamed is ok but why was I feeling so bad even though I agreed with the message wish was nothing more than “Hi, I will need more help from you, here are the tasks we have to do”. 
I never logically, consciously took it personally but, my feelings let me suicidal! Completely inoperative for a day because after lunch I just stopped. 

Is this a emotional flashback?"
Am I a narcissist?,10,mi543m,4,"My parents both are, I'm sure. And I recognize some tendencies in myself of covert narcissism. I know that CPTSD can result in NPD, perpetuating a cycle, but I don't want to be one. Is the fact that I'm even questioning it evidence that I'm not truly a narcissist? Anybody have any insight?"
I wish my parents had split up,45,mhtl6b,11,"We weren't even teenagers yet, we were children.

They involved us in their fights, we saw my dad hit my mom and destroy her most sacred belongings, we saw our parents cry and felt confused and helpless, they talked badly about each other to us (with or without their spouse) and tried to emotionally manipulate us throughout our entire childhoods (and still do), they made us pick sides and used us as weapons, they insulted and mocked us if we as much as resembled their spouse, they made us fall asleep scared and anxious hearing them fight all night long through the walls, shouting and screaming and hurling insults, they asked each one of us who we wanted to live with, they told us ""your mom/dad and I are getting a divorce"" for the 1000th time as if it was a threat to us, as if it was supposed to make us sad, as if we cared about their ""marriage"" ending.

The reason according to them as to why they never split up, is that they didn't want to ""do that"" to us, they didn't want their children living with divorced parents.  I honestly wish they would have just split up, both back then and also when looking back now.

I don't think it's easy to have divorced parents, of course. But my parents ended up doing way more damage to me and my siblings by staying together, than they probably would have if they just split up. We grew up in a hateful and loveless household full of fights, shouting, screaming, name-calling, side-picking, blaming, threats, mental illness, emotional and physical abuse and neglect, and overall misery.

Their marriage was not a real marriage and we were not a real family.

There was nothing to save in the first place, then what was the point?"
Stress sensitivity & CPTSD: burning out easily.,34,mhum14,7,"Hi all,

A question here, wondering if anyone else can relate. Ever since my trauma happened, i have been very sensitive to stress. I tend to get overwhelmed way easier than i used to, i need more time to recover from minor stresses and i can’t deal with stress very well anymore. 

I have been unable to hold a job, maintain a social life and do the things i like to do (hobbies) in the past few years. It’s either having a job and nothing outside of it because i can’t cope or it’s being unemployed & having a small social circle and being able to enjoy my life/hobbies. 

I don’t want to be unemployed and feel like a loser because of it. I feel like people look down on me because i can’t hold a job like a ‘normal’ adult. This creates a spiral where i keep pushing myself over and over again which always ends in me burning out even worse and my mental health going downhill again. 

I’m not sure how to continue my life, get a job or not.. Maybe work on trauma and mental health first, learn how to cope with stress before i get back into working/socializing? Everything seems to tire me out quickly and i spend days recovering from social events or a work day. 

Can anyone here relate to this? How do you cope?"
Getting past hypervigilance,7,mi3kka,6,"I struggle with being in what feels like constant flight/fear mode. My body is always tense and hurting, and I’m never breathing full breaths unless consciously trying to.

A major disruptor in my life is hypervigilance, specifically at night either just before falling asleep, or after being woken up from outside sounds. I take steps to avoid getting triggered in the first place, like blasting a compact fan in my room for white noise, but sometimes outside city sounds still get through and I wake up. I get immediately triggered into a terrifying fear state that I am not safe. I rationally know that most likely I’m okay and nothing bad is happening, but I cannot convince myself until I get out of bed to check the window/house/doors a few times, etc. But the larger issue is I’m stuck awake all night until dawn because my body is stuck in a hypervigilant state. My body is convinced someone is coming to hurt me.

Do you have any advice for how to get out of hypervigilance? Emotional flashback management steps don’t seem to work as well in these moments."
I setup a tent indoors last night and had a magical childhood adventure.,795,mhcqfd,72,"This whole month I've been feeding my inner child. I have been fingerpainting, drinking from silly straws, eating tacos in bed and more.

Last night I fulfilled a childhood fantasy I always had, which was to setup a tent in my house and pretend I was camping in some exotic location.

The tent barely fit in my room, but it worked! I setup the sleeping bag, air mattress and sheet. Outside I setup a speaker on a timer to play ""Forest music at night"" for 2 hours. 

I got inside the tent, the sounds started playing and instantly I was transported!! I could almost smell the forest and feel the space around me. It felt nice to be somewhere else, and the nature sounds were relaxing. I felt so free and light and young,  I was so at peace and calm :)

It's interesting because I then had a vivid nightmare about being attacked by Nazis and then killing them....a bit intense after the calmness of the tent. 

I feel this nightmare was me fighting off and killing another toxic part of my past. Each childhood thing I have done has released a part of something and I feel lighter. Not sure what comes next but I'm excited to keep releasing more and more.

Thanks for reading and being here. It's very embarassing and shameful for me to have to hide these things from co-workers and some people. Can't wait until I don't have to hide anymore."
Does anyone else deal with a mom who is hypersensitive?,2,mibe1r,1,"My mom is know for her manic moments, where she’ll go on tangents for hours and in general really hyper and volatile. She is known for being really mean, she’ll make blatant sexist/racist comments, she’ll purposefully nit pick chores we do, is passive aggressive with family and is always the victim. It’s dumb but today she really upset me with this. We were bantering and she mentioned her boyfriends daughter, who she really dislikes. Jokingly I asked her if it’s because she’s fat. My mom is constantly telling me how she wouldn’t hire fat people, how they’re gross and she can’t stand them. She then begins to cry. She tells me how it’s not because she’s fat you’re making it seem worse. It’s because she’s lazy I dislike lazy people, who tend to be heavier. I just went along with it because her mood went from estastic to depressed. She felt like I was pointing out how cruel she was. Later in the day off handily she mentions the mean comment I say earlier that hurt her feelings while talking to her boyfriend. I’m frustrated. No matter what I do, I can’t predict her. I’m always wrong and it’s wearing me out."
Is this also freeze response?,4,mi6sza,1,"My symptoms fit perfectly into the freeze response category. I learned very early in life that I need to shut down completely in order to survive. I'm 22 and I'm just now learning how to open up and relax a little bit.

Recently I came across this grounding exercise when you pause whatever you're doing and you notice exactly what you're doing in that moment, then you keep expanding your awareness and notice the position of your body in the room, how the chair/couch/floor feels and observe everything you can observe around you in the present moment. When you realize you're not in immediate danger (like you were taught to believe), you focus on how your body feels. This exercise helps me relax, open up and be present.

The thing is I struggle with derealization and agoraphobia, too, because I just don't know what my role into the society is/should be. It's like I can't comprehend my position into the world. It feels like I don't belong to the country and culture I come from, but I also can't connect with any other country or people in general. That's how I figured out that the problem is not with the people in my proximity, but I have a problem.

Since I was a child I fantasize a lot about what I could be, about my potential, and I do have dreams and desires. The problem is fantasizing has been a coping mechanism and growing up like this made me isolate myself. It's like I can set the goal, but can't follow the path from point A to point B! And honestly, I'm not even sure if I want to have the career I imagine I'd like to have. I don't know how to be practical, because I don't feel grounded in my culture, in the dynamics of the people in my proximity create.

I'm not sure how to explain this better. If you've reached this far, THANK YOU for reading!

TL; DR Is not being able to understand yourself in the circumstances that you find yourself into (being born/existing in the family/country/dynamics/society you were born/you exist into) just another characteristic of the freeze response? How do you deal with this?"
"If someone is triggering emotional flashbacks in me constantly, is it a red flag?",41,mhrtj1,18,"Or is it my doing and my own responsibility? I know this is a very generalized question, but I wonder where is the fine line of just reacting because of being traumatized, versus actually dealing with someone toxic who hides controling and manipulative behaviour behind ""good intentions""."
"Remember, it is now April Fools Day in some places so be extra wary of anything you see for the next 36 hours",260,mhir01,17,"Remember people who aren't dealing with what we are might try and do something that they think is funny that might set you off, could be a fake pregnancy announcement or something that causes your stress levels to spike, be vary wary of anything you see in the next day or so just in case. Protect your emotions and don't let assholes ruin your day/week with a stupid thing"
"Just left a traumatizing job in mental health emergency services. Now I’m unemployed, 24 years old, just feeling hopeless",8,mi15sl,2,"I’m no contact with my mom (blamed me when we lost our house and lied about it, kicked me out a week after surgery because she didn’t want to be stuck inside during the summer, hasn’t helped me financially since I was 13, expected me to dump all my money to her when I graduated and started working full time (which I can’t manage because of my cptsd) acted like I didn’t exist when she started dating abusive guys throughout my childhood,I could go on and on and on) and my dad is an abusive alcohol who is losing his apartment despite making six figures and also doesn’t help me. 

I’ve been living on less than 10k a year since I was 19. I’m starting to lose hope. I feel so depressed. The last job I had I lasted 8 months, it was a mental health respite facility. A friend knew someone who used to work there who called me and basically told me the boss there is an abusive psychopath who “takes joy in the clients struggling.” She said it’s a very traumatizing workplace and has a horrible reputation in my area for being a nightmare to staff and clients. 

I was paid barely over minimum wage, exposed to covid multiple times without being told until days after, put in one-on-one situations with aggressive full grown men who were off their meds and was told condescendingly to “do my job” when I reached out to the supervisor. Clients were section 12ed over nothing and retraumatized so much. Most of my coworkers would accuse clients of being “manipulative” and lying when they were really suffering from severe ptsd. Almost every shift someone would say “I hope they take their meds early, go to sleep and leave us alone.” I was invalided by my boss and supervisor when I asked for support around my triggers and trauma. 

My last shift is this Saturday and I just feel hopeless. The pandemic is catching up with me, the amount of retraumatization I’ve experienced at this job is flooding me now that I’m leaving. 

My housemates have been in a weird love triangle thing and things feel tense here. I woke up to a passive aggressive group text from one of them asking us to be more on top of emptying the dishes because they “can’t wash a single dish without unloading it.” I had been doing it almost daily like the whole time we’ve lived here, I cut back recently because I felt annoyed that no one else does it and this housemate unloaded it like twice and is now getting all petty about it. It’s not even a dishwasher it’s a standard size dish rack it takes five minutes. They also do nothing else around the house at all while I do a lot. It just made my mood spiral and I’m still in bed at 2 pm upset about it. I’m starting to lose hope that I’ll ever have enough money to live alone. 

I have about $7,000 in savings because of stimulus checks and saved up unemployment from last year. Otherwise I would have under $1,000 probably. My monthly expenses are around $1,000 until student loans kick in.... I am so fucking tired. So insanely tired and hopeless. I can’t even imagine myself holding down a job right now. I actually started and quit a full time job this week because I was way too stressed. Two of my housemates are in school full time and work, and one of them has a great high paying full time job (44k a year with free insurance, from an insanely rich family and still likes to act poor/complain about money and they’re not in any debt). They all have much more supportive families. I’m just barely hanging on my a thread. I’ve been calling crisis lines again. I’m just really in need of support. Does it ever get better? I just want to live alone and have money. 

I was already really anxious and afraid of the world before starting that job. Now I don’t know if I can even trust myself. I feel so adjusted to taking abuse from my family it’s like I need ten people reassuring me when it’s really happening. Like I’m a magnet for it. I’m so tired."
Would you use this service?,1,midlwe,4,"If there was a talk/text service where you could vent, ask for advice, or ideas on how to deal with your trauma, would you pay for that?

I realize therapy is an option but it is often expensive, and sometimes when I was in therapy I didn’t need a whole hour of someone just nodding their head and saying basically “that sucks” with no real action involved.

I keep wanting to start a business somewhat like this, but keep feeling like no one would be interested. 
What do you all think? Is posting on Reddit enough or would this idea be valuable to you?"
Misattunement and childhood crushes,61,mhpkku,15,"I am wondering if any of you have that feel they grew up with a chronically misattuned primary caregiver also experienced intense crushes as children, particularly at an unusually young age? I ask because I was the only child of a single mother and have recently begun really digging into the framework of developmental trauma and have recognized that my relationship with my mom very much fits the detention of misattunement: https://dictionary.apa.org/misattunement#:~:text=n.,the%20infant%20to%20feel%20understood. I also have recognized that there may be a connection between this and the obsessive, mostly unrequited, crushes I started developing even in kindergarten. Like I was looking even then for some form of connection and intimacy I was unable to access from my mom. Would be really interested to hear if this resonates with any others with a similar background."
How do I survive living with an abusive parent?,4,mi45j0,2,"How do you deal with having an abusive parent, seeing your mom/sister or brother get abused and gaslighted or blackmailed? My abusive parent is always trying to control everyone and he does this in so many ways. 

How do you live if you cant move out at this point? My entire life keeps getting ruined, time wasted, anxiety, I cant do my job and my abusive parent only controls me, always asking me to take permission before leaving the house, never showed empathy, when I talk about the issues he gaslighted me and made me feel it is all in my head, I tried in so many ways to heal our relationship but nothing worked and now I just avoid him but sometimes I feel like a prisoner. I feel like I am constantly dealing with damage he caused to other members of the family and these things he never even acknowledged or apologised for. I have a theory that he is a narcissist but I am not a professional. If anybody tries to complain or reacts he twists it and makes himself the victim. He is always intimidating everybody by constantly yelling and screaming or blackmailing or threatening that he will become violent. He was violent in the past but of course he denies he ever was. We all suffered different forms of abuse. I want to move out perhaps travel but it feels like it will be another big fight and I don’t care but how do I deal with all of this until I can leave? 

I don’t want to become bad or mean, but I want to protect my self and not let all of this ruin my day to day life, specially the anxiety and time wasted soothing the victims or myself or helping or fighting conflicting feelings of love and resentment. How do I survive? 

Side note: Sometimes I thought of killing myself but not because I want to die but simply because ever since I was a child I had to suffer this enormous non ending drama and I don’t see a way out. I am 26 and I am still yelled at, abused, mistreated and he always manipulates everyone so that I am under his control. Sometimes I fear that even If I somehow can leave, I will trapped or manipulated to stay. This has ruined my life from self esteem issues to choosing abusive or immature partners to projecting love and rushing to relationships in order to be saved. This also holds me back a lot. I am always dealing with all of this and I am left with little or no energy to work on myself or study or work or take care of my health or meet people or enjoy life. Will my life be like this forever? Because if there is no way I can actually live a normal life I really wish I am dead.

Is this all my fault? My life is falling apart? My anxiety keeps coming back, self esteem keeps falling, time and energy wasted, my whole life feels like I am trying to survive all of this. I am always sick physically and mentally and I don’t know what to do.

I feel like I am always taking care of my mom and I am raising my younger sister and I am suffering on all levels and he wont even admit it. He makes me feel its all us and he is the victim and that makes me feel like I am crazy. I love him of course but whenever I try to forgive, accept and avoid conflict with him, something else happens that makes me feel sick again. I am always going in circles."

How Childhood Trauma Leads to Addiction,128,mhloaj,6,
Does anyone else struggle to believe they can heal/grow?,7,mi1fd9,3,"Sometimes I feel so tired of trying and question if I’m capable of further meaningful growth or healing.  Part of this comes from the short term memory and focus problems caused by my cptsd, it can be so confusing sometimes.  During times of balance I feel hugely better, including in my ability to think, focus, and remember.  But I struggle to feel like I’m making progress when my suffering is as consistent as it is.

I'm also really anxious all the time now. 

One if my friends has been doing very, very badly (mentally) for weeks now, and now this friend's father was put in the hospital and was not even conscious today. And i can't be there to support them in person because it overwhelms them. So i just sit around worried all the time. 

I have no one to vent to currently. My therapist has been away for four weeks already and i will see her again at the end of next week (hopefully - they had surgery done and were gonna come back this week but had to cancel due to not feeling well enough). 

I'm feeling like I'm breaking. I can't handle anything right now. I'm really struggling to support my friend and I'm struggling with staying afloat myself.

CPTSD and Parenting,5,mi1c6y,5,"I feel like this is such a deep topic and this little rant isn’t going to even touch the surface of the issues related to trauma processing while trying to parent but here is my little hurdle of the day: 

I have a toddler. A beautiful, willful, wild child who is currently learning by testing boundaries. 

I also have a fraught relationship with feeing helpless, and the flip to that is feeling angry... not the most suitable emotion for parenting, it seems. 

A skill I’ve been given to deal with the anger/helplessness is to try and identify not what is angering me, but what is making me feel helpless; and to then take steps to regain some power. 

Logically, this is great, and can be applied to all things.. all things except irrational, developing toddlers. Screaming, hitting toddlers. There essentially walking triggers- no respect for personal space, volume up to 10 and they leave no space for your own self, it seems. Mine won’t stop pulling our elderly cat’s tail. Do I just need to let go of any notion of control? Clearly, it’s out of my hands. 😐"
"DAE consider leaving your long term partner after having dreams at night that they are cheating on you? My dreams of my boyfriend cheating are frequent and ruin my sleep. I am insecure and fearful when awake, too, but the dreams push me over the edge.",6,mhzmcd,10,"I am 25f, with my boyfriend (28m) for several years.

I wake up from bad dreams by doing any of the following: making crying sounds, actually crying, whining, growling in rage, yelling out, asking things like ""why"" or ""why would you do this"" out loud, which wakes me up.

My relationship has been rocky because of my personal issues. He has been as supportive as he can be and he is faithful to me as far as I know. In the past I have snooped thru his stuff so I'm pretty sure. 

But I do always worry he is deceiving me, lying to me, cheating on me, or that his thoughts are probably so vile I should maintain my dignity and just leave him.

The dreams are so realistic, I feel like my life is ruined when I wake up. 

I love him but I want to be free in my mind.

CPTSD fantasy and online dating making it worse?,14,mhug4t,5,"Like intense crushes on people I meet online, I think this makes it worse. Most often its toxic. The only ones that are stable are the ones who don't know a lot about me and are actually strangers. The other internet people I know a lot about such as their daily habits, same internet spaces and hobbies. 

I don't fantasize about the complete strangers, at most I have limited interactions with them and thus can't imagine them.  But with the edates they give me their real information I can"
Had a week off and I just fell apart,7,mhydj4,2,"Well that’s it I suppose. All my hopeful thoughts about how my internal dialogue is becoming more loving and curious vanished into the mist of fucking despair. The “you are always going to be alone” voice came back and it was hard not to believe it. 

I know that this is a natural part of progress, I just don’t trust my new therapist and didn’t have any social outlets available to talk to about how I woke up a different angry human than the one who went to bed. Recovery is hard."
Guilt and advice for dealing with Guilt,3,mi2cqg,3,"Holy crap the amount of guilt I feel all the damn time.  Does anyone have any advice?

For instance, I've decided that today I am going to do nothing but play video games.  Because I feel like I deserve it because Im getting my first vaccine tomorrow and am scared. While I know this is progress in some ways, how the fuck do I let go of the guilt??

All I keep thinking is how I should be looking for jobs (yay unemployment), I should be calling unemployment, I should be making sure Im productive, I should be do a million things...

I just want to let it all go for a damn day AND not feel guilty :("
Does anyone else not remember there childhood?,44,mhohnd,10,"Hey I’m new here and recently learned about how toxic my upbringing was and how much it really affects every part of my life now.  I feel so confused because most of my childhood is blank (basically since I was a baby and it starts getting clearer around mid high school) I remember a few bits and pieces but other than that it’s all gone. I don’t know how to get past it if I can’t ever remember it which is really scary. I don’t even know why I react sometimes but the most random event will send me into a full on emotional flashback and it always leaves me so confused. I don’t even know why I feel the way I do sometimes and I know it’s wrong sometimes but I just can’t get myself out of that mindset. I’m so tired of feeling crazy. Right before quarantine I was doing so good (therapy, substance free, working out, open about my emotions) and then as soon as I went home for that 7 months everything regressed. I didn’t even know how bad my life was until quarantine when my partner sat me down and told me all the stuff they had been noticing. I feel so bad for my partner having to deal with me because I know they see the most of my symptoms.

Edit:
Thanks everyone for your answers. It’s nice to relate to people. It certainly helps me feel more valid and less alone in this world"
DAE want to stay in state of deep chill far away from people?,1008,mh4niw,144,"I just want to lie in bed, in a cute cabin in a forrest with a beautiful lake view, watching funny videos, not having to talk to any humans or do any adulting. I just want to exist and feel a nice breeze and smell of the forrest, surrounded by couple of friendly deers, occasionally go and play board games with my far away neighbours. Is this so much to ask? Does anyone else feel the same?"
Does anyone have any strategies for dealing with PTSD-related psychosis?,3,mi2yro,2,"I've had troubles with auditory/visual hallucinations since I was in middle school - I learned in the last year that it probably happens because I have PTSD. Which makes sense to me, because the things I see and hear are deeply trauma related. The trouble is that hallucinating is exhausting and emotionally difficult, and it makes it hard to do anything. I've done some CBT for psychosis I found online that helped and I do take an antipsychotic medication, which helps a lot but isn't perfect. When I was younger they thought I had Schizoaffective Disorder, so I've tried plenty of medications and I know that most of them do something for me but none of them stop me from hallucinating altogether.

Work is the hardest part for me. I try not to work if I'm seeing stuff but I can't afford not to work while I'm hearing voices because it's so frequent. I've been fired from more than a few jobs for being visibly mentally ill, so I'm always anxious about it too. I know that after 14 years of dealing with this that I can generally manage to keep a straight face and act normal, but it's unbearably difficult sometimes to have the voices of people who hurt me saying degrading and threatening things in my ear, to hear the sounds of dying children, people being raped..., and at the same time talk and look like a normal person. But then I also call in sick way too much already and the truth is that if I never worked while I was hearing voices I wouldn't be able to pay my rent, or even hold down a job at all maybe.

I don't want to live like this anymore, but I don't even know if there's anything more I can do. Has anyone else struggled with this? How do you manage?"
To what extend is it ok to share things online?,2,mi5kr4,4,"Something really uhm... Triggering happened, and I took this thing to calm down, but even then, I feel this urge to explain parts of my past. Resumed. Which is usually impossible for me to do? But this time I'm being able to write down.

That said, I have a question.

The other day a doctor came to visit me and she precisely recommended me to write, draw or sing in this type of situation. But she said I must not share with anyone because they are my past.

Yet the feeling I have is the opposite, I want to share it because I feel... I want help, even though I don't know what type of help can I even get. I want someone to read it, I want people to know, many things I'm sure have crime names and I don't know them. I want to know, and I want someone out there to know, and no it can't be the doctor because I can't dirt the image of the family here it would do seriously bad. But is this good at all?? (to share about my past online I mean, being vague enough that nobody knows who I'm talking about)

What do you guys actually feel about sharing personal experiences? I think I kind of asked something similar once and someone said it helped, but is it morally fine?"
It makes me sad that no act of vengeance will give my lost childhood back to me.,7,mhwft3,3,"I’ve been feeling a lot of anger this past week. At first it was at all Catholics. Then it was at my Catholic extended family members who didn’t realize anything was wrong at my house, who I was isolated from. I want to call them and angrily ask why they didn’t care. I want to make them feel bad. I want to tell them what I have been through, and that I felt abandoned by them, and that there’s nothing they can do about it now. I’m 23 and that ship has sailed. 

But I’ve realized that that won’t make me feel better. It won’t give anything back to me. It won’t turn back the time and make them reach out more. I still won’t have had any healthy adult relationships in my childhood. And that hurts so much. It’s just not fair."

I have successfully kept my space spotless and organized for 4 days straight.,153,mhftyt,12,"I have no one to tell this to who would see it as a success and would rather see it as more of a ""big woop, come back in 3 months"" sort of thing. Many people in my life have seen me go through this roller coaster of massive cleaning, and it lasts for a day or two and just deteriorates after that; rinse and repeat.

&#x200B;

I feel myself coming out of a depressive state, and i felt a huge shift in myself when i chose to do my chores first thing on sunday instead of procrastinating until later in the day when i always lose energy to follow through with it. If i would've continued the pattern of procrastination my entire week would've been shot-- hectic, filled with overwhelming emotions and mess all around me. Instead of doing that, i cleaned my desk, got all the trash out of the room, got rid of all of the dishes that had piled up for weeks (small pile but i had been avoiding them) and vacuumed. I had the rest of the day to myself to live in the clean space! It took only a few hours but the effects of it are spreading into today and will continue to spread into the next weekend if i can keep it up, where i will have more time to do what i want instead of devoting it to catching up in my chores. I must remember that if i continue to bring down dishes as i use them, bring out trash as i use them and generally take things that are out of place and put them away that i will be less stressed and overwhelmed to complete other things that are more important than cleaning.

These are things i've told myself to do for as long as i remember. I know what i have to do, it's the following through that is hard, and i finally did it. I jumped back on the wagon after chasing it for months. Sharing it here will hopefully give me some accountability from others to continue this momentum. I even went and got my blood drawn (something i had been putting off for weeks) because of how good i felt for just being able to sit in a clean and organized space. Almost a year of therapy seems to be paying off. Feels good. Real good. I hope it continues."

Has anyone’s religious faith helped them cope?,6,mhuqd3,11,"I’ve considered myself Agnostic for as long as I can remember, but I realised yesterday/today that I do believe in Catholicism it’s just that my mum has forced her own version of it onto me for as long as I can remember- which put me off from fully trusting or opening myself up to God. Going to mass, having sacraments, praying- everything was deemed to be ‘stressful’ or ‘a chore’, and there was no purpose/meaning behind it other than ‘you have to do it because you’re a part of this family/I said so’. 

It kind of pisses me off because she says that she prays frequently and she talks about herself as being religious- yet is the main cause of my mental health problems and trauma, and still overall is kind of selfish in her actions and words (she’s a narcissist). I think it’s really sad that I’ve had such a bad role model for a faith that I do believe in, and I went to reconciliation today to say sorry for not being able to forgive her (and dad) for how greatly they’ve affected me. I love them, but I don’t think I can forgive them because they’re still the same and I feel so shit even though all the bad things that happened were ages ago.

So yeah, I guess I was just wondering if anyone’s involvement/participation in a religion has helped them manage their symptoms/feelings/thoughts? And/or helped them form/realise their identity? I feel like if done right (and if it goes well) it could bring a very needed sense of comfort and guidance. I mean God is the ultimate parental figure, right?"
DAE regress back to the worst version of themselves after seeing their abusive parents?,36,mhnpsm,4,"TW: mentions of alcoholism, abuse, eating disorder

My parents are quite older, although I am young (23f.) I am in a loving relationship with my partner and I never thought it was possible for someone to show me so much genuine care and kindness without expecting anything in return. 

Anyway, my parents live a few hours away. My dad's going through chemo, both alcoholics with untreated mental illness. Lots of yelling, manipulation, don't respect me, gas lighting, just generally treating each other so disrespectfully it makes me feel sick, you know how it is. They get soo sad not seeing me so I feel guilty and end up going to visit for a weekend here or there... 

Before I moved in with my bf a few years ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder because of the intense swings caused by my parents- fierce anger, guilt, depression, worthlessness, eating disorder, constantly sleeping, failing classes, all the bad things. Ever since I moved in with my partner it's like I'm actually sane and emotionally stable. I feel like I am a different person who is actually someone I can like... until I go to visit them.

Even just visiting for a day I find myself raising my voice at my partner in like a normal conversation without even realizing it. Thankfully he is so kind and forgiving and understands why I am lashing out and he lets me know so I can become aware of that toxic shit real quick. I end up disassociating, dropping hobbies, isolating, mistreating myself, filled with negative hurtful thoughts only towards myself believing I'm not worthy of any basic human necessities. basically hitting a massive low until after some unspecified amount of time I can pull myself back out of that ditch. Rinse and repeat every few months, it's exhausting. 

I know the correct answer is to cut them out of my life, but I just don't have the heart to do it, I cant even think about how it would make them feel... They support me passion/job wise which I'm very appreciative of and very frequently financially because of my horrific mental health, which I appreciate so much because I know barely any parents do that for their kids. Except.... financial related things has only been my since of stability and affection from them as far as I can remember. I wish I wasn't such a push over and I could set myself free of this torture for good. I feel like such a jerk for even saying these things, I feel spoiled and unworthy for the financial stability.... I just really needed to get it off my chest. Can anyone relate?"
"[TW: mention of CSA, no details] Talking about doubt and uncertainty of experiencing CSA in therapy? Can someone who has been through this too give advice?",3,mi044y,4,"My feelings of shame and being a terrible person for even thinking about the possibility that one of my parents might have abused me are weighing me down and preventing me to talk about these feelings and doubts with my therapist. 

I told my therapist that I can't tell for sure I have **not** been sexually abused. He said that growing up in a healthy family doesn't leave children with questions whether or not their parents are safe and that my feelings of not being safe at home are valid whether or not the abuse happened. 

The parent in question did something to me that I remember clearly. It makes me wonder that if they did this to me with someone (other parent) watching and they got away with it... what else could they have done? There are more 'clues' that fuel the doubt but I don't have memories of anything else besides a few (minor?) incidents which I prefer not to go into detail about. 

I am scared of making things up that may not have happened at all.

Struggling with the lack of intimacy in my life,10,mhsiox,4,"Hello!

I though this would be the right place to bring this up as I feel my childhood trauma is the main reason i struggle with loneliness/ lack of closeness and intimacy in my life. Recently I've been feeling quiet lonely and like I'm missing something, I believe its emotional intimacy. 

I'm a 20 year old male and I've been trying to talk about my feelings with one of my closer mates but its always a bit harder with guys than it is with female friends.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have advice on how to help fill this gap or heal it? (obviously the latter being a long process)

Much appreciated."
My abuser has cancer and I’m not sure what I’m feeling...,2,mi1z6o,2,"There’s a lot going on in my head, and I have a lot of feelings, I’m not sure what exactly to do or think. She took two of my human rights away, abused me for most of my life, yet I feel scared and depressed for her. I actually want her to live, why would I want that? I’m not sure about anything right now, and I just wanted someplace to say this."
I think I might have high functioning autism,4,mhx09f,9,"I was recently trying to do some research on my symptoms for cptsd and found an article about the intersection of autism and CPTSD. A lot of the symptoms of undiagnosed autism in females overlapped with my cptsd symptoms. 

The random noises I make when I feel uncomfortable, rocking back and forth in times of extreme stress, to hitting myself on the head or hitting my head off things, not liking to be touched at all, losing my ability to communicate when I feel stressed or angry (I go from a fully functioning adult to 5year old screaming tantrum really fast) I experience sensory overload where it feels like noises are much louder than they are. Involuntary muscle movements especially when I head sounds that are triggering. The list goes on, the symptoms are the same for both illnesses

Wondering if it’s possible that I may have undiagnosed autism that was overshadowed by my severe trauma history. I don’t even know where to start to find out if it’s possible that I’m 26 and may have autism that was never diagnosed. 

I’m concerned that if this is true, that I’m clearly not receiving the proper therapy that I need. Which might explain why the 30 different types of anti depressants that I’ve tried have never worked and why I’m not seeing much progress after 15 years of therapy. 

Is there a test you can take to find out if you have autism? Has anyone experienced this?"
"""I think everyone has a little bit of PTSD"" lol what",187,mhbs4o,56,"Yeah, everyone has had a traumatic experience, but not everyone has fucking c/ptsd.

Fucking annoying comment"
I'll never completely get rid of all my PTSD...,4,mhwxz6,1,"So, I still deal with Adrenaline surges. I'm no longer triggered over my past. I call that the counseling aspect. It's gone. I can think about it without any adrenaline surges.

However, anytime I'm excited over anything, good or bad. I get an adrenaline surge. My voice raises a few notches, I can't sit still, I have to move and talk. I'll feel the butterflies and some anxiety.  I don't fear it though. I let it wash over me. I allow myself to pass through me. I don't get aboard the train. 

If it persists, (say due to some conflict or something I'm unable to do anything about), I goto my goto, which is video games. I play daily for a few hours at baseline so if anything it may need to wait til then. 

But it's all good. My body knows I'm not in the trauma. It knows this is a natural response to some life event. My mind doesn't spit out crazy thoughts. It is what it is and it will pass."
It feels like I’ll never be able to afford a house and that makes me so depressed,30,mhn5mb,20,"Just saw this post, which validates things I already knew: https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/mhdudx/oc_where_have_house_prices_risen_the_most_since/

I can’t express well enough how much I just want space that I own. Just a single fucking parcel of land somewhere on the planet that is mine. Nowhere feels safe, and if I had my own refuge it would mean everything. 

I hate renting. I hate that maintenance can show up in your apartment whenever. I hate knowing someone else has the keys to my home. I hate hearing neighbors through the walls and living in a human beehive. I hate living with roommates. I’ve lived with abusive roommates, I’ve lived with roommates who are absolute slobs. It seems we all have roommates who slam doors and walk loud, a common trigger. My sister has had multiple roommates steal from her. I hate the inconvenience and uncertainty of things being moved. It might sound minor but I mean this in every way: food in the fridge, the cabinets, dishes, etc. There is something so immensely therapeutic about knowing everything will be exactly where I left it, barring natural disaster. Knowing that I own the space and am the only one who can change it. I hate hiding away in my bedroom all the time. I want quiet when I want quiet and I want to be able to blast music when I want to.

I’m going to be living minimally this year, bouncing around and living out of my car at various campgrounds because I’m so disgusted with my money being siphoned into rent. Maybe I’ll explore van life, or some day buy a tiny piece of land and building a small cabin on it, but even that is costly.

Property prices are just going up and up, more and more landlords are just adding places to their portfolio, house flipping is also trendy and just drives up costs everywhere. I can’t even find a run down house in my city to patch up at a reasonable price. Seems my only chance is to slave away at a job to save up for decades while somehow still affording rent and hope the housing market crashes again.

Not to mention how far behind I am financially, I’ve been paying rent since 18, while most of my peers have been living with their parents and saving up money. And now I need to use the little remaining savings I have for healing and therapy so I can just function. I don’t see how I can compete with that./r/

This shit just sucks y’all, I hope it gets better."
How do you stop neglecting yourself? Especially with chronical illness,2,mi1j5y,2,"I have T2 diabetes, I got diagnosed at 20 and I had pre-diabetes since I was 11. It has become apparent now after 6 years of uncontrolled diabetes that I neglect to procure medication because I feel so much shame for being diabetic. I eat carbs knowing it’s killing me, and I don’t know how to stop. I can’t make myself care to keep myself alive for the long-run. I know I’ve already shortened my life span by at least a few years with this and I want to stop. This suicidality and shame belongs to my abuser who I inherited diabetes from. When I was diagnosed my family blamed me and he called me a whale. When he was diagnosed while I was still a child I cried because I felt I was to blame for him becoming diabetic. My birth giver was a diabetic since I was 4, and somehow I’m the one who doesn’t deserve treatment, even when I was living with them their diabetes always took precedence over mine. I’m so tired of being sick and knowing where this comes from and knowing it’s not curable but “treatable”. Even when I took meds it wasn’t enough, the only way I can keep my glucose normal is by forcing myself to fast for days or eat a very strict ketogenic diet and I always end up crashing and back in the same levels and weight. I don’t know how to fix this so if anyone has advice or deals with this same issue please comment. It’s not just diabetes it’s every physical health issue I have I am so resistant to see a doctor and actually go through the full course of treatment, but diabetes is what will probably kill me at this pace."

I'm tired of feeling invalidated, of feeling like I'm invisible and that no one gives a damn."
Does my ex hate me now or forgot I exist?,0,mi5nro,2,"My addict ex and I were together for 6 months during which he asked me to marry him. But he was trauma bonded/addicted to his ex. They’re both drug addicts and he’s an alcoholic as well. Up until a few days before we broke up (when I began seeing signs of being devalued), he was as loving as usual. But I also started noticing signs of him relapsing back to her. Long story short, we ended up in a huge dramatic mess and they got back together. He hasn’t hoovered me this time like before. Does that mean he probably hates me now?"
Intrusive conversations,10,mhs6oa,6,"Does anyone else have a really hard time focusing because you’re constantly having conversations in your head trying to explain your trauma and why you are the way you are? 

Feeling that it’s less of a CPTSD specific symptom (could probably fall under intrusive thoughts though), but an indication I need to talk more about my experiences. 

Much love to everyone here!"
Does anyone else close off from someone completely after ANY red flag or trigger?,27,mhmosm,7,"I’m really, really struggling with the concept that other people are human and they make mistakes. The instant anyone hurts me at all, I feel like I mentally shut down and close off from them forever. I put up so many walls that it’s impossible for them to ever get close to me.

I never forgive, or forget. It’s like I keep a running tally in my head of all the ways people hurt me. And with each tally mark, I unconsciously close myself off from a person more and more. Even if they apologize- even if they change their behavior and actively work on improving- I never trust the person again. Sometimes I just dissociate from them completely, become emotionally distant/ monotone, or I feel complete apathy towards them. Sometimes I even forget everything about them (as my dissociative disorder comes into the mix).

But I’m worried that sometimes I may end up prematurely freezing out people who are actually ok or relatively healthy (although not perfect) friends. I’m a little trigger-happy (pun-intended) when it comes to pushing people away. I think this response probably stems from fear- essentially everyone I’ve ever been even slightly close to (family, friends, etc.) has hurt me. 

But my therapist has explained that even a healthy or trustworthy friend will likely make mistakes / display at least one red flag at some point over the course of the relationship, and that it may not be grounds for instant termination of the relationship every time.

How can I distinguish an ok/ healthy person with a red flag/ who has hurt me from an abuser who will hurt me more? I genuinely have no idea. I seem to react to everyone as if they were an abuser.

Is anyone else in a similar position?"
How do you think about and perceive being present and conscious without getting freaked out about the concept of even existing and having a mind?,7,mhsk12,3,DAE experience this? It's really hard to explain. Whenever I try to ground myself and stay in the present and actually experience it I always end up freaking out because I become aware that I have a conscious and a brain at all  and then everything just feels very scary and unreal. Is this is a C-PTSD and dissociation thing or is there something wrong with my brain?

I’m off to see my parents this weekend for Easter. I have a lot of feelings. So I was going to try and prepare a little kit for me to use - something travel size really.

I feel fucking pathetic. I feel vulnerable and anxious - remembering all the times I felt alone and had to care for my mom when she was high on drugs. She once lit the arm of the couch on fire when she dipped out on heroin and I had to put it out. Must have been 10. Then she lit herself on fire and I saw all of it.

The image is attributed to something called the ""Telos Project,"" which I guess is a religious organization or something - I am honestly not really sure and that isn't something that I personally care about in regards to this specific post. Maybe this post ""makes sense"" in the ""context"" of the religion but even in that generous interpretation it still comes off to me as upsetting to me.

The reason I scrolled back up to read this was because I guess it just took a second for it to sink in what it was saying. Someone who's isolated is ""not a real person?"" I suppose this hurts so much because I in fact do not feel like a ""real person"" often because I am isolated. But it is not like I choose to feel isolated. I feel isolated even when I am around others. 

As for ""a real person is someone who lives in and for others,"" besides this sounding like a meaningless aphorism, still manages to come across as also... maybe to call this specific claim ""offensive"" is too far, but it is ignorant and judgmental in my opinion. I spent a long time living ""for"" someone else and all that did was make me less of a ""real person"" than I felt I was before. Again, in a generous interpretation maybe this is saying something like ""Be kind to others, see yourself in them"" or something (although even this is still vapid). But to use the words ""real person"" is just upsetting to me like I said.

I don't know. The shared post by my ""friend"" got like 7 likes. idk how many likes the original post has because I don't really want to engage with it. But I doubt it was liked by tons and tons of people. This seems like a small organization. I don't really think they were trying to phrase this in a hurtful way, but it nevertheless hurts to have someone else call me (even if not personally) not a ""real person"" for something I don't feel like I can control. 

I really wish I could just ignore this kind of stuff. I feel like I used to be able to, even in the early days of my trauma, but as time as gone on and I have grown older (I'm 24) I am growing more, not less sensitive to this sort of thing. How can I get back to that? To being able to not get upset by something like this? Am I just trending in the totally wrong direction with healing? Because it feels that way at this point."
It's my birthday tomorrow,27,mhkq6v,22,"I've felt ""off"" all week-- sensitive to rejection, self-conscious, awkward in my body. Today I finally realized that it's because I associate birthdays with feeling like a burden, and like I'm too much trouble to celebrate. I'm so many years away from those experiences in my youth, but on days like this it's so hard to shake the feeling that no one wants me.

Has anyone been able to cheer themselves up from birthday ennui? I don't have the gumption right now to coordinate an event, but I want to be more proactive than just sitting in this sadness."
(Bit of a rant) About to get treatment in a month but now I feel completely fine and feel like I don’t need it,7,mhqonk,14,"Now I’m about to get help, I feel like it’s not necessary. Even though when I look at all the facts, and if that was the case for someone else, I would definitely say they need the help. 

But I feel fine now. Or maybe I’m confusing it with numbness. I’ve been feeling bad for a week or two after realizing it’s probably cPTSD, but now not anymore. It’s probably because I’ve been resorting to my coping mechanisms (bulimia/maladaptive daydreaming), but still. Man I don’t know what to make of this. I’m just scared of change I think."
“Stuck it up” and “get over it”. Everyone gets upset about people who say that and claims that “mental health doesn’t work that way”. Which hypocritically is exactly what therapists do.,57,mhf5qs,19,"They may pay lip service to guidance, insights and “teaching new skills” but the vast majority of their actions say otherwise. Their preferred method of mindfulness, CBT or DBT makes things worse?  Well then you just need to “work” and get over your resistance because nobody else has ever had negative side effects from it.  Very few therapists will even admit that they can do harm.  Paid wall stand in method and superficial empathy doesn’t do much other then acting as an expensive form of journaling.  

Ask for something else?  Well now you need a higher level of care as community mental health’s “trauma informed care” is just a dbt course and cbt counselling.  Oh but you’ll have to pay out of pocket at $200 per week?  Can’t afford it?  Well, why don’t you just work really hard and save up? You’re just being resistant and not taking those “options” that were given to you when you say that all your addition income is currently being spent on the physical illness you are fighting.   That is essentially saying “too bad” just get over it.  

Want another clinician because you got matched with another incompetent therapist?  Nope, apparently letting you see someone else is just a waste of resources.  Turns out the “ability to change therapists” that the front desk told you about really means “come back in three years and then we’ll see”. Day treatment?  Well no, the clinic is basically online and you need a private internet connection that can support 5+ hours of video conferencing so they just discharge you if you can’t afford that. 

Oh and when you run out of money and are now broke because you dropped a couple grand on therapy that did absolutely nothing?  Insurance only covers three sessions which are basically spent “getting to know you” or therapist shopping?  They then tell you to “maybe get a better job” or “read a self help book”.  Great, except apparently the dissociative disorder, c-ptsd and other general illnesses I have are hindering my career and life as well.  Why do they think I sought help in the first place?  

Bad therapy cause you trauma?  Well now you just have to “get over it” and seek help from another therapist in a field where therapeutic harm isn’t talked about, very few therapists know the negative effects of their methods and even fewer use any sort of feedback metrics to check their biases.  And hope that the next therapist who does the exact same thing will somehow be different.  Then repeat the cycle when you inevitably do get harmed.  

Suicidal because you have no other options left?  Well call the crisis line who will basically do nothing but suggest “DBT” and to distract yourself.  Which doesn’t work as a long-term strategy. They actually can’t refer you or anything because of previous reasons, but just give a pep talk on “how you need to stand up for yourself in the system” without any actual information on how to do that.  So basically, they expect you to magically get over issues.  Ironically, the police who came were more aware of the flaws in the mental health care system then actually paid mental health care professionals – at least said cops acknowledged that the system was broken and apologized to me.  It’s a new level of sad when members from a goddamn police force are more self aware and kind to a WOC then the people “helping”. 

Attempt suicide?  Well, they’ll basically put you in a hold and pump your stomach then discharge you.  They will just keep your body alive, you’re still expected to “get over” any mental health issues magically and actually live.

At least when the average layman says “get over your issues”, they are open about it. Some of those laymen became more helpful then the vast majority therapists as I started to ask them how they “got over it” and it turned into them at least hugging me and offering to come help me complete tasks.  Mental health professionals, however, hid behind a “I can help you”/”sucking it up doesn’t work” lip service yet in reality, they will essentially resort to that the moment you are not an ideal client or don’t actually have anymore money."
"Thinking of finding a new therapist, am I acting out/wrong?",1,mi1ou2,4,"Before this therapist, I worked with another for 3 years and left because I stopped being religious, and she was a religious-based counselor, and so that wasn't working anymore.

I started with the psychoanalyst I have now immediately after leaving my first therapist and also while I was going through a horrible, horrible, really painful breakup. I told her I wanted to find a way to build up my self-worth so that I could avoid being in such a painful relationship scenario again, hopefully. It is with her that I was told I had CPTSD, and I recognize that I do. However, I'm currently upset and thinking I need to get out of therapy with her because I've realized she hasn't really given me tools to deal with it and I also don't feel that she helped me process my childhood in a way that makes me understand it or myself and how it's affecting me today. For example, here we are over 2 years later and I'm still in a weird on and off scenario with the ex who I was going through the breakup with. In our last few sessions I've brought up how frustrating for me that is. I feel I haven't changed at all. I'm still doing the things I've always done and I don't know why and I don't know how to change. She just keeps telling me it takes time and to have self compassion. Those things aren't wrong, but they also arent' helpful when I'm quickly declining. I've been crying almost every day for the past month until the point that I throw up, which is way worse than I've ever been before. Today when I was pushing her on why I am still unable to fully break things off with this guy and was asking her why she didn't teach me about attachment theory, why I had to find it on the internet then read books about it. That I know somehow this guy and the relationship between my parents is related but we rarely really deeply talked about it. She kept saying things like ""But now you see that I'll support you in whatever you want"", which by that she means she was supporting me in trying to get back together with this guys because it's what I wanted, but I feel that it was her job to see that it was an unhealthy want driven by patterns and experiences and feelings that I didn't know about at the time. I think it's scary that she would encourage and support me in trying to get back together with someone who she also says molests me just because that's what I felt I wanted. I feel she has done very little to teach me or talk with me about deserving better. She talked a lot with me about having compassion for him and the hard childhood he had too and it just made me over and over again want to forgive him and give more chances and believe he would change and made excuses for how he treated me because I felt bad for him. At one point she told me ""Yes, it's hard, but he's getting better and all you can do is be there for him"". I guess because I did want to be there for him, but I guess I'm just conflicted on her encouraging me to think someone who hurts me is changing and that I should be there for him when he hasn't changed at all. Of course, today she is like ""I thought we did talk about it relating to your parents? Am I supposed to remind you of how it's connected when you start telling me you want other things like you feel like you love him and want him?"" And I guess in my mind that yeah I think she should've reminded me. I don't think her saying it once was enough for me to understand it and especially when she turns right around and basically supports me in staying with him by spending sessions helping me to maintain my anxiety around the situation of the relationship, but never helping me see it's a relationship I shouldn't be in. And today too she was like ""Well I don't think you should be with him. I think he's getting worse. Do you want me to tell you what to think?"" And I don't want her to tell me what to think, but I do want her to help me make informed decisions by learning about myself. 

However, now I can't tell if this is all something I've misunderstood or created or somehow a wrong interpretation of mine. Maybe I should talk with her more to try to work it out between us. Or maybe I should start over with someone else? I feel like I'm dying. She said today she thinks the treatment is working, but if it is why am I emotionally/physically worse? Why am I still in contact with the same person I was trying to be more detached from? I can't tell what is my fault and what I'm not understanding and where the breakdown is happening. I don't want to lose a good therapist just because I push people away, but I also have been gaslit so much I can't tell when I am right or wrong for getting the idea to run."
Sick of feeling like a perpetual child,15,mhn4gk,4,"I saw a photo of a girl who lives in my city on Instagram. She was wearing a super cool, semi sexy outfit, nothing outlandish but she was clearly going out to celebrate her birthday. She looked awesome! I don’t know her personally, just like her style and was about to scroll past when I realized we’re the exact same damn age and now I can’t stop thinking about it. 

I was raised super fundie Christian, and I would feel like an IDIOT in an outfit that showed my body. Like a kid playing dress up. My brain has me in such a bizarre, stupid limbo. On one hand, I was extremely parentified by my own parents and was always ‘mature’ for my age (you all know what that means lol). But on the other, I’m so disconnected from my body from the years of various religious cults driving it into my brain that my body is not my own. 

Does anyone else here feel like they’re not actually a part of their own peer group? Like the things that come with being in a certain age bracket aren’t open to them, for no logical reason? For me, this innocuous post really drove home just how juvenile I still see myself as for some reason, and now I don’t really know what to do with that information."
"I just contacted several of my old, good friendships that I lost contact with after my trauma came into my life like a tidal wave. I am struggling, but this felt like a victory!",5,mhrl1d,2,"Here's to life! To freedom! To redemption! FUCK anyone who says ""you've got to learn to live with it"". Hell no! The only thing I've got to do is tirelessly work on total, utter redemption from my conditioning. It is doable. It is the only thing that really matters. 

Everything else will fall into place once I am at inner peace"
"The consequences of not addressing PTSD can be dire. Original trauma leads to poor life choices, which significantly increasing the chances of repeated traumas, as well as, poor health outcomes.",65,mhdq33,20,"If you do not believe this statement, please view my reddit cover photo. That was the result of living with and not fully addressing my trauma(s).

Someone tell me this is going to be okay? Leaving toxic parent for the fourth time.,2,mhw3wp,4,"My mother is toxic. She and I had a ridiculously codependent relationship for most of my life. I ran away from home when I was 14 because I couldn't handle her shit anymore- literally. She was a disassociating mess with years of unresolved trauma that she refused to deal with which made it so that it was impossible to know who exactly you'd be dealing with at any time. This was extremely unnerving and also caused some pretty extreme behaviors that were unsuitable for a child to be around. 


When I was older, she had dealt with the craziness that her disassociation had created in her life, and she apologized and was accountable for this, so I came back home to go to university because cash was gonna be tight. Our relationship fell back in to being codependent until I realized what that meant when I got sober 3 years afterwards. I tried to get her to see it, but she couldn't, so as soon as school was done, I moved away. 


She crashed and burned. I crashed and burned as she crashed and burned because I couldn't handle her crashing and burning. (My issue- not hers, I am aware.) She got a therapist. I got a therapist. With rent so expensive, we moved back in together- this time in my place, and it worked well enough for a year or so... mostly because, like with school, I wasn't home much with work. It got even worse when she stopped working with her therapist while I got more and more healthy working with my therapist, staying sober, and making strides in all areas of my life. The healthier I got, the more I had to deal with the mean, petty, and manipulative parts of her. I had no clue who was going to be walking through the door any time she crossed a doorway. It also came out that, from the time I was born until I was 8, when we visited my grandparents, she had sat upstairs drinking tea with her MIL while I was sent downstairs with my grandfather who had molested all of his kids- and she damn well knew about this the hundreds of times I got sent down there. The best part was when I had to tell her I had been molested FOUR TIMES before she would remember I had told her... which, fine, disassociation sucks for that, but if you know that you disassociate, maybe don't get mad at the person reminding you that you've been told?? Fuck me, right? Sigh. 

All of this coupled with how I ended up developing CPTSD to the point of being debilitated after aaaaaanother trauma in adulthood, I had enough. I was at a point in my life where I had to take care of myself, and I couldn't keep caring for someone who would, amongst everything else, guilt trip me when I wouldn't give her the insane amount of undivided attention she wanted and then gaslight me when I called her on it. 


I left home until the end of my lease which was 8 months down the road. I continued to pay for my lease there because she refused to allow me to sublet it which I accumulated debt for because I had to pay rent at the place I was staying at. I didnt have it in me to fight. I was that desperate to GTFO of there. And she and I made strides in our relationship. She was doing therapy (supposedly) and going to 12 steps (supposedly) and doing everything right (supposedly) and she stopped asking me how to handle her job, bills, taxes, everything. She was respectful and considerate. She was back to being the mom I loved and respected. I was thrilled. And should have kept it that way.


In the months after I left, she ended up needing a finger amputated, and my guilt kicked in to high gear because it was somehow my fault for not being there to force her to go to a doctor... even though she's been a full time social worker in management for over a decade. Yep. She also found out she was going to need two surgeries with an 8 week healing period for each, so I figured (foolishly) that I should move her back in with me until the surgeries were done. We made a deal that we would keep working on  ourselves and stay accountable. Found a place that she and I both liked, and we tried again.


Seven months later, I'm now looking at moving again- the third time in a year and a half, and I am fucking PISSED. Like. I should've fucking known better. She's just as bad, if not worse, than when we last lived together. She's not seeing anyone regularly. She's postponing surgeries. And I feel like such a fucking idiot. There's NO way that I can just up and fucking run right now because I can't afford the two places, but I'm just so fucking done. 


So. Yeah. I can afford to double pay for a couple months, so I'm only stuck here for another 3, but I honestly have no idea how to get through this. I am SO angry that I've spent my 12 adult years on this fuck of a person... for what? I'm shaking any time she's home- just waiting for the next panic attack she triggers... which she does on purpose...  or the next careless thing she does like leaving dark chocolate on the stairs for some goddamn reason that sent my dog straight to the vet with a $400 bill to follow and it's bullshit. ""I just forgot you have a dog."" Why would you leave chocolate on the stairs anyway?!? Sometimes wonder if she doesn't do shit like this on purpose... Honestly? She probably does. That shit happens so often. Then she forgets when she flips or she says she forgets. It's ridiculous. But. Whatever, I guess. 

I'm looking forward to having my own little place even if its a shit hole. Just gotta get through 3 months of being unsure of where I'm going to be living. Fuck around. Guess I needed practice with distress tolerance and not avoiding shit anyway....... fuck. "
"Looking for help, understanding and feeling vulnerable and lost af",3,mhtogm,3,"Hey guys,

In advance, sorry if this is long. I'm just looking for some help, or some people to talk to this about because I really don't feel like I have anyone around that I can trust or who will understand me; therapists included, and I just want to understand a bit more

I only recently discovered CPTSD after my therapist recommended that I should do the Safe Sound Protocol and after looking into it, it lead me here. I have a lot of doubts, and also want to understand if this is something that I might be affected by. I also am not sure if I have some sought of trauma that warrants this... Or even if how I feel is valid. I have no idea, and to be honest I'm just really confused and looking for help.

After reading the symptoms, I can relate to a lot of the such as lack of emotional regulation such as anger (explosive, easily triggered) relationship difficulties, trust issues, I always jump when there is a loud noise, anxious and tetchy and a lot of sadness inside. I was once diagnosed with tendencies towards BPD but I really feel like that's not it.   
I can say that I don't have many or any fond memories of my childhood.

And finally, I just feel like it will never go away, I just want to feel calm, safe, happy... and I guess like a belong or feel loved."
Has anybody else experienced this sort of hypocrisy? Esp amongst professionals?,22,mhjxsu,5,"Granted, this is far more common in the poverty bracket—public health/mental health systems, but the professionals talk so much about having self-worth and self esteem, advocating for yourself, etc. But the second You try to do it with them, there’s pushback and they start to say things like, “you’re not special” and think I’m trying to ask for special treatment when I’m just trying to get my basic needs met. I don’t think I’m better than anybody, but I also can’t at all accept the way things are. The horrible, negligent sort of care they give (or don’t give, rather). I think everybody should get their needs met. The only reason it looks like I’m asking for exceptions and wanting special treatment is because they treat people like shit. And I know I’m worth more. How can you possibly expect people to get better and actually have self worth if your actions don’t follow through. You can say it all day long, but if you don’t back it up, your words are emptier than your souls. And they’re all complicit. They act like god made these rules and nothing can be changed. What a crock. Humans created this mess. Humans can fix it. They just don’t care enough to. I wish people could see that the pandemic should prove a lot of their points wrong— YES change CAN happen quickly, if you want it to. YES you CAN change laws and make exceptions. Too bad only stuff like that happens when the rich/powerful are effected."
Childhood trauma and addiction,6,mhqjf9,1,
I slipped up and told my parents about my upcoming adventure,4,mhs3on,2,"I was going to keep it a secret but I had just finally paid off all my debt and was excited about budgeting to take a dream trip I've longed to go on for a decade. I wanted to go on a cross country road trip to see a part of my country that I'd like to live. I do better in dry heat, and I kept not having money or waiting for things like surgeries that never happened, never visiting, much less moving. Using it as an excuse not to look for long-term love, bc I want to find a partner(s) when I settle down. I was invited on this trip, at least partially paid for by others I trust, who are moving and want me to go on this adventure with them. I trust them. My parents screamed at me for half an hour when  I told them. They don't want me to go because I live on disability and only people who work for a living should go on trips. That my mom accompanied me to a city to look at grad school and I decided not to go (she left me in a park at night after picking a fight, and I had to call my bf to use his iphone to tell me how to get back to the hotel. I was a young, disabled woman at night in a strange city in a park. THAT'S what I remembered about THAT trip. That my mother was so mad at me she left me to be preyed upon.)  My parents want me to move to this part of the country sight unseen, only after accepting a professional job that's ""good enough."" They give me money (which is why I was proud to tell them I paid off my debt) so they think they can tell me how to spend it. but this money is from a car accident settlement. these people who invited me asked me where I wanted to go and I started daydreaming and they extended their trip to accomodate me and im spiraling with guilt and shame. They don't want me to pay that much. They just want me to have fun. I haven't decided how much I will pay them..max $1000 but its not enough to justify. I want to finally start painting and give them paintiings and gemstones for the trip, bc they like those. I feel myself regressing into a little girl and cannot speak and I lost  my appetite again. I was never going to tell my parents about the trip, and I was right. All the joy is gone. 

And before people ask, I know these people and I trust them and I will pay what I can. We are part of a spiritual community and my bf is part of their ""family."""
"What’s causing it, schizoid or PTSD?",3,mhtfu6,8,"My psychiatrist told me I’m borderline schizoid (3 out of 7 traits. You need 4 for it to count as a disorder) and that I have complex post traumatic stress without the disorder part.

The problem is I can’t tell whether the worst of my symptoms is caused by CPTSD or Schizoid disorder. Or both.

I have anhedonia + depression. The lack of feelgood chemicals makes me feel like I’m losing my mind, so then I have lie under my duvet for 1-2 hours to “prevent insanity” + regulate my freeze response.

I also have intense avolition, which makes me not want to do anything, and want to ‘hibernate.' A vicious cycle.

—

Do I need to wait for my antidepressant + EMDR to start working to treat the numbed emotions/anhedonia? Or do I need to ask for an anti-psychotic like Abilify to treat the Schizoid symptoms? 

I asked the same question to my psychiatrist and he said ""we need to discuss options.""

I can’t go on like this much longer, but I’d rather ask people with knowledge and experience then potentially wait weeks to discuss things with my psych. 

Please advise."

"Has anyone had a huge swing in their interests or change in their identity? I'm wondering what's disassociation, and what's me, or what could be me.",2,mhvc29,6,"I spend a lot of my time with hobbies that keep me indoors, gaming, reading, spending time here in reddit and these kind of things. I know to some degree I do it to disassociate, and it makes it hard to know if it's what I truly enjoy, or what my identity really is. I know a lot of it was there before my CSA, most of it is just more extreme.

I'm just here wanting to hear if anyone has had the experience of completely changing their identity in this way, starting to hike a lot, or so dance, do martial arts or sport, become a painter or really just any change that has felt very much a 180 degree turn in personality or identity. And what this meant, if it was something that was positive, or permanent or if it was some kind of grass is greener ideal? I'm debating turning a new leaf and just trying on a new identity, I'm afraid of going through life having not seen if I'm someone else. But I'm also afraid of spending time away from the things I enjoy."
Did I just score a victory for myself or make everything worse for someone else?,2,mhzuil,4,"Ok this is gonna be a long one, so sorry in advance but I could use some support today. 

When I came home today my mom was sitting in the kitchen, fully aware that I would be walking through the door to make dinner at this time of the day and perfectly positioned, crying and wimpering that she was so afraid of life and begging me for help. 

She has done that repedetly in the past whenever something changed or she had to go to a routine health check or whatever. So nothing new to me. 

For a little context she parentified me ever since I can remember, made me hate my dad because he is such a egoistic and cold person (he is not btw) and told me I was an unlovable, cold person whenever I wouldn't be able to solve the problems she had. 

And I never could. Admittably she is struggeling with her mental health herself, but she is not interested in getting better. I suggested going to therapy several times, gave her options to solve problems, told her my honest opinion, or sat down for hours to research something she needed while working and being in grad school because she was mentally not capable to do the work herself. I also suggested self help groups but, mind you, ""I don't want to listen to other people whining about their problems"". 

NOT TODAY!! I know that the problem she had is real this time, but I am emotionally exhausted and I know that I can't keep this up. So I told her what I was thinking once. Then I turned to start cooking and only responded with a ""hmmm"" for the rest of the conversation. She started crying more because I don't care about her and ended the conversation with asking me wether she upset me or not. Perfect timing for guilt tripping and making me feel like a jerk. 

I am a bit proud that I will now invest the energy in trying to comfort mysef and not her, but I also feel like the worst daughter in this world. I am shaking and feel like vomiting but I can not change her situation and I can't make her stop feeling like she does. I could comfort her but then I would intangle myself in that net again. I don't want to feel like I am a bad person that only takes anymore but I will break myself if I fall for her manipulation one more time. 

So to anyone who read to the end, thank you! I need to get this of my chest and I would greatly apprechiate some words of advice wheter or not you think I did the right thing or just hurt someone who is also struggeling."
Just: Thank You,85,mh9r26,7,"Thank you to all those who have made such positive contributions to this sub. I’ve been lurking for weeks and have learned and healed so much. Just from reading your postings and the compassionate responses. 

I’ve been in therapy for decades, have had more autoimmune and mental illness diagnoses than I’d care to admit, but I think it all boils down to early trauma and CPTSD. 

What really brought it home for me was when my mother dropped off something three weeks ago. After she left, I literally vomited. My blood pressure was 210/90, which is not good, even for someone with high blood pressure.

I'm trying to not fight my feelings and feel them instead,15,mhkp3a,1,"It's hard, but it seems to be helping. giving myself permission to be sad, to be angry, to be whatever it is I'm feeling has been helping. I can't get rid of them, but accepting them as part of me instead of beating myself up for not being perfect has been helping more than I figured it would. I think I owe a lot of therapists an apology. I wasn't allowed feelings growing up. If I was sad, I had no right to be sad. If I was happy, how dare I be happy? It's made it hard to even acknowledge I have feelings, let alone that they're okay to have and that I'm entitled to them. I don't have to be perfectly pleasant 100% of the time and that's not just okay, that's normal. No one is perfectly happy all of the time.

You rejected the anger you were force-fed and made an active choice to never be like the people who hurt you, even though it's hard, even though you're burdened and suffering with pain that has never been your fault. I am so proud of you and love you so much for that.""

Maybe reading this will help you too, and if you're not ready to say these things to yourself yet, well, I will be your mom now too."
Can anyone else neatly divide their life into phases of “fight” and phases of “flight” with little to no memory of anything else?,1,mhxy8w,1,"Once I learned about the idea that all coping strategies, good and bad, are simply “fight or flight” type responses to a perceived threat, I immediately realized that I have basically always been existing one way or the other.

For weeks, sometimes months at a time, I am *on my shit.* All responsibilities, self care and goal oriented pursuits are accomplished, and I am telling everyone around me about how everything is different now, and I’m so much better and happier. It’s never felt sustainable, though, it’s always such a hustle and grind that eventually I wonder how on earth anyone could go on like that on a regular basis. 

Fast forward another month, and I am the exact opposite. Any and all addictive/numbing behaviors become overwhelming and all-consuming. Even in the moment, it feels like running and hiding. Negative, cluttered thinking leads to a cluttered living space and I spiral socially, physically and emotionally. Eventually, I hit a “bottom” and elect to overhaul everything, which leads back to the other side. 

Only in rare occasions can I ever remember not existing one way or the other. Am I doomed to be perpetually amygdala-activated? Is there always going to be something to sprint towards or away from?"
Just need to get this out,18,mhj9po,2,"A person I follow on another platform, who is in the Army, asked specifically for any guys who had experienced sa/r while in the Military. (Sa/r in the Military is known as MST, Military Sexual Trauma). I was one of only 7 that responded, after 4 hours.

I asked if she wanted active members or can they be Veterans too? Since only 1 of the other 6 responded that they would talk to her. The others were like “they knew a guy once, in another State, at another base, maybe who been raped. 

So, I thought maybe I could provide some good Intel for her. Why did I think that? She said no, only Active Military.  So I told her “Okay”.  Guess she’ll get what she needs from only 1 responder. 

Maybe next time someone asks, they will want to hear my story too. But maybe I will do as I normally do, keep quiet. That’s safest thing anyway."

Holding myself accountable,1,mhxi0v,1,"Howdy,
I have had a very, very long day. And it's the beginning of a very very long month. By the end of the month I have some big decisions to make and make sure these decisions are solid ones.

In January I had a transformative moment in my life where it changed me for the better, and part of that meant me needing to be accountable. Me needing to understand I cannot run away, deflect or get defensive with my problems. If I am having an issues I need to work them out, work through them, or talk about them. 

Yesterday me and my partner whom I love had some issues. He was worried I'm not holding myself accountable because I do dip sometimes and I made a big decision and I'm not sure if I worked out this decision making properly.

How do I make big decisions while keeping myself in mind, whilst also being accountable and not running away from my problems? I cannot tell if I'm finding stuff to use as a way to escape a situation when it can be worked out or if I'm inclined to actually use that as something fine to use."
Being Needed Scares Me,13,mhk1ca,3,"Does anyone else have this experience?

If I just float around, am a flash in the pan, come for a good time then leave, I am more at ease and feel more comfort than if I am a permanent feature. I'm getting older, and coming into a time in my life when I need more permanent things, more permanent people, but somehow this being needed - it makes me anxious. I have a lot of experience moving people around, I'm a great coach and motivator, mediator, but having to take on these roles exhausts me. Drains me. Takes me back to a time when those were the skills that helped me survive.

Can anyone relate? How the skills that saved them are now these huge assets that they don't really want?

I want company, connection, but also I just want to be left alone"

file under: I hate it here,6,mhnsvc,4,"I hate it in my body. I hate it in my head. I hate that the more aware I am of my trauma and triggers, the harder and heavier it all feels. I don’t know. It’s just that when I was just high functioning on survival mode it was like yeah every day was miserable but weirdly enough it was like this idea that someday it wouldn’t always be so but now that I’m fully aware of how deep CPTSD runs, and aware of the amount of energy and work it takes my brain and body to just be present to go outside to pick up the mail or get groceries without triggering all these parts. It’s bizarre but it’s honestly like I don’t know how I managed to do those same basic tasks 5-10 years ago while I was still living with abusers and in a toxic environment. It’s like I don’t trust myself or life to move myself to get out of bed without it feeling unsafe. Then I can’t take the steps to brush my teeth without that feeling unsafe. And I know it’s irrational. And that’s the thing. That I know where it stems from. I’m aware of it, but I guess this is where I feel like doom. This is my sentence. A lifelong sentence of hoper vigilance and inner critic mouthing off in my head, my body trapping itself in past traumas over analyzing every action and detail and word of mine and others to avoid more gaslighting. And there’s no book or science that tells me it’s ever going to be easy. And I’m resentful that I was denied a sense of safety since and as a child that now in my bloody mid 30s I’m struggling every single day to parent myself to learn how to self soothe and feel safe to feel and be safe and to just breathe. It’s not fair. And it just is. The world keeps spinning. The sun will rise again tomorrow. The trauma remains. I remain, me."
"A ramble about my experince, context warning for CSA.",5,mhogd2,5,"Just another warning to be safe, don’t read this if you are effected by CSA. It gets graphic. Rape is talked about in detail.





When I was a child I was molested and raped by a “family” member, Repeatedly. I lived in an awful combination of fear and depression, and in an absolute blur.

My mind repressed the memories of the rapes even moments ever they had happened. I remember being in my room and feeling my anus gaping wide enough for me to draw air into my rectum, but at the time I had no idea how i was able to do it. 

My first consensual sexual experince with a male was in highschool, a guy who I will call J1. We started by hanging in the woods, and just touching each other. After a little while we got down to buisness and I performed oral sex on him. At this point I had not recovered my memories but I still felt a strong feeling of “I’ve done this before”, and this at a time in my life when I could not identify when I was depressed or anxious.

 He wanted to preform anal sex on me, and I consented to it. When he penetrated me everything in my mind went pitch black, the outside world didn’t exist anymore. I begged him “stop stop!” And he did without hesitation. This was to me my first serious set of flashbacks. When I was performing oral sex on J1 it reminded me of my childhood home, my mind was drawn back home the entire time.



We broke up later over unrelated conflicts.


My next partner was a sweet boy who I’ll call birch.

He was my “first” in terms of having sex to completion (from my understanding at the time).

It was pretty awful, frankly. My mind snapped between the real world and that same pitch black, and I wanted to stop but couldn’t bring myself to tell him. So I allowed him to continue. 

Later on we were in his room, Mabye a month after, and I was performing oral sex on him (as he requested). He finished in my mouth and instructed me to swallow it, so I did. The taste was familiar, it didn’t feel new at all.

Another time I allowed him to finish on my face, and this again felt like old news. 



It wasn’t untill spring of 2020 when I got my memories back, and i wasn’t ready. My flashbacks would last hours on end, and I was a wreck. I tried to convince myself that it was a babysitter who had raped me, my minds way of protecting me as I was still living at home with my abusers, including my rapist. Had I known who it was I would have murdered him, and I still feel the urge to do it. I won’t kill him because I know it won’t do me any good.


So that’s the story of how little Shenya had her life ruined, little autistic trans girl going from happy and kind to bitter and depressed. I would sooner count the grains of sand by the river than count the times I wanted to commit suicide.

He ruined my life so that he could get off, and I’m healing in spite of that monster. I’m way better now, and I’m hopeful."
My therapist said my brain works the same as the military veterans she treats,141,mh40e8,18,"She said I disconnect/ignore emotional stuff and am fully functional to complete tasks that need to get done.  I also go towards danger and accept physical pain if I have a reason to.  

Pretty interesting.  Hahaha. I have no military experience.  Just childhood torture.  The punishments I endured in childhood are classified as torture by our government, and the military actually trains special forces how to handle these things in case they are captured."
DAE experience massive overwhelm from any academic assignment?,142,mh3v8p,63,"I have a few deadlines coming up shortly, but whenever I have to sit down to write, my freeze response kicks in, and I'm unable to put anything down on paper. Having a clear structure helps to some degree, but my brain seems to be quite aware of the difference between making some notes just for myself and actually producing something for others to see and this is where the self-doubt becomes unbearable and any structure or argumentative line I've had in mind before just fades away 🙁

I just want it all to be over. i'm in so much pain trying to live and be normal"
I sure wish there was a way...,7,mhl8ue,1,"I sure wish there was a way to say ""I'm sorry that my CPTSD causes me to withdraw for survival a few times a month"" without sarcasm in my tone.

People don't understand that at some level I'm fighting for physical, mental, and/or emotional survival when I do that. I never asked for panic attacks or being diagnosed with CFS, OCD, ADD, IBS, and a non-apnea sleep disorder... all vying to take me out at any moment.

And the need to unplug and sleep 20hrs a day once-in-while is a bad thing?

The indifference to how hard it truly is for so many throughout the world saddens and frustrates me. I'm sure my CFS is the obvious result of 50+ years of undiagnosed CPTSD. The body can't survive extended neurologic takeovers like that for more than a few decades; depending upon the intensity of coping mechanism someone needs to employ.

And often by no conscious fault or choice of our own.

I was a workaholic and it fried my circuits by the age of 50. I also kicked ass for nearly 40 years as an IT Manager as the result of my ""defects"". I performed just how the system taught me to.

And I don't see any way off this train gracefully.

We only get to pick only one at a time:

1. Work
2. Retire wealthy (that ship sailed)
3. Live on welfare (in one or more of the many forms) 1 Year of disability rocked while it lasted but that ship sailed too because everyone thinks I'm faking it or just being lazy.

So, work is my only option. I've become the statistic who lived paycheck to paycheck too long, regardless of how big the paycheck got.

It's now time to plug back into the Matrix, and I'm dreading it.

Not that I don't want to, had a great run for several decades. I now fear I'll never get back to full-time work. A few hours a day is all I've got the bandwidth for, but I still push to try and do full days to be more productive and experience more of life. But it always comes with a price. Some internal pressure valve goes off and I have to stop everything, regardless of consequences (jobs, friendships, social groups).

Anyway, guess I just felt like rambling for a minute. I suppose I could also post this in r/existential_chrisis since this cuts to the deepest core of navigating life's demands where everything is harder than it should be.

Keep the faith, getting through any day with minimal struggles is a day to be grateful for. I'm grateful to be able to claim that now, at least for today. Tomorrow will be whatever it will be.

Blessings!"

DAE also lose their vision in certain situations?,10,mhinzj,7,"It's been happening to me only for the past 4 years (I'm 27). In certain situations, for example, being surrounded by too many people and smells, waiting in line in a place I dislike or being in a bus going somewhere, I begin to feel sick in my stomach, nusea, starts sweating cold, my heartbeat and respiration become erratic, I can't control my respiration at all and then slowly my eyesight begins to dim out until I can't see at all.

It happened to me again 2 days ago. I went to get some lab tests so I had to get my blood drawn. I was siting just fine and suddenly I started to feel the signs, the inability to breathe correctly even if I'm consciously trying to, the cold sweat, nausea, blackening vision.

I had three REALLY GOOD semesters so I’m sitting at a 3.3GPA, but I am hopelessly behind and failing this semester. I’ve already withdrawn for medical reasons twice before and I thought I was doing well enough to start this therapy process. I feel so torn. I’m doing so much better emotionally, even took up ceramics and fell in love with it and I’m happy. But it feels like my brain just doesn’t want to do anything other than process and rest right now.

You don't though. You can't because you don't want to be a burden on the people you love and are afraid of at the same time. You want to shut down completely but keep f****** going instead because if you stop you will lose everything and everyone.  And you worry and create horrible scenarios and beg a higher power to release you. Until you go f****** numb and take leave of your self for awhile. And it never ends, ever. I hate this feeling.

I know I shouldn’t compare but a part of my trauma is being told by everyone around me that I didn’t go through anything

I lived 15 years with a narcissistic emotionally abusive mother and a father I would see once a month that didn’t bother or care to look after me and would cause havoc over needing to do the smallest things for me. I started living with my father after my mother kicked me out a year after she kicked my brother out. I was treated badly by everyone around me and used as everyone’s emotional punching bag never having any rest or feeling like my existence was wanted

I feel like what I’ve been through wasn’t enough as my pain is only downplayed by my family.

Have you ever gotten closure from your abusive parents?,1,mhs4c3,2,"I’m 20, so still quite young. In about 4 months I will have gone completely non contact with my mom and non bio dad for 12 months. 

Last august I found out my parents were emotionally and physically abusing my brothers , I left home when I was 18 and I have CPTSD due to their emotional and physical abuse, as well as a lot of accounts of sexual abuse (some indirectly from them) throughout the ages of 4-18. When I left their home, I was on my own, struggling and I thought they had “gotten better” because they were nice to me on the phone or over text, but they were putting on a facade they usually do for guests and we didn’t talk much after I moved out. 

So, I had to threaten to call CPS on them, it was terrifying and I had to bark louder than my fear, appear brave and confident when behind my phone I was suicidal and breaking down. My partner was there for me and I will never be able to thank them enough, as well as a few on this sub who shared their kind words with me at the time. I’m still in contact with my brothers, and although my parents will always be who they are to some degree, they’re trying. They no longer hit them or have anger outbursts as far as I’m aware through my siblings. 

My family is complex, so to give some brief context before I continue. My brothers are younger than me. I’ve been playing parent since I was 6. I lived in one place until I was 8 with my mom and bio father, who were going through a messy divorce. My mom met someone knew and gaslit me, groomed me and manipulated me into hating my bio father. Not dislike, not that he wasn’t a good person, she groomed me into hating him because she did. I have repressed memories from this time. She met someone new and I moved across the country, and she cut contact with my bio father. He tried to find me and contact me my entire life but I thought he was an awful person. I decided to open contact last October, and found out my mother had lied about ENDLESS things, including me getting diagnosed with ADHD when I was 6 and never telling me my whole life. My father was a kind, loving man when we talked. I’m trans and he accepted me for his son. Unfortunately a month and a half later he died, I was overwhelmed and not replying to his texts and he died proud of me and wondering why I wouldn’t talk to him. I often wonder if it’s the stress that killed him. 

I didn’t tell my brothers the entire time I was in contact , as they’re young and the youngest doesn’t remember my dad at all. But the older one found out a couple months after he died, he called me and cried. I regret not telling him and him not being able to talk to my dad, but at the same time I don’t feel like it was my place. 

Anyways, after all this happened I found out my brother had told my mom + non bio dad about him and his passing, and they are both narcissistic but surprisingly supportive. Especially my dad. Sometimes I wonder if my mother brings out an awful side in him, because he can be such a kind man sometimes. 

My brother understands why I can’t talk to them, but I don’t think he fully will until he’s older (he’s 16). I have so much baggage, trauma , memories repressed or otherwise that I carry and I am working through in therapy, it is so rooted deeply inside of me and effects me every single day in a crippling way. I can’t talk to people, I have nightmares, extreme anxiety, disassociation etc. 

I guess , where I want to end this is have any of you gone back to your parents, after NC to ask them why they did what they did? Ask them if they understand the effect they had on you? Ask them to apologise, or just to get some closure on what happened? Have any of you gotten closure? For me, especially when it’s complex I’m afraid I will never get what I want because it’s not one event- it’s my whole life. I just want to know, I need to know.  Sometimes I wish I had any kind of parent at all, I have my biological grandparents I’m in contact with but that’s about it. I struggle to reach out so much. 

And how do you contact them, what did you say, how did it go? 

Thank you for reading"
Difficulty trusting and approaching women,16,mhcs8o,4,"17 F
Ever since I was around 4-6 years old I never felt safe around women, despite being assaulted and abused by a man in my life at the time, my mother always denied and berated me for ""lying"" and ""wanting attention you don't deserve"". Since this man that had been sexually abusing me was her close friend. Even as my energy and emotional development essentially dropped from being abuse she turned a blind eye. Other older female family members refuse to believe it too, responding in the same ""you can't lie about things like that, you could get [sexual abuser] in big trouble if you keep lying"". 
I don't know why just because of that I distrust women as a whole, I get incredibly uncomfortable when they're too close or even try striking up casual conversations with me, I want to immediately hide if one approaches me at all. I really don't know if this is normal trauma response or not.
I don't know why I distrust women when it was a man abusing me"
“sToP aLwAyS lOoKiNg FoR tHe NeGaTiVe In ThInGs” and similar forms of toxic positivity drive me absolutely insane.,348,mgv5t0,47,"“you just have to stop always looking for the negative in things.”

“you’re taking everything too personal, it’s not that deep.”

“just give people a chance.”

“i’m sure it wasn’t that bad, just be grateful it wasn’t worse.”

“you’ll be much happier if you just forgive and forget.”

“have you tried___? i’m sure if you really put in effort, it would help.”



okay sure, maybe sometimes they really mean well and are really trying to help in the only way they know how. maybe these are said with good intentions and they’re just trying to be supportive. but i don’t think people realize how seriously ignorant they sound when they say something like this to people with a history of trauma. do you just not get it? like is it a problem of not understanding? do you need someone to explain what trauma does to the brain? or do you just not fucking care? because what this translates to, to me at least, is “just stop complaining already.”

it’s just frustrating because if you really cared about ME as a person, you’d let me heal on my own time without making me feel like i’m even more of a burden with comments like that. you’d be compassionate toward my struggles with myself and my past even when it’s not convenient for you. i don’t expect anyone to constantly be patient with me or to coddle me. i understand that caring for or being close to someone like me at times can be... intense. i’m not even understanding or patient toward myself 100% of the time. i don’t expect anyone to be a saint. but i have these walls up around me for a reason. i get defensive easily for a reason. i have trust issues for a reason. i obsess over my boundaries and independence for a reason. my behavior is the way it is FOR A REASON. and until i’m completely healed from all of this (which could take many, many years if it happens at all) i’ll still have moments where everything gets to be too much and i have a bad day or even a meltdown. even when i’m considered really far along in my treatment and have made miles and miles of progress, i could still have a bad day. and that’s okay, i’m allowed to show symptoms of this disorder that i’ve been diagnosed with, and so are the people who haven’t officially been diagnosed but are still struggling.

i just wish people would think about what their “innocent” comments sound like, especially considering they’re usually completely unwarranted. my struggles can’t be fixed with a positive attitude and just “letting it go.” and if i wanted everything i’m feeling to be invalidated by “loved ones” and “well-intentioned people,” then i really wouldn’t have had as bad of a childhood to begin with, and we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation."
DAE want to talk about how it *feels* when they dissociate?,14,mhdhms,16,"Hewwo.

So I know that dissociation feels differently for everybody, but I only just learned that this horrible feeling I've been experiencing for as long as I can remember is dissociation.

-I stop being able to feel my fingers and toes and my heart feels like it's stopped beating. 

-My vision doesn't get ""blurry"" but everything I'm not focusing on (""tunnel vision"") sort of ceases to exist. 
My hearing gets incredibly acute and loud/high-pitched sounds fills me with fury or terror.

-If I close my eyes my sense of proprioception is greatly distorted: feels like my arms and legs are 50 feet long and wire-thin, literally as thin as a wire. The rest of my body feels like an amorphous mass, like a dead jellyfish drifting in the water. When I open my eyes, I'm always shocked that my body is the same.

-I find it very difficult to form sentences and get really clumsy.

This feeling while dissociating is pretty specific to me, I think, but I wanted to share and see if anybody else feels something similar or wants to share how it feels for them. It feels so awful and gives me so much anxiety. Understanding *what* this feeling is has helped me greatly.

How to deal with all-consuming anger after a trigger?,9,mhgpr4,4,"As a child, I was never allowed to express anger at home. If I did, I was physically abused or neglected. This caused me to become a people pleaser and avoid confrontation.

I am doing somatic psychotherapy and reviewing DBT so I am making real progress with stating my boundaries and asking for what I need. I did this with a very close friend recently, and was shocked when she demanded an apology because I stated how I felt and what I needed. I refused, and she told me how 'self-centred' I am, that she's 'done', and that she hoped 'it was worth it'. 

This triggered a lot for me as I have trauma from relentless bullying all throughout my childhood. I didn't respond in an aggressive way, but on the inside I am experiencing all-consuming anger. I think this is due to me repressing my anger as a child. Now, when I feel dismissed or that I am treated unfairly, my anger is very intense and I can't stop obsessing about it. I don't know what to do with all this anger... 

How do you deal with this?"
Responsible parties,10,mhf735,3,"I had a long conversation with my brother last night, like 4 hours long. We live in different places so we talk every 3-6 months about random things, but it normally turns into a deep talk about our family history.

My niece is a preteen and I called to find out what she wanted for her birthday. My brother said she enjoys reading, and I thought back to when I was her age. At her age was the first time I was raped and I decided to tell my brother this and ask if he felt it was appropriate to get her a book(not about sexual assault) that has some kind of body positive, women centered theme or discussion.

My brother is religous(christianty) and he basically got into this deep theory that because our parents were religious, but weren't following god that their kids were cursed, which is why all this fucked up stuff happened. He reassured me that his daughter is free from that curse.

I DON'T want anything like I've experienced to happen to my niece. But it shifts responsibility from my parents and abusers to say it is some kind of spiritual curse. My parents should have taught me about sexuality, protected me from predators, and not deemed me as impure or shamed me for sexual assault I experienced. They were the adults. They were the responsible parties- curse or no curse. 

But I feel guilt for not believing the whole curse thing because that would mean that my niece, in a way, isn't safe from that.

I do think intergenerational trauma is something in my family so maybe that's what he means, but still, it makes me feel like I have to carry the responsibility, when adults should have been and still should own up to it."
Does anyone get random attacks of anxiety? Especially in social situations.,9,mhgg1l,2,It happened to me today and I am so embarrassed. I don’t always know why I’m getting triggered by something. But when it happens in front of an audience I feel especially distressed by it. It can be very difficult for me to share my thoughts and feelings with people in an academic or social setting. This can be true even when I’m talking to people I know well. I’ll get this intense rush of anxiety. I feel detached from my body and almost like the words are tumbling out of my mouth. I start to feel like I’m not in control anymore and that other people are somehow aware I’ve been activated by something. I become very hypervigilant looking at people’s microexpressions and feeling as though I am falling apart in front of their eyes or not even a whole person anymore. Is this a common experience other people have as well?
Just fucking venting,6,mhi105,0,"I just need to vent this, because I feel very heavy right now and need to be able to go to sleep. Trigger Warning: neglect, abusive relationships/parents.
.
.


I got a lot of healthy love as a child until I was around 12. Then I got heavily neglected in a way that left me with much trauma. The people I pick for relationships now are the type of people to shower you with love and then drop it at random times and then theyll get cold or even aggressive. I see that pattern and I am working on resolving it, but it still hurts. I am only 20, but I am starting to get very tired of this desperate search for affection. I am good friends with myself, but theres a point where you need somebody else to give you a hug and be there without being unpredictable, or me having to be scared they'll get angry with me for nothing the next day. Also (and I don't mean this with any offense), I have started to wonder, whether that's just the risk of being with a man. I know that can't be right? But every single man who has had a loving role in my life before, also has scared and scarred the fuck out of me."
"I understand 100% why being aware of what's going on with your own body and mind is necessary for recovery, but why is it so goddamn draining?",36,mh5xr9,16,"I am so used to dissociating through life that it comes more naturally to me than being present. I have started to try and break that ""habit"" with mindfulness and all those kinds of techniques, but I can't be fully ""in the moment"" for more than a couple of minutes at a time. Afterwards I'm often exhausted. 

Feeling and recognizing what's happening inside of me takes all my attention. I can't do it on the fly. Is that normal? I feel like this kind of stuff is supposed to start taking less effort over time (I mean how else do other people get through life without dissociating all the time), but it doesn't. There has been progress for sure and it has improved my life, but I feel like I'm already hitting my ceiling and it's just not enough to be functional."
"I have noticed some stages I have been through, not necessarily linearly, on my way to trying to have better relationships with myself and others",4,mhkast,1,"When I first realized I have cPTSD a couple of years ago it was like a door opened in my mind and I could see myself a little bit more clearly.  I was also able to start the work to forgive myself for some of my past mistakes.


As I started noticing where I wasn't being the person I wanted to be in my daily life, and seeing the struggles in my relationships, I began trying to change the things about myself that I didn't like.  It wasn't/isn't easy, but the work has been so worth it.  


I got triggered the other day by something tiny and unexpected.  A little one but enough to send me into anxious, flighty thoughts and some of my current flighty behaviors.

Any time I am in flight mode, my self talk is atrocious.  I like to say there is a mean bitch in my head.  I am working on not listening to her and eventually silencing her completely.  She is absolutely not who I want to be.


I wrote the below as a way of working through the latest trigger, and giving my journey some perspective for myself.   As a kindness to myself.  To remind me that I have been a long way already although I still have a long way to go.  A self-therapy and self-soothing exercise, if you will. 


I thought maybe sharing these thoughts could help someone put their own journey in perspective.  It is all my opinion and words, although likely echoes some things I have read over the years.  I may or may not remember sources if I try.  Aside: I have a lot of book recommendations if anyone wants them.  I could put together a ""books I've read"" post in the future if anyone is interested.


This got long so I'd like to express gratitude here at the top for you checking out my post, for being here, and for being you.   You're awesome!  I am so grateful for this whole community, you have all helped me so much.  


Sorry for any formatting or spelling errors, etc.


I am very interested in reading any thoughts that come up for you, although I may not have the energy to respond quickly or at all.  I am feeling a bit of a crash coming on and may need to make myself take a break for a bit.

--
Stages I have noticed in my journey (that I have mostly moved through, or still jump back and forth between):


1) Not understanding any of my triggers and being subconsciously triggered often, spending days or even weeks living in fight/flight/fawn mode at a time, before it all came crashing down into depression.  Repeat flight/crash cycle ad nauseam for 40+ years.


2) Reading about and starting to recognize and understand my patterns after a trigger, starting to recognize my cycles and patterns of coping from my past experiences, paying special attention to the way both my body and mind felt throughout - as much as I could remember, which was not much.  Also identifying triggered behaviors and coping patterns, which usually involved a lot of alcohol and pizza, as well as perseveration with venting to whomever would listen.



Interjection:   These next few stages are even less fun than living these cycles subconsciously or passively watching them play out, I think.  Acknowledging where we are using poor coping skills is hard.  Know that those coping skills served you at one time, and there is no shame in developing them.  Changing them is hard, but when they aren't serving you any more, maybe it is time for a review and purge.  It's harder than it sounds, but worth it.

-Stages 3 through 6 are where a lot of people (including myself) get stuck, IMO.   Taking an honest look at ourselves and ultimately controlling our behavior is more painful than living out our patterns subconsciously.  Especially when we have said or done not nice things to others when triggered.  So we blame all of the relationship problems on the other people in them, and keep repeating the same patterns over and over again in new relationships, expecting different results.  This is certainly insanity.  (But not according to Einstein, to whom this is often misattributed.).    
It is hard to acknowledge our contributions when relationships are difficult.  And most relationships are difficult at one time or another, I've found.

Finding and maintaining relationships that bring out the best and downplay the worst in us is key.  Some of us trigger each other constantly and repeatedly because of clashing coping mechanisms that do not serve communication, trust etc. in that relationship with that person.  That doesn't mean you are they are bad, just not for each other.   Practice is the only way to get good at setting and enforcing boundaries on your way to healing.  I recommend keeping the people in your life who encourage and help you to do so and getting rid of the ones who don't.   Two people who are healing may be able to make it work.  A person who is healing will have a hard time in a relationship with someone who refuses to let them grow or who believes there is nothing wrong with their own maladaptive coping behaviors like taking their anger out on others.  They usually justify their behaviors.  For example, by believing that everyone they unleash their emotions on deserves their anger, when that is often not the case.  They are often deflecting anger from the past onto their current closest target who did some small thing that reminded them of a big or repeated trauma, or did nothing at all to warrant their anger and is simply there to receive it.  Then they pile on the manipulative guilt because you ""made them"" do or feel something they didn't like.  To be clear, people's feelings are their own responsibility, you cannot ""make"" someone feel something, and you certainly can't make them do anything!  Don't let guilt trap you into a cycle of accepting responsibility that isn't yours.  (This was a hard one for me, so I wanted to be sure to mention it.)


Interjection over, back to the stages:


3) Identifying how I feel in my body and mind during the flight/crash cycle nearer and nearer in the past, and recognizing my maladaptive coping behaviors as they pertain to and interfere with my having healthy relationships with myself and with others.


4) Feeling myself in flight mode after an unknown trigger, identifying the trigger, and being able to reason myself down days or weeks after going into and living in flight mode.


 5) Feeling myself in flight mode after an unknown trigger, identifying the trigger, and being able to reason myself down minutes after it happens.    
-By this time I have usually run away from the situation, or lost my shit and then run away.  Hopefully the former.


6) Feeling the beginnings of flight mode after an unknown trigger, identifying the trigger, and being able to reason myself down in the moment, before I lose my shit or run away.   I often still feel the effects of the adrenalin rush, but am able to use breathing techniques to calm myself down and not react the way I would have in the past while staying in the situation (discussion, party, meeting, etc).
-I can only do this sometimes.  Most of the time I am still in the above stages, recognizing the trigger days later, or sometimes weeks.



Addendum:


Throughout this process, I recognized my trigger categories in a somewhat stepwise fashion as well.   (This write up started as an exploding brain meme, and got way too long and involved.  I've posted the below on cPTSDmemes in exploding brain format by itself.)


1. Realizing certain words and phrases in writing and in conversation trigger me.


2. Realizing abrupt tone changes, and sarcasm used to cover truth in conversation trigger me.



3. Realizing macro-expressions that gross me out, are condescending or don't match people's words and tones in conversation can trigger me.



4. Realizing micro-expressions that gross me out, are condescending, or don't match people's words and tones in conversation can trigger me


5. Realizing micro-expressions that gross me out, are condescending, or don’t match people’s body language in strangers in passing can trigger me


Re: triggers.  I've also noticed I have big triggers and smaller triggers.  The small ones I can usually work through faster, the bigger ones take a little more teasing out, and I often take longer to identify them.



Thanks again for reading if you got all the way here.


Don't forget, you are awesome and the world needs your gifts.  Shine on!"
I'm moving away from my hometown in two weeks and I'm freaking out,1,mhqwbz,2,"TW: dissociation, mention of menstruation

I've lived in the same town for almost my whole life, and I've moved around here a lot but never truly away. I grew up here with my narcissistic dad (the source of most of my trauma). My grandparents (his mom and dad) are also in town, as well as my mom, stepdad, and siblings.

This last year was really rough, but my husband and I got an opportunity to join some of his family in a better (for us) area 400 miles away, and we move in two weeks. Normally I handle change pretty badly, and I thought that this time I was doing okay until a phone call with my mom yesterday. I mentioned that I hadn't really been feeling like a person recently, and I was frustrated that my cycle is two weeks late for no apparent reason. Talking with my mom made me realize that I had been hardcore suppressing my anxiety over this move, but now that I've realized it, that awful tension in my gut/lower throat won't go away. I know it will get worse the closer the move gets unless I find a way to manage this, but I simply don't know how.

The worst part is that this move is going to be really, really good for us. Our town is small enough that I almost always see somebody I know when we go out, and there are memories everywhere. Living here is like being perpetually surrounded by my shitty past. Our new home is much bigger with far more opportunities, it's much closer to our political alignment, the weather is beautiful, and it will be a desperately needed fresh start. Still, change is petrifying for me, and while I've never been able to figure out exactly why, I'm positive it has something to do with my trauma. I just wish I could get it under control."
Urgent- please help I just remembered my trauma and I don’t know how to cope (TW:CSA),10,mhea5j,7,"If you don’t want to read the trigger part only read this: I‘m remembering terrible things and the memory is very visceral. Gut wrenching, my heart is racing, I feel sick. I feel like crying. I wanna stop remembering. But my body can’t stop screaming it at me. What do I do? 

TW- here comes the bad part:
Don’t read if this triggers you! 
I think I am remembering that I was abused by my own mother. I kinda hope that it’s a „fake“ memory but there have always been signs and I always kinda thought this happened... I had kind of a moment today where suddenly really terrifying feelings came crashing over me. As if a gate had been opened and now I am convinced that it happened, that she did this and that it happened during our vacation to Austria, where I was alone with her. 
I am not ready to remember this now and I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t want to focus on it and remember more. I’m not strong enough right now."
"Is it even possible to be happy with CPTSD? Like really, truly happy?",9,mhevpa,10,"I was thinking about this today. I have technically been diagnosed with PTSD and severe depression for 9 years now. I feel no closer to my happiness than I did when I first got the diagnosis. I’ve been in inpatient care, I’ve had my current therapist for 2 years, I have tried meds, lifestyle changes.... the only time I ever felt something remotely close to happiness was when I had high functioning depression, and the only reason I was high functioning was because I was powerlifting and the endorphins every few days was enough to get me there. 

I’ve been taking an honest view at my life and today I realized all the things I constantly feel just make me unhappy.... it’s just me. It’s me. I think I can admit that to myself finally. I have a good life right now, and I SHOULD be happy. But I’m not, and I hang on so tightly to all the bad that happens, even if it’s the tiniest amount of bad, and literally can’t see the good. It’s like the good doesn’t exist in my head without constantly reminding myself of it to give myself perspective. Otherwise, only the bad exists, so then the bad is all around me all the time. Because I can’t see any good. And when I can, it’s like the unhappiness looms over it so closely that I can’t feel the full impact of it.

And I don’t know how to even stop doing that. I’ve tried for almost a decade now. I’ve done everything that everyone says to do. I even had a two year run with meditation. 

I’m just starting to think that everything that happened to me when I was a kid has made it impossible for me to really truly be happy. Like my brain structure can’t support genuine happiness anymore or something. 

Does anyone else relate to this? Do I sound nuts?"
I hate it when people say that I should just let go of the past. The past affects how my brain works now as an adult.,1321,mgkxfq,109,"I'm not obsessing over past trauma but my involuntary fight or flight responses, anxiety, and depression are caused by the stuff that happened to me. I don't actually care about the events that happened to me anymore but my brain is wired to react as if I'm still in those situations. It's not hard to understand if you're able to have at least a little empathy, and a basic understanding of mental health topics like depression."
I Am Still The Person I Was Before The Trauma,10,mhejfo,1,"I discovered in therapy today more about who I am. My therapist pointed out parts of my inner self I didn't even know. She said a lot of my actions have shown that I am an advocate. On a scale that I personally think is small but as she noted, can be quite impactful to others. Even if its just among my own friend group or with my family. 

I always believed that the multiple layers of trauma I have experienced took everything from me. I believed that the only thing that survived was a small part of empathy, hope, and innocence. But my passion and drive to fight for social change has survived. 

Its amazing and now I have another tool when those bad days hit. When all the flashbacks hit and my panic attacks are so bad that during my recovery from them I lose a few days. It really is true, those asshats didn't take everything!!!! For now its enough to know. That even when I can still feel their marks upon my brain and body. Many parts of me survived. 

And it helps me to realize that I am more than what has happened to me. It will always be apart of me. But the person I was before all of the abuse is also here. I'm a 2.0 version of my previous self. And I see now, that everything I did to make it to this point was worth it. For so long, I didn't think it mattered. 

I mean what was the point with experiencing so much pain. Much of which will always be with me. So yeah, I hit a huge breakthrough. The importance probably won't last when I can't sleep because of the nightmares or to fearful to even leave my room. But right now in this moment it feels pretty damn good so I'll take it."
I try to talk to my friends,14,mhbbo9,8,"and people just don’t fucking GET IT. I try to explain how tough confrontation is for me because it lead to severe emotional abuse and learning to move through it and my friend just compares it to his family life...which is not abusive AT ALL. And it just kills me because everyone diminishes this to “oh your parents fought a lot and your mom just insulted you so like why are you so fucked up” 

Like I experienced something I probably can’t even remember that sent 12-year-old kid me into fight or flight mode and I haven’t come out of it until a year ago...at 27. I feel so diminished by them because everyone treats me like “it’s not that bad,” partners, friends, family...and I want to be like - then why can’t I remember more than half my life up until 2018!! Why do I have a go bag and a car packed ready to leave in a minute or less. I know I shouldn’t need validation but it gets tiring."
"Coping with the feeling of being ""in trouble""",18,mh9ir0,7,"I'm 40 years old; I've done quite a lot of healing; I'm on a medication combo that works well for me; I've found several grounding exercises and meditations that work pretty well for me. But all my life, knowing that someone is upset with me, or that I've done something that will be criticized or that I may face slightly unpleasant consequences for - being ""in trouble"" - leaves me with paralyzing anxiety. I know the psychology of why, and it doesn't help a bit. The grounding exercises barely help. There have been times when I've run away from problems making them a thousand times worse than if I had just dealt with them right away (you'd think I'd learn from that right?).

Today, I need to face up to a situation that I KNOW rationally really isn't that bad. I KNOW that I have the skills to handle it. I know that if I calmly explain things, I actually won't even have any unpleasant consequences because it's largely a misunderstanding. But right now, my avoidance is kicking in fiercely. 

Guess I'm just writing this all out in the hopes that it makes my brain see how silly it's being so that I can get past this. I've worked way way way too hard over the past two years to start running from my problems again, so I know I have no choice but to sit down and tend to this even if my body is telling me it's dangerous."
DAE else feel panicked when setting boundaries at work because you don't know if they're reasonable or actually asking for too much?,6,mhh01o,3,"I've been on disability from work for several weeks and am planning to return soon. My therapist and I went over boundaries/accommodations I need for my return to make sure I'm prioritizing my mental health. We set what I thought of as a reasonable request, but now my HR is pushing back a little saying ""it would be difficult to accommodate with the employer's needs,"" which is making me question if I'm really asking for too much. Now I'm just kind of spiraling into feeling like I'm faking my mental illness and questioning whether my job wants to let me go. This feeling really sucks."
Someone please tell me that this can get better,4,mhj12g,2,"I was just discharged from a 2 month hospital stay in a unit that specializes in dissociative trauma disorders where I was diagnosed with PTSD and DID. Feeling extremely raw right now. Understandably, I think. 

Before I went into the unit I was in denial that I had even experienced trauma in my life and thought my experiences could all be explained by stress or the bipolar disorder which I have been diagnosed with for a few years. I always knew something wasn’t fitting with my diagnosis and treatment, but I was so against the idea of this (trauma) being the problem. I’ve become more accepting of what happened to me/what I’m experiencing but now I’m having a hard time accepting that recovery is even a possibility I guess? I am overwhelmed by the feeling that this world was not made for me and I cannot exist in it. 

I have never done trauma therapy before, I’ve never even had what I’d call successful therapy of any kind in the past. And I’m feeling very pessimistic about the possibility of therapy being a treatment that can change my life in any meaningful way. I still wish this was bipolar disorder or depression or stress, those feel like simpler problems that could possibly be fixed with a medication and a routine. There’s no pill for this. 

Please someone just tell me I’m not the only one? Tell me it can get even a little bit better?"
How do i avoid getting PTSD directly after incident?,8,mhehc3,11,"Hi! I'm sorry if it makes little to no sense, but i just had something very traumatic happen to me and already have a lot of other PTSD from childhood and teenage years, i can really see this also developing into it, but i would like to prevent it, if anyone knows how to ( Specific way of thinking or more? )it would be greatly appreciated since it is night where i live and I can't call a therapist or see anyone due to lockdown.
Thank you in advance if you took your time to read this."
Lateral looking,34,mh4ihd,8,"Huge progress for me just using an exercise. 
I looked again at Vagus Nerve theory and that Dorsal Vagal would be related to my struggles. So freeze, shutdown and dissociation, social anxiety. Hyper vigilance. Other crap.
So I found an exercise that caused good shifts, on YouTube, an exercise where you hold your head straight ahead, just helping by cradling your head with your hands behind your head, then looking to the right or left for at least 30 seconds, until you have a shift, like a sigh or a yawn then you can look ahead again. And I believe this is what vagal toning is. Strengthening it. 

I’ve felt a lot better. Been more capable and present socially. I do it throughout the day, even if talking to someone I might subtly move my eyes around to different directions just to combat that freezing. 

On that subject video games, tv and phone scrolling especially seems to be activities that narrow that eye movement and cause that stress response hyper focus vigilance. Always glad to find something that helps with recovery and hope it will help others"
Did anyone else have “homework time”?,5,mhiim4,7,"Edit: This is a lot longer than I thought I could make it, but it’s the most condensed “formula” to their usual pattern for this abuse/experience. It is primarily all like.. crazy making, word twisting, projections/insertion/accusation, emotional and psychological abuse. The physical abuse didn’t strike me as abuse til adulthood, the mental aspect is what was the worst in my perspective back then. She makes it feel like your brain and reality as you know it is ripping to shreds inside your skull for hours first. 

**So TLDR; DAE parents sit them down for 5-8+ hours to do homework, but only use super mind-break-y word twisting, “got cha” style escalation to instigate conflict/frustration, work themselves up into a mental break, and escalate into physical abuse? **

_______

My parents did this to me, the oldest and all my younger siblings. They would have us sit at the kitchen table for hours(usually around 5), literally sometimes up to 8 hours, consecutively with no breaks sometimes even withholding bathroom breaks. 

They called it “homework time” 

Basically it is a non stop escalation from calm to annoyed to enraged to terrorized. 
It would turn into our parents making frustrated and angry(blatantly disrespectful to us as individuals) remarks on why we are taking so long, badgering enough until we get stressed and then actually cannot focus on the work. They drink beer or wine non stop as the night goes on, and get angry along with it. 

Eventually they get us to the point where we are extremely upset, and say “I can’t think” when they prompt us with something about why we are still doing homework, why do we have so much homework, why don’t we understand the homework, why (literally anything) homework? 

Then they force/order us to ask for their help, as though the reason we can’t do the homework is a lack of knowledge or understanding of the material- rather than being extremely emotionally overwhelmed, and under extreme pressure and fear/terror even for fear of “getting in trouble” and “the consequences”. 

Once they are “helping” with the homework(a few hours into them screaming, and us panicking) they become ENRAGED at any number of reasons, primarily these two:


- why do you even have this much homework assigned? 

- (insert school subject) has changed since I was in, why would they change it?(especially math) 


In which they would then 
scream AT US in a violent rabid rage/tantrum as though we are responsible for the school giving too much homework, or for the education standards changing from the 70s to the 2000s-2010s. 

By this point we have been crying, having panic attacks, dissociating, all of which is EVERY TIME met with threats of punishment, or accusing us of disrespect and disobeying. 

“You better stop crying before I give you a real reason to cry”

When they ask why are we crying, and we say anything than the two bulleted complaints above, it is disrespect. A horrific offense to them.  How DARE we accuse them of being bad parents, because if they made us this upset then that makes them bad parents so it isn’t them. Besides if we made them mad we deserved it. 


When they ask why we are crying, and we say one of the two bulleted complaints above/state the reason we are upset is the same reason they are upset and screaming, they threaten us that “that isn’t a good reason to be upset” and that we are “spoiled brats trying to get out of homework”. 

It is kind of like.. one of those video games where every choice you make prompts s different ending, but every choice or NON choice made is explicitly WRONG and terrifying.

The escalation goes on until they decide to hit us, which would be the ending in this video game scenario. And every time, it is always the same ending no matter WHAT choices were made through out. 

 Every ending results in being whooped, as in just.. attacked in any way they can land a hit on us- then blamed that if we had just been still for our whooping it wouldn’t have been all over. Really what it was is that their anger escalated to the point that they physically attacked us to release their emotions. 


This happened 3-5 nights a week(depending on how much homework I wasn’t able to compete before getting home) for most of my childhood from probably 2nd to 3rd grade, until my sisters were “old enough” to over take my homework time by “needing parental supervision” when doing homework. So years. 

And each occurrence, this is usually how the afternoon/night ended. And every time it would go on for hours, once it started it **never** ended until it reached completion (being physically abused).


**tw blunt description/listing of physical abuse after this point**

Sometimes it would even go on well into the night, on nights that our mom could not pull herself away, and then it would take on a different cycle. Kind of like the typical “abuse pattern” in relationships but rapid, one full cycle every hour or two. At this point, my dad would just disappear to watch Tv or something- he just tuned out and let it happen. “Nothing he could have done.” Because if he got involved at this point on “our side”, he would get a part of it too, I guess.  And this is when the physical abuse also changed from “angry child slapping up a punching bag” style “whoopings”, to my mom doing stuff like squeezing fist fulls of skin and pulling, trying to crush our arms or hands, yanking or shaking our heads by her fists in our hair, screaming like a banshee with her mouth centimeters away from our ear or face, trying to throw us (she wasn’t strong enough for this tbh and we were all underweight)."
I need to be around people,4,mhh49e,2,"I really like having a roommate or living with someone else or I spiral into a weird headspace and don’t keep a schedule well. I know a lot of people - my sister included - look to isolate themselves, but when we talked about it between us, her abuse happened in a group while mine was one on one. 

I like to live in a city because I also feel like someone can hear me if I get in trouble and would help me. 

That, and everyone else moving pressures me (in a good way?) into moving. The general buzz makes me remember that life goes on outside of my own trauma and mind. 

I don’t have abandonment issues, but have also not lived alone in 4-5 years. With my recent unemployment, I’ve been staying at a boyfriend/friend’s since I didn’t trust myself alone. 

I find I’m in the minority RE traumatized people on this - but...anyone else?

EDIT: And I was alone in an apartment before in college and kept having non-epileptic seizures. It’s not that I can’t be alone, but having someone to check in with or to do teamwork stuff with is a positive for me. In my isolating and abusive relationship I did a good amount of community work."
Treating Self-Injury through Research Study,2,mhm5zj,1,"Thank you to the moderators of r/CPTSD for allowing me to post here!

I am part of a team of researchers at New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University who are currently recruiting participants for a research study looking at an investigational treatment for self-injury called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is a non-invasive, well-tolerated form of brain stimulation that delivers a low current to a specific area of the brain using electrodes. Research has shown that tDCS can help reduce negative emotions and may help treat depression and other conditions.

We are seeking individuals between the ages of 18-65 who self-injure (through burning, cutting, or other means). Eligible participants should be staying/living within 60 minutes travel distance of Manhattan (New York, NY, USA) to participate. The study involves completing a baseline psychological assessment, questionnaires and six sessions of tDCS during three visits over one week. This is a double-blind trial, so you may be randomly assigned to receive an active or an inactive form of tDCS. All research procedures can be done from your own home–no in-person visits are required.

Three months of treatment visits with a psychiatrist for medication management will then be offered after AT NO COST to you. Compensation of $150 is provided for time and effort if you are eligible and complete all research procedures.

The researchers on this team have no conflicts of interest to declare. All study procedures have been approved by the Institutional Review Board for New York State Psychiatric Institute.

Some details about confidentiality and the use of your personal information:

the earthy smell and smell of crickets? triggers me because of a dream i kept having during a difficult time that i can’t actually identify but i know it’s when i was a kid,5,mhf9g3,5,"the dream was like my mum as a nurse along with other people i knew and we were in this derelict bug infested ‘hospital’ and they were taking care of us or at least supposed to 

i saw other kids in uncomfortable conditions and they didn’t say anything

it was also during the time where there was the ‘we will rock you’ kid band advert kept coming up and somehow i associated it with that 

this is one nightmare that always stuck with me and i hate the trigger and it gives me a feeling of like i’m disgusting and honestly it had a melancholic vibe along with it, like there was nothing i could do and i just accepted it in the moment"
"DAE have *cough* ""Seasonal Affective Disorder""? (SAD)",7,mhe3y5,5,"Canadian here. Spent a number of years travelling to warmer places in my 20s (probably relevant to this point actually) so I missed a few winters in Canada. I've been back ""home"" for the last 3 years, and have definitely confirmed that as soon as the snow flies and it gets colder, the fight to maintain my mental health is a daily struggle...and come Feb/March, it can be a losing battle for me (just getting through about a 2-3 week dissociation right now).

Yesterday, I was making breakfast and looking out the window at what remained of a freak, March snowstorm (about 4cm of snow). For 2 days, the temperature went from 12 degrees Celsius to -5 degrees. I looked at my weather app that was forecasting a snap recovery with temperatures of 14-17 degrees all week. I became very excited. I almost took a screenshot to send to my buddies out of excitement (which I've done in the past).

And then it hit me. SAD? Maybe. Over the past few weeks I've really been piecing together *how much I sought safety as a child by running away.* I grew up on a small acreage with a few chickens, cows, and a dog. There was a river that ran through our property with some dense trees where we had a little firepit/campsite. During the summer, I would set up a tent and sleep down by the river as often as possible. I would spend many evenings and weekends as a 10 year old, by myself, walking up and down the riverbank skipping rocks, swimming, and just hanging out. I would set up a hammock or put bedding on the trampoline and sleep outside regularly. When I became a teenager, I was able to buy an old $600 motorbike that I would rip around our little farm on almost every day after I got home from school.

I genuinely have no interest in basketball - watching or playing (didn't know this until I became an adult). But we had a hoop on our driveway that I spent enough hours on as a child to make me captain of our junior varsity team (11th grade) and a starter when our senior high school team was playing provincials (aka. ""state""). Not a flex, I still hate basketball. Don't enjoy it now, and looking back, never *ever* enjoyed playing it. I hated games. I hated practice. But I did what everyone told me to do, which included, ""Hey, you should play basketball. You're pretty good!"" Asked every year to play in the alumni tourney and every year it's a flat no from me. I'm just trying to illustrate *how much I ran away as a child just to feel safe for a few moments.* A reluctant *provincial level athlete* for shit's sake.

SAD? Maybe. Or maybe cold and the winter meant that I would be forced to stay inside most of the time where I was often screamed at or physically abused. Winter meant covert tactics like sleeping/reading in my closet and being really quiet so I wouldn't be found (at least for another 10 minutes). Winter meant doing basketball dribbling ""drills"" in the garage. Or, basically, it just meant a lot of verbal abuse, stuck inside the house all day while it's -25 outside for weeks on end.

Seriously though, am I crazy or is it possible that 50-80% of people that report having Seasonal Affective Disorder are just experiencing flashbacks from having to stay inside with their abusers all winter long? DAE?  


Edit: a word"
My husband poured water on me,3,mhgeej,1,"I was having a CPTSD episode.  I suffered 7 long years in a sexual, emotional, and physically abusive marriage, I am now married to a Grandiose Narcist  , who in order to stop fights will try and trigger an episode. A couple of evenings ago he triggered me by telling me I would never get my kids in a divorce they were his, (something my previous ex said) i fell down my rabbit hole into a episode and he poured water on my head to get me to stop doing whatever I was doing \*regressing, repeating myself, self southing, crying, melting etc. Basically reliving a moment in time).  Tell me what your opinion is . I feel violated."
Rambling about desiring intuition and care vs mind reading. Am I alone in this?,6,mhex6x,2,"I hear people talk about how you cant expect others to read your mind and know what you want/need/are thinking.

 I feel chronically unheard and have grown out of touch with fully understanding what i need and often it's the simplest things.

What I want is for someone to intuit me for a change. Is that really in such violation of the social contract to warrant that kind of cartoonish dismissal of these feelings?

I'm all for self responsibility, but nobody sees me."
How do you validate your own trauma?,27,mh4o1p,12,I just got my diagnosis a little ago and it feels weird. I feel like whenever i see other peoples trauma i find so much more reason for them to be struggling. I still feel like i am overreacting. Like i just make too big of a deal out of the things that happened to me. My siblings who where there with me throughout the experience dont seem to be carrying it around with them all that much and my friends who i share a traumatic experience with (all except for one) seem to have moved on and not be affected all that much. I know i am suffering. But i keep asking myself whether i just need to get my shit together and not be acting like it was that terrible. But i also know i would not have gotten the diagnosis if it wasn't serious and when i tell a professional they immediately recognize it as complex trauma. How have you guys dealt with overcoming that insecurity? What helped you to learn to validate your struggles?
My mom still s a major trigger. It breaks my heart.,6,mhel1s,1,"My dad was bipolar schizophrenic and went untreated until he died. My mom has some major mental hangups but as far as I know she's only been diagnosed with ptsd. My whole life I watched my dad beat her and my siblings. I admit my mom and brother had it worse. My dad had a thing to where he thought all males on earth were evil. Prob bc he was evil.

My mom was the adult and as a child I already hated her and my dad. She could escape and take us with her. As adults I was LC until my dad had a stroke that slowly took his life. My mom exoierienced major burnout towards the end. My dad begged me to be his POA. By this time he was more a child than the man I'd known. I'd long forgiven him. How could I not. He was so helpless. My mom wouldn't allow me to take over. Said I'd have to prove her unfit. I tried after she purposely allowed him to aspirate on food he wasn't allowed and she fed him. By then it was too late. 

My mom is a major trigger. I can't even think about her without getting so angry. Not only about my childhood. But the way things went with my dad. He was on his way to getting better. But she was done taking care of him. She convinced herself she did it so he could finally die. That he was suffering. I feel sick.

She's in a position to where she relies in me pretty heavy for life. Every time I have to spend even a second of time with her. I have to spend the whole day in bed. My husband just doesn't get it. Hell I don't get it. I just want to not have these feelings. Therapy isn't in the cards atm. But when it is how do I even shop around in a town as small as mine? So much stress. I wonder if I'll ever be normal. Will I ever get over any of it? Enough to live a normal life?!"
I feel like my trauma isn’t valid,4,mhh116,2,"So my trauma started when I was...uh, born? 
Throughout my whole life I’ve always been alone in some way or another. My first experience being away from my mother, I had such bad separation anxiety that I cried the whole time and when my mum came back to get me I went ballistic, and I was physically restrained to ‘teach me a lesson’ about getting so upset. 

The whole time I was at school up until the time I was seventeen I was excluded. I didn’t have a long term close friend until I was fourteen and didn’t have a friendship group until I was seventeen years old.

Every single person I have intimately trusted except for my dad has either emotionally abused, neglected or abandoned me. My mum suffered with severe anxiety problems and used to take it out on me, sometimes blowing up and screaming at me for the tiniest thing until I was crying, at which point she would either laugh at me, shove me into my room and lock the door or threaten to leave and never come back. 
This wasn’t an every day occurrence - most of the time she was a relatively good mother, but when I got older especially she was never very motherly. She always solved the problem by using verbal and emotional aggression, both for my benefit and to punish me. 

At school I was ritually humiliated for fun, and because I wasn’t seen as one of the ‘worthy’ kids the teachers did nothing about it and actually encouraged it in some cases. It went on until my family threatened to call the police, because I was regularly receiving death threats and threats of physical violence (breaking arms, legs, strangulation) from other kids. People stole my stuff and hid or destroyed it, pretended to be my friend and then humiliated me, or asked me out for a joke. 

I also have autism, so I was basically in fight or flight for my entire childhood because on top of all of this I also had sensory issues and extreme social anxiety.

My best friend of six years lately abandoned me for the sake of an easy sexual opportunity and told me that I was toxic when I reached out to him for help because I felt suicidal due to this, the pandemic and my eating disorder. I cut him off, but I was on suicide watch for about two months afterwards. 

Since I’ve had therapy for my eating disorder, that coping mechanism is gone and I’ve started experiencing frequent emotional flashbacks and occasional visual flashbacks. I’ve been hyper vigilant my whole life, experienced hyper aggression at times and have had five or six intense suicidal periods throughout my life, starting when I was ten. I have severe trust issues, my shock response is to shut down my emotions and I don’t know how to respond to affection. 

I just want some support."
"DAE have a hard time finding their ""people""?",177,mgukik,36,"I always hear stories about people who work on projects together or build things together, whether it be a website, a podcast, a music recording, etc.  Where are the people who want to do these things?  How do you find them?

I don't think I've ever met anyone who was moving in the same direction as me, mentally or spiritually.  I don't think I've ever had anyone genuinely encouraging in my life before who wanted to build things or create things together.  I've never met anyone who shares my excitement or curiosity.  Any time I have any sort of goal or idea, I'm met with either direct opposition or complete apathy.  Family, friends, colleagues, it doesn't matter.  I can't figure out why these are the only sorts of people I attract, or who stick around.  Even my current boyfriend can't be bothered to work on a simple project with me.  Everything I do or make only comes to fruition when its made completely or entirely alone.  

I'm in my mid-30's now and I'm on the cusp of no longer looking for ""my people,"" because every encounter with others has left me more lonely than before I reached out, even in groups where one would expect to find like-minded people.  Fortunately or unfortunately, I've found far greater comfort in the presence of my own company.

Still, ""two-heads-are-better-than-one"" and all that.  It would just be nice to find people to bounce ideas off of or collaborate with, but I've largely given up.  I feel like I'm probably going to become a hermit at some point, but maybe that's okay."
"Even you have accepted that you shouldn't have been born,what to do when you tell this to your parent and he agrees?",43,mh1bqx,29,"I have been crying for two days now,I can't focus on anything.
We had another huge fight and  gaslighting session but this time I blurted out everything I had in mind.
I told him if you aren't stable enough and have hated my mother you shouldn't have got married and had me and he bluntly agrees and says yes I shouldn't have.
It just shook my core,even though I have accepted it for a long time hearing it from them is just too heartbreaking.
I cried the whole day and drank so much at night I thought i was going to die.
On top of that I also told him that I'm sorry that such an emotional child was born in a house where emotions are not appreciated and he replies
Yeah you're so right.

What's the point of all the work and progress I thought I had been making when now I feel like an absolute waste of space.i am so close to ending everything."
"Seeking resources for the Eugene, Or area.",2,mhjjun,1,"Does anyone know a reputable therapist/company who specializes in emdr, or trauma therapy?"
Nervous about getting treatment due to a past emotionally abusive therapist.,5,mhd9ss,2,My previous therapist took advantage of my vulnerabilities and now I'm absolutely terrified of getting the proper help I need. Anyone else dealt with something similar or have any advice?
"At 22, I have started to accept that I am a lesbian",140,mguj3s,20,"I knew I wasn't straight when I was 13. I learned about being queer from a girl I was hospitalized with and instantly knew that I was not straight. For 9 years I identified as bisexual.

My father sexually abused me as a child, up until I was 15. And then I cut contact and never spoke to him again. At 16, I had my first serious relationship with an 18 year old boy and have had a running 7 years of nonstop abusive relationships with men.

I have never been attracted to men. I was only trying to replace my father. And now I am beginning to accept that I am a lesbian.

For being openly queer for the entirety of my formative years, it is surprisingly difficult to accept that I am a lesbian. I would have never thought I would be the last person to have trouble accepting this, but no longer will I try to force myself to be a feminine bisexual. I am an androgynous lesbian. I always have been. No longer will I try to change who I am. I refuse to continue living my life for male attention."
Do i have any reason to stay alive?,2,mhivnc,1,"Hello. I dont want to be pathetic, and thank you all. Im a 20 y.o. I cant say that my life's bad, but i literally dont understand my feelings. Now i dont have any close friend, but i have a gf. My gf's perfect, but i think i will be seem like a burden, cuz she got more problems than me,  at least I think so. My  father narcissus, and i did all what he wanted, when i was a kid. He didnt think about my opinion, i felt i was like a soldier in the army. He said he wanted only good for me, but no one in the familly didnt feel that. I have 2 brothers, but their mental health are better than mine, they rly dont care about him, literally. I dont know my brothers are bad or good, but my mom said they're good, cuz my brothers can be happy, but i cant.. Every fucking time when my dad's screaming i can't stay normal. I mean i cant stay normal when everyone's screaming, cuz i got a flashbacks about daddy's scream... What's wrong? Why am i like this? Only my mom knows about my  diagnosis, i dont want to talk with this with my dad, cuz he will be think about me like a psycho, i cant prove him about his mental health (i said in the start, he's a narcissist), he wont believe me. He didnt trust anyone. I know, this's his disease, but what i can do with my dad? I cant talk with him, i felt like im the soldier, literally. I cant fucking stay with his screams, with any screams. I get a panic every time,  when i hear the fucking screams, it's so difficult to describe. I feel all the problems I had because of me, i dont know why... I rly cant understand why, but i feel it's only my bad, is it ok?  He puts mental pressure all the time. He controls me everytime. EVERY FUCKING TIME. I know i need to go away from my dad, but i cant.  Cuz he will blame my mother, my brothers. But this is not all...  


In the 2016 i survived the gun threat. It was my  CLASSMATE. He wanted money from me, but i didnt give him, and got a  threat. I.. After this i cant stay outside the house.   


In 2018 my good mate died 2 days before my birthday. Now i hate my birthday,  cuz i didnt know about his anxiety. He didnt say and show it to anyone  his feelings.   


And from 2018 my life's going  downhill. I agree i got good memories, i got a good feelings, Im grateful to my girlfriend for the support, but i dont want to be a burden, cuz i rly love her.. I dont know what i can do, cuz now can't be social, i talk only with my girlfriend, and  I haven't gone outside for more than 3 weeks. I think i'll most likely have problems at the university, but i dont care about that..  What can you recommend? How can I remove the sensation of flashbacks from my childhood? I know that therapy is needed, but now I have no money for it, spent all the money on identifying the diagnosis hah,  but I think I'll start a little later.  What can i do before the therapy? Can i improve my mental health?  


Thanks everyone again who noticed my post, im sorry about my english.."
It’s not my fault,46,mgzwyv,3,"I’m not the one who failed them. They’re the ones who failed me. They should’ve kept me safe and treated me right, not make me feel not good enough or worthless. I am *not* worthless. I still don’t completely love myself, but that’s okay. Progress takes time. And I’m not okay, at all. But that’s okay, because having feelings is valid. And I can cut myself a break, I’ve been through a lot. It’s okay to feel sad and cry. I am not a bad person for not loving them. So yes, I think I will report them

CPTSD was well-designed for a different era of human life,826,mghpwa,99,"I am sure that some of you must have had the same thought process as me, as we have learned about CPTSD, attachment disorder, etc: ""Why the hell would I have learned these behaviors that are SO counterproductive to a happy life?? Surely there must be a smarter way to adapt that doesn't leave me afraid of other people, attracted to abusive folks, unable to do daily life tasks..."" My therapist tells me repeatedly that they protected me as a child from an unsafe environment. But something else clicked for me as I've been reading Pete Walker's Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving (great book btw).

**CPTSD was designed for an era of human life that was VERY different from the modern world.** Given we've only been living this way (single-generation families in a home, highly mobile, highly independent in adulthood) for a few dozen to a hundred years - less in many countries - the reality is that we are adapted for a totally different social configuration. And humans are EXTREMELY social creatures, we regulate each other emotionally, we fit into a greater social machine, because even in the modern era, you literally cannot survive without someone taking care of you into adulthood. And a hundred, thousand, 10,000 years ago that was infinitely more true: to be rejected from the tribe, family, or village was tantamount to death.

Today, you are raised by one or two parents, sometimes with no other familial or friendly adults around. Pete Walker talks about ""safe enough"" or ""good enough"" relationships: many children these days are raised with zero of these, a guaranteed path to CPTSD. Historically, you would be raised by a group: aunts, uncles, grandparents, parents, cousins, neighbors, older siblings, etc. You would have daily exposure to a wide range of adults who cared about you, so even if your parents weren't great, you had the opportunity to healthily connect elsewhere. Nowadays with our isolated nuclear families and hyper-mobile tendency to move away from extended family, you get ONE shot for solid upbringing - your parent(s), with some lucky enough to have engaged grandparents or extended family or teachers - which are sometimes enough to prevent CPTSD from occurring or reduce the severity. And for as much as we malign parents for leaning on schools to help raise kids, human children were *never* meant to be raised by only one or two individual people, especially not people working 40+hrs a weeks. This is a great recipe for neglect at the very minimum.

Okay, so that explains why CPTSD is more prevalent these days. But what makes it well-designed? When I think about 500, 1000, 10000 years ago, and ask what kind of situation would a child have to be in to be as severely neglected and/or abused as many are in these modern isolated, stressful ""families"", they were very different from what is apparently just normal in modern times. If you were born a slave, member of a low caste, or servant in a village or society that treated such people as sub-human citizens, being surrounded by fearful, emotionally distant adults and having a life punctuated by abuse would have been the appropriate context because as an adult that wouldn't change: you would need to be fearful, subservient, and self-critical in order to survive and thrive. To be confident, secure, and willing to speak your mind or protect yourself from abuse could have gotten you killed or severely punished. If you were born a female in a society that had (has...) very deferent, subservient roles for women, it's the same issue: CPTSD is actually the ""correct"" model of upbringing to prevent you from being disowned or ostracized, which would have been the most dangerous thing possible. To embrace abusers, to dissociate from your true self and the pain you experience, and to people-please would actually be the safest form of personality in these kinds of scenarios. Human evolution favors that which helps you survive to reproduce. These would be ""adaptations"" needed to survive the life you were born into, not ""maladaptations"" as they are in the modern world where you can just *move away* from your abusive family and never talk to them again, and start a new life without their influence. Such a thing was never so easy until the last few decades, and has completely changed the script of a typical human life.  These adaptations would have even helped you be more comfortable in your situation, as dissociation and leaning into your bad circumstances can be less painful than internally flailing against them your whole life.

The loss of the ""village"" to raise children has been critically damaging to modern society, leaving children adrift to gamble solely on the suitability of their direct parent(s) to model healthy attachment and behavior. CPTSD, while infinitely frustrating to those of us trying to work through it now as adults in *completely* different contexts than we were prepared for as children, made much more sense in the historical context that we evolved in, when childhood and adulthood would likely see a very similar treatment of the same person, unlikely to move away from their birthplace.

These are just my musings as I work through my own journey and try to make sense of my own conditioning. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
"Help with trauma, ADHD & crippling executive functioning",14,mh5grb,13,"Hi all

**TLDR is at the bottom, I'm sorry for this extremely long and unplanned post. I'm looking for support and advice for my situation.**

&#x200B;

I've been lurking here for a while but I figured I'd write up a post else I'd end up going down a rabbit hole binging solutions and threads. I've read hundreds of threads, tons of books, every video on Youtube, there isn't anymore information I can hoard so a curated post for my needs seemed like a better option and I'm hoping you beautiful souls can help me out.

VERY condensed background: 28 y/o male, CPTSD (childhood trauma, near-death experiences, heavily medicated child and teen due to health issues, two alchalcoholicolic parents, one dying, one wanting to die, and other stuff); diagnosed ADHD 18 months ago (although questionable given all the research I've done).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm extremely ambitious and have lots of goals and dreams in life, but dealing with executive dysfunction is fucking with my mind (which I've worked extremely hard to heal). And I think it's only JUST hit me how hard executive functioning problems have impacted my life. 

I've achieved a lot by ruthlessly fighting my way through life. The last 12 months during lockdown I've pretty much turned my entire life around from almost ending it to getting a university scholarship, tripling my salary, getting into the field I always wanted to and building an entire productivity system, all whilst working on healing my mind with psychedelics, meditation, diet etc. Tried Vyvanse but I completely lost my memory and it freaked me out so I was forced to stop (Concerta was even worse).

This is only the tip of the iceberg. I've done a LOT of work. Alone. All whilst living in the same house and with the same abusive alcoholic parent (who herself is extremely traumatised). I've done things that people would deem impossible/insane. I don't even know how I'm alive if I'm honest.

Whats kept me going, is me. I found worth in myself. And I refuse to die without slaying this life despite my challenges. I have a lot of talent. A lot of fucking grit. A lot of potential. Cultivating that within myself has taken years but I'm here and I want to absolutely take this life and do as much with it as I can.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I can't rationalise how I'm able to do such things. Maybe it is ADHD? Who knows. All I know is, I now know what I'm capable of and I'm trying to leverage this to succeed.

**The problem? Realizing just how much executive functioning is impacting my ability to do this. And therefore, to actualise myself.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I now realise that what once was self-doubt, immobalised by ""procrastination"" is the result of a traumatised mind and brain that is constantly in fight/flight and neurologically different, whether that be CPSTD, ADHD or both.

What I've used to overcome the executive functioning challenges so far has been using my adversity and pain as fuel and truth seeking and seeing what life and society are about. Using my knowledge and past, I was able to induce fear/worry about my mortality and lack of time to fuel urgency around the shortness of life to shock my brain into change whilst in lockdown. I didn't want to go back to that old life and I didn't know at the time but, I always need something to do. So in lockdown, I had all the time in the world (as my brain perceived it) to change my life. And it was the best thing I could think of to do during lockdown.

But this has come at huge costs - further traumatising my brain with fear, sacrifices like being completely socially isolated even digitally (I've had almost no loving or safe human contact for most of my life, never been in a real relationship), crippling anxiety about breaking the ""routine"" I've managed to build for myself when lockdown ends (I don't want it to, I operate best alone and inside with all the executive functioning deficits), overworking and doing too much everyday but also feeling the need to cause when I don't I feel COMPLETELY lost and paralysed by not knowing what to do, even if its something as simple as eat food. Theres a lot more but I wanna get to the point...

&#x200B;

Now, I'm trying to make huge life decisions. Or at least commitments. I'm basically on this planet alone. With no one to help me. No family. No nothing. And so, I've got to do all this by myself. I've come to accept my past (although therapy is needed but time and money are things I gotta work towards getting to do this). I've come to accept my life will never be ""normal"". I've come to accept so many things that were very hard pills to swallow. I've come to accept, I will never be able to fit into society. Not just from a neurological standpoint, but also, a psychological one too. I think and see the world differently.

&#x200B;

The one thing I can't accept, is my brain holding me back from what I know I can do to create a life that works for me. Objectively, removing emotion and feeling from my knowing - my brain is holding me back. Despite all the knowledge, strategies and the rest, it's fucking with me everyday. And thats messing with my mind because I HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE. I know whats going on. It makes it worse. And thats manifesting into apathy, depression, lack of motivation, and honestly? Suicidal ideation.

The thought of having to live my life, waking up everyday dealing with feeling held back, is killing me more than being alive some days. After everything I've been through, I deserve to have a good, successful, peaceful (and hopefully happy) life. I want to travel, I want to create things, I want to be independent.

But I'm sat here wondering, how on earth I can make any of this happen knowing that pretty much everything I do is impacted by my brain. It's soul crushing, terrifying, anxiety-inducing, and probably making the executive functioning worse, ontop of the depression. It's a vicious cycle.

I've been working remotely so my colleagues think shit is fine but the absolute insanity that goes on behind the scenes (the meltdowns, the crying, the burnout, the overworking) is what people don’t see and... yeah. It’s insane to be inside a body you feel is completely against you. That’s how it’s feels every minute of every day right now.

I'm working towards using my story to help others. Two life goals I have are travel (and nomadic working) and achieving financial freedom so I can get the external help (therapy, assistant, treatment) I need to thrive and leave all the pain, suffering and challenges behind me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The key to everything I want to do? My brain. My mind too but I've been working on that for years (and part of me wanting to do all this work on my brain is so I can continue doing that work).**

The biggest problem I have right now is feeling paralyzed by planning and my brain immobilising me using fear to not do the things I know I can and should do. This subsequently plays with my mind. I literally go into freeze because I realise that, 1, I have to even do the coping strategies to operate and 2, making the right decisions daily that will benefit me, not only to survive but to work towards success, feels very hard when in reality, I KNOW what I need to do. But spending hours hyperfocused on details and the exhaustion of doing things adds to that fear. 

I sit here, trying to figure out what to do, yet ironically, there's a million things I want and need to do. Its such a goddamn paradox and it hurts cause I lose more TIME to deciding and picking/breaking down things, instead of just getting on with it and having time for myself, which I rarely ever do. And this is all with having zero social life, zero obligations and still not being able to fully look after myself (tidying etc). My brain is costing me more time than I've already lost in life.

&#x200B;

I've taken this week off work. Its the first time in over 18 months I've stopped with nothing planned. And it's REALLY hit me how even with ""freedom""/downtime, I can't relax and I'm kind of terrified by having nothing planned that isn't working. My life before I got diagnosed was literally me doing nothing but surviving and I never want to go back to that. 

I have time this week for me, to do what I want and need to do, yet I feel completely lost and don't know where to start/what to do when I have so much to do. Realising how paralysing it is to always be ""on"" and have NOTHING planned.

&#x200B;

I can't describe it, its like an invisible wall, and I spend hours everyday planning and replanning my day. It destroys me. To be a fully independent as a person, I HAVE to be able to do things and look after myself. For much of my life, what I did was dictated by other people (work, family etc). I wonder if life will ever get better or if this is worth it. I don't care to even fit into the system of society. I want to create my own system to live in this world.

**I need to master my brain so I can get things done. I've woken up half way into this week off work and realised I need to master executive functioning in a way that works for me so I can eventually work for myself and create a life that works for me. And that means money, time and treatment.**

I refuse to let this brain and my past hold me back. But living life this rigid to survive is killing my ambitions cause I can't see how with freeze/flight cycles of CPTSD/ADHD dominating my life.

I have the to do lists, I have the planners, I have the timers, I have the music playlists, I have the exercise, meditation and diet (rocky but consistent enough), I have exhausted almost every single strategy you can think of. I think at this point, I need to get to the root and treat the brain itself.

I have a list of things I identified I still need help with optimising. If anyone has any pointers for me on any of the following, and maybe even in the context of my specific situation, it would be a godsend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

***Executive Function & Productivity Stuff*** ***(if anyone has a system they use, it would be incredible to adopt and try out)***

\- How to plan without being paralysed/freezing and anxiety due to not knowing how long things will take (ways to overcome this cause I've become scared doing what i love and want to do from fear of fucking up, overdoing it, not having the time to finish it which impacts task initiation)

\- How to see past NOW/TODAY and realise there is the future to do things (e.g. I can do some of the things I want to do in the future and understanding that exists, I don't have to cram it all into one day/right now)

\- How to not spend 4 HOURS planning my week (too long)

\- How to not spend days, weeks and even MONTHS making a single decision (its crippling)

\- How to efficiently plan goals & dreams that have multiple steps (travelling, health etc)

\- Setting my own mini-deadlines (timers have worked but they do so less as the brain gets used to it)

\- Not excessively doing things due to time blindness (i.e. researching trauma without intent for 4 hours and spending an hour writing this thread)

\- Sequencing tasks so I do them in order (I get things done but its all over the place)

\- Sensory overload (I think this might be another condition though)

\- Estimating how long things take & prioritising tasks (this is halting my dreams)

\- Filtering out irrelevant data that isn't necessary to my intention (I always end up taking way longer to do things instead of just doing the thing, maybe hyperfocused related)

\- Batching tasks (this has worked in the past but picking the right thing is so key)

\- Testing out different routines and schedules to see what works for me (I'm very much a night owl but the older I get, the less energy I have)

\- Tips with processing/learning issues (inc reading, writing, I find it hard to learn new things and apply them, e.g. music I tested myself with, its like I'm hearing another language even though I understand the basics, still doesn't register well)

\- Planning for flexibility (a change in schedule completely throws me off into anxiety at this point)

\- How to induce internal accountability when you're alone (this was my circumstances in the past, but I think my brain has gotten used to it and cant be tricked anymore)

\- What kinds of outsourcing has helped others? (an assistant? a specific type of coach?)

&#x200B;

***Executive Function & Trauma (CPTSD/ADHD) Stuff***

\- Can executive dysfunction be reversed with treatments or medications? (apart from ADHD meds) 

\- Have you experienced using MDMA, Ketamine etc to heal and has that restored functioning? 

\- Learning to trust myself and teaching my brain that I'm safe?

\- Kinds of treatments should I start off exploring? EMDR? Somatic? IFS?

\- How have you managed to become independent and/or successful with the brain challenges?

&#x200B;

**TLDR: I need to master my brain so I can get things done. I've woken up half way into this week off work and realised I need to master executive functioning in a way that works for me so I can create a life that works for me and allows me to achieve my dreams and goals. The list above is stuff I need some pointers on. I need any and all the advice/help I can get.**

&#x200B;

**I realise this was very long. Sorry. (This is part of the problem, I overdo it with everything). I'm only 18 months into this journey of knowing about trauma and ADHD etc. I don't have a lot of time to research as I'm dealing with health and personal circumstances that make it hard to find time I need to research deeply. I'm EXTREMELY grateful if you read and can help me in anyway. Truly. I can't put it into words. Thank you so so much. I hope to be in a position of giving back one day.**"
"Does CPTSD have to come from household violence/abuse only or do outside abuses such as bullying also play a role? Can it come from a ""later"" life trauma (age 9-18) or does it have to be early childhood (age 0-8)?",9,mh8c5y,17,"The more and more I read about trauma, the more I realise what my life has been the past 10.. hell all my 20 years of life, and the more convinced I am I have this.

The one thing I'll ask though is does it have to come from parents only? I was emotionally neglected by both of my parents in crucial years of development such as around puberty and teenage years (I don't particularly remember before age 10 so I can't say for sure), mom was an alcoholic and had her own problems and forgot about me, dad forgot about me as well, of course with a job which I can definitely excuse but he also spent like 6 hours on the TV instead of looking after me, I've witnessed a lot of domestic violence all my life and quite frequently - breaking, yelling, dad crushing his head on the wall, wall and doors breaking, smashing objects, etc (which I've also read that someone witnessing it is just as bad as being the object of violence), and I've also been chronically bullied from middle school all the way to the end of high school, on and off for like 7 years.

I'm not asking for a diagnosis, I'll talk to my therapist about it, but can a combination of these three things \[neglect, constantly witnessing violence in a toxic dysfunctional household and being under stress, and bullying\] culminate CPTSD?

I remember being left completely alone in a hopeless scenario - inside the house I was witnessing violence and I couldn't reach out for help, outside the house I was getting bullied and I've believed the world is a horrible place all this time, I've lived in hell all my teenage years.

And I wanted to ask about flashbacks.

I was walking outside and noticed broken dishes and I froze up, disassociated if you will. It reminded me of a time when my father broke dishes and shit.

I freeze up when someone's laughing cuz I think they are laughing about me and that they will bully me.

I was eating mashed potatoes and it reminded me of a time when my parents were arguing and my father picked up the pot of mashed potatoes and angrily threw it, there were lots of scenarios like this.

I always wanna cry when I remember and I always remember the way I felt. Would these be flashbacks?

I don't remember when the domestic violence was happening, I asked my mom and she said it has definitely been happening ever since I was born, so that's (at least 10) potentially 20 years of witnessing it, 7 years of bullying, and like 5-6 years of emotional neglect.

&#x200B;

Thank you.

**TL;DR:** Witnessing domestic violence for at least 10, potentially 20 years, emotionally neglected for 5-6 years, bullied for 7. Main question is can bullying lead to CPTSD?"
Re-traumatising myself,17,mh4b4v,8,"I want to keep it vague to avoid triggering anyone but I sometimes engage in behaviour that would retraumatize me, for example social media stalking. Does anyone have any insight as to why I would do this and how to understand how detrimental this is for my healing?"
Is it bad that I only feel comfortable around three friends only?,3,mhfqra,3,"So I have a lot, lot of friends that I talk to. I'm close to a lot of em but like, I only feel truly comfortable with three, those three are very laid back, non-judgemental, deal with some of the same issues I do and are really nice guys and I actively feel the want and need to check in and comfort them when i'm a lil worried or want to make the effort to message them a lot because they mean a lot. I still like a lot of my friends but I feel like I can't fully be my most authentic me around them, and get worried I anger them a lot. But with those three friends in particular I never really feel that way and they make me feel good. Is it bad that I don't tend to be comfortable fully around other people?"

Say it with me...,415,mgkzhq,31,Just because your abuser was abused does not justify the abuse they did to you
"Yesterday I felt soooo good, today I wish I was dead",116,mgt69p,10,"The swings in this healing process are so hard. Sometimes it was easier just to feel awful all the time. Because the moments of feeling good and like I'm going somewhere make the crashes that much harder. I guess the moments of feeling like I'm becoming are more frequent and deeper. But that somehow makes these lows harder too. Sigh.

Edited: sigh not sight. and while I'm at it BIG sigh

"I went for a walk and ended up walking through a graveyard, I've never felt so much love around me.",205,mgp0gd,29,I started reading all the text on all the graves. There is so much love behind these words. So many beautiful poetic lines. I broke down and full on bawled with my knees on the grass. I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings anymore. Some guy ended up walking by and he totally respected my space and just wished me all the best as he continued walking. It felt so nice. Graveyards are places where I feel free to let any emotion run its course despite being a public place. Where all emotions are unconditionally accepted by everyone. I imagine this is what a home is supposed to feel like :)
Does your brain freak out this badly and just stop working around people?,28,mgzyjo,6,"Cross-posted to /r/BPD, since I think it could be relevant to either

Sometimes during social situations, especially if I'm caught off guard, it's literally like my brain doesn't work. The world around me feels like it's closing in, or like I'm floating away, and my brain is falling to pieces. My brain can feel a million miles away, I'm not even processing what's in front of me for the most part thanks to overwhelm and dissociation I guess. Half of my brain is in a distant place trying to escape the anxiety, overwhelm, discomfort and pain, and the other half is fighting like hell trying to bring me back down to earth so I'm at least halfway present.

I literally, functionally, feel almost like a 5 year-old in that moment. Because I can't just think and talk like a normal person in their 20s. My brain stops working, the fear and anxious thoughts I'm having magnify and the parts of my brain that actually think about anything else are just gone. I don't look around at the world around me and have thoughts like I might when I'm alone or less anxious - 90% of my brain functioning is going toward anxiety, anxious thoughts about myself and what I look like or what the people around me are thinking, and trying to fight the anxiety. If you asked me to think about something that took much deep thinking or a little bit of intelligence, I either could barely do it or straight up couldn't, depending how bad things are. Or my brain goes wild, tears everything into a million little pieces and goes a million miles an hour trying to analyze everything. 

Sometimes I end up just giving up, give in to the dissociation and spend the whole time just trying to be what I think the other person wants me to be (I think that's probably kind of ""fawning""). For a few years a while back I thought it was getting a little better, but I think that's just because I was avoiding a lot. Kind of trying to figure out whether CPTSD/PDs/anxiety alone can cause this or not. I'm still not 100% sure if I'm autistic, have BPD or another PD, or both, + CPTSD.)


Does anyone else experience things this severe, or is this probably not just CPTSD/PDs?"
Realising that I am affected with cptsd at late age,6,mh8jh3,8,"Hi, I want to know if I am the only one that found out that he has cptsd issues, only when he grow up older. I am currently 20 years old, when younger around 18-19, people used to look up to me, and still, some do, and they never knew my issue, but now when I am growing older I feel anxiety is taking control over me, so does my past memories. I would love to know if there are similar people like me."
EMDR,2,mheud9,1,Has anyone had a lot of improvement through emdr? I’ve been doing it for about a year now and have seen a little improvement. I was just wondering if there is something I should do prior to my sessions like meditating or grounding work so that I can easily access my trauma? Anything helps
I guess I had a breakthrough?,13,mh22cr,2,"So,  if you've seen any of my comments - I realized about a year ago (right before I turned 39), that I probably need therapy to heal & move on from my childhood.  And also, I realized: I don't have to allow my parents:  to hurt me.  To be in my life.  To be in my kids' lives.  To hurt my kids.  To judge me.  To dictate to me.  To shut me down. To take space in my head.  To pull me or distract me from things that I find important.  

As I'm doubly blessed to have *TWO* narc parents /s, I'm sure you can imagine how that went.  

It sent my mom into a frenzy because I wouldn't meet her for my 39th birthday.  It's been threats of police,  text messages asking how therapy is going with laughing emojis after & a surprise visit on *her* birthday - when she knew (or thought,  at least), that my husband & I wouldn't be home.  *AND*, for an *added* bonus,  blaming our no contact on covid - not her behavior.  

My dad,  for my 39th, threw a card on the table, said happy birthday & made a snide comment about my wanting space (in my kitchen).  And couldn't understand why a card that starts ""who loves you"" and ends with something along the lines of ""we all feel that way sometimes""  wasn't appropriate after my declaration of not wanting to celebrate,  needing space & needing to heal from my childhood.  It ended with a lot of yelling and a period of no talking.  

So,  February was my 40th. A lot of emotion was tied to this one.  The *original* plan was to go to Mardi Gras. My mom *loves* New Orleans & has visited multiple times.  Once, with me.  So,  of course,  she had invited herself along for the birthday trip, when it was still a few years out.  Well,  with no contact,  and with Covid,  that trip didn't happen for anyone.  And,  I was off for my actual birthday & had a short week for the following few days.  My husband had said that he wanted to plan a gathering,  but I realized that all the people he was talking about inviting were *his* friends.   So,  I cited Covid & said that sounds great for *his* 40th. 

Being in this sub,  I'm assuming there's probably a few others like me,  with *ZERO* healthy coping mechanisms. Watching my parents,  I saw both turn to drugs & alcohol for escape when there were problems.  Or birthdays.  Or Fridays.  Or Tuesdays"
DAE hear friends complaining about their parents and think “That’s it?”,2,mhb0u7,13,"I have this friend who complains about her parents a lot. She’s a nice girl, but is sensitive as hell. She seriously complains over the dumbest things and plays it up like it’s a big deal.

She talks about how awful her life is, but her life is actually very privileged. She has a loving, financially affluent family.

Once while we were at her place, her mother was pressuring her to do the dishes. Her mother didn’t even force her or yell at her; her mom literally just asked her to do it multiple times. She threw a fit over it and got all hissy, all because her mother asked her to wash some dishes? And she was 17 when that happened. Come on. 17 is too old to be acting like that.

Another time, a different friend of mine was off ranting because her parents were ‘playing favorites’. It was Black Friday, and they were both given money to spend. Her older sister got more spending money than she did. She whined over it and said her parents were being unfair and favoring her sister who was 7 years older than her.(Maybe it’s because older kids get more responsibilities?) I told her that, and she went off at me saying that I didn’t know what it’s like to be mistreated by my own parents.

I dropped the subject, but let me tell you, I know more about abuse than she could ever know. And she’s lucky she never had to go through it.

You want to know what mistreatment looks like? Mistreatment is when my father threatens death upon me. Mistreatment is when my father tells me to kill myself, or that I’m no longer his child, just because of small things like clogging a sink. Mistreatment is when my father does these awful things to me, then acts like it’s my fault for making him angry. 

I just think it’s hard to relate when I hear my friends complaining about their parents. They haven’t been through actual abuse before."
Feeling sorry and ashamed for making people sad (symptom - selfharm),2,mhd2r8,2,"....but why?

Alien, Differently addicted, strong but guilty for failing, a bad person, depressing others, .... it's almost all colors except gladness, I cant quite feel glad that people care, I am afraid that I force them to care against their will.

"Being Percieved by others triggers me, what do I do?",46,mgv8uv,13,"Whether I'm in the same room as someone, or they're in the house with me, even if they're out of the house but I'm imagining them judge me for whatever it is... I get triggered and knock out dissociate on the spot. 

I get it, I'm emotionally numb, but still functioning. This would protect me from others *cough* parents *cough*. 

I wanna know how to overcome this response. I feel myself use the False Self projection (?) --- that customer service voice 💁‍♀️. I hate this defense, even tho I know how it's protected me. I'd rather be my frank self with others. 

I'm coming out of a family of long standing abuse, so it's extremely difficult for me to feel At Ease near others. I can, and have been improving, but have a hard time trusting people won't suddenly hurt me, sabotage me, humiliate me, etc. 💔 

Any suggestions?"
They call me strong. But they have never seen the side of me (TW: multiple),10,mh3e1b,6,"The side of me having a major meltdown and went hysterical. 

The side of me that's desperate for justification. Why am I the way that I am? Why did I deserve the treatment (abuse)? 

The side of me having flashbacks during bed time. They haunt me and I have to fight so hard to be able to fall asleep. 

The side of me that's constantly exhausted and have no will or motivation in life. 

The side of me that feel worthless, undeserving and unloved. 

The side of me hoping to numb all these feelings by taking drugs/alcohol. But because I don't, so they hit me so hard and real. 

The side of me that has no clue about my true self. Is it the stable, functioning mask I put on? Or am I just made up by a bunch of self defense mechanism? 

The side of me that splits when someone changes tone, or use a wrong choice of word.

The side of me that has suicidal thought.

The side of me that's constantly in fear, hypervigilant, and on high alert. 

They see me having a good life. Have a job, a house, a car, being high-functioning and productive. 

So they call me strong after knowing what I went through. Told me not to look back and start a new life.

But they will never see the other side of me, because I hide it so well. I isolate myself during episodes. How would they ever know? It's almost impossible for me to show vulnerability."
Bone conduction headphones,50,mgv0vc,7,"I hike alone a lot. It’s part of my process and since I started going out into the woods with only myself for company I’ve made some real progress.

I often listen to audiobooks, podcasts, or music while I’m out there. Sometimes I just want to be alone with nature, but sometimes I want to distract myself with something. I used to use AirPod pros for headphones. I’d put one side in and leave the other open so I could hear any animals or people who come up behind me.

As I’m sure you all can understand, I don’t like having anything sneak up on me. Even with one side open I was often startled by other hikers. Even though I would quickly assess that I’m safe, the autonomic nervous system would still start up and I’d get panicky. It kept happening to the extent that I started checking behind me every ~30 seconds. Hiking became stressful rather than beneficial.

For Christmas my husband got me a pair of bone conduction headphones. The brand I have is called AfterShockz and they’re fantastic, but there are other options and I’m not trying to shill. They sit just in front of your ears and use vibration to conduct sound. Ambient noises easily override any sound coming from the headphones so since getting them I haven’t been startled once.

They don’t work well in city type environments because the noise from cars drowns out whatever I’m listening to, but they’re life-changing for hiking. I highly recommend for anyone with an overactive ANS."
Medical reminder,594,mge6en,138,"Hey guys!

I've been thinking and want to remind you, that if you've got the resources: get bloodwork done!

**Get your vitamins and minerals checked!  Get your hormones checked! Get intolerances and allergies checked!Get whatever else warrants getting checked! Persist in the face of negligent doctors!**

So many times there's a physical ailment adding to our pain and it makes everything so much harder.

Simple things such as vitamin D can have a high impact on our mood. I've got multiple nutritional deficits and I was losing my mind.

DAE get desensitized to things that bother others?,6,mh622g,4,"Abused by my father, an abusive ex that forced me out of the closet, and raped by my classmate. I’ve been through quite a bit of abuse, and nothing else really bothers me anymore.

This guy in my university made some misogynist jokes about abortion on social media. He got expelled from university and everyone hated him completely. Were his jokes appropriate? No. But are they worth expelling over? I don’t think so. People were SO angry at him. There were many people who spoke out on social media expressing disgust. I didn’t approve of his jokes, but I wasn’t that offended over it. As a female myself, I didn’t think it was that bad. Meanwhile, my girlfriends were all fuming angry.

Another time; in high school, we were discussing racism against Mexican people. There was a Mexican student in our class named Simon. Teacher turned to Simon and said “Simon, since you’re Mexican yourself, you should explain to the class what your opinion is on racist stereotypes”. In the moment, everyone was too scared to say anything, and I myself didn’t think much of it. When I told my friends about it later on, their jaws all dropped. They were in shock. I didn’t get why they were so surprised at first. When I told other people about it, the same reaction. Once again, everyone else was upset over it while I couldn’t see what was so bad.

A third story: There were these two girls in my friend group, named Lily and Wendy. Lily was trash talking Wendy, and she was kicked out of the friend group pretty swiftly. Like damn, teen girls talk trash all the time. I didn’t get why it was so terrible in their eyes. All my other friends unfollowed her. Lily went from being one of our best buds to being out of the group, just because she said some mean stuff behind Wendy’s back. Everyone was talking to Wendy and supporting her unconditionally(myself included). It was kind of a big deal, and I didn’t understand why. I still talk to Lily sometimes, we’re still on good terms. The rest of my friends don’t speak with her anymore.

To others, all three of those stories were shocking and messed up. To me, it was nothing. After the abuse I’ve been through, those things were more entertaining than anything else. It was pretty interesting to watch the drama unfold.

Is that weird?"

Does anyone use tabletop RPGs to try out new personalities?,1,mhg054,11,"This *just* occurred to me.

IRL, I want romance, but I'm very shy about approaching anyone. I assume that people are offended/threatened by the very idea that I feel attracted to them, and so it feels like the more respectful thing is to just never talk to anyone ever. (It doesn't help that I'm male, and men are often seen as dangerous/dishonest in these matters.)

But if I made a character in a tabletop RPG, she could be a *terminal flirt*. She could be fearlessly approaching NPCs all the time and we could just play out the consequences, good or bad. I could practice this other side of myself without worrying about actually offending people. (Also, you'll notice that I'm thinking of making the character female, because it makes me feel less guilty. The way I've been trained, it's ok for a girl to be interested in guys, but the reverse is dangerous/perverted.)

If I found the right group, I think this could be really helpful.

Has anyone tried this before? Did it help you?"

New work supervisor and I’m not sure if I should skirt the issue or be frank about it.,2,mhabqr,4,"Back story. I had some major issues with ptsd affecting my work 1.5 years ago. Ended up on a PIP about the time I was diagnosed. Started treatment. Disclosed to my boss the basic diagnosis. Survived the PIP. Supervisor was available and helpful as needed and that really set me up for success. I’m now doing well in my roll, but definitely still deal with triggers frequently. 

That supervisor moved to a different company earlier this year. New supervisor started a couple weeks ago. They seem decent enough. 

I suspect my boss has already given them a heads up about me. But now I’m like “how do I react now if something triggers me?” 

Before, I’d just message my supervisor if I needed to take a few minutes away from my desk or take an afternoon off, etc. It didn’t happen frequently and it was never an issue. Now I feel like I have to navigate building this foundation all over again.

I’m probably overthinking this. But it’s so very frustrating to deal the uncertainty and anxiety around navigating a new work relationship while dealing with ptsd."
I have a weird inner child “fantasy” of sorts,45,mgtiz9,15,"I feel like the word fantasy implies a lot of unintentional things, but I think to myself a lot about what it would feel like for this to happen. 

It’s nothing too specific - I think I just want to be able to cry and be openly upset and have a meltdown like a very small child, and for some type of caregiver/safe person to respond to that in a comforting way I guess. I think I wish someone else would step in to do the soothing besides myself. But in this fantasy I don’t have any hang-ups about feeling guilty for accepting that kind of help. 

Certainly not something I would ever admit to anyone in real life"

"Trauma just keeps compounding, sometimes indefinitely",4,mh3ypd,2,"I am lucky in that I've had an opportunity to break away and stop the cycle and heal. But some people aren't so lucky. I'm thinking about a couple I know from a meetup group. They are both deeply traumatized, they wear it on their sleeves, and their lives just get harder and harder.

For instance, the guy likes to be big and scary, intimidating people unnecessarily and then, of course, will deny that was his intent. But the thing is that his behavior has consequences. During the pandemic, he was let go from his job. That caused him and his now wife to lose their health insurance. Then they got into a car accident and had to figure out how to pay by themselves.

Lack of friends, unstable job, higher health risk. Trauma piled on top of trauma for them. I feel sorry for them. The thing is there's nothing I can do for them. Until someone has started healing, until they have asked for help, you can't just say ""Hey, have you considered the possibility that you have loads of unprocessed childhood trauma? Have you considered that you might be highly codependent?""

No, you can't ask people those things because they'll blow up. Their defenses are still in place. So I, and others, just kind of stand back and watch their train wreck unfold. And it hurts because I used to be in their shoes. I used to have no friends and bounce from job to job. I know they need to hit rock bottom and then ask for help before they are ready. Until then, their trauma will just compound in on itself."
The amount of dismissal my mom uses on a daily basis,2,mh9i3u,2,"Tw: for firearms.

My mom tried to normalize gunshots in the city. 

My apartment complex has gone downhill since Covid, and apparently the area I live in has been going down in the past five years. I’ve lived next to drug dealers so I know any of these units may be shady af. Safe now and I only have a few more weeks before I move.

The other night I woke up to two gunshots. They were at a distance but close enough for me to role out of the bed and retreat into my bathroom in case a fire fight broke out. Luckily it was just the two.

I was telling my mom this and she just kept saying oh it’s normal!!! People just have guns and fire off round into the air for the joy of it.

It’s normal but not ok on New Years. It’s normal in the country (target shooting). It’s not normal where I live on a random Sunday night.

She normalizes it because her precious son committed so many threats of gun violence against us that she’s delusional.

At this point in my recovery it just makes me laugh and I can call her out. But it also just makes me sad for how much gaslighting my teenage self endured. Very glad I don’t live with her and that I am moving.

(Plus I’ve had firearms and training and never do I have the urge to just randomly pop off a round. That’s stupid and people can get hurt. Not normal and dangerous and someone or a gas station was probably getting robbed.)"
Progress!,35,mgubjn,3,"So, yesterday I was taking a hit from my pipe and wasn't paying attention to where the lighter was. I singed my thumb a little and I started going down the downward spiral of my inner critic beating myself up as usual. Then I stopped myself. I told myself *It's ok. You didn't deserve that. You just weren't paying attention.* And that's was it. I'm so proud of myself! Here's to breaking the cycle!!"

"Problem with ""angering""",16,mgxx42,7,"I'm a big fan of Pete Walker's work, but I get hung up on his advice to meet your Inner Critic with anger and self-defense. How does that not turn into ""beating myself up for beating myself up""? Instead of my Inner Child being rejected, now it's my Inner Critic. Still a lot of self rejection. Richard Schwartz talks about this critical voice evolving as a way to try and protect us and keep us safe, and we should try and befriend it. Thoughts?

Resources for dealing with hyper-vigilance?,1,mhda4f,2,"Are there any youtube videos or self help books that deal specifically with the hypervigillance side of cptsd?

im physically tense every waking moment. my muscles make crunching sounds when i massage them. the only thing that relaxes my body is cannabis (but it numbs my emotions and therefore i cant engage in therapy) - so ive quit it for now.

I read most of jonnice webb - running on empty but what i read of it didn't deal with the physical side of trauma... 

ive started yoga and that seems to offer some relief through grounding and stretching ... but only partially, not every time and only while im doing it.
The moment i stop im braced as if someone or something is about to hit me. 
Right now typing this there isnt a single muscle in my body not at 60-70% contraction.
its painful and exaughsting and thats just the physical side. The emotional dread that goes with it is unbearable.

i want to meditate and just 'chill' but i dont know how to chill... i dont think ive once chilled (not exceptionally high) in my 30years alive. id like to listen to an audio book or feel comfortable sitting or lying down doing nothing.
but im so wound up and on alert that sitting down is an activity that i purposefully have to make myself do. and its like an endurance test as it is anything but relaxing and pleasurable. 

i know why relaxing is not deemed safe by my brain due to a toxic unsafe family dynamic. and i dont feel i deserve to relax nor do i believe i am worth the effort itd take to relax myself.

but those shameful beliefs i try to challenge when i feel strong enough...... but my body... no matter how much i get onboard psychologically with the idea that i do deserve to relax and wont be punished for it... ----- my body is always totally tense and ready for a tiger to stroll into the room.
How do i let go? know any resources that could teach me? thanks."
Anyone else have 3rd person memories?,55,mgpsbt,15,I only see my memories in third person and apparently its because I detached myself from those situations so I wouldn't have to fully deal with them emotionally at the time. Dissociation be like that I guess.
"(trigger warning) Rant About my Codependent Ex Girlfriend, and her smear campaign (I'm autistic and have CPTSD)",1,mhcens,1,"This is all the things I wish I could tell my codependant ex gf, who triggered me intentionally through reactive abuse. Emotionally she was a very manipulative person, she's no longer in my life, and I've set many boundaries between me and her.   I have autism and CPTSD, it's hard to explain the situation, mainly I'm posting this to share my story in some form anonymously, to warn others with autism about befriending their ex's, also the hidden warning signs of codependency. It's better to disengage then continue when you see these patterns.

She is a student studying to be a social worker, and she gaslighted me pretending to be my friend for several months before meeting up for a coffee and in and initiating reactive abuse.  She played the role of a therapist, and pushed my boundaries severely. I tried to get out of it, told her i was uncomfortable talking about fixing me. She pushed and pushed until she got all of my secrets out of me, gaslighting me in person also. 

 She then emotionally abused me, telling me i wasn't living a realistic life at all, and that some people live as their disability while others actually live life being more than their disability, which was severely dehumanizing for me as an autistic adult who is a survivor and a warrior.

 I lost my temper (shouted) at her outside of the coffeehouse because of my CPTSD/autism and she later started a smear campaign against me claiming I was a stalker and possibly a violent abuser. I had to move to a different community due to harassment and death threats I received  within the community.

NO WONDER YOU'VE NEVER LEARNED TO HAVE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS. YOU'RE A MANIPULATIVE PERSON WHO LOVES TO PLAY A PRETEND THERAPIST, HOWEVER YOU CAN, AND THEN SMEAR YOUR EX'S REPUTATION. IT'S BETTER TO HAVE NO CONTACT THAN TO PLAY MIND GAMES AND TRY TO FIX SOMEONE/INITIATE REACTIVE ABUSE

I WISH YOU NEVER TRIED TO GET IN MY HEAD THE WAY YOU DID, TRYING TO FIX ME, MOLD ME, SHAPE ME, BECAUSE IT WAS CRUEL, AND HAS ACTIVATED MY TRAUMA.  IT ONLY TOOK 30 MINUTES OF YOUR ABUSE TO MESS ME UP FOR MONTHS

YOU CLAIMED I WAS AT A POINT WHERE I DIDN'T WANT FAMILIAL SUPPORT, OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE A HEALTHIER FAMILY, SINCE YOU CAN LIVE WITH THEM AND GO TO UNIVERSITY.  MY FAMILY IS UNSUPPORTIVE, AND HAVE BEEN EMOTIONALLY UNAVAILABLE FOR MY WHOLE LIFE.    

IT ISN'T MY CHOICE TO HAVE A BROKEN FAMILY, FROM A BROKEN HISTORY OF SYSTEMIC RACISM, RAPE, COLONIALISM, SEVERE ALCOHOLISM  ETC.   I LIVED FAR AWAY FROM THEM TO WORK ON MYSELF, AND TO BETTER MY OWN COPING SKILLS.

 YOU'RE THE OBSESSED ONE, THE ONE OBSESSED WITH FIXING ME CODEPENDENTLY, STOP BEING CODEPENDENT, IT ONLY MANIFESTS MORE SITUATIONS LIKE THE ONE WE'RE IN NOW. I WANTED TO BE YOUR FRIEND ON EQUAL TERMS, I DIDN'T NEED TO BE FIXED, CODEPENDENCY TO SUCH EXTREMES IS NOT BEING NICE

IF YOU DON'T ENJOY THE EXPERIENCES THAT YOU'VE HAD, THEN FIND NEW EXPERIENCES, STOP PLACING YOURSELF IN THESE SITUATIONS, TRYING TO FORCEFULLY FIX  YOUR EX BOYFRIENDS THROUGH SHAME, MANIPULATING THEM AND THEN ENJOYING PLAYING THE VICTIM.

It’s going to be nearly impossible to date/be in a relationship,62,mgodqi,18,"I may be super negative here but I’ve realized that I am kind of jealous of those who get to experience stable, safe, HEALTHY relationships. 


I hate dating. It gives me anxiety. I have a hard time trusting men but I do recognize there are good people out there! It never goes well when it comes down to opening up a bit. Like: hi yeah I’m a little fucked up but I’m really working on it I also can go up these specific mountain anymore or do ____ or ______ :)))


Ultimately, the person would WANT to learn about the triggers and how to go about them. They would WANT to understand to an extent. 


Personally, I have the things I need. But I’ve realized that the one thing I want to experience is a healthy relationship. If anyone out there has, I’d love to hear your stories."
"Too dissociated to live alone, too hyper vigilant to live with roommates",30,mgt3oe,7,"Has anyone been else in a situation like this? I’m a college student who can’t go home (abusive family), and I’m struggling to find summer housing. On one hand, if I live alone for too long, my suicidal ideation and dissociative disorder will likely get much worse. I don’t really trust myself to live alone for three months with my dissociative disorder (I feel like I’m much too likely to just leave the gas on and walk away by accident, etc.) But I‘m so terrified of other people that I can’t imagine living with anyone else. I feel like I’m really stuck between two equally terrible choices here. 

I keep putting off making the decision because my symptoms are so intense nowadays, and both options seem so awful. But I know I can’t put this decision off forever. My housing situation is preoccupying my mind to the point where I can’t even think about anything else. None of my classmates are in a similar position- they all have families they’re eager to return to- which really adds to the intense loneliness of my situation.

Has anyone been in a similar predicament?"
Has anyone else sued their sexually abusive parent years after it happened?,13,mgx84o,6,"I went to law school literally for this. I know that sounds crazy, but this man has gotten away with so much. He raped my mother, sexually assaulted me 12 years later (yup, I'm a rape baby), got custody of me, abused his new wife, his new son, who later died, and now has two young daughters. No one in his family gave a shit. I was called a slut by my aunt at 12. I went through an incredibly invasive medical procedure. This man should not be around children. I want all advice I can get, please. Especially if you know New Jersey- specific things. 

This is just something I have to do.

5 years of Survival,9,mgyx7g,2,"TW: Sexual Violence and Suicide 




So background, when I was 18 I did a gap year program and on the last day with the group a man in our group who was my friend waited until I was shit faced, manipulated me to let him stay at my hostel, and raped me in my bed. And throughout all of 18 I was being repeatedly assaulted by different men in different situations. 

As a lot of you know, you just aren’t the same after. For me my mental health went to absolute shit to the point where I had to drop out of college and couldn’t hold down a steady job. Because of these many challenges I attempted to kill myself 3 times, once in 2016 and twice in 2018. I call myself a survivor because living in the aftermath of rape was nearly deadly for me. The amount of shame I felt was so unbearable, death sounded better. 

After my third attempt, my parents and I began to realize I needed real help. In the summer of 2018 I went to a partial hospitalization program in Portland, OR for a month and then a residential treatment program for 45 days to finally get a handle on my PTSD and MDD. DBT therapy and medication completely changed the game. 

Fast forward less than a year later, I lived out one of my biggest dreams to celebrate my journey in recovery and I hiked 2,650 miles on the Pacific Crest Trail. I didn’t get to graduate college like all the rest of my friends and peers, but I got to say that I walked from Canada to Mexico, which made me feel accomplished in another way. 

On this trip I did get revictimized. It’s going to sound fucked up, but it almost felt like a test in some way from the universe. One thing I remember telling myself during treatment was that I could never be assaulted again or I would not be able to handle it, and probably die. But then it happened again, and while obviously it was scary and confusing, I was able to handle it. Instead of keeping it a secret and letting myself live with it alone, I told my aunt and let myself ball my eyes out instead of living in denial and being numb. I let myself feel my pain. I let myself know it wasn’t my fault this happened again. And I was able to use the coping skills I learned in treatment. I had to get off of the trail because I was scared of seeing him again, but the next day I walked out with my backpack on and head held high and somehow hiked all the way to the border of Mexico. 

This has been a long ass journey that has felt like at least a decade, but I’m proud that I’m alive today, regardless of the horrible things in my past. I take three different psychiatric meds every morning to stay stable, and sometimes it feels like  a reminder of my past. I think to myself “I’m taking this hand full of pills because of what men did to me” But I’m just happy to be alive. Even these past few months I had detailed plans of attempting again, but I was again able to use my skills from therapy to make it through. 

So let’s celebrate! I have survived 5 years!"
I don't know what to call this,40,mgp94o,10,"When I was 9 or 10 years old, my dad called me into his office and showed me a stack of bills on his desk. He showed me the bill from the hospital when I was born. He said he was still ""paying me off."" 

I remember being so confused. And anxious. I still don't know how to think about it. For context, my family would be considered well to do and often drops $50+ on eating out 2-3 times a week."
How do I work out what I need after a breakdown?,7,mgzqi9,2,"Cw: incest, CSA, eating disorders, intrusive suicidal thoughts

I'm doing a law degree and last week's lecture on Thursday was about sexual offences. And it specifically included a discussion on the defence of coercion for incest. 

I could feel myself getting overwhelmed, with the feeling of a lump in my throat. But I just kept pushing forward since I had an online test to complete.

Unfortunately I didn't fully communicate all this to my partner and later in the night he made a sexual advance which I was unexpectedly triggered by. I tried to escape and accidentally hurt him in the process which of course made me feel so much worse. I could see it all happening in the third person.

I ended up just sitting on the floor hitting my head against the door and briefly screaming. I can't even believe I'm typing this. But I've been dissociating and repressing it all for 8 years so now it's like I'm feeling what I should have felt in the first place.

My partner and I calmed each other down and talked it out. I emailed my psychologist. I organised an appointment with the university counselling service but it won't be until mid next month.

I haven't done any course work since Friday and I keep trying to do my study schedule so I know what I need to work on but my brain is just defaulting to avoidance.

I don't know if I should try to force my way through to just do the course work, or take some time out. The anxiety just keeps screaming at me to do the course work but I don't know if I can handle it right now. And university doesn't have any accountability which I've struggled with before. I barely passed my first degree. I've been getting high marks for law at least.

Healing is so up and down.

Are there any specific things I should be doing to take care of myself? I'm also in recovery for an eating disorder so I'm not using food to dissociate. I've been eating okay and sleeping okay, but barely showering. I got myself some shiny new weights yesterday as shopping therapy because I've found that lifting kinda grounds me. 

I don't know. Maybe I just need to give myself permission to rest. But I'm stuck in that mindset of self-neglect where even though I'm not doing the course work I'm still pushing myself mentally. I've started having intrusive thoughts of not wanting to exist anymore as a burden and I am frightened of them.

I had my usual appointment with my psychologist yesterday and we just sort of discussed it in general.

I've been trying to meditate with body awareness, and doing grounding exercises. I don't know how much it's helping.

So that's where I'm unsure. I ask myself what I need and all I get is a want to go to sleep in the middle of the day. Are there any particular self-care behaviours that work well?"
Intermittent affection,7,mh0cjk,4,"I don't know what this is, but have you feel like certain person 's affection fluctuates randomly? That you don't know if they will overprotect you someday like you aren't a functioning adult and next they forget about your existence (implying they care about others more)?

I never experienced this before, other people in my life seems pretty stable (with moods, but they just don't forget about me).

Making you guessing what you did wrong this time, going crazy about that and anxious? But when you confront the person they make you feel guilty of asking? 

Is everyone like that??? Am I crazy? People that loves me all the time are lying to me?"
Adjusting to life with CPTSD,3,mh0ai3,3,"CW: alcoholism, reference to attacking “threats”, thought of suicide, I think that’s all

I’ve adjusted to life with cptsd for the first time. It’s weird. 

I have realized a number of things since I got stopped drinking and started focusing on my CPTSD:

- I have had CPTSD for a very long time and I didn’t know.

- I used to visit doctors all of the time with unexplainable conditions. I have extensive chronic pain. They said it’s trauma- related.

- I only drank to escape feelings, so I always drank to black out. I didn’t want reality. Reality is hard, and I’m having to feel the feelings I have been running from since I was young.

- I have experienced so much gaslighting for so long about my condition from manipulators and abusers, I was in denial about CPTSD, just believing I was “crazy”.

-  I have noticed that i now internalize everything and constantly people please. When I used to drink, it was to avoid negative emotions, thoughts, or feelings. When drinking, the desire to people please (edited for clarity)/ caring what others think were both gone, explosive anger surfaces, and impulsivity is at the max.

- the self- hate I constantly felt was CPTSD and not having a positive self- image whatsoever. I don’t even know who I am sometimes. I don’t know how to explain it. I feel lost.

- I worry about leaving my home, or when my husband goes out. Thinking the entire world is incredibly dangerous, and used to drink to be able to feel “okay” outside of my home. Since quarantine and adjusting, I never want to leave my home again. I can’t even watch the news without panicking, which makes me paranoid sometimes.

- I avoid anything that makes me think or feel a negative emotion. I have to work with a man that is not kind, but pretends to be. He’s been aggressive with me in texts, I’ve had my husband double check them, making sure I wasn’t taking something too harshly. He’s a trigger. I hate working with him, I avoid him at all costs, but he’s unavoidable. Situations where I feel trapped, like my current work and school situation, are too much for me. I feel unsafe, and as if people don’t like me. I never say anything, I just internalize it. Disliking myself more and more. I used to drink to be able to deal with people/ places/ things that triggered me to make it easier to deal with. The social anxiety alone is too much. I don’t feel like I fit in anywhere, I feel very different than everyone else. 

- I like to be at home with my animals and/ or husband. I don’t like people staying at my home, it makes me anxious, I realized it’s because I feel unsafe (edited for clarity) with people in my home. I’m content. I have extreme social anxiety. I only have a few people I have let in, and I don’t even tell them everything. I don’t trust people. While I want to have a child, I worry about them being out in the world. The world is just violent to me. I fear they will deal with violence and trauma.

- I have a lot of broken relationships. I push people away when they try to get close, friends and partners. I attracted friends with the behaviors of my abusers. Toxic and nasty people that I would stay around, not realizing my self- worth at all. They would do horrible things to me, and I would just let it slide. I’d trust people and they would slight me, and I couldn’t handle it. The toxicity issue has occurred especially with potential partners in the past. And I have had a couple of long term partners (years each), and they all treated me poorly. My husband held out when I wanted to be alone for a while. And I’m glad. I was definitely dating iterations of my abusers for years and years. He isn’t like them at all, he is nice, caring, understanding, etc. Feels weird to be married to someone that treats me well. I constantly worry that the toxic people that I have broken relationships with are going to harm me. I don’t know why. I also have damaged relationship with other people, mostly all alcohol- fueled, to be honest. But I do. 

- I have a detachment from my emotions sometime. I numb out and disassociate frequently, or feel things too intensely. Not emotional outbursts. Just up and down sometimes.

- I have thoughts of wanting to die or to not be alive frequently. I don’t have plans, I don’t attempt, I just have overwhelming shame and guilt. I always feel badly for everything I’ve ever done in my past, the things I can remember and the things I cannot. I think of a broken relationship and feel shame and emotional flashbacks, not even remembering what occurred to break to break the relationship, but flashing back to a feeling from another time. It was always in the midst of an awful episode, though. I haven’t broken relationships while in recovery, but I also don’t have episodes very frequently anymore. When I do, it’s just like the world is too much, or I am in intense fight/ flight mode.

-  i have been told that my CPTSD is severe by multiple mental healthcare professionals.

- I don’t want to do anything that I’m doing in my life. I have sought to people please for so long, I never asked myself what I wanted. By the time I did, I was at explosion level. I don’t know what I want to do, but I know I don’t want to do this.

- I have emotional flashbacks, but don’t know where from. I don’t have many flashbacks to my trauma anymore. But I have emotional flashbacks frequently. I used to have reoccurring dreams of things my therapist said I blocked out. I don’t know how I feel about this still. It doesn’t feel real. Most things don’t feel real and feel surreal.

Did I mentioned I hate myself? I’m told this is normal. I still don’t have much self- worth, clearly.


——

When I would drink, I would drink to black out. Every time. No matter the day of the week or responsibilities. I couldn’t cope with the world or stressors of the world. I would drink to escape.

My behaviors:

- I would bottle everything up from people pleasing, etc. and then explode when drinking. I saw drinking as “an emotional release”. The emotional regulation was very different. My husband could look me in the eyes, and tell I wasn’t there. It’s like all of my trauma would come out in rage. Sometime, engaging in violence with people that I deemed to be a threat to friends I was with or myself. While sober or even just not drunk, I would never in a million years. When drunk, my manifested rage would explode all over everyone around me. My therapist said I was acting out the anger of my (edited for clarity) traumatic youth and adulthood.

- I used to have to lie to cover- up what was happening at home. I don’t recall ever really lying before that. I also recall being told a lot of lies about myself and others when I was young by my abusers. In adulthood when blackout drunk on my meds, I would lie. I wouldn’t remember it. But my husband used to tell me that I did. I guess to cover- up that I was having an alcohol- induced CPTSD episode, put the distraction elsewhere on some other issue? I’m not sure. I don’t really lie otherwise. But apparently I really believed what I was saying. I don’t remember anything, some of the stories I’ve been told about myself when drinking are honestly shocking. They would be in the midst of a traumatic trigger or high stress situation (where I felt trapped), it would be multi- day bender, sometimes going on/ off for weeks, while also on my CPTSD med cocktail. My psychiatrist and therapist both said that this is what happens when drinking at the levels I was on medications. I couldn’t figure out why I told these lies. I was so confused, I was sure I had a misdiagnosed, and thought they were delusions. But the therapist and psychiatrist both said that they weren’t, and they’re a part of having an episode. I’ve broken so many relationships through this. With alcohol, the episodes of drunken erratic behavior would go on for days, sometimes for a week, with a break, and then another week. I don’t remember almost anything I did during those episodes.

I don’t drink anymore. It’s been a longtime. But it’s weird to remember these things, and to have constant emotional flashbacks to them. 

I don’t know why I wrote this. Maybe because I just wanted to talk to someone about how I felt about all of this, (edited for clarity) because no one I know understand. I understand myself so much more. I wish I would have figured this all out a long time ago. I people pleased myself into mental health crisis, reacted to my emotions for a long time, my emotional regulation was not great before, then I began bottling and exploding when drunk. But I wish I knew how to manage it all before now. Life is really hard. But I’m sort of making it through. Should be asleep. Everyday is a long day and is so draining. I don’t have energy for anything. I hate it. Did I mention extreme insomnia? Because that, too."
I created a boundary- and it went well!,50,mgm0mu,3,"Hello! I thought I'd share a story of a little victory I had this week!

Some background: my workplace is casual, almost familial at times, which has both its joys and pitfalls. Although maintaining boundaries sometimes is very necessary, I love my coworkers. One of my coworkers in particular has always been especially kind to me, ensuring that I eat (I have hang-ups about food and compulsively skip meals as a result).

We frequently exchange phone numbers at my workplace for various reasons, both work-related and otherwise, and this person asked for mine. In general, I don't feel comfortable texting or calling older people, even if their intentions are innocent, so I gently refused, telling them I didn't feel safe giving my phone number out yet.

And it was well-received! They said, ""It's okay, I understand. It's important to be safe."" We worked together amiably yesterday. It's like the conversation never happened.

It probably sounds strange, but creating boundaries is terrifying for me. Now, I'm not certain of what I was afraid of. I'm very glad to have a coworker who respects my boundaries, and I'm proud of myself for taking, what is for me, a gigantic leap in my healing."
Going to my first therapy session tomorrow and nervous,9,mgxgh3,6,"I have such a massive amount of anxiety thinking about it, I've got things filled out and ready but like I'm so worried I'm just gonna be quiet like I usually am.

"My therapist asked me what the unscathed, vibrant me needs to be able to come out and live. In my mind arose this incredibly BEAUTIFUL vision:",29,mgp6en,5,"He asks me this question as the disgusting, yucky prison in my mind really shows it's reeking face.

I am standing on a vast medieval looking bridge high up in the clouds, spanning from horizon to horizon. Behind me is all the darkness, the disgusting pile of disgusting fuck I've been carrying all my life, trying to drag me back on the bridge and hold me in place. In my hand is a badass, huge sword. 

I reach back with the sword and with a mighty, rageful, radical blow of fucking liberation I shatter the entire fucking bridge right behind me. I take a breath and turn forward. And there it is: the horizon. 

A gentle, beautiful sky with picturesque clouds. The tender, light evening sun gently strokes my face and dips the scene into the softest, most gentle and divine colors. A breeze of fresh, clear mountain air fills my lungs. It's a fucking fairytale from heaven. I really want to go ""there"", without a clue what it holds. But it looks so incredibly nice. It radiates freedom. I drop the sword, stretch my body and breeeeeathe. 

My T asks me what I see. I tell him the above scene. I see the horizon. I see endless possibilities. I see ease. I see a future that gently invites me to come explore the opportunities it has in store. I look beautiful in this scene. I'm handsome and powerful, but also tender and gentle and wise. I'm at complete peace. I'm full of love and peaceful anticipation and my body feels light like a feather. I see heaven on earth and I'm right there. I see LIFE. My life that is patiently waiting for me to get to know it.

Jeez, today was a great session"
DAE feel way too attached to some small event?,3,mh1qsn,11,"My trauma comes from a few places, I've been working on identifying them recently. I've also been trying to listen to my feelings instead of just pushing them down when I think they're ""wrong"" and I've hit one I don't really understand. 

When I was young, maybe around 4-7, I brought a small stuffed bear to the fair. It was one of my favorite toys, when I was a kid I carried toys all the time. Well I lost it at the fair and it was heartbreaking, my parents even helped me look but no luck. The thing I don't understand is I'm still sad about this years later. Sometimes it hurts just as much as it did that day, to the point where I get choked up talking about it. I'm 22 years old. I've felt the emotional repercussions of this for years and I'm still shaking them off and I just can't understand why. As an example, I get this stress and deep sadness when anyone shares that they have a precious comfort object, because some part of me is positive they'll lose it. 

In terms of my confusion, there's the obvious ""it's just a toy"". Second, I wasn't treated poorly, my parents helped look for it and my mom took me to different stores to try and find a new one without my even asking. 

I want to make clear that this is by no means my biggest problem, it's just the most confusing one that is also very persistent. 

Does anyone else have any experiences like this, some small thing you can't let go of? Why do you think it's still bothering you (or me)?"
My ex-bestie keeps using my therapist as if she is our friendship counselor,11,mgvr22,5,"Last fall my friend sent an essay long letter addressed to me to my therapist instead of me. It resulted in an entire session feeling hijacked and an overall awkward situation where I felt ambushed, undermined, and intruded upon. While we definitely needed to address the things she'd talked of in her letter, I still felt that going through my therapist is entirely inappropriate and that she please never do that again. 

Flash forward to February 1st. She comes at me out of the blue about how I'm a bad friend who doesn't reach out and always makes the conversation about me and my problems. To be fair, I'm sure it has felt that way in the past year. I've been going through intensive recovery for CPTSD, anxiety disorder, depression, and an eating disorder. The recovery causes me to relive trauma from childhood, to which there is a lot. I've needed a ton of support and for friends to kinda just sit with me while I recall the sadness. It always seemed to make her uncomfortable, so of course I withdrew somewhat. Anyway, it all bursts that day and I said a lot of things but I mean, i felt like a broken record at that point. I'd even offered that different relationships are for different purposes in our lives, perhaps her purpose is not to be someone I talk to about the struggle, and that's really really ok. But she said her therapist suggested we take a break and so she was going to do so. I was just waiting for her to come round, you know?

I took her off my social media because I was reeling enough over it that I didn't need her at the top of my feed every day as a constant reminder. I guess she took that as, don't talk to me. Because next thing I know she's emailing my therapist again, today. 

My therapist seems flustered and frustrated as well. I feel beyond violated. She says im the email (my therapist read some to me) that she doesn't feel comfortable reaching out to my partner or friends where I live because she doesn't know them but there are older friends she could have reached out to and it's not as if I blocked her on my phone or Gmail.

I'm just confused. Am I crazy or is this like..pretty messed up? What do I do? It feels petty? She also said her therapist suggested she contact my therapist again. That feels unreal to me? Like, either a bad therapist or something she's making up. 

I am they/them btw. Thanks for any advice."
How do I tell my mom that I failed? What do I tell everyone else? How do I begin?,1,mh7dep,3,"TW: Family trauma, abuse, insomnia, social anxiety, may make you paranoid, suicidal ideation

\[ I'm sorry for the word vomit in advance. I just typed whatever is going inside my head so, somethings may not make sense. \]

I haven't told my mom about how I failed a big project which will equal my class grades. Haven't replied to my teacher either because I don't know what to say. I don't understand much either but I guess because this project stresses me the most and that it will be expose to many that it triggers my fear of failure and getting beaten for that failure. It's irrational, I know, and I accepted that at one point. But when I did, my mind clicked his tongue, and presented me with flashbacks instead. And that worked. I know I'm safe but it's still fucking me up inside. I'm still a scared little girl in the end. I'm still scared to sleep at night because I don't know where our abuser is, and I'm scared he might come. Or someone else might come. Our balcony can be climbed, and windows can shatter even if we lock our doors and gates.

I still wear my earphones even though one of my ears are aching from it, because I couldn't take the noise. I feel protected at least even a bit mentally with them. At least, it can possibly distract me from the ringing screaming, shouting, crying, and whipping in my head. I'm still scared of people because they said they are evil people out there. And if we're not staying away from someone who beats us, how evil could they be? Like that man in the ending of ""To My Sister""? Or that mafia boss in ""Banana Fish""? Worse than that? And what do I do with this fear of failure if their fists, belts, and words are not far from reach?

It's all irrational but the reason isn't. And if its grounding and roots are not irrational as the fear that stands and chases after me, doesn't that after all mean there could be some truth in what's been plaguing me all my life? And how exactly do I discern the truth? How would I know what's the lie in it better than when I believed that some of my family could change? If I can't discern what's in front of me, how can I know what's inside me that I can't see but only feel? And I don't know much about feelings? Heck, it took me so many years to know about anger, fear, and sadness, and still ongoing with the different types of love. So, how do I know? Where do I even begin to tell anyone about this?

What do I tell my teacher who said she won't hesitate to call the authorities if she figures about any toxic home environment, even when it's over? What do I tell my mother who is already struggling in work and having lost someone precious to her recently? Who do I turn to? It's not like someone would randomly rescue me from this situation, and solve my problems for me. I'd rather not. I really want to solve them myself and I honestly don't want any more people to get involved but I don't know if I can do it alone. I'm lost. I really did my best and I'm still trying to, and I'm trying to do my best to keep myself together from being done with it all. I don't know what to do anymore."
I finally cried - now I feel guilt for having shown emotions,24,mgqf64,4,"I just had my first therapy appointment with a new counselor and while I am generally speaking completely emotionally numb I started tearing up 3x while talking with her.

DAE have flashbacks OF their flashbacks???,37,mgn865,10,"OMG. This has been happening to me for 10+ years!!! So I've been having flashbacks of my flashbacks. As in, if I have an emotional flashback I will then associate everything I was eating, doing, wearing, listening to etc. with the flashback and if I go near these things again, they trigger a visual, sensory, somatic, and/or emotional flashback of the flashback.... crazy. It's like a cyclical thing... or Dante's circle of hell. I am having crazy flashback inception I suppose. And let's not mention the flashbacks of the flashbacks of the flashbacks etc. etc. 

So am I the only one? It makes my home, personal possessions, fave music, clothing, fave food, tv shows etc. become emotionally 'tainted' as they become triggers so easily (as I might have a flashback in their mere vicinity)

I held a man as he died exactly 1 year after my dad died,84,mggo2o,5,"When I was 12 my father died in tragic circumstances. He was stabbed to death. It was 2010. I'll make up a date. 26th August for instance

When I was 13, on the 26th of August I was walking to school when I saw a man collapse. I was alone, I ran to him and uses the raised road blocks as leverage to get him on his back. I put my arms around his shoulders. He'd cut his head. He tried to speak to me, he looked me In the eye and died.

I fainted, then called an ambulance. I found a man jogging who helped me and put his arm around me and walked me to school. I was in shock.

I was never explicitly traumatised by that mans death. I don't believe in destiny, but it was a very weird coincidence.

"If a 12 yr old & 50 yr old have a sexual relationship (verbal only), is that trauma?",7,mgwtqm,6,"Please help. For years I've let myself ignore this, and told myself it wasn't a big deal at all, and it didn't affect me. But I'm having weird feelings I can't really describe, and I'm wondering if this potential situation is even worth brining up with my therapist.

I'm in my 20s now, but I grew up in a very abusive home. Like a lot of younger people, I found solace and companionship with people, with strangers, on the internet. When I was 12, I began talking to a man in his late 50s. We talked every day for over 5 years. He was the first person I ever said ""I love you"" to, and for a long time I felt he was the only person who really understood me and knew the real me. Slowly but surely he turned the conversation more sexual. Until eventually I seriously considered moving in with him, marrying him, starting a life with him. He would ask personal questions and make uncomfortable comments related to sex and development. He would insinuate and...I don't want to say ""brainwash,"" but he made me seriously believe that sex and a future with him and only him was the only future in store for me. I never told anyone in my family about him, but this relationship with him was my entire life for many years. He was the only person I told very personal things about my traumatic and abusive upbringing. 

There was no touching or physical sexual interaction, which makes me think this wasn't a big deal. Please help. What do you think?"
I hate myself for getting triggered with a lot. I feel like I give my boyfriend a headache,1,mh6aqv,4,"I can't tell if my triggers are triggers or valid to be upset about.  But I expressed to my bf that I didn't agree with the way he talked to a coworker and he expressed that this took him by surprise and hes been quiet via text all morning. He was assertive over a decision at work and borderline condescending to his coworker and that triggered me I guess.


We don't live together but will live a lot closer soon. I'm worried I annoy him with all my shit and now that I'm moving closer, what if he's doubting our relationship?"
"DAE find that reparenting their inner child feels ""wrong"" because it feels like an act of ignoring and bulldozing over ""how the world works""?",49,mgk0wo,15,"Some point along the way trauma became equal to ""how the world is."" My mind's playing games because: 

* The og parenting behind the trauma was the brush that painted the way the world works. 

* In replacing the og parenting with my own parenting, my nervous system still thinks my og parenting perception of the world is true and fixed even though I changed the ""brush"" I'm painting with now, so to speak. 

Whew the explanation was the most unclear lol. In other words: 

As a child, OG parenting determined perception of world. So logically, new parenting now should change my perception of world. Not the case. My nervous system's convinced my perception of the world is divine truth. The cause-effect relationship's reversed with my existing perception deciding my parenting instead of what it was before. 

The answer is challenging beliefs and changing the way I feel about things. I think? No one told me it would be this hard. :("
Breaking up with my abusive boyfriend,2,mh2lji,3,"For the past two years I’ve been with a man. He told me what to say, how to say it, when to say it. We fought physically. He blamed me. He told me I was shitty and worthless and crazy etc. 

I told him to do the dishes, he told me he was going out with friends, I got mad. He said “I’m shooting an arrow down the hall” as a “joke”. I was like “you’re gonna shoot me like you shot your mother?” (Suicide attempt gone wrong. She’s fine). He got mad and smashed my computer. I got mad and pushed him. Eventually we’re on the ground and he punches me in the face and I have a black eye (cliche). He left a note today after I told him I signed a lease that says “I’ll see you on the other side”. I freak out and go to his mom. She starts screaming her ex husbands name and being all crazy. I freak out and leave. I call the cops, but lie and change my story because if they saw the bruise and the note said “I know we fought”...  

His grandma calls me and is like “he’s fine but don’t break up with him”. He shows back up and he tells me how he should have appreciated me and how I’m great and the love of his life and blah blah. 

Fuck I’m so tired of this. I’m a mental health worker for Christ sake. This is literally textbook abuse. (No advice only validation pls)"

"DAE feel terrible for letting comparatively minor trauma effect them this badly? I feel like my abuse wasn't ""bad enough"" for my issues to be so severe and I take away from people who had it worse.",3,mh0dvz,9,"I (28m) was recently diagnosed when I had a bit of a breakthrough with my therapist. We had been getting  to the reason for some of the issues I have and I casually mentioned a time where my 8 year older brother dragged me around the house until it ripped my underwear off. My therapist kind of honed in amd asked me about other things he did growing up. I told her about the hitting, the threats of violence if I told, the physical intimidation into giving up pokemon cards or video games, the times he would force me to plastic sword fight when I didn't want to and he would hit me hard enough to bruise, etc. and she asked me if I knew I had been abused. It took me aback because I thought it was normal sibling stuff and she just told me it was abuse. Then I talked about how he would hold me down covered in a tightly wrapped blanket for a long time as I begged him to let me out, had a flashback of it, and cried over zoom.

Long story short she said I was abused and may have c-ptsd. I have a lot of trauma from my brother but part of my brain thinks of it as ""normal"" older sibling stuff and that it wasn't ""bad enough"" to really be abuse. I know that what he did is abusive and my partner has been supportive, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm blowing it out of proportion. 

Has anyone else had similar issues with accepting a diagnosis or that they were abused? Has anyone else dealt with sibling abuse? Am I weak for letting what is comparatively minor trauma affect me so much? I just feel like I'm spinning and don't know if this was abuse or normal sibling stuff that went a bit to far. I would really appreciate some input because now I'm wondering how much of all my symptoms stem from unresolved trauma relating to this.

Tl;dr At the age of 28 I realized that my 36 year old brother was very abusive growing up and my therapist thinks I have c-ptsd from it. Has anyone else had trouble accepting that they were abused and that it created a lot of problems later in life?"

The trauma and suffering was real too and if people in your life don’t understand/respect that then they don’t need to be there.

Feeling guilty about being loved,6,mgvht8,3,"I originally posted this in an OCD sub but I think you guys might be able to relate better...

TW: suicidal ideation, self-hatred

My OCD and trauma history are very intertwined. A lot of my intrusive thoughts revolve around hating myself, feeling worthless, deserving abuse, and most of all wanting to die. A lot of my compulsions revolve around making myself seem a little less worthless.

I have a long-term partner who is wonderful, and despite the fact that I treat him well, I feel incredibly guilty about being in a relationship with him. It just feels really wrong of me to let someone plan their future with me in it when I don't want a future at all. I am not actively suicidal, I'm fairly confident that I won't ever commit suicide despite really not being into this whole ""living"" thing, but it still feels like I'm wasting my partner's time. He has a bright future ahead of him and I don't believe that I do. He has a will to live and all I have is an aversion to making my mother bury me. He knows about my traumas and PTSD, he knows about my battle with OCD, he has seen me at my worst and he still chooses to be with me. Despite this, I feel like he deserves better than me. Someone who wants to be here.

I guess I'm venting. I welcome solidarity, support, suggestions. Thanks for reading."

Where he is being hunted down by a monster who is made up of his own face, and the face is every face he's ever seen. We both have different times of feeling like pieces from other people or from media and things we've seen before."

Actually, that’s partially a lie. After thanksgiving passed, he had messaged me and one other phone number in a group text asking what the “plans for christmas were”. I replied with “you’re a piece of shit”. That other person must have been so confused, I’m almost intrigued to know what excuse my dad told them. But at the same time, I know if I heard what he probably told them, I would probably be crushed. Anyway, it’s been almost 6 months now. I said I didn’t want to talk if he wasn’t willing to have a hard honest look at his life and an honest conversation about the abuse he inflicted on myself, my mom, and my sister. He didn’t say a single word. No sorry. No faked confusion.  Nothing. His girlfriend didn’t even reach out to me. So she just accepted his reason for no longer talking to his daughter and followed his lead? Not totally unfathomable. I did it for years and years growing up. Always thinking he was my savior from my mentally unstable mother, without ever realizing she was the way she was because of severe mental, emotional, and financial abuse. Peppered in with some physical and sexual. He did the same to all of us...and he has to know it. Narcissists still know what they’re doing is wrong, right? I was his only blood child. He loved me so much when I was young and moldable. Before I knew better. And that father has been gone for a long time. He never existed, is the worst part honestly. I had it in my head he was a good dad. Until I didn’t, and no matter what I did I couldn’t continue to fake this relationship with him that’s rooted in...a false sense of myself. I can’t be an authentic person around him, that person is stupid and doesn’t know what she’s talking about. I couldn’t pretend anymore. And I lost my dad. Well....he lost me. I gained my freedom.

I am starting to feel like a whole person again,9,mgrscm,2,"I am feeling the healthiest I ever have in my entire life. Physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. 

The happiest I had ever been prior to this was in college, years ago, when I was regularly exercising and surrounded by friends I adored and who adored me back, living on campus, around May 2009.

August 2019, I was living in Michigan. I was horribly depressed, to a degree I could not recognize. My fibromyalgia was still completely unmanageable, although I was JUST starting to realize how helpful Full Spectrum Oil is for my body. I was drinking so much I was officially a functioning alcoholic, my relationship with alcohol was wildly unhealthy. I barely had any physical activity, I couldn’t, I was in too much pain. I was at my peak weight, the heaviest I had been my whole life, and it exacerbated my fibromyalgia to a degree I didn’t understand at the time. Depression, drinking, never moving, I was starting to become pretty unrecognizable to myself. My relationship with my parents at the time was at its very worst in my entire life, and I was finally starting to recognize the signs of childhood trauma manifesting in an adult body. It is so fucking clear to me now that my chronic illness is a direct result of my childhood trauma. And I’m pretty sure the trauma I experienced in college kind of... finished the job? I don’t think my body stood a chance, knowing what I know about the connections between chronic illness and childhood trauma. 

September 2019 Nick and I fell in love. We were mutual friends who stayed connected over Facebook, but he lived in California. I started pushing myself to use the treadmill, a quarter mile at a time, to build some stamina for all the sight seeing we were going to attempt when I visited him (with the plan to keep me loaded on edibles). For the first time in a long time, I had a kernel of hope that life was going to get better.

October 2019 I moved to California. Permanently. (Yes after only a month, when you know you know!) Everything started to change. I could move better. I WANTED to move. I took long walks, on purpose. I still drank a lot, but already so much less. And after about a month, even less. As time went on, I realized I was barely drinking compared to the way I had been, and I pointed it out to Nick. He said something to the degree of, “Yeah I totally recognized that, as soon as you got here. I noticed when you started cutting back too, and I’m happy for you.” And essentially we puzzled out... I was using alcohol as pain management back in Michigan. Not just depression management! But physical pain management. In California, that’s when I started exclusively using cannabis to treat my fibromyalgia pain. And falling in love was definitely helping my depression pain. Oh, and going no contact with my parents. Cutting my toxic mother out of my life was the very best medicine. It’s pretty clear that in Michigan I had been drinking myself into an early grave, but in California I have a healthy relationship with alcohol, the way I always hoped I would. Socially, not constantly. Because of cannabis. I noticed I was dropping weight like crazy. (DESPITE the cannabis, haha). In fact, I’ve lost fifty pounds. Between the walks, the lack of booze, the increase in water, THERAPY, and most importantly: an unconditionally loving environment with Nick and Cal (my bonus son), my body finally was able to start to heal itself. I’m finally starting to feel like the old me. I’m finally living in a space where I feel safe enough to be vulnerable. My partner helps me feel secure enough in our relationship, so I feel comfortable breaking decades-long codependent habits I’ve built up. 

Do you know what’s crazy? I just found out at the doctor today that I’m the exact weight I was when I was my happiest in college."
DAE feel like they're untying smaller knots in their web of trauma but the heavy emotional trauma mass at their core won't budge even after years of working on yourself?,369,mg5hr2,41,"This isn't something I think I can explain coherently in words. I've been in the healing game for several years and incredible changes have happened in me without a doubt. People from years ago would hardly recognize me.

After hours of introspection and investigation, what that tightly packed mass really fears and how it operates eludes me still. The core feels made of poison and rottenness. I crave a cleansing light to shine through and clear it all up. I want that simplicity, lightness and purity some people seem to have naturally. That simplicity that remains clear and cohesive rather than murky and shattered into pieces. I know on a level I'm making the choice to consistently tear myself apart when I could keep myself intact but the emotional barrier to changing is so high.

I never ever celebrate my birthday and the one year I decide to throw a small get together, no one can make it. And I invited over 20 people. I am realizing that I dont really have any real friends, which makes sense because Im a shitty person. 

I totaled my Dads car a few days ago by running over a rock at the park that tore out my radiator. The security guard threatened to call the cops on me for an honest mistake because it was “federal property.” I am a small black woman, so this was extremely triggering. 

My dads super pissed at me and told me to “get a job” and started comparing me to my cousin whos a successful lawyer at 27. I started self harming again and accidentally put a hole in my wall. Ive been starving myself and not leaving my room and all I can think about is punishing myself and how much I wish I was someone different or didnt exist. I dont know what to do. Ive hated myself to my core since I was 13. Thanks for listening."
I fucked up so bad.,62,mgdipb,10,"I got mad at my husband over something stupid and I just decided to walk 2 miles at 4am. It's something my dad used to do. Anytime he would get mad he would just be like ""okay I'm leaving"" and he would just start walking. I don't know why I did it. I think I was hoping someone would kill me. I hate myself so much. I keep doing this shit. I don't know. I miss my dad. I dont know what to do. What am I supposed to do? My husband probably hates me now. I keep ruining everything."
Can anyone explain this strange compulsive behaviour?,6,mgt9ot,10,"I've had this weird behaviour for as long as I can remember, age 3 or so. I think it is related to my childhood trauma (emotional neglect from both parents and always-yelling father) and would like to understand it better.

When I was a kid, I would spend a lot of time spinning my hands around each other with closed fists in front of myself, and making sound effects to go along with whatever I was fantasizing about. I think it started off pretending I was driving motorcycles.

This behaviour never stopped, and there have been a handful of times when family members have walked in while I was doing it which resulted in incredible embarrassment. 

As I became an adult, I suppressed the movement a lot but there is still an urge to kind of shake my fists and make a slight sound at certain times. 

I only ever get the urge when I am at home by myself, and there are some common patterns to my thoughts that accompany the behaviour. It is usually fantasizing about future scenarios (realistic or not), in a sequential, numeric way. Some examples:

\- Fantasizing about the weekly medication amounts changing as a family member tapers off their drug regimen.

\- Fantasizing about the progression of skills or abilities learned (like university education achieved) over the course of months, years, decades.

\- Creating imaginary products, like a line of car speakers, and thinking about how they would progress in specifications and price along the product line. 

When I go into this compulsive behaviour, it is quite sudden and I might not realize I'm doing it until during/after. I once accidentally recorded myself with my webcam (I didn't know it was on) and it was quite shocking how quickly, briefly ""possessed"" I looked as this behaviour came on while I was doing other things.

I can sometimes catch myself before I engage (for some reason going to the bathroom and sitting on the toilet is often a trigger), and I could choose not to do it, but it feels satisfying to some part of my mind to let it happen. It seems like a catalyst to creativity & fantasy, except it's often the same useless scenarios over and over again.

I asked my friend, who is an occupational therapist that works with children, if this or other parts of my personality led her to think it might be autism-related, and she didn't think so, but she also hasn't ever seen me do it. 

Is this a form of dissociation? A sign of autism (which I don't really understand and haven't looked into), something else? I'm open to hearing any input that might help me understand what is happening. Thanks."
Is feeling negative come naturally or we choose?,2,mgz08r,3,"Im not sure if i choose the correct flair.


I used to be get angry/sad/upset for big things that heppened to me. but, now slowly i started feeling same for little things. Like, i cant eat that noodle tonight? im sad. I didnt bought that t shirt when i was in the mall, so when i came back, i was upset. 
Yesterday, i saw pics of someone's LO and i was sad because i didnt click my LO's pics in same way.(i wasnt sure at that time but my husband wasnt much interested)

My husband thinks that im choosing things to be upset, im upset because i want to. I sad because im a negative person. 

Im not sure now, am i feeling all this only to play victim?

Pleas help."
Not sure what I’m looking for,8,mgrw3y,9,"I am not well, and I want to get better. I’ve spent a long time believing a combination of a) there’s nothing really wrong with me (and I’m making a big deal out of nothing/seeking attention), b) if there is something wrong with me, I need to just get over it and stop being a baby, and c) there is something wrong with me but I’m *handling* it.     
I don’t think any of those are really true, but they feel true.     
I am doing alright, all things considered - I went to university, and I have a job, and I pay my bills, and I have friends and a loving, supportive partner, and I can drive and do my taxes and go to the grocery store by myself. On paper, I am a functional adult.     
But I am currently coming to terms with the fact that I am not as functional as I have been pretending to be. That it is not normal or fine to be afraid of everyone and everything. That it is not sustainable to only feel good or secure when I’m around my partner. That my ‘coping skills’ are maladaptive and I can’t just do the bare minimum and then lie in bed watching Netflix for the rest of the day. That I dissociate, that I get triggered, that I am not fine.     
I want help, but I don’t know how to ask for help, because I’m not allowed to need help. If I can’t do it myself, it’s because I’m not trying hard enough. I have an appointment with a psychologist in two weeks, which is great, except that I’ve seen therapist after psychologist after doctor, and no one has ever really helped me except my current psychiatrist. And there’s no medication she can prescribe that will heal my trauma.    
I need real, concrete steps I can take to get better. I can follow directions - I’m good at that. If someone would just tell me what to do, how to heal, I think I could do it. But talking and breathing and grounding have never changed anything for me. And I don’t know what else to try.     
So I’m not sure what I’m asking for, but I want to get better."
DAE get paranoid that you are the abusive one?,129,mg91ja,39,"Met with a new therapist and she described one of my experiences as being “stalked.” I described what happened and she said, “You were stalked.” And then later in the evening I had a panic attack about whether or not I am actually a stalker because I have a former flame I text/email about once a year or so. If i can’t recognize it when it’s happening to me, maybe I’m doing it too? 

I’ve noticed this also happens with abuse stuff. Whenever I talk about my trauma, and either call it abuse or if someone else does, I’ll later get paranoid that I am actually the abusive one. 

Does anyone else do this?"
"This weekend my sister is visiting. And no, I will not fawn for her.",10,mgnm8u,1,"I have come to the conclusion that my eldest sister is toxic/abusive. I am so unused to healthy relationships that I thought her behaviour was normal. I also believe that family member's unkind behaviour must be tolerated (I have this belief due to abuse.) I realised that when someone on here said ""If you feel fear around a person, it is your body communicating that they are not a safe person""

I would extend that to feeling fear, self-loathing, worry, and a desire to ass kiss (fawn) when she is near. I also have to hide my interests, true feelings, hobbies, personality, and such when she is around, as I've experienced victim-blaming, criticism, gaslighting, and more when I am open with her.

I will not bend to abusive people, even if she may not know any better, or be uneducated about how to be kind or healthy in relationships, and even if she is uneducated about my mental illnesses.

My mom also feels afraid around her, so I'm clearly not alone. My mom says things like ""She'll be visiting in a week I'm so nervous. She's going to criticise my house."" I told my mom that being afraid of someone is not normal.

So. She will come and I will say 'no hugs - virus' and she will say her piece (I have no idea why she's coming for several hours after 100 mile drive... I assume she has news of some kind) and she can get fucked :)"
Is anybody triggered by clothing?,18,mgjn9o,14,"I’ve had to throw probably half of my clothes in the back of my closet. I can’t seem to throw them out because I feel oddly attached, yet they trigger me! I’m hoping I can wear them again if I ever recover... but I’m wondering if anyone else has a similar experience."
There were no hoofprints in the snow.,3,mguumy,2,"There was a little girl who loved horses. It's all she ever dreamed of, a horse of her own. She might have been 8 one snowy Christmas day, when she was told that she got a horse for Christmas, all she had to do was open the curtains and she could see for herself. 

Did she open them? Not immediately, no. She did know better and wasn't trusting of the source due to their sense of humor and that tricks like this had been played before.  (She did really want to open them tho, she did really want that horse).

Her Dad finally convinced her to open them, those crushed green velvet curtains, and lo and behold, there was no horse. She remembered that the snow was unblemished because she did intensely search it with her eyes just in case the horse may have moved off to the side.  Her Dad thought it was the funniest joke ever.  She spent the day as you would expect.

Later on friends of the family allowed her to ride their horse and she saved and bought a used Crosby close contact jumping saddle. It was $300.

When she finished riding each time, she would put the saddle on the hood of the John Deere riding lawnmower at home, to protect the tree. 

Her brother didn't like this. Without warning, he took the saddle and put it behind the tire of the family car.   Her mother got into the car, and when resistance was felt against the tire, acceleration was used.  This folded one flap of the saddle like a piece of paper, creased right in half and shredded the leather across the cantle.  As luck would have it, she lovingly cared for that saddle prior to this, and oiled and cleaned it dutifully. This prevented the flap leather from cracking in half. 

It took her about 5 years to find someone willing to attempt to fix the leather across the cantle. The job ended up being crude but there was no other way, and her beloved saddle was whole again. 

Her brother was not reprimanded because she was told, while she sobbed, that she should not have left her saddle on the hood of the lawnmower because this is what can happen. 

Not one of us can know what secrets are held in the hearts of others, that they are too ashamed to talk about because they believe these things happened because they let their guard down and let others know their vulnerabilities.  Or simply, that perhaps they deserved it. 

Try not to be so quick to judge their quirks and failings because they are trying as hard as they can, they were just not given the same starter pack as you.  

Due to their life, they've learned to read people like a book as a way of personal protection. You might say they're sensitive they might correctly say it's survival. 

One of their quirks is that to their true friends they are very loyal. 

This ends today's PSA.  If you made it this far, here's some eye bleach and have a wonderful day.

TL;DR the unvarnished me, because I'm changing meds and unfortunately I have no choice but to feel again while I clear one type before I can go on the other type and hope they work better at ridding me of emotions.  My anxiety is currently at DefCon 1.

Edit: omg I used too instead of to and that was understandably causing a high level of anxiety.  

Also, I wrote this because I have nowhere to go with the anxiety and maybe internet strangers are more my family than my family.  Who knows, but I gotta ask... do you give horses to people for Christmas?"
Has anyone found a good medication for nightmares/night terrors?,9,mgnlm0,11,I’ve had intermittent nightmares/terrors with varied intensity for years that have increasingly gotten more consistent worse over the past 3 years. I pretty much can’t get through a night without one these days. I’ve been on cyclobenzaprine for a few months for anxiety/spams and I found it helps get me to sleep but still really doesn’t help with the dreams. My doc put me on prazosin to try to help stop the dreams which I tried for a week but had horrible side effects and it didn’t really stop the dreams either. Any suggestions?
How do you open up to another person about what you've been through when it's just so much?,2,mgx0dd,2," 

Hello kind people,

I’m a little nervous to post on here, but I wanted a spot to voice a question that I’d love to hear some different thoughts on. Let me start by saying, I’ve been doing a lot of work on myself with a therapist over the past couple of years, and I’ve made a lot of progress. I feel like I can (almost) trust her, which is a huge success for me. She is the only one who has joined my life after the traumatic events I’ve been through that I've told about those traumatic events. I have a few friends that I’ve known for years at this point but that I’ve never told about any of the traumatic things. I’m going to talk to my therapist about this topic also, but I wanted to get some of your thoughts because I’ve seen how kind and helpful this community is, so here goes: I feel like I’m at a point where I want to take ownership of my story and choose a select few people in my life to let in. But now that I feel more ready, I just don’t understand how.

My story is kind of insane (which I know is true for many of us here), but without getting into too many details, basically the trauma I’ve been through started taking place after one specific event (my mom passing away suddenly when I was eleven), and then there was a horrible domino effect of trauma that followed (narcissistic and neglectful family, chronic injury, abusive school staff, among other things). I’d say from ages eleven to eighteen I was dealing with a constant bevy of varying traumas. A lot of people in my life know that my mom has passed away and that I’m dealing with a chronic injury that sometimes needs accommodations, but beyond that I haven’t mentioned anything else, and I honestly don’t know how to. In my brain it feels like it all needs to be said in one serious conversation that’s going to take an entire night. But I don’t know how to bring it up, how to phrase it, or how to keep from boring the other person since talking about my personal trauma feels like a one-sided thing to talk about. I also have a really difficult time talking about anything serious and often undercut my own problems with humor, so I just don’t know how to have a conversation like this without going full-on self-deprecating and depressing.  I’m also very fortunate because even though I deal with ptsd-related symptoms, I’m generally high-functioning and appear to my peers as though I’m put together and doing well (I’m especially fortunate financially after finding out about an inheritance that my mom’s side of the family had successfully hidden from me and my immediate family for several years). I feel a lot of guilt with that inheritance, especially when others around me are struggling and have to work so much harder than I do to earn money, and a lot of the time I feel like the fact that I’m currently blessed financially should eradicate any issues I’ve had previously in my life. I fear that when I talk about the things I’ve been through I’ll come across as just complaining. I also start to minimize my own experiences and think “oh it wasn’t that much, you’re really just complaining because you’re not strong enough to deal with life”. I also do want to be conscientious to the fact that living through this pandemic has been difficult for everyone, and for many of my friends it’s been a lot more stressful than it has been for me (both financially and also because not many people are accustomed to plans falling through and their lives changing drastically overnight). I don’t want to bog anyone down with my crap when they’re already trying their best to get through their own crap - if I do talk about things I’ve been through I want to make sure I leave them space to talk about anything they want, or at least make sure they know that I am open to talking about anything, and I don’t know how to do that either. I’m also just not sure how to even mention my trauma at all since it was so many different events that all added up - do I mention one specific trauma and go in depth on it? Do I list the traumas off like a bullet list? I also don’t want anybody to treat me differently than they do now, which is one of the things that scares me about opening up.  

Tl;dr: Basically, I feel that I am at a place where I can handle telling some of my closer friends about some of the trauma that I’ve been through, but I don’t know how to bring it up or talk about it since it's just so much.  

Sorry for a long and rambley post, and thank you guys in advance, even just for reading! :)  I appreciate anybody's input on this post regardless of if they have advice or not, but I'm especially curious if anyone has any success stories of how they shared their traumatic experiences with another human being?"
"""Reparenting to Heal the Wounded Inner-Child."" Very insightful and inspiring.",3,mguntd,1,
Where are the spaces for people with CPTSD that didn't primarily come from their parents but from abusive relationships?,14,mgley8,17,"So I've known of my CPTSD issues for a few months now and been reading Pete Walker's From Surviving to Thriving and I read a LOT of posts on here, but sometimes I don't feel like I truly fit because the majority of my CPTSD symptoms didn't come from my parents. They came from abusive partners and friends. 

Yes, my father was emotionally incestuous with me, yes my mother verbally and emotionally abused me, and yes it was painful to live at home for a good chunk of my childhood. But the *deep wounds*, the *severe emotional pain that leaves me paralyzed* came more so from **other people.**

I was continually and painfully socially ostracized in *every single* social space I existed in for the ENTIRETY of my childhood and adolescence. The only reason it got better was when I started drinking and then I felt people could actually tolerate me. The bullying I endured from kids at school wounded me way more than what my parents did. I can't even bring myself to explain the type of emotional torture the girls I went to school with put me through.

And then there are my romantic relationships. My first partner was 21 when I was 16 and every part of our relationship was severely toxic and abusive. The abuse I endured from him was worse than anything I had already experienced. When we would get in fights he would often threaten to leave me stranded somewhere, and once when I thought he did and I called someone to pick me up, he became furious with me and told me to never call my family for that sort of thing ever again. He used self-harm as a manipulation tactic when we fought, which was daily. I lived through that for a year and have seriously dissociated from that year of my life and done the most I can to heal from it.

Then came OTHER abusive relationships after, partners who mimicked his behaviors. But the absolute worst, **the worst of ALL OF THESE THINGS**, was in a relationship I had 4 years ago. In addition to all the other types of abuse, for the first time I was sexually abused by someone who claimed to love me. I partook in using psychedelic drugs often with him. I was cheated on and given an STI by this man. The emotional torture he put me through put the rest of all of these other experiences to shame. As I am typing this I feel my face get hot and my heart pound because it was so traumatizing and I still don't know how to process it. 

Did my parents play a role in why I chose to be around such toxic and abusive people? Absolutely. Did my core issues of codependency start with my relationships with my parents? Yep, definitely. But did they *continuous abuse me* while I was being abused by all of these other people? **No.** They actually were the only place I felt I could turn to because *they were still safer than the other people outside of my family who abused me.*

So where do I go when all I read about are parents being the awful ones that caused CPTSD? Where do I go when I have a much more adult and healthy relationship with my parents today? That because I've been able to implement healthy boundaries with them and they respect me as an adult and don't continue to abuse me, I don't feel like I belong here.

The worst of my CPTSD symptoms, especially the emotional flashbacks, come from all these other people, especially my abusive relationships. My current issues with self-worth and invalidation came primarily from these toxic people **outside** of my family. My fawn/flight responses fully developed from my abusive relationships, and not because of my parents. 

Where are the spaces that I can be in where I can feel fully heard and accepted because my CPTSD isn't completely tied to my parents? Is there a place for me? I'm in CoDA and AA and do a lot of work there to feel connected to others. But I just want to know who else on here feels this way because I have to imagine I cannot be the only one."
Struggle to connect with people even via the internet? Any advice please.,6,mgqao6,8,"I’ve spent most of this year alone, estranged from family for the last 4 1/2 years (sister the exception ) no friends and living in a new city for 7 months. I can count on one hand the times I’ve talked to someone outside of my sister ( doesn’t live near me)  and therapist. I’ve had 7 months off work due to previously spending 4 years working everyday except for 3 weeks when I went to visit my sister 2 years ago aka was a workaholic to distance myself from the reality of my life. 

I’ve spent the past 7 months convinced I would ‘make friends’ I haven’t or ‘try dating’ I haven’t and have even for the past 3 weeks thought I would try to make friends online via twitter or forums for bands / tv / films I like..:.i haven’t. Even posting on Reddit with all its anonymous-ness has to be a valid reason rather than ‘because I want to’. 

I’m worried this is who I am now, someone with no one &amp;amp; slowly getting comfortable with the thought I’ll always be alone and not good enough, some people are not meant to be happy and I’m one of them.

I’ve had 7 months off work. I’m still physically and emotionally alone, except now it’s evident and not because of ‘work’ or being ‘busy’ but because I cannot put myself out there, sad, scared and waiting for the sky to fall on top of me, even though I know, the smallest interaction would change my life significantly. 

My sister and therapist make it sound so easy, every night I have the best intentions before attempting to sleep, telling myself I cannot bare to live like this and every day I spend it convincing myself I’ll never be good enough for anyone or thing other than working. I spend most of my day watching daytime tv, watching the same 5 tv series / films , sleeping, crying , trying not to think about the past and waiting till the next therapy session  or when my sister will call. Feels pathetic typing it out. 

Contemplating going back to work, just to have something to do and not feel like the waste of space I feel I am, so I don’t spiral into sucideal ideation I’ve been flirting with for the past 3 months. Even though I’m financially ok for the next couple of months.

Have been in therapy for the past 5 months, I don’t know what I expected ? A new personality? Wake up trauma free ? Less sad? Less sucideal? Less me ?  Just something that isn’t this constant hollow dread feeling. 

Anyone have any tips on how to help myself outside of therapy which I’m already attending?  People with cptsd, have friends and partners. I’ve never had either, unworthy to mean anything to anyone, other than a sister who is a burden &amp; a pay check to my therapist. Nothing more. If I died tonight no one would know for weeks, what’s the point of being alive. What’s the point of my existence. Nothing. 

Don’t know how long I can do this for. Thank you in advance for any help."
Why are my symptoms getting worse when I’m trying to get better? Please help,3,mgujby,11,"I’m getting therapy for years and now my life only began to be a *little* more stable, and now all these traumatic core wound and pain are coming up and I’m processing them and my symptoms are the worst I’ve ever had in years. I’m learning a lot on how traumas are affecting me and trying my best to rewire my brain to a healthier way. However the amount of emotional pain I’m in is unbearable. The past haunts me. I always feel like my body is stuck back 10 years ago, I feel like I’m right there, with my abusive family. The flashbacks are relentless. I feel all these painful, negative emotions everyday coming out of nowhere. I can’t sleep. I can barely function. I kinda lose faith in therapy. Unlike general anxiety or depression, there’s structure for therapy with CBT, my therapist says trauma is organic and she’s going for that “go with the flow” thing, which I don’t really know if there’s actual a goal or an end or if I’m ACTUALLY getting better? I feel like I’m getting worse!!! And going crazy! This is relentless!! This is torture!!

I can only see my therapist every fortnight but that’s not enough for my symptom. I’m a migrant living alone and I don’t have a sense of community or much human interactions. All these people having Easter holiday with the family is triggering me so badly. If only I can get that warmth. I’m running on empty. 

The scary thing is there is so little I can do to change my current situation and it’s gonna be this shitty for a long time. I’m gonna have CPTSD symptoms for years to be realistic. And same with my economic situation. I don’t wanna do this anymore. I am losing hope. I have put 150% effort everyday to get by and just to survive and it’s so tiring. Most people can be lazy and stay afloat where my life is a daily struggle. And it’s all these traumatic memories and feelings I cannot shake off. I can be sitting on a desk and suddenly the flashbacks pull me in another dimension. They just visit me daily. I can’t do this anymore. 

I need a CPTSD buddy I can talk to. It’s so difficult. At least I wanna know I’m not going crazy. I feel like most people can’t understand me. Help!"
I grow Up terrified of my Dad,3,mgu0w1,1,"I remember that deep feeling of being completely powerless on regard of his colossal rage. I remember being a Kid and wanting to kill my dad from the age of 5. I was terrified of him. Everytime I heard the sound of the car in the park I remember that I have always rushed to my mom or to my bed under my blanket. He used to be extremely angry after he came back from work, If he had found me playing with few toys that family friends had gifted me, he would often time take them and smash them. The worst part about it is that I have always I have always been jelous of other kids who were often time excited to see their dad come back from work, and I have always wondered what is wrong with me, why does my dad treat me like this, why am I the kid that had always been mistreated. I will never forget his gaze, his dead cold eyes looking in to my soul like he was going to kill me anytime soon, his shouts that used to make the home tremble. He used to be violent with me, using hands  and trowing me things but after I have blackmailed him by telling him that I am going to call the police, he used to make me do cold showers everytime I showed any sing of activity that he found bothersome or everytime I had answered him back. I had been closed inside of me now for so long, the cold or cold water in general partly triggers me and reminds me of how powerless I was. Nothing have ever given me any deep consolation."
"Trauma coming to a head. [Physical, emotional, infidelity]",1,mgzlej,4,"I am a 31 year old stay at home father of two young children and have been married for over 10 years. It feels lately like everything is coming to a head and I am drowning. I started having brain fog, joint pain, and other weird things in October that are possibly related to having Covid in June. To treat it my doctor decided to put me on an ssri, and upped my dose at the end of December. After the dose was upped i started acting progressively more and more crazy. It started getting bad when my wife and I let my best friend sleep in our bed with us after we had a couple friends over and their was nowhere else comfortable to sleep. After laying down I picked up on sexual tension between the two of them, got turned on and wound up having sex with my wife while he was in the bed and both of us kissed him (we were all very drunk). I asked my wife the next day what the fuck was going on and found out she had an affair with him for years stopping shortly before the conception of our first child. I knew about two instances of infidelity (making out) that i caught her doing while at parties, one with my prior best friend, one with a stranger. Throughout the next two weeks I slowly broke down, had dissociative episodes, one in which i scratched my wrist to bleeding without knowing, and one in which i punched holes in the wall and talked of suicide. The next day I went to the hospital and they determined i had serotonin syndrome due to the meds.

This has triggered abandonment issues worrying that my wife was leaving me, which has been triggering flashbacks of childhood trauma. I keep having this one set of flashbacks when i was 12 where my dad beat me (he had a belt studded with his name in raised steel lettering he liked to use because it left his name in bruises), and I threatened to call the police/cps. He told me to do it and see how i liked foster care where i would be abused even worse. I told him someone else would take me in, that my grandma and grandpa that I was really close to would. He said no they wouldn't. Then the flashback jumps to the next day whenever I was alone with my grandma and told her what had happened, showed her the bruises, and asked her for hep, asked if they would take me in. She told me that my parents love me very much and are doing their best, and she will not come between us or get involved at all. That is where the flashback ends, and usually at this point I am shaking uncontrollably. The prevalence of this has caused me to think more of my childhood trauma and has gone on to trigger more flashbacks about my childhood, and flashbacks about finding out about the original infidelity. On top of that I am having nightmares about the two of them together that keep me from sleeping. 

This has cost me that best friend, my next closest friend has since gone to jail and is facing 2-10 years in prison, and i don't really have any other friends. My emotions are a mess and bouncing all over the place, and I need to talk through this shit with my wife regularly, which is making it hard for my wife to keep up with work and gradschool. I have been waiting to get into talk therapy for like 6 weeks now but still haven't gotten there yet. My back pain is now worse than it has been since i had surgery 9 years ago, our finances are shit...and yet somehow most days still feel like good days other than short episodes. I feel overwhelmed to the point i feel like i can't handle it most of the time."

I've never done crack, but I feel hyper-alert... almost vibrating. If there is a better place to post this, or it's just too much, I'll rely on the mods to remove this or redirect me. 

NSFW!!

It's a long story, but the main points are;

*that my son had some sort of emotional breakdown, unbeknownst to me.

*he was suicidal, and became violent with me. 

* after (physically) fighting with me over trying to prevent him from hurting himself...

*he committed suicide last Thursday.

Arrangements have been made after the M.E. released his body, and plans are underway for a service. It's overwhelming, and my daughters and others close to him are beyond traumatized. There are so many moving pieces, so many emotions and I'm numb. I took a hot soaking bath last night after realizing I hadn't bathed since before his suicide. I didn't realized how tense and knotted up I was. I'm still sore after trying to fight for his life, and losing. 

He had never been violent towards me in all the years he struggled emotionally and with addiction. Not once, not ever. That's what is so incongruous. He wasn't high, he had finished rehab a week earlier. He had just started working again after being unemployed for a couple of years. He looked great, with a bit of a tan from working outside for a week. He was dropped off by the rest of the crew he had worked with in another part of the state, and hours later he was dead. 

I realized he had hidden my phone, and drove to my neighbors and they called 911. Then three or four law enforcement agencies showed up. The SWAT team, a huge RV with negotiators, an armored vehicle, bullhorns, state police, town police, sheriffs department, the road blocked off at both ends... Finally ending when they decided to enter the house after 4 or 5 hours, and found him dead. It was the middle of the night by the time I was allowed back into my house. I spent the rest of the night and most of Friday mopping up, literally.

it feels incomprehensible. My wife (his Mama) committed suicide two years ago. He never recovered from it, and blamed himself. My other children are traumatized, inconsolable... bereft, and I know I must be too. I just cant feel anything, except responsible for failing to protect him from himself."
Trying to read a helpful book and getting triggered,6,mgpc7j,3,"Possible TW for treatment facility trauma. I couldn't figure out which flair to use.


Hrgh...I'm trying to read ""The Body Keeps the Score"" because multiple people, including my therapist, have recommended it. I'm only 2 chapters in and I'm in total fight mode. Reading the stories of the hospitals/""asylums"" is totally taking me back to my years as a staff in a residential treatment facility for kids with behavioral issues. I'm feeling the same sensations I would get right before I had to restrain a patient. I always felt dread, and a rush of adrenaline because I hated doing restraints. I knew they were necessary to keep the environment safe but I always saw them from the patient's perspective and felt like a terrible person for re-traumatizing them. I'm literally in my office at work feeling like I'm about to get attacked. I'm just waiting for my medication to kick in and needed to get this out. 

I'm sorry if anyone reading this has been in a RTC . I know RTCs can be very traumatic and mine is a perspective that isn't typically well-received."
Exercise makes Symptoms Worse?,21,mgf2jb,17,"5 years ago I was attacking the gym 5-6x a week and eating a ton and was generally happy.  

Then I began long distance training, lost weight, casually smoked marijuana, and then got slammed with a stalking incident that caused PTSD and compounded my CPTSD from childhood (shock and attachment traumas). 

I developed brain fog, GERD, insomnia, fatigue, etc.  I was trying to lift 4-6x a week to get my strength back that I lost prior to distance training and it seemed to make it worse. 

So I stopped training for a year.  The past month I began training again and made the bone head move of lifting 5x a week. The catch is my strength was coming back but knee pain and a ton of body aches most in legs and it’s seemed to cause insomnia and anxiety spikes again with some fun added in the form of hopeless despair. 

Has anyone been an athlete and experienced this? Any science to what’s happening and how to remedy ? Seems similar to overtraining syndrome but caused by mental stress as well."
There's always a scream bubbling up just under the surface,32,mgd0qn,9,"I need to yell. Just, yell. I need to drive somewhere where no one can hear me, be it in a soundproof room or an empty mountain forest or in the middle of the desert at midnight, and lose my mind for a couple minutes. I need to just go until my lungs don't have any more air and my vocal cords give out. Every day I can feel it caught in my throat, the mother of all screams, just itching to come free. It's been building up in there for years now, curing, ripening, aging like milk. Every time I discover some new breed of bullshit it gets harder to contain. The way I'm writing this probably sounds a bit tongue-in-cheek but I'm dead serious. And late at night, when I'm all alone, when nobody sensible should be awake, it gets even worse. Maybe it sounds weird or childish, but I crave that kind of release like you wouldn't believe. To just expel it - the pain, the anger, the frustration, the confusion, the whatever else, all of it - in a primal screech that would probably get the police called if I did it anywhere within a 10-mile radius of somewhere populated. Which is why I can't do it now, because I haven't been able to properly get away and I don't want the neighbors to think someone's being eviscerated with a spoon.

There's so much on my mind. Just so, so much. So much shit. Every day I wake up and think thoughts. I can't even properly articulate the way I feel, as much as I wish I could, but standing in the middle of the desert and roaring like a feral ape-man ought to do. You know? You feel me? At this point I don't think there's any more accurate way to vocalize the burnt spaghetti mess clogging up my skull other than ***""AAAAAAAAAA-""***. I am at my limit, hanging by a thread, burning at both ends if you will, and I've been there for a *while.*

I've heard that in a town in Switzerland, or Finland, or some other cold place ending in -land, they have a day where everybody hollers their heart out in unison at a certain time. Too bad I live on the other side of the world, huh?"
This came on a mix. A little encouragement,4,mgqmfg,2,
Advice wanted: supporting someone.,23,mgelvh,10,"Hi all, hope everyone is coping okay.

Recently my girlfriend has been diagnosed with C-PTSD. She’s currently an inpatient in a psychiatric unit, she’s been there about 4 weeks now. She should be coming home some time next week.

Things that she struggles with is SH urges, suicidal thoughts, nightmares, dissociation, trouble regulating emotions and lately some pretty big panic attacks. I think the road ahead is going to be really difficult for her, this stay has uncovered a lot of trauma that needs addressing so I understand it’s not going to be easy. 

Her family that she lives with most of the time aren’t very supportive and have caused some of said trauma. I’m unsure how to support her while she is there, I can’t be there 24/7, I know she is safe while I’m there but I’m unsure if she will be safe when I’m not. We spend a fair amount of time at my home too and there’s never been any issues. It gives me a lot of anxiety her being at her home. 

She’s currently starting a few new medications as well which I hope starts to help a little because the past 2 weeks or so have been really really rough for her.

I’m also curious as to what therapies people have found helpful in addressing trauma related stuff? Just so I can see if I can find any therapists near me that might be able to help. 

Thanks in advance anyone who gets back to me."
I‘m scared that i‘ll never be able to truly love someone or live a normal life,5,mgq4pu,11,"i‘m in therapy for 10 years now yet they found out i suffer from CPTSD about 1 year ago. my dad‘s mom killed herself when he was like 14 years old and he never had a dad. his adoptive father abused him and i think he also suffered from PTSD/CPTSD. this is for sure the reason he wasn‘t able to be a „good father“ which caused my childhood trauma. anyways CPTSD as diagnosis helped me a lot with understanding why i function this way and reacting to things the way i am doing it and so on. 

i got a pretty bad taste in my relationship partners since they‘ve all been emotionally unavailable and if not i didn‘t want them. i think i‘m responsible for the heartbreaks they caused me. reflecting on those past years i don‘t think that i‘ve ever been truly in love and that these people were just obsessions. i‘m not sure if i‘ll ever be able to truly love someone and it scares me. on the other hand i don‘t want anyone to fall in love with me because i think i‘m just gonna hurt them. 

lately i‘m so powerless of the constant fight against cptsd. healing is so so so exhausting. i know it affected my whole development and i always thought i‘mma be fine someday but i actually don‘t think that this day is gonna come... i feel like that i have to struggle for my whole life in every aspect of it which doesn‘t make it worth living. i‘m not suicidal and i still find enjoyment in some things there‘s always good and bad episodes but i‘m not sure how long i‘ll be able to handle the bad ones. 

i feel guilty for everyone around me. i‘m isolating and pushing people away not talking to anyone except for my best friend about it because i‘m scared to hurt anyone. 

has anyone of you ever been in a healthy relationship with someone? does anyone of you feel like they can finally handle CPTSD?"
Can't stop eavesdropping.,2,mguaa3,1,"So I've always been an eavesdropper, which has in my childhood led to me overhearing things I shouldn'tve (in particular, that's how I found out Santa wasn't real, and somewhat more traumatically I remember my mom calling me too needy). Nowadays I am TERRIFIED of my roommates complaining about me or making fun of me.

Whenever I'm alone and my roommates are hanging out I'll overhear a laugh from the other room or something that could theoretically be about me and my stomach will drop and anxiety takes over. Then I feel like I HAVE to get up and eavesdrop a bit so I can reassure myself that they aren't talking about me (which, as a friend put it when it first became an issue last year: they never are). Like, if I don't get up I'll sit there with a stomachache trying and also not trying to overhear until I either successfully distract myself (which is a crapshoot) or I go check. At first this only happened when I was high but recently it's been an issue when I'm fully sober, too. And I'm having worry stomachaches throughout the day when I'm reminded of whatever my brain has decided that they're upset at me for (based on the snippet of conversation I heard).

I've been working with my therapist about it but I'm seriously struggling. She gave me worksheets and stuff, and I know it's just a thought, which will come and go, and I choose to believe it (as she reiterated many times today) but it really feels like the worry is so sudden and overwhelming that it controls me almost. She also wants me to talk to my roommates and establish that if there's any issues we talk to eachother first instead of talking about it but I'm worried theyll take that the wrong way, or if they have actually been complaining about me the whole time they'll finally drop the ruse of liking me. 

The whole thing is really making it hard for me to maintain a regular relationship with my roommates, since I think they hate me whenever we aren't actively having a pleasant conversation. I've been fantasizing about moving into my own apartment, so I don't have to worry about them, but I can't afford it and my roommates are literally the only people I talk to outside of my work (where I'm alone for the majority of my shift). The only other solution my broken brain has is to kill myself, and obviously that's a no-go.

Anyway. Advice from anyone who has similar issues would be appreciated."
Vaccination and medical anxiety,2,mgu67f,5,"I’m a survivor of ongoing medical trauma (honestly too complex and paranoid to explain further, sorry)

I was wondering if anyone similar has gotten vaccinated and how you coped with it. I’m scheduled for my first dose, it’s at a hospital I’ve got a history with. I really want to get vaccinated, despite my severe medical avoidance, but these people terrify me.

I live in a rural area so there aren’t many options unfortunately. I’m so stressed I’m worried I will cancel and be stuck at home even longer than I already have been, which is really triggering to agoraphobic tendencies creeping back that I’ve worked hard on.

First time In months I actually feel something positive without alcohol or drugs.,14,mgg75g,2,"After years of suppressing and neglecting my trauma, I am facing it. Honesty, I either felt anxiety, depression or numb for months since starting to face my trauma.

That was until I setup a vision board. I put on it Goals. I put on it some details on how trauma has shaped me and what I need to do to try reverse unhealthy behaviour. I have taken action to set boundaries and cut people off who were causing me to relive trauma. I also became open with those close to me that I am going through this. It took some time for me to process all that, but tonight I am finally feeling good, like I am moving forward and making progress. To feel relaxed and quite content while working hard on my trauma, that’s a big deal to me and I wanted to share.

I would really recommend a vision board for anyone."
"DAE struggle with being around older adults, despite also being an adult",15,mgg2oq,3,"I'm (F/24) afraid of people ages late 20s/ late 30s, as these were the ages my parents were when then first started abusing my siblings and I. At least from what I can remember

I know I'm just projecting but it's gotten to the point that it's interfering with my life. I can't speak to my professors, teachers, older coworkers, anyone in this age bracket without feeling extreme anxiety. I blew 3 separate opportunities to get my foot-in-the-door of a job I know I want because I was too afraid of the people I would have to interact with. This was two years ago and I still regret it, but I can't help it and I'm too embarrassed to talk about it"
Reaction to termination,6,mgnuq0,12,"Anyone have any ideas what's going on? Long read, apologies.

My therapist whom I was simultaneously attached to but trying desperately to not be attached to, terminated me abruptly in November. 

It has been extremely difficult for me to process. It really hit at my core beliefs about myself. My other therapist and then my psychiatrist have both told me it was not right, not fair, not something they would have done, and not something I deserved. I did not want to hear that, at all.  Talking to other therapists about it, instead of making me feel better about it and the confusion lifted, has just made me so much more confused about things and hurt by former therapist's actions.  Rather than there being a good, ethical, therapeutic reason for it, that a lay person just could not understand, but that a therapist could explain, I can only conclude that she could not tolerate me, could not feel even basic positive regard. We don't ask much of our therapists, 50 minutes every other week, and that was too much for her. I guess that's the ethical thing to do when you get to the point where you hate a client.

I really don't get why this hurts me so much. I guess I feel very exposed and deeply ashamed. It is a confirmation of my core beliefs.  I sat there, month after month, being vulnerable, all the while she dreaded my presence? I really liked her as a person, and she couldn't stand me. Why did she take me on as a client in the first place? 

The anger is coming in now when I look back at the last 5 months, the effect this has had on me. Current therapist has been trying to get me to not take on the blame, and she's ""happy"" that I'm starting to feel some anger around it now. 
The inability to work, the random crying spells, the constant reminders, the need to cancel social interaction because I could not predict when this shit was going to hit me again, the pushing people away, the drinking I started again, the lack of sleep, the fact that meditation which used to help me now only serves as a reminder of what has happened. 

I paid thousands of dollars to walk away from this experience quite effed up. Now I've spent months in new therapy trying to figure this shit out. 

Why did she have to do this at this time? I was newly living alone, we were going into lockdown, nothing to distract you like in normal times. She knew my history of attachment trauma, of my sore spots of ostracization and bullying, the relational betrayal, she knew the hate I have for myself and she knew that I had been trying to trust her and had in fact just told her something that demonstrated an incredible amount of trust. I  can only conclude that knowing all those things, knowing how this would hurt me, that on balance she literally could not tolerate my presence any longer. Did I make her skin crawl? I must have. 

I know that most people would not think this to be such a big deal, and that fact just makes this so much worse. I feel utterly defective and ashamed. Why can I not be normal with this kind of thing?

My therapist was also my former co-worker's therapist. This co-worker and I have not texted since before the termination. Sometimes we would discuss therapy with eachother. Well out of the blue she texted me today and I almost shit my pants when I saw her name, started shaking, almost started hyperventilating. The first thing I had to say to her was not to mention anything to do with therapy. Talk about embarrassing, who the fuck has to say shit like that to someone?  Now I haven't gotten any work done since then.

I just don't understand why I have had such a strong reaction to this. Is it my untreated depression? Is it a trauma flashback being activated? Is it both?  

I never even had this long of a reaction to a breakup with someone I loved. I know I didn't love my therapist. What the hell is going on here? 

I guess it's huge huge progress that I'm now able to make a post about it. Who knows, I might take this down later."
I feel so gaslighted by the constant societal messaging of: “you need to learn how to validate yourself and not rely on others”,1002,mfqtlm,161,"I really do get where people are coming from but come on. This whole concept makes me angrier than I can explain. As much as it is partly in truth, how could it actually be possible to embody a feeling you’ve never even experienced before? 
I just read an article that said, “If we want to connect with a person, we do it because we genuinely want to connect with him or her. Not because we want something back, or we’re afraid of being alone.”

Honestly, I would do anything to be able to exist this way in the world. Of course I genuinely want to connect with people authentically. But when I grew up in a “family” that makes me feel no sense of worth, belonging, or love, how could I seriously NOT be afraid of being alone or wanting a certain outcome, like a healthy version of love being given back to me? Is that seriously too much to want out of life? 

What about all the studies that prove a greater feeling of well-being in people who feel a sense of community and support by those around them?  

Ugh I just feel so frustrated and stuck about how to overcome this I can’t even think straight sometimes. As much as I hate this concept I actually wish it was true so I could stop feeling so controlled by my trauma...

advice for hyper vigilance while living in apartment building?,4,mgp6mm,2,"one of the symptoms i struggle with the most is hyper vigilance. growing up i was never able to listen to music or anything because i had to be able to hear if my parents were upset about something, yelling for me, or if i could hear their stomps coming down the hall. now i’m constantly on edge with every voice or bump i hear. living on the second floor of a three story apartment building doesn’t help. especially since i live right near the stairs where everyone is constantly coming up and down, and my landlord feels the need to scream at people constantly. it’s been hard as is for the past year, but at least no one lived in the unit above me. but now someone is moving in. it feels like i am just trapped in a state of survival and constantly being on edge and i hate it. i can’t be in my own apartment ever. it’s like being back in my parents house, only feeling safe and calmer at night once everyone is asleep. i don’t want to have to constantly find excuses to not be home. especially since i’m going to start working from home soon. i just feel so disheartened and upset about it, especially since i know i don’t have any control here. does anyone else struggle with this or have any advice on how to help? i would appreciate hearing it so so much."

Question about the role of self-esteem in CPTSD,3,mgou26,2,"TW: Death of parent

My overall question (in case you don't want to read the following wall of text) - is damage to one's self-esteem and/or feelings of shame a fundamental part of CPTSD? Could CPTSD still develop from long-term adverse circumstances even if everyone around you is fundamentally kind?

&#x200B;

Context:

I lost my father when I was fourteen, and my mother's ensuing depression/PTSD meant I had to take over his role as confidant during her daily emotional breakdowns. They were never directed toward me, but she always looked to me specifically to vent her pain, and I couldn't leave until I could figure out how to calm her down. She affectionately called me her ""little therapist"" when I was in high school, and still repeatedly tells me I am her only real source of emotional support.

My therapist referred to this as parentification, which I understand is a form of abuse. It's been 10 years now since my dad died, two years since I moved out, and I still feel like I'm not quite a full person anymore. Descriptions of emotional flashbacks have been the best way I've found to explain the episodes I get now.

But I haven't seen any literature, articles, etc. about CPTSD that don't include the assumption that someone was openly treated as unworthy of love/protection. My mom has never made me feel like filling my dad's role was my ""duty"" to her, or that I was a bad person if I didn't; I stayed because she was dangerously depressed, crying, and/or screaming every night for years, I felt obligated as her daughter to help, and I was horrified by how much pain she was in (we were living in the same house, so that part I truly couldn't escape). Aside from this, we're actually very close (though I still feel on edge around her).

So I just wondered if a sense of shame/unworthiness is inherent to CPTSD; I certainly don't want to take for granted the significance of this aspect to others' experience."

I just stepped on my glasses last night and they're broken. I have no money to get them fixed. I have a second pair but i haven't been able to find them since last night because... my apartment's a mess. 

I feel like i should have a better handle on my life than i do. 

I was going to go get my psych meds from my gp yesterday but couldn't manage. Just went for a five hour nap instead. I call them today to realize they are on vacation. The doc filling in is not open today. I don't have time tomorrow. Which means, because i always wait till the last second, i do not have meds to take tomorrow night. 

I feel like I'm just failing at everything. I currently cannot deal. So i just sleep. And sleep. 

I hate myself today. I am trying to be compassionate towards myself and all that but i feel so lost and so much like I'm just failing at life.

I hate that I doubt my experiences,4,mgmqzf,3,"TW: mentions family trauma, emotional abuse, emotional neglect

CPTSD is so difficult to deal with and the doubt that comes with it (for me at least) does not make it any easier. Sometimes I doubt the severity of my experiences because ""others have it worse"". I was emotionally neglected and had to look after my family's feelings over my own throughout my teens (I'm only 18 now though and still have to) and I've been made to feel like an absolute failure of a human, of course that's a serious issue. I wish I didn't gaslight myself because my parents did the ""best they could"" and because they gave me lots physically. My family makes it clear that my views are wrong, my choices are wrong, everything about me is wrong. I've always been the black sheep but sometimes it just HITS me. I had an argument with my mom last night that triggered me so so badly and I have not been able to do anything today except watch lighthearted youtube videos. Moments like this make me realize that my experiences are valid even if no one around me understands how much suffering I've been through. Most people don't completely fall apart after an argument. Most people don't need days to recover after an argument. Something inside of me got triggered and I don't know what to do about it. My mom loves me but it's like we are in different universes. She has no idea how much emotional damage my family has caused me, she has no idea how much pain I've been through, she has no idea what she has put me through. I could never explain to her how intrinsically flawed I feel because of my childhood experiences. I could never explain how much my conservative Christian town has made me feel like I have some fatal flaw. It's just so confusing to me how she loves me and says she loves me and thinks she gave me a wonderful childhood and did everything she could yet at the same time crushed my individuality, crushed my creativity, tried to stop my critical thinking, and basically made me feel like shit for years. I know this is all over the place, sorry. I'm struggling and wanted to rant. Thanks for reading."

DAE struggle with forming attachments?,3,mgpqoh,2,"TW: Death

I realized recently why I'm able to move on from loss in the blink of an eye.

When my dad died when I was young, I didn't even blink. I remember moving on immediately, being normal at school (to my school-assigned therapist's surprise; I told her I didn't need her, and they shouldn't have assigned her to me after my dad died). I remember being annoyed that everyone around me was always sad about it.

When I broke up with my boyfriend of 3 years, I moved on the next day. I could have fallen in love with someone else immediately, but I was also in no rush to find someone else. I was normal, happy, well adjusted.

When one of my friendships ended, I shrugged it off and moved on with my life. I can make more friends if I want to, no big deal. I didn't get upset over it.

I've been thinking about these situations recently and I thought to myself: ""why can I discard people so easily? Is there something wrong with me?"" Because I feel nothing when they leave my life. 

I think it's because part of me can't form an attachment to people. One of the connections is broken, but I don't know what it is. From a young, young, young age (probably too young to remember, because I never remember NOT being like this), I learned that there was no family I could trust. I couldn't form attachments to any of my family members because they constantly abandoned me, so as a survival mechanism I learned that it was unsafe to form attachments...but now I don't even know what an attachment looks like.

Anyone else feel this way? Have any of you finally learned how to form healthy attachments?"
Am I right to feel awful about something I barely remember?,3,mgnl8y,3,"(Repost because I think it got a little lost)
I’ve posted here before, but basically long story short I have CPTSD from a multitude of experiences, including abuse from my family in particular my mother. I also am traumatised from an event where I was groomed sexually by an older girl (17) when I was 11.

What I want to ask/talk about right now is a completely different event entirely, it’s something I’ve always acknowledged/remembered happened to me, but I only just realised that this was potentially awful and it made me breakdown crying the other day.

My mother’s step father raised her from a young age, and I’ve always acknowledged him to be my grandpa as much as I have her birth father. I’ve never known him as any different and I was raised calling him Opa (grandad in German, my family is from Germany.) He works as a gynaecologist.

The reason I mention this is because it’s related to the memory I mentioned in the title- I think I must have been 4 or 5, and I remember my mother taking me to my grandfather for him to look at my private parts. I remember lying on my back in his practice, completely alone in the building apart from the three of us, and my mum standing next to me. I remember him seeing me naked and him looking between my legs, but then the memory completely blacks out, I remember nothing else.

I do not recall ever having any gynaecological issues, especially not at that age that would have needed looking at. I’ve always remembered this experience and memory, but it was just the other day when I really thought about the implications of it and I broke down in distress and tears. I was in the shower and I just remember holding myself and my whole body shaking, I felt ashamed and uncomfortable and terrified- terrified of why my mum thought it was okay for my grandparent to see/touch me like that, and terrified of what I don’t remember. 

It could have just been harmless, and I acknowledge that completely, but at the same time I feel this deep genuine disgust about the situation. I don’t know what happened to me, I was never able to consent to my grandad seeing me like that. I feel horrible, even typing this my stomach is just churning. 

I’m genuinely asking for advice, is this something I have a right to feel this way over? Is that normal behaviour for a parent/family to do? I’m terrified. Thank you for reading."

DAE have brainzaps (my only name for it) that gets worse when in stressful situations and/or feeling CPTSD-symptoms?,4,mgo1oo,5,"basically the title because i’ve been having this problem where i get so so cold inside and it spreads through all my nerve endings and bones and i just get goosebumps all over. i’ve never been able to identify it besides it being associated with antidepressants and withdrawals and that did make it worse but i’ve been having them since i was a child. the cold also makes it worse and even feeling too hot.

when it gets really bad i feel it all in my head and brain and it would lead to migraines and i’ve noticed when i’m more stable and able to handle myself and my surroundings they’re just there and not so overwhelming but it’s still there 

it’s one of the only symptoms i can “easily” identify that started around the time things would start to happen that affected me, i thought it was normal until i was able to be in an environment where i felt as safe as i ever felt and saw it wasn’t happening except when i felt negative emotions, experiencing flashbacks or was in the cold"
Struggling and don’t know where to go,1,mgus18,4,"I (27F) am struggling with a current situation triggering past sexual trauma. 
Just over a year ago I had a short (2 month) fling with someone from work (we will call him an Ex for the sake of clarity) I had hesitations because of the work affiliation but agreed to give it a shot. We work at a fairly large call center and it isn’t uncommon to see relationships start there. There were difficulties with respecting boundaries from the get go and I decided it was better for me to part ways. I had just finished EMDR therapy and was still trying to find my footing and I felt he was counter productive to me healing from childhood abuse. 

We went into lock down and thankfully working from home and I have not had contact with him since. I have now found a relationship that I feel is quite healthy and I am incredibly proud of!  

A few days ago a mutual friend, that knows both my bf and I, was apart of a team building exercise at work with the ex and he confronted her about my relationship. He provided details about our sexual interactions and made accusations that I was a cheater, and a liar. He is under the impression I began flirting with this new guy while the fling was happening when there was actually about 6 months between the two. The mutual friend shared this information with both my bf and I and now I’m terrified that my bf will view me differently (he says not the case but I can’t get my brain to believe it). 

At this point, I am struggling to ground myself and am having major symptom flare ups that have been well controlled for awhile now. The physical sensations and feeling “unclean” is overwhelming. I know I am safe but I can’t help feeling violated still. I have the ex blocked on everything I can think of and don’t wish to confront him at all. I just don’t know how to negate the fears, shame, and ultimately all the symptoms that go along with it. Any help or advice is appreciated."
CPTSD education for loves ones,7,mghi9x,4,"So, I was having a discussion with my therapist about how much the discovery of CPTSD has changed my life -- finally there's a word for 'whats wrong with me?' and that word is 'trauma.' I've been plugging through the Pete Walker book, and sometimes I find it a little dry and disorganized, but that's due to the nature that most of this book began as independent articles. I find the book a little dry even when the subject matter pertains to me and my situation, I cannot imagine asking him to read the entire thing just so he can help understand -- it's just too much for the support person upon introduction to CPTSD.


Recently my husband and I were talking and he said something along the lines of being aware when I'm disregulated because I'm ""not quit yourself"" and my logic tends to be pretty ridiculous. He said ""I can see you struggling, but I don't even know what's happening to you or what happened to you (because nobody is really themselves when they're in the throws) and I feel helpless because I don't know what to do or how to help."" 


And so, I was wondering if any of you have been able to find materials to help with a ""crash course to the wonky traumatized brain"" that might be easier to understand for an outsider. 

Regardless of what critics and voices tell us, we are loveable. We are doing a good job. We're worthy. And there are supportive people who want to help us feel better. Every day is a good day."

Does it get better?,4,mgjfo2,2,"Hi!!
I am 20 years old and have now freshly been diagnosed. I have spent a long time trying to figure out whats wrong with me or whether im insane and it feels good to have a diagnosis now to help me validate the ways i have been struggling. I am starting therapy in a few weeks and i am really happy about that. Still i am a little scared. These events ive experienced and situations i have lived in long term have such a big grip on my brain most of the time and I guess I am just a little worried as to whether you can even move past something like that. I want to be a functioning person and I am quite looking forward to my life especially now that I have some distance from most of those traumatic events and circumstances, but its so hard to imagine being healthy and coping fine. I guess what I am asking is: can anybody who has worked through at least a bit of their trauma and seen what comes after that process tell me about that? And do you get to a point where you feel healed or do you always stay scarred and broken? I like to think I will be okay someday and I am quite hopeful, but I have never heard the perspective of somebody who has already started or finished that process. Thank you for reading!"
Not talking in therapy,21,mgaav5,23,"Is it ok to hand my therapist a note instead of talking directly about something? There is a huge, very difficult subject I’d like to discuss in therapy, but I don’t know how to share that. There seems to be a built-in mechanism in me that keeps me from taking about it, there is quite a lot of shame too. I thought that maybe if my therapist new the basic problem, she could help me talk about it. But since I can’t say it out loud I thought I could write it down and hand it to her. Is it a good idea? Is it going to be therapeutic? Or is it only valid if I can say it out loud? But then again I fear I will never talk about it, and it’s something that is rotting in me. And I think that maybe if she learns the basic truth of what happened and it’s no longer my best kept secret maybe I’ll be able to talk about it? Do any of you have a similar experience?"
Seeking the excitement of abandonment by hunting for images of my ex,44,mg5xkl,11,"Anyone else get those weird cravings to feel shitty feelings that come with excited feelings? Sometimes after 4 years of divorce I want to find my way into my wife's Instagram and look back to when we were getting divorced and see what she was writing and saying.

Why?!! Why the fuck?!! That's insane. It would bring up so much pain and feelings of abandonment. It would get my blood pumping and I'd feel like puking.

In other words it would feel like my childhood all over again. How wild is it that my brain wants to binge on that shit?

Pretty interesting to think that some part of my brain wants to do this believing it's going to get me something it needs.

I am gonna need to spend some time with my parts and work on this one. I'm glad my ex (who I get along with great now) has doesn't follow me and I don't follow her. I'm not even on IG anymore because of what a dopamine junkie I can be there.

Major Dissociation During EMDR,2,mgmm1b,4,"Sooo after a crazy therapy journey, I finally found an awesome therapist who does emdr. I've been working with her for five months or so. And I could really feel myself changing. As part of this, my flashbacks have turned into full body flashbacks. And today we decided to work on the main events (same thing several times in my childhood) that power those. We'd done it before at a cognitive level but I felt ready to do it at a body level. This is a series of memories that I've tried to work on in previous therapy before. THe first time I even talked about it at a high level ten years ago, I got blackout drunk after, for the first and only time ever. And when I tried again last year with a therapist who turned out to be harmful (see previous posts), I almost lost it. This time, I felt ready if nervous. Well, we got into it today. I felt like it was moving on. Then the last 20 minutes I like majorly dissociated. I ended up leaving while still very out of it. She was aware and I think concerned, but none of what she suggested was helping because I was so gone. I am like a teeny bit back but mostly gone. And now I'm paranoid she's going to quit working with me, which has happened to me twice before (not in emdr, regular therapists with no trauma expertise). I am also like terrrrrrified of this memory and what it means. Anyhow, not really looking for any response in particular but needed to get this out. Thank you."

"Found out my uncle and his wife wanted to adopt me when I was a kid, now I can't stop thinking about the ""what if""",44,mg3qdn,7,"I had dinner with my uncle (mom's younger brother) and his wife a couple days ago. I've never been very close to anyone in my family but over the last few years I've felt a better connection with him than anyone else. I moved out of state two years ago and this is the fist time we've seen each other since then, they in town for a work conference. We started talking about our family history and a lot about my mom, which we'd never talked about in depth before. I knew she had issues, most likely borderline personality and issues because of heavy drug use before she had kids. During the conversation they told me that when I was young, around 2 or 3 years old, they wanted to adopt me and my older brother (a year and a half older) because they knew our home life was so toxic. Since my mom is they way she is, she refused any kind of help and took it as an insult. They knew we weren't being fed properly or being taken care of so my aunt would bring a cooked meal to our house, trying to be nice, and mom would start screaming and swearing at her and telling her leave. Any kind gesture from them was met this way. My dad was an alcoholic and no help at all with us kids (he also had 3 other kids and a previous marriage he abandoned in his home state when they were toddlers). My parents fought constantly, both verbally and physically, and I watched them both get arrested multiple times it would get so bad. We were very poor to the point that my mom would collect aluminum cans to cash in to buy me and my brother a happy meal at mcdonald's. My uncle and aunt knew there was no way to safely talk to my mom about letting them take care of us. She had already threatened suicide multiple times and put her brother through hell his entire life because she's always been this way and abused him growing up. Even when I was young she would tell me that if she didn't have kids to take care of she'd just kill herself. My uncle and his wife already had three boys of their own so I can only imagine the stress it would have put on them taking care of us and it kills me just knowing they wanted to try. My uncle is an amazing person who has overcome difficult times himself, but my mom has always had a jealous resentment towards him. He is doing great things for his family business and is passionate about helping kids who have troubled lives like me to get their lives on track.

I moved out of my parents house at 15 while starting to work full time at 15 as well, barely graduated high school, and worked a handful of different jobs before I eventually went through a tech school. I'm 28 now and 13 years after leaving I'm doing pretty good in life. I have a great job and an amazing girlfriend and I'm happier than ever. I still can't help thinking about the ""what if"" part of it all. How would my life had been different if they took me in and where would I be in life now if I hadn't had to fight so hard to be where I am now? Would I be better off mentally or even worse knowing that my parents gave me up because they weren't fit to take care of us? Would I have rebelled while living with them because they're more strict or been happier living in a home being taken care of? How different of a person would I have become? I now have just a close enough relationship with both parents that I can casually talk and joke with them, but not close enough where we can talk about anything serious or even have arguments. Would I have had any contact with them if I had been raised by my uncle? I don't hate either of my parents, I just know they weren't fit to raise kids and I keep a certain amount of distance. I can't help but feel this sudden resentment towards my mom because of this. She had the opportunity to give us a better life, but because she has too much pride and jealousy we had to suffer through her mental instability and an angry alcoholic father. Part of me wishes they wouldn't have told me but at the same time I'm really glad they did. It feels so fucked up to think about all this, like there's two different timelines or something. There was a chance everything could have been completely different if they had pursued it and for some reason that scares me."
DAE have to remind themselves it's okay to feel good or be excited about something?,88,mfzc3s,6,"I'm sitting here drinking ice water, telling myself it's okay that I feel good about something good. I don't have to panic about it."
DAE never go to the doctor until it's too late?,62,mg1lu8,21,"Example: last year my glass french press with freshly brewed coffee shattered and covered me in boiling coffee. I got 2nd and 3rd degree burns all over my abdomen and leg but I didn't go to the doctor until a week later when I realized I couldn't fix my skin by myself and I was in so much pain I could not breathe.

I'm really struggling and this is the only place with people who might understand. This is just letting it out and will be unorganized because that is my brain. Sorry...


I really need to go to the doctor because I've had some very scary episodes (like heart attack feeling/thought I was gonna die episodes) over the past few months and I can't bring myself to make call/wait on hold/make appt/explain everything to a new dr.


These weren't panic attacks, as I've had plenty of those and am quite familiar, unless it's a new development of super panic attack. I've struggled with chronic autoimmune disease and POTSyndrome, endo and CPTSD for a very long time (I'm in my 30s) and at this point I just can't. Deal. 


This past summer an event triggered old childhood traumas and because of my POTS I already dish out 10x the amount of cortisol than a person is supposed to make, so all of my chronic issues have been really bad. I'm even more hyper vigilant and in fight or flight all the time.


Here's the thing, all my health conditions are not well known in the medical community... Dysautonomia (when you're autonomic nervous system just gives you the middle finger all the time) in general is just becoming ""seen"" in society because a lot of people who get Covid-19 are coming down with viral induced POTS. So it requires a lot of explaining and self advocating, a lot of doctors turning up their nose at my diagnoses because they haven't heard of it. Haven't found one willing to investigate the cause (apart from traumas, this is a chicken or egg type of deal). I moved to another coast a few years ago with my number 1 and I haven't found a new dr. I don't have any energy or will to do any of this. It's too much.


The thought of having to explain everything AGAIN, to be not taken seriously AGAIN, to be dismissed when I'm really scared I could die is so overwhelming that I am in constant freeze mode. There is only 1 POTS specialist in this state and he isn't taking new patients.

The event this summer was that my ancient, beautiful friend cat, who I had gotten when I was 14, was attacked by a cougar. I woke up to him screaming outside my window and I flew out of bed and ran outside barefoot to see my cat in the cougar's mouth. Without thinking, full fight mode, I charged at the cougar screaming like a wild animal and scared it enough that it dropped my cat and we both were able to run inside. He lived 4 more excruciating days after a vet visit and then we had to let him go. On my birthday. Since he was the last remnant of my childhood, and one of the only beings I could trust as a kid, I just. Broke. Alllllll my old traumas are hounding me all the time. I can't sleep because my mind is racing all the time, bringing up shit that I don't want to see anymore.

I don't have friends in this new place. I can't make friends I'm too fucking awkward and can't trust anyone, especially in a world where it seems like no one actually tries to get to know one another and genuine connection is my only setting. I'm completely isolated in a new side of the country, in the woods, which is extra hard as I spent the majority of my childhood in solitude while my mom locked herself in her room for hours a day and I wasn't allowed to get her unless I was bleeding. I was homeschooled, it was truly isolating, so I made animals my friends and confidants.

I have a loving husband but he has no concept of how to deal with this. I don't want to drive him away with my insanity, despite him saying that's impossible (he is a nice person) and so I know I need a therapist and a doctor to help me figure out my physical problems. It is literally my only drive. For him, not for me.
I have no will to help myself. Some days I do, but usually it is freeze to lock out the panic.


If anyone reads this, thank you. I don't even know why I'm writing it. I guess I just want someone to understand what I'm going through for once."
Does that feeling ever go away of wanting to contact your past abuser and ask them to apologize or aknowledge the damage they have caused in your life?!,22,mg7pmy,12,"Soo from 17 to around 23 I was in an abusive relationship with a narc.. he was either the best man I knew who took excellent care of me when I was sick with chronic illness issues, or the worst person I'd ever met.. this wasn't easy for me to realize at the time because I had grown up in an abusive household.

Its been 8 or so years I just realized, and it still feels very raw sometimes.. the flashbacks, the nightmares.. and random days of sadness, it all still hits me.

Why does this still make me want to contact this person to let them know just how much they have hurt me. ( I know this will only probably make them happy from what I've learned now) so it's obviously not going to help me but it just pisses me off that someone can cause so much havock in someone's life and then go on about theirs and be just fine.

Basically, I explained YouTube to my Mom 5 years ago and she managed to join a Cult and become racist. 

Trigger warning for

Religion/Cult/Christianity, Homophobia, Sexism, Racism, Drugs, Qanon content 


This has been very confusing to deal with. 

Before I moved out of my mother's house 5 years ago, I introduced her to the Internet. I was hoping she might find a new hobby or some friends, and gurl did not disappoint. 

She's always been a very religious person, and carries alot of unaddressed trauma herself. So she is very anti-everyone, feels 'out of this world' and has a hard time connecting to people even though she is (usually) a very kind person. She is a widow. Throughout my childhood my family was politically leaning very, very far left. Though my Sister and mother are very much 'conservative' now. We live in Germany. 

For those past years I've gone low contact with her. But I just became a mother myself, and met her to set some boundaries around her seeing her grandchild. Since then she has been sober and clean, and started going to therapy for her depression. It's been going very Allright. 
But every now and then she would tell me about her new religious beliefs. I wasn't opposed to listen, though my cult senses kept tingling because they have a 'prophet' lady and keep talking about Armageddon. I told her so, but she disagreed. 
Shortly before covid got to our country she started frequently talking about the world ending, which spiraled into Qanon territory. And, whelp. 

[trigger territory] 

Her phrophets Youtube channel was banned for homophobic content, and she angrily complained to me about the lack of freedom of speech. 
Now she's telling me that being Gay is not allowed, but God forgives me for being bi/confused (she doesn't really believe I'm bi), as I am engaged to a man and have already fulfilled my duty on earth, aka breeding. Women are biologically inferior to men and do right by obeying them, and obviously jews are bad and pedophiles. Also, her therapist works for the medical industry, so she's just telling him what he wants to hear and doesn't actually do therapy. 
I'm sure you can imagine that this was a terrible car ride. 

[end] 

I'm pretty set on this being a cult. They tick most boxes on what a cult is, luckily only online and no money (yet) attached. She might be spiraling into some psychotic territory, though I feel that is speculation. But, most importantly, I don't want racist/homophobic/anti feminist talk around my daughter. Especially from someone she will grow very close to if we keep seeing her as frequently as we do rn, which is at least once a week. We had an agreement on her seeking out therapy, which she isn't actually doing. And I don't want my kid to be scared that grandma might be right about us all dying and demons coming to earth, or mom and dad not being allowed in heaven and so on. I don't trust her to hold that back around my child. 

Now I'm torn on how to deal with this. I will probably just talk to her openly and tell her what I think. But I am scared to pull the ""if you don't do [x] you can't see your grandchild on a frequent basis"" again. It feels like I am blackmailing her, but I also feel very valid on wanting to protect my family from this.
I'm also scared that she might decide that we are not worth it, aka my abandonment wound is flaming up.

Any advice is appreciated."

It's nice that people care... I didn't expect this reaction.. also, thank you to everyone for the awards and sending me hugs..

Edit: To everyone asking me what makes me want to stay alive when I talk to a lifeline, I'm going to copy and paste a response I replied to someone below.

""They ask me why I'm hurting. I explain and bawl my eyes out. They validate. They keep me safe by keeping me away from things that would hurt me. They just listen to me scream and cry. I've literally just cried on the other end while they listened. If I get someone that doesnt seem like they can help me, I say I'm fine and hang up. Then I call back and get a different person. It's worked for me.

I've also had them help ground me by talking about random things until I'm calmer. We talked about lion king one time and the symbolism behind the movie. It calmed me down enough to stop having as intense urges and bring me back to the present."""

"My family is moving across the country and although I’ve wanted nothing more than to move out, I cannot seem to handle this",3,mgewam,2,"** Trigger Warning: Suicidal Idealization **

I’ve always planned on moving out of my parents house as soon as possible. I graduated college during Covid so staying home was the most viable option. When everything was over, I planned on moving out to my own place, even a state away. However I never wanted to be more than an hour or two away. 

My parents just retired and moved yesterday across the country. I’m talking a 20 hour drive. They took my little sister with them and although we are years apart, she’s my rock. I’ve been crying since yesterday. 

When I was thinking of moving it was fine, but now I feel abandoned. I can’t stand to read other posts that say “mommy and daddy won’t be here forever”. I have nothing tying me down here, except a mediocre-at-best relationship with someone who has told me they “couldn’t handle it” when I cried about my parents relocating. (I’ve always attracted the emotionally unavailable types). 

I guess I don’t really know what I’m asking. I want to move down near them, again about an hour away at most. But I’m afraid I’ll be stuck in this cycle. I’ve always figured I’d off myself when my parents pass away. Now is a great time to learn to be an independent person but I never had that foundation.

I just got back into therapy and my therapist sucks so I can’t even look to her for support. I feel like the rock and the hard place is always *needing* my family and being my own person."

Even when folks are nice to me i feel like i dont really have friends. Because people come and go so much. Ive been stuck on disability for the past 11 years. No real human contact outside the house due to anxiety/depression etc. except for online. I recently lost my online gaming group due to not wanting to deal with a person who was constantly rude to me so i left their discord. Now they dont really talk to me. Wed been friends since 2007 but its like oh well hes gone and it dont matter. I feel like im an invisible throw away person. Im not and i dont need them but i really wish people werent so complicated and like that. It seems so needless and silly tome. If you dont walk or talk a certain way, look a certain way, do this do that. Annunciate your words a certain way you dont belong. So many stupid rules people have. Theyre unspoken too so not like you can read them. Or you can but why would you even want to? So dumb.

&#x200B;

My therapist told me i have some form of PTSD the last time i seen her I dont get flashbacks or anything like that and i dont know much about this. Id quit seeing her because at the time i was feeling better and it kind of felt like a waste of money. But besides the PTSD i may or may not have, i definitely have avoidant personality disorder, social anxiety and some kind of depression, not sure on that one whether its bi polar or unipolar.Anyway ive been alone a really long time besides my wife. I dont leave the house anymore hardly at all. Occasionally a few times a month to get food or stuff from town. I can do that fairly okay.

But I have such a hard time when it comes to people. I obsess over it and worry if im gonna say or do something to push them away. That inevitably does, because then youre coming across as neurotic im sure.  I dont really know how to dress or talk or be a ""normal"" human. Dont even think i want to be. Dont get me wrong im at peace with who i am for the most part. I like who i am. Im a loving caring hopefully fun to be around guy. But   I just feel so disconnected from life and the world.  Im also a highly sensitive person. Ive learned to control that over the years to sort of harden my heart. But at the same time thats part of who i am and i dont really want to have to do that.  I dont know. Like i said just rambling.

I try to find people to talk to here on reddit and thats fine i guess but generally due to my age thats a no go or if i do find people they dont stick around past a few weeks. Ill get really depressed due to that feel like ive failed again. Then its time to move on and try it again. I read about people talking about dont get validation from other people. I get that. But sometimes the loneliness will kick in and its like some sort of disease /soul cancer or something always in the back of my mind waiting to strike.

I wish i could find a group, online or off where i could hangout, have some friends, some fun. Just enjoy life. But I really don't see that happening anytime soon. I really feel like this song ,

[kinda sums it all up pretty well.](https://youtu.be/9zCKMgfOMPo)

Thanks for listening to me ramble. Hope ya'll have a good rest of the day/week.

**Amazon Prime Lyrics**  
\[Verse 1\]  
Kate went to Vegas and she never came back  
Warner Brothers lost the love and gave me the shaft  
Well I'm okay I found a new lifeline  
Now I feel the hole in my heart with Amazon Prime  


\[Chorus\]  
So come wait outside my door  
Give me something to come home for  
'Cause my whole life is one big mess  
But when you come around it's a little bit less  


\[Verse 2\]  
Fluorescent condoms and DVDs  
Six wife-beaters and a plain white tee  
Well it ain't just me, it's my neighbours too  
Waiting on some love from China  
Just to get us through  


\[Chorus\]  
So come wait outside my door  
Give me something to come home for'Cause my whole life is one big mess  
But when you come around it's a little bit less  


\[Verse 3\]  
Uh I pull that tape and my face goes flush  
The anticipation is way too much  
There's a little piece, a little part me  
That thinks I might God in a box of teas  


\[Chorus\]  
So come wait outside my door  
Give me something to come home for  
'Cause my whole life is one big mess  
But when you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less  
When you come around it's a little bit less "
Being there for a struggling partner when you’re still recovering yourself,4,mgcyg1,1,"My boyfriend and I both have CPTSD, but I am in a better place right now than he is. He has gotten by through distractions such as work and socializing, and he has had periods of being in a seemingly okay place. The problem is his coping mechanisms aren’t sustainable, especially since he hasn’t been able to socialize and his work situation has been more stressful. 

Because I’m interested in learning about different treatments and general ways to improve things I struggle with, I read books on trauma treatment and things related to the brain. His experience with treatment has just been CBT awhile ago (which didn’t work and possibly made things worse for him) and anxiety medication. I know there are lots of things left for him to try that could be helpful and we do occasionally chat about things I read, but he is possibly at a place where anything other than his normal routine is too much and therefore reluctant to try things. 

I don’t try to push it, because it’s his decision, but I’m worried about him, and, unfortunately, it’s also impacting my mental well being. The neglect I experienced as a child was partially due to my dad not ever doing anything about his mental health problems, and so the echoes of this can be triggering at times. It’s particularly disruptive because it triggers the irritation and resentment I have felt towards my dad, rather than the compassion or patience I would hope to feel. 

People need to recover in their own time, but does anyone have advice on how to be there for them without it taking its toll on your own health, particularly when you’re in recovery yourself?"
"DAE over exert and feel burned out the next day, but you don't realize you're over exerting at the time?",75,mfwnup,17,"Basically the title. Last week I was pretty tired and overwhelmed and hadn't had the weekend before to rest, so I vowed to take last weekend off to rest mentally and physically. Saturday I mostly relaxed all day, but also hung out with some new people over Discord/Among Us and very quickly got overwhelmed so I left after a few rounds. I also played Mario Kart (no voice) with a Twitch community, which I do frequently and enjoy, and it was really fun. Sunday I had some energy for once so I cleaned a bit and took my dog to a new park we've never been to before. I got groceries delivered the day before so I prepped simple meals for the week. Then I played Among Us and was on voice chat with my group of friends. After about an hour of that I recognized I needed some alone time, so I got off the call and relaxed.

Today I'm exhausted and burnt out. I'm at work and can't concentrate. I made a mistake which caused a flashback and I cried for over an hour and was unable to work. This happens when I over exert myself but the thing is is that I didn't feel like I was doing too much this weekend. I definitely was more active than I usually am (usually I would only do one or not any of the above things I listed), but I was listening to myself and my emotions and what I needed. I gave myself rests when I thought I needed one and was gentle with myself all weekend - leaving the park when I felt tired, hopping off the voice calls, even pulling up a chair while I was finishing cooking.

It's frustrating because I don't know how to tell when I've over exerted. I'm having a REALLY bad day today because I can't gauge my own boundaries/limits and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else experienced this?"
Can someone recommend books to help a doctor who’s been though hell in work and is so traumatised they prefer to be in work than with family because work is “familiar”,9,mg9n90,6,"Basically as the header says
She works in all areas so sees kids dying of cancer works on them when they die, same for adults and elderly of all ages. And all traumas and deaths.

Covid been pretty hard and relentless and now she seems depressed and distant and switched off and has said multiple times “I find it hard to go home to the kids because I want to be in work because it’s familiar”

Can someone help out with some books I guess it’s ptsd and or depression but I’m know nothing about it.

And prehaps any books for me so I can understand it.

I there anything that will stay?,5,mganmg,7,"Is*

I left my abusive family, my hometown and the toxic friendships I had.
I’m changing, building myself up again and forming an identity, which has always been hindered up until now.

So I’m currently in college and I just know for a fact, that I’m adapting to my circumstances and to the people around me again. To a certain point it’s normal, but who will I be afterwards? 

After graduating everyone will go their way, live in a way which resonates with their parents and family and they will simply all have a sense of self.

Who will I be afterwards? I’m so afraid to even become someone right now, because afterwards a different lifestyle and attitude will be expected from me. I will graduate and then be completely lost and alone again.

Is there anything that I can hold on to? Something that will stay with me?"
I'm tired of being tired all the time...,1,mgl3bs,2,"I have trouble sleeping a LOT of the time, and even more trouble sleeping ""well."" Sometimes I have nightmares, sometimes they're about things that happened, sometimes they're entirely dream based, sometimes I'm not sure if they're real or not. 

This past week or so I managed to sleep when the sun was still down once, and that was last night. The day before I didn't sleep at all, and i had intended to stay awake the whole day to hard reset my sleep schedule. But I wound up passing out around one in the afternoon for several hours. What's worse is I had plans that day and I totally missed them because I just couldn't stay awake. 

But even with that, I managed to fall asleep around two or three in the morning and slept until around seven. But it's a quarter after ten and I'm struggling to stay awake again. 

It's like I have this deep, existential tiredness that permeates my entire life, and no matter how much I sleep, it won't go away. The fact that it's also just one of the ""smaller"" symptoms I experience on a daily basis makes it that much worse..."
"Hiding abuse is itself abuse, my family will never understand",38,mg0pie,2,"My father was extremely abusive to the extent that my younger brother was handicapped by him

Abuse was so normalized in my family that other family members hid it. 
Lying to police to protect my mom,  who was being abused but was also doing illegal things herself.

Example 
Few  Months after my brother was born severely disabled, both of my parents were arrested for prostitution and being a pimp.

Instead of us kids going into the system, my grandmother took me, dads grandparents took older sister,  and aunt took disabled brother till our parents where released and we where sent right back home to them.

They had no reason to change when another family member would step in between us kids and ANYONE trying to separate us and save us.

 The abuse didn't end until my father committed suicide in front of everybody.
And now the family says I should be thankful they helped so much.

Thankful?
Sure , thanks for letting people abuse me because those people where family. 
Thanks a ton 

They insist they aren't abusive and just wanted to help and I'm just too spoiled to see that. 

I've been homeless for 5 years, I published a book. 
My aunt claims her grandchildren need therapy from my book, but still insists I never needed therapy or help for living the book.

I just want them out of my life forever and they stalk me like obsessive lovers."
Telling my father he traumatised me,3,mgc6a5,2,"I am stuck living with my parents in the moment because I have bad health and I’m staying away from infection. I’ve recently realised that my father may have given me traumatizing experiences as a child by him throwing out his anger issues at me.

He seems not to understand why our relationship has been garbage, and blames all of it on me for being ungrateful. He is stubborn, quick to anger, close-minded, doesnt believe in mental health. Is it worth my time to explain all this to him? Or should I just pretend to be the good child he so desperately wants me to be?"
Wondering how many people here are LGBTQ+,37,mfyvs7,75,"I'm curious to see how many of us are part of the LGBTQ+ community so here's a poll!

Edit: adding my comment here so people dont have to dig around for it.

I love this so much, thank you beautiful people for your participation! I apologize for not using more inclusive language as it has been brought to my attention that having 'gay as fuck' instead of LGBTQ+ felt limiting to some. It was truly not my intention, and I'm unable to edit the poll now but know that if i could I would to better encompass the LGBTQ+ community.

Second edit: u/Infamous_Wave2217 wrote a great response below about the many reasons that using ""gay af"" as the umbrella term for the LGBTQ+ community is invalidating and damaging.

I am conflicted about keeping this up as the language I used is triggering to some but the conversations in the comments are super important.

"Finding a trauma therapist when you don't feel your ""trauma"" is enough of a trauma. HELP",20,mg1qmm,7,"I've struggled for years and I just want to be better. My aunt thinks I should see a trauma based therapist but i'm struggling to push myself to look for one for a few reasons

1 - I don't feel like my trauma's are enough to need a trauma based therapist, i feel like it'd be laughable to seek one even though my aunt says otherwise

2- I'm worried i won't connect enough with the therapist

3- I'm worried i'll not be totally honest with how bad things are, especially if it's not face to face due to covid.

4- I'd have to go private due to long waiting lists otherwise. I'm unemployed but have savings but don't want to waste money searching and searching to try and hopefully find someone helpful  


5- I don't know where to start."
Hope this is helpful to some of you,78,mfrt65,18,"I don't have CPTSD myself, but I appreciate this sub a lot and like to learn about trauma and mental health for the sake of broadening my compassion. A few days ago there was a post about how people without severe trauma can judge other people with trauma because they haven't achieved very much in relation to their standards, which stem from living a life that wasn't very difficult in a lot of ways.

It reminded me of a quote from Sylvia Plath that I would like to share with you. Sylvia Plath was a famous 20th century poet, and many of you probably know her or are a fan of hers. She was a known perfectionist, got straight As at school, got a scholarship to study at the university of Cambridge, was published in many literary magazines and journals since she was 8, won a scholastic art and writing award for her art aged 15, wrote a novel, released anthologies and raised two children. She was a very accomplished woman in so many ways but unfortunately, she struggled a lot with her mental health. This is what she had to say, in relation to personal achievement, in 1957:

>**""If I get through this year, no matter how badly, It will be the greatest victory I've ever done.""**

That's it, no accolades, no awards, no new book, or anthology. Simply, if I get through, no matter how badly, then it will be the greatest achievement of them all.

The same can be said for all of you.

I don't know how to cope when all the distractions are gone,16,mg2src,4,"I hate being left alone with my own thoughts, since lockdown - not seeing mates and not being able to go out - it's been so much worse than before. I cut back on weed and tabbaco but now I'm just self-harming more. I don't feel like shit all of the time, it comes and goes in spurts but I have zero fucking strategies to deal with it when it does come. It's 1am and there's no one here to distract me."
Maybe I should wait it out more?,5,mg99f0,1,"
TW: emotional abuse, verbal abuse, bad grammar ( I cheated my way to graduating pls be gently) 

 I told my mom how I felt about her and how she made me feel. And the whole truth this time. It was so much I thought I was going to throw up multiple times on my drive back home. I was sobbing and emotional and it was undoubtedly the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. These last five years practically my whole childhood that I can faintly remember bc I’m 19. My mother has built me up just break me down and do it all over again. 

 It went over Surprisingly well it’s most likely due to having multiple break through (exhaustive traumatic arguments) before laying everything out. The last 2 years we’ve had arguments  about small things but it was getting to be a bit much after beating around it too long. I just had to tell her everything she put me through. Although to be fair I have tried to call her out many many times before but she shut me down really quickly. It’s just now recently she’s even been letting me talk 20-30 seconds at a time. Which is really big progress compared to relentlessly cutting me off and telling me how I feel.

She was being genuinely motherly and apologetic. Towards the end of the conversation she starting falling into old patterns but I’ll take what I can get. The true test is in the next argument does she defend herself or trust my feelings and recognize them as valid.  It all felt so unreal as if an alien possessed my mother or something.

After that conversation I felt so deeply disturbed and uncomfortable. Do I just forget the trauma and move on? Do I treat her like she’s a perfect mom now? I thought I would feel better than this. I thought I would be healed. This doesn’t feel like happiness though..

Fast forward to now

She just got into a whole argument outside my door with my step dad about the car keys. He couldn’t find them and he told her. Although she doesn’t drive anymore it’s only me and him. 

So instead of communicating that him asking her that irritates her because she feel the better option would to be to ask me the other driver. She goes on a rant about how irresponsible we are with the keys and how he should just be a man and look. He needs to go to the source. To use his brain and use common sense because he’s lazy and not a real man. All this is in a grated angry yelling  tone. All while telling him how he feels. 

She says he needs to communicate with me. (Very mockingly) surprisingly he doesn’t fly off the handle probably due to the incessant 4 hour no exaggeration rants where she breaks you down and doesn’t let you leave or walk away until she’s convinced you and herself she’s right. And if you’d do your disrespectful and you just added another hour and she won’t let it go for at least a year. 

Seeing her argue in a conversation that I wasn’t in gave me so much clarity on how skewed her perception of information she’s given is viewed. 

Even in a everyday example you say something, she gets defensive, and repeats it back in a condescending mocking tone as if you said it exactly like that. Now your wondering did I say it like that?? Then tells you how you feel? And your like is that is that  how I feel??? 

And I have to sit back and listen to the arguing as per usual outside my door because if I mention it. I’m taking his side and “intervening on her marriage”. And to top it all off with a cherry on top she forces him to apologize to her 

I would describe a relationship with my mother as walking on a tightrope or essentially waiting for the other shoe to drop. I’m really really tired. I feel like I’m in a relationship with a awful boyfriend. He swears ups and down he’s going to change and ultimately you see a little progress but that person is still that person at their core. And they don’t even know they are.

Maybe she’ll never change ? Or maybe I just need to be more patient. Idk I just feel kind of stupid. Like I was conned or something. Why did I even try!!!????"
Persistent lack of motivation for something particular can be due to not wanting to feel thoughts or feelings associated with that activity,43,mfvlkj,2,"Lately I've focused a lot on trying to analyze mental phenomena. This was prompted by how the mental health system tells my mother to do stuff like take a shower, and then when she doesn't do stuff says the problem is her behaviour. It seems what they tell her to do fails to help motivate her, and only makes her feel bad about not doing it.

I've experienced a lot of this in my own life. Though with me both the idea that I ""should"" do something and the feeling bad for not doing it were almost always all in my mind. I practically never talk about it with others.

It seems that behind this persistent lack of motivation, which should maybe be labelled as persistent avoidance, I can find thoughts and feelings which I don't want to experience.

One thought is the idea that by doing something I'm working towards a terrible future I don't want. Another is that although I'm improving something, other far more important factors make the resulting quality of life improvement negligible. For some things I get the sense that it would lead me to painfully compare myself to others. There are more patterns, and I'm not going to try to list them all.

It seems avoidance of doing some things now can also be linked to past events. Apparently anger i dissociated in the past can be channelled into persistent refusal to do some things. Maybe as long as the refusal is present i don't have to feel the anger.

Often various factors like this weren't experienced clearly, and I instead felt a vague but powerfully painful ""Nooo!"" feeling about the idea of doing something.

Psychological addiction seems to work in a similar way. It's a seeking of something instead of an avoidance of something, but the desirable end result is also not feeling some thoughts or feelings."
What is it with parents projecting their insecurities onto their kids?,17,mg1sdg,4,"For as long as I can remember, I've been worrying about my weight, and so has my mom. Since I've been losing weight, she'd become a lot more judgemental towards my body and defensive regarding hers. She's saying things like ""don't lose any more weight or I'll look even bigger next to you"" or bashes my weight loss accomplishments completely by claiming ""it's much easier for you to do, since you have a lot of free time, no job (I'm in school atm) and a room to isolate yourself in"".  Besides that, she's also constantly saying that she looks fat and whatnot, yet judges others for their bodies. I also noticed she often tries to hide whenever she eats something, meaning she's clearly ashamed of it. //Obviously not a good message to convey to a child. 
She's not once told me that I look pretty either, or even just that I'm fine the way I am, but has made dozens of comments about my eating habits, back when I was still a child (on top of my father body-shaming me on a daily basis but that's another story..). She's a very easy going and sweet person other than that, but these kinda things really mess(ed) with my head, aside from hurting like hell and making me feel worthless."
"Starting to think I'll never know what ""okay"" feels like.",20,mg115x,2," Yeah yeah I know, recovery takes time, it isn't linear, different for everyone, ups and downs, good days and bad, all that stuff.

It  doesn't stop me from feeling like I'll never really know what ""okay""  is. I know ""okay"" as in ""surviving"", ""okay"" as in ""struggling on"", but  not ""okay"" as in content, or peaceful, or genuinely feeling ""okay"" rather than feeling like I'm just barely keeping my head above water.

""Are  you alright?"" is a common greeting here. I usually say yes, but I don't know if I'll ever really mean it, even on the good days."

It all barely helped, and nothing really resonated or was relatable, until yesterday I started reading the book mentioned above.

Some questions:

- What are good forms of therapies/treatments? I’m in therapy but here in the Netherlands CTPSD is not really yet acknowledged. I will bring it up next session anyway.

- My body is 24/7 in some sort of flight or fight mode, even though my thoughts are calm most of the time. Any advice to heal the body?

- Any other advice or sources are greatly appreciated. I’m also a serious meditator so if you have some advice/traditions I greatly appreciate it.

Can't get excited about my baby shower,8,mg69jc,6,"Last year, I finally cut ties with my abusive father who gave me cptsd.  It was a good decision, but I've been waiting for him to finally stop ""playing along"" and confront me.  This anxiety went up ten fold when I announced I was pregnant.  I heard through the grape vine that he was posting on facebook about how much he was going to love this grandkid and how he couldn't wait to hold them.  

  
He's a pedophile, so this made me want to vomit, but it also confirmed my fears that he thinks this is just a phase that I'm going through and that I'll clearly break so my kid can have a grandfather.  


My dad loves to push boundaries in front of a crowd, because he knows I hate public drama. So I'm pretty sure if he confronts me, it's going to be at my baby shower.  This time I won't be silent, and I'll announce to however many people we can have with COVID restrictions that he's a pedophile. 

The frustrating thing is that I don't want this to be about him. I want it to be about my new family that is growing. I want it to be a happy day.  But I know even if I'm wrong, I will be tense the entire time, waiting for that damn shoe to drop."
Ugh... I really don't know what else to title this,2,mgg6hq,1,"""So I went to an NA meeting and was talking about you....they want you to know your ""aunts and uncles"" in NA Love you for your strength and courage for attempting to rebuild a relationship and we all know how hard it must be for you!!!"" - email that I just read from my mother who I've been NC with for a while but I've been putting in some work to sort of accept her back into my life because she's ""doing better."" I don't even want to deal with her, I just want to forget she ever existed... But in order to do that, I would have to give up all contact with her side of the family... I don't know what to do anymore... This email just sort of set me off. I really wish I was home right now so I could just go and scream and cry somewhere.

Just as background, I've tried going NC because she's been emotionally abusive(although I'm still trying to accept that's what it was) and neglectful my whole life. I pretty much blame her for practically every reason I have CPTSD because if it wasn't for her stupid actions and decisions I wouldn't have ever had to deal with any of those things... Basically, I've paid the ultimate consequences for her decisions. And I've also never told her this altogether... I'm not really sure how to, but I also know that I'm sick of her being in the dark and being so oblivious. I don't really know why I'm even posting this, but here it is, I need to say it to someone because I can't risk having a meltdown today."
Really frustrated with 'being the better person',14,mg252k,2,"I'm venting because I can't vent. My parents are to me, horrible and irredeemable people. But I have tried so hard to be fair for my younger siblings. My parents don't have custody of them anymore and I live with my siblings so even though I'm no contact with my parents, I will occasionally have to hear/deal with them. I try to be as honest and fair as possible so my siblings understand the weird position we are all in without making it unnecessarily harder on them. When I have to explain some things I don't go into detail, I just say that our parents weren't good to us, that their problems were serious enough to remove custody and I hope that they will take this time to learn how to be good for them. 

I have never expected my parents to be fair or kind back and they really haven't. Everything that my siblings do that they don't approve of is because of me. I'm always making the wrong choices when it comes to them. And they constantly lie about everything or tell them things about me that isn't their business to share. 

I tend to have the hardest time with the lies. I can't stand it. Especially when the lies are about me, for those I'll usually try to correct. Everything else I do my best to not make things worse with a lot of finger pointing. I know that it'll just divide and hurt my siblings more.

But I just feel like venting today because I heard another lie from my parents today and it's so unfair that they can say, ""Oh I was so nice to (relative) back then."" when the truth is so fucked up.  And the absolute kicker is that if I say, ""Oh that's not true."" then I'm being the bad guy and hurting my siblings. And it's not like I can just open that door and not back it up with facts which would clearly be inappropriate to tell them. So instead I have to shrug it off and not say anything. It's so hard to do that though when they don't deserve to repaint the past like that and force me into that position.

I know that they can't admit to being a bad person, but it just feels like they found another way to dig at me. Living with them, they did no wrong and everything was all my fault. I just thought that once my siblings and I were finally away, that I was free from being dragged into this crap."
Need help seeking help,13,mg2l7u,3,"I have lurked here for a long time now because it’s a place I can read others experiences and feel validated in my own. I second guess my trauma a lot, like many of you, and I am very worried about seeking counseling/treatment. I have been treated for depression and anxiety in the past, but I’ve realized in the last 1-2 years that those were simply symptoms of cPTSD and I want to find a way to tackle the root cause. Do I just waltz in there and say “I think I have cPTSD”? Are there specialists I can seek out? I’m honestly terrified of having an experience like I’ve read from others where I’m basically told my trauma isn’t real and I don’t suffer from the disorder... 

Sorry if this post is difficult to read or it’s a stupid question, my brain is all over the place today. Thank you guys."
Medical neglect,5,mg7net,7,"Just a big fat trigger warning. 
Self harm. Medical neglect  

So forget the fact that my mom neglected my mental health for years. Cancelled therapy appointments that my school forced her to make after the school threatened to baker act me. And cancel therapy appointments I begged for after telling her I wanted to die on multiple occasions. Or her ignoring all my attempts to make her care about me. Or when I overdosed on Tylenol all the time and when I eventually confessed to her she responded with ""I know""  
Yeah forget all that. 
Let's start on a fresh slate and say she's been forgiven of all that for some wonderful (sarcasm here) reason. 

I've been gaining weight like crazy for several years now. I've always been sensitive to tempatures. Always been crazy depressed or anxious. I always suspected my thyroid was slow. And told my mom I needed to get it checked. She never took me to the doctor. Well I also have memory problems. I went to the doctor today. O have thyroid problems. 

So quest diagnostics has this cool thing where you can look at your test results. Including past ones. Including ones from when I was 15. I checked the blood work. The only blood work ever taken of me, I might add. I have a slow thyroid. But did we ever follow up. Nope. Did I ever get treatment. Nope. 

I'm so angry and hurt. And I cant say anything because it's pointless. There will be some reason why we never went back Or she will deflect it. Or even somehow blame it on me. Or she will get upset and call my dad saying I'm attacking her. So he will just call me and yell at me for yelling at her. 

I'm at a losing battle. Not only did she ignore my mental health which most of the world ignores. She also ignored my physical health. But she didn't ignore my siblings. They went to the doctor regularly. I didn't. I always got cancelled. 

I'm just hurt."
My education is being impacted,8,mg4x0p,1,"I am currently in school for massage therapy, I worked extensively in the field and also worked extensively with a psychologist prior to and continue to do so while I am in school. However, I had an instructor who has proven many times that they are unfit to conduct themselves as an instructor due to their lack of trauma-informed and evidence-based research approach to therapy... I have worked very hard on what  I have been through in order to prepare myself for a very touch-based therapy. I decided to enter this profession in order to work on safe touch therapy and creating a safe space to work with those where touch has created a negative space and allow them to feel a sense of control and respect for themselves. I want more resources available to those with negative touch experiences to be able to get back in touch with their nervous systems and learn how to stabilize it when trauma responses take over. However, through that I had an instructor perform a very unnecessary and invasive technique on me without any consent. I was on the table in a paralyzed state, my trauma response is to freeze and I really did freeze when they did that. They claim themselves to be an experienced practitioner and yet they were unable to pick up on my complete rigor to my body in response to their touch. They reached between my thighs to perform the technique without informing me and asking consent. I was not only mortified, horrified, and completely terrified, but I felt so broken and put right back in my trauma experience... I was also so sad for the profession as we still had practitioners like this, not only with the general population but also educating future therapists. I also work in the bar and pub industry and a mere day later had a customer start shouting about her trauma experience, to the point that I heard my own voice coming out of their mouth in response to my trauma response... I have stopped attending this instructor's classes as of now. I also reported their conduct to the administration department and will continue to go up the chain until this is properly addressed. I am making myself so vulnerable and feel so insanely exposed, however, in no way was what this instructor demonstrating appropriate or even necessary for what we were being taught... this technique is something we breach in our 5th semester, I am only in my second... they made a very poor move and continuously show a disregard for student and patient safety... I am done letting things like this slide... I want to be an advocate for those who do not feel they have a voice and I refuse to let a therapy such as massage therapy be sullied by therapists who do not deserve the title... we won't change unless we demand change... however... I am terrified to return to their class and engaging in homework to any extent is exhausting... I am reaching out to this community for support and guidance and also just a huge hope that you are all safe and that we come together to make this world safer for those who follow us. I wish you the best and thank you for the support and I find my voice and my strength in speaking out for a safer future... much love. - Pineapplemilkshake."
Been made aware of a serious symptom of my illness...,18,mfz8gn,3,"Does anybody else deal with this?

For years I've dealt with anger and the occasional fit of rage (blow up) \[maybe every 6 months or so\]. But I'm noticing a pattern that I can't let go of now. I take things very personally, that maybe even aren't meant to be about me, but I perceive it that way. Once this happens I enter a hyper-aware, vigilant, anxious state, and I try to confirm my own bias. Once I do (because I always can) it results in what feels like righteous anger, where I then berate a loved one, or belittle them for speaking to me in what I perceived to be condescending.

I'm working on this now, but I'm looking for patterns anyone has found in themselves similar to this, and maybe if someone has more insight into what's happening in the brain.

\[Ritual Abuse topics and possibly triggering\]>!my parents also trained me to isolate and cause problems as a part of maintaining abuse, so does anyone relate there? I think this comes from that.!<"
"How harsh was it? (TW: Physical, Emotional, Verbal Abuse)",7,mg66fe,14,"It took me a while to understand how bad the abuse was at home. I’ll try to not make it too long, please bear with me...


When I was younger, my parents (mainly my dad) used to beat the mess out of me and my siblings for the smallest things, like if I made a mess at home, didn’t clean up the room, forgot to do our chores, etc. I even remember when my dad would help me do my homework, he would beat me if I kept getting the answer wrong, and at one point having bad handwriting. 


And some of these weren’t just a few beatings, some would go on for a minute and beyond. There was this one time when my younger brother stole ice cream from school, and when my dad found out from the school, he beat him for 3 cycles (beating, rest, resume beating, etc). He was covered in bruises and my mom almost called the cops on him (dad laughed at this btw).


He’d also yell at us too before the beatings (sometimes during the beatings). Like literally every time he would come to our room or come back from work, we were either shaking or frozen, and every time we talked to him we would stammer or fumble our words, then he’d yell at us for not speaking up, or would accuse us for lying (which yes, would lead to an unnecessary beating). Even as an adult now, I still find it hard to talk to my dad because of all the things he did.


The crazy and confusing thing about all this is after all that, my dad would say things like “We’re only doing this cause we love you son” or “I don’t want to see you end up like those bad kids out there.” He would even say “When you don’t do what I tell you to do, that’s why I spank you. There’s so much more examples I can put here, but I don’t want to make this too long.


I never saw these things as “wrong” growing up. In fact, I felt I deserved all that for disappointing my dad (of course my mom too, who wasn’t as intense as my dad, but still abusive nonetheless). It was hard to see him as a bad dad because he still fed us, bought us gifts and things we needed, praised us for our endeavors (good grades, graduating, getting a job, etc.) Still, these are vivid examples of abuse and gaslighting, but a part of me still thinks “it wasn’t that bad” or “others had it worse.” I just wanted to see from all your opinions of “how harsh” the abuse was, since I grew up minimizing the severity of what my parents did to me and my siblings.



Tl;dr: Physical, emotional, and verbal abuse from parents, sprinkled with acts of kindness, is making it hard for me to see “how harsh” the abuse was in my family.



Thank you all for reading, and I look forward to all your responses"
''It's not okay to be too functional or happy'',63,mfpq7y,13,"I've been taking care of myself probably more than ever. From going to the dentist to finally figuring out why my skin always hurts, from yoga and meditation in the morning to booking a (safely distanced) vacation. And covid/this last year has been about breathing, taking breaks, slowing down. Which has been the biggest change. When I'm early for an appointment, I don't runwalk around the block stressing myself out more – I sit on a bench and watch life go by, close my eyes in the sun, take a sip of water. 

I'm getting emotional typing that – because taking up that space, I can't remember ever doing that. Wherever I am, I always expect someone to say: can you leave? can you move? can you get me a drink? And for years, my automatic fawn response meant that I would be standing up before they'd even finished their sentence. 

It hurts that my (pretty shitty) therapist never understood what I meant. If you're happy, that's good! Yes, but the moment I'm enjoying myself, it's also triggering. I'm on edge, to say the least. A wave of shame and guilt hits me. I feel selfish. I get paranoid, think someone must be watching me. I project my inner critic, my mother, onto the world. And I'm aware of it, but can't stop it. 

If she could hear me breathe, she'd yell at me. Sighing was out of the question. I would stare at something and she would follow my eye line, draw conclusions, then attack. I wasn't allowed to sit on the couch anymore because it sagged – so she drank her coffee on it, while I sat on the floor during a visit. In hindsight, that was probably another weight comment. It's not normal, I know that – but it's all I've ever known. 

I do smile when I see how my own couch has sagged. How friends have spilled stuff and panicked, and I didn't care. After a lot of healing, I can breathe. Looking at whatever I want – that one I still struggle with. Some people do follow your eye line, not meaning anything by it, but it's been too triggering. There's progress, albeit slow, and that's important to remember. 

&#x200B;

A week ago or so I was really happy. And I had worked for it. Exercised, then did my yoga and meditation, got some stuff done, did some therapy exercises, cleaned my apartment. I kept saying out loud: it makes no sense for me to be this happy! Pandemic, loneliness, zero people in my life, no career goal I'm working towards, just doing some simple self care – and yet. I was so happy. 

And then it all came crashing down a lot harder than it has in a while. I mostly felt so, so selfish. Immediately there was depression. And fear of abandonment, most of all. 

Of course anger wasn't okay either. But sadness was definitely more accepted – at least I was easy to control that way, she didn't have to envy me, I wasn't a threat. And it was all black sheep gossip material, of course. It makes so much sense that to be safe, I become depressed. I make myself small and miserable. 

&#x200B;

I don't know how to let go of what she taught me, because it's in my body. The moment I'm happy, I feel unsafe. Sometimes, thank god, I get so angry. That doing well is something to be punished. She rolled her eyes when someone was happy, called it being lucky, showing off, self obsessed. People work for it. I work so hard for it. Maybe a rare few are just very lucky – but the rest of us work. Why on earth would you make someone feel bad about it. 

I'm trying not to obsess about it, be curious instead. Have hope. One day I'll figure this out. Bird by bird. But it can be very disheartening, when simple things are made extremely difficult by CPTSD. When no therapist was ever properly educated on it. When a bunch of them retraumatized me. When taking care of yourself is followed by an emotional flashback. I am still being punished for being happy. And I don't know how to unlearn what she taught me – the stumbling in the dark is so frustrating. Because I feel like I'm just experiencing the same thing over and over. Self care > happines > emotional flashback > depression. 

How am I learning? Am I not just still stuck in the same vicious cycle? How do I let go of this fear? Kind of rhetorical question, but also kind of not – if anyone has any wisdom, experience, resources to share, please do.

"DAE have a hard time going through old text messages, pictures and videos?",15,mfz6eo,6,"This is always rough for me because I knew what place I was in as I'm reviewing it especially due to trauma. As I'm reviewing them, I can't help but think ""pre-trauma"", ""during trauma"" and ""post trauma"".  It's mostly ""post trauma"" though. Going through old text messages, I saw that majority of the texts that I sent were out of fear or anxiety, a cry for help or desperation. As for pictures and videos, it's also hard because I tried to look happy on the outside but on the inside, I felt so much loneliness and emotional pain. I remember during those times I felt dead inside. It's just all triggering for me and makes me feel very sad, even though I'm healing right now.

Can anyone relate or does anyone else feel this way when you going through old stuff on your phone?"
Why is spanking considered less harmful? (Vent and TW),104,mfmmnj,33,"Why is spanking considered less ""bad"" than hitting? I know people who would say, ""That's normal discipline"" and ""At least you weren't hit"".


I remember being a child, terrified out of my mind as this angry adult man chased me, pinned me down as I was screaming and crying for him to stop, and hit me out of sheer uncontrollable rage. What does it matter what *part* of me he hit?

To make it worse, I already had issues being touched on the lower body. Being hit there felt humiliating and *violating*. I don't think they can ever understand how exposed and scared I was. But sure, I ""wasn't hit"". /s"
"Hey guys, I’m new here and could use support (MULTIPLE TW)",15,mfztfe,2,"I’ve been on so many meds and misdiagnosed so many times it’s ridiculous. I was MDD, bipolar 2, BPD, back to bipolar 2 and now CPTSD. It makes sense to me but at the same time I’m scared and feel alone. I have a close friend who has PTSD due to a horrifying event she endured and I feel like I don’t “deserve” the CPTSD diagnosis, even though they’re different disorders. 

I want to share a small portion of my story to see if anyone can relate. My mom was physically ill and in the hospital a lot when I was a young child. She also developed stage 3 cancer when I was 18. I have Heath anxiety because of this and my loved ones tease me for always assuming the worst when I’m sick or others are sick. 

My mom also suffers from a mental illness and an eating disorder and verbally hurt me on several occasions, but most of the time we had a good relationship. Same thing with my dad, as in she would get into horrible fights with him as well. I know she self harmed but she didn’t do it in front of me. I got bullied (verbally) a lot in middle school which I know is a common occurrence but it didn’t help. 

My brother also suffered from a mental illness and he took his own life when I was 17. This destroyed me even though it was 7 years ago. I have no other siblings.

I never feel safe, I harass my boyfriend multiple times a day to drive safe because I’m always convinced something will happen. I have a lot of BPD type behaviors which was why I was misdiagnosed, like identity problems, deep shame, explosive anger etc. 

I’m worried that this is another misdiagnosis but it does seem to fit. The fact that it fits makes it scarier to me. I could use some support right now if it’s ok to ask for that"

How can I stand up for myself without getting into emotional fight?,4,mg7gox,3,"I had my roommate who confront me about text message I sent her the other day. She had a problem with my pan being laid around the stove and counter top before so I put my used pan in the cabinet where all the pans and pots are at. I wasn't done with my pan so I didn't want to put it in the sink and I wanted to put it in reachable space. She got angry at me and texted me saying ""please do not put your pan in cabin and dont let it happen again. it is disgusting"" I thought she was being hateful for no reason when I didn't think it was a such a big deal. I didn't know what her expectation was about having clean space when I was literally complying her request by putting it somewhere else. so me thinking it wasn't such a big deal I thought she was being unreasonable hateful towards me and taking her stress out on me because of her school. I shoot her back and said ""maybe if you stop taking your stress out on people, not everything is as detrimental as It seems. just an advice."" And she got FLIPPED OUT and started attacking me verbally over text and said i'm not in the place to give her advice when I mixed dirty pans are with clean ones. I mean I get she didnt like the fact that she found dirty pan in cabinet but it seemed overly critical of her to send aggressive text message when I put pan in cabinet for her because she complained about it being in her sight?? She asked me to have a. talk with me today because she was pissed about how ""disrespectful"" my text was.

When she started complaining about how offended and angry she was, (even though I never intend to to upset her that much and just wanted her to back off and stop texting me about small issue around kitchen.), I couldn't stand up for myself and say she shouldn't be so aggressively sending messages about pan being in the certain place when  she never set a clear expectation of how things are supposed to be in the kitchen in the first place. it was very confusing for me when she started to get mad at me for things not being in the right place and then get mad at me for defending myself on her negative text. I just stood there when she kept on yapping about how annoyed she was and how unacceptable it was to put pan in cabinet and what I said to her in the text. my brain kinda froze in the moment when she was spitting out her words and I didn't know how to respond to her. now that im looking back at it she said a lot of things that aren't even relevant to our issue and she had a very strong opinions about how she interpreted the situation SOLEY based on her perspective and needs. She said what I sent her was unacceptable and people. aren't going to be nice to me if I talk that way. UMMM maybe because I was mad at your insensitive text and you sent me rude text first?  When I told her how insensitive her text sounded like when she said it was disgusting, she practically yelled at me and said it was disgusting. I didn't know how to react or what to say and got immediently quite after she raised her voice. I don't know why I couldn't just take control of the situation and tell her my opinion in an assertive manner. (And tell her to keep her tone down.) I always regret and beat myself up for not saying things that I needed to say in the moment after the interaction. Now I feel like I am falsely accused and im angry at myself for letting her  walking all over me without trying to understand from my perspective. I was basically going along with whatever she was saying and could not express any form of emotions when I had different opinion. It was extremely hard to find a right moment to speak my mind when she was talking without a break. I didn't want to come off rude or cut her off so I just kept quite and listened until she finished talking, but I feel like I should have been more assertive and expressing what I actually think  when she pushing her point of view on what happened. I didn't know how to oppose to her opinions when she had such a strong opinion about me and what I did. Most of all I was afraid of possible conflict that could arise if she got upset with me. I hate dealing with people who want to complain to me.  Why can't I be confident in expressing my emotions and needs?

Help with husband whose wife suffers C-PTSD.,7,mg39hw,7,"DAE experience this??


I suffer from C-PTSD. My husband used to go to see my therapist individually off and on for help with some of the issues he may be experiencing. Not only being a husband of a person diagnosed with C-PTSD, but I'm also disabled and he is my caretaker. He also suffers from PTSD and ADHD. So it was a great stress reliever for him to have someone to talk to. Right now he is not seeing my therapist but is encouraged to.


Recently? Like in times past? His office (which is actually supposed to be shared space) has been turned into a refuge for him. It is so full of trash and other things that it is difficult to traverse. It is hazardous.   


I know he is doing this because he is having issues with his own PTSD. He has been discussing his trauma issues with me lately. Telling me things I never knew. Even though I've been his wife 20 plus years. So I think the reason he's covering his office with trash and making it insurmountable to enter is because he's hiding what his real issues are and he wants to make sure no one can touch him so that he can be protected. I'm not a therapist. I'm just guessing this because of prior behavior and  therapeutic sessions with other therapists.

I need things to be clean and organized. I want things to be. Today I told him I was going to go in there and clean everything up. He basically told me to shut up. I have discussed this with my therapist but sometimes it is just too much for me. 


He refuses to get help for his PTSD or ADHD or other things that he has going on with him. As his wife I can love him and try to learn how to help him with the help of my therapist.

Vent about my childhood abuse,5,mg4tsc,1,"When I was 3-4 years old my father was an alcoholic and so was my mother. My mom would work late at night and my dad worked day shifts so he’d take care of me during the day. 

Now one day this past year I started to become aware of the trauma I had made myself forget due to being in similar settings to where it took place. I noticed when I would be in a basement with the lights off (because my friends would mess with me as we all messed with eachother) I would start to freak out and and my stomach would drop and I’d become hysterical. 

 I brought it up to my mom and describe the dreams I was having reliving my trauma. I was tied to a pole in the basement by my dad and left down there in the dark for what I can only guess was maybe 30 minutes. I have been able to forgive since then and heal but I wanted to share my story. Turns out I was correct because I confronted my dad about it and he admitted to it. He told me he was drunk and he did that to “show me the danger of the world and all the messed up people in the world” I know it was just classic manipulation from him but I am bigger than him.

Were they ever a friend?,2,mg8ly5,3,"TW; Emotional abuse, emotional harm, mental breakdown 

I recently have had some major “can of worms” reopened due a friend’s partner. A little backstory. This friend was my best friend, was my confidant, was someone I generally trusted. I can’t say I feel the same today. They’re partner gas-lighted me for almost 2 months before I realized the signs. This person dragged my character down, ripped my voice out, and swayed any and all they could that knew me. They even went so far as to comment on things like my sleeping schedule, who I was playing with, and so on. I felt trapped all over again, like I couldn’t go or do anything without this person ripping me apart. 

I was having to take anxiety meds just to even deal with this person. I was breaking down daily and I was losing my sanity. My friend ended up breaking a trust by telling their partner all that I confided in her. This person then proceeded to rip me apart even more by telling me I shouldn’t be telling or stressing out my friend. That all I was doing was stirring up drama by confiding in her. In a sense I stopped calling this friend my best friend and now I can’t trust her at all. 

This person caused several friends to abandon me and one straight up lied to me and stole from me yesterday and I was so full of rage and anguish that I was in and out of tears. They have said so much and caused so much damage that I have this feeling this person wants me dead. Why else would they continue to stir up all this drama when I haven’t responded anymore.

its just hard. there were so many layers of manipulation that my empathy, trust, and respect in/for them were constantly being stripped and hastily reapplied and now that i'm 'free' my brain is just a puddle. 

i want to give them peace. i'm angry of course, and sometimes its targeted at them but overall i know they were just another cog in the machine. i'll always love them, but its a hollow kind of love that i'm not sure i trust - do i really love them or am i just supposed to love them. and then reality starts to drip away because if i can't trust my own feelings than what can be trusted, yknow?

anyways. i don't want vengeance. i'm not giving them the silent treatment to get back at them. at this point i just don't feel any type of desire to have any kind of relationship with them. it sucks because this is clearly having some negative effect on them (apparently they're very sad) and i feel bad for making them sad but going over there isn't going to fix it. every time i try to see them i shut down or implode and leave things worse than they were.

For the rest of my life until 2 years ago, he would come home after a year working abroad, very little to no communication in between, demanding that I be a sweet, loving kid to him. Take care of him, be a submissive girl who cooks, cleans for him. And every time he will have outbursts of rage towards me since I do not meet this standard of him. This is my idea of him growing up, someone so angry at me for not being what he expects me to be.

I am depressed, anxiety ridden, almost 30, struggling to pick myself up because it’s hard to find a job during a pandemic, so I’m stuck here living with my parents. Everyday feels like a battle, I struggle to do anything, to pick up for myself, to clean, to eat. My thoughts are over run by suicidal ideation. This is a trigger to my father, who expects me not be lazy.

He had another outburst of anger last night. Telling me he spent all his life providing for me and that it was wasted. I tell him it’s just not natural for me to be what he expects me to be. This angered him more, telling me(roughly translated) ‘If you don’t change, you’ll go through me. You’ll see.’ He was smashing plates and glasses, pacing as if wanting to punch someone. This made me walk out of the conversation. My mother tried to pacify, but was barely even there. Like always.

On the other hand, I can understand why he hates me so much. They wanted me to be someone successful, they threw money at me when I needed it. He worked his but off working alone abroad. They provided food, shelter, despite being retiree age. Maybe I should have been more grateful, suck it up and fake being another person? But if I do, it feels fake and icky to me. They will sometimes try to reach out to me, but my father always ends up saying something insensitive to me that he says are jokes, and me walking away angrily.

I struggle looking them in the eye, talking to them, showing I care. It makes me feel disgusted at myself if I try to push myself to be a ‘sweet, loving girl’ when I feel like all my life I’ve been forced to. Maybe I still have resentment towards him for all the times he never apologized to me for making me feel like garbage. Reduced to an invested where he feels like he’s been scammed. 

I feel so pressured in my own life, struggling to function everyday, and I’m too weak willed to tell them this to their face lest he throws a plate directly at me this time; it’s so hard to talk to them. They are highly religious and don’t believe in mental health. They are stubborn and narrow-minded. Or am I just being whiny? But I plan to finally tell this all to him in a long letter, but I need to know before I do, am I just being over dramatic?"

This is terrifying because I’ve only shared this with my Psychologist.,1038,mf6vdx,205,"I’m scared to put my story out there but I’ve been lurking on this sub for awhile and everyone seems so supportive.

I was raped by my biological father from the age of 4 until I was 9. He tormented me physically, emotionally and psychologically until I was well into my 30’s. 

I’m sorry. This is all I can handle disclosing. It’s not much I know but it’s a big step for me. 

Much love to all survivors. We’re not victims anymore. ❤️ 💪🏻

[ TW COVID] I’m reaching out to see if anyone can share information (personal or medical) about getting the Covid vaccine if I’m still sick with long haul.,2,mg7v0r,1,"Hi, to start off, I am not an anti vaxxer, but I’m posting this question here because you’ve all been amazing with support when I’ve posted in the past. I’m feeling uncertain about getting the vaccine for long haul reasons, for mental illness and the benzo/antipsychotics I take, and because I have childhood trauma related to being given medications from someone I don’t trust based on information that is still being studied. 

Two reasons:
1. I have long haul, still sick and have been reading (reputable) articles with mixed answers. And also answers that “no” professionals really don’t know about the vaccine and long haulers. Everyone is still learning about this world pandemic. 

2. I have a mental illness that requires me to take benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and antidepressants. I’ve done as much research as I can and the meds I take have not been used in trials. I know it’s unlikely there would be an interaction, but when I start hallucinations and a voice speaks to me through my headphones... I’m not willing to risk it. 

If anyone has the same questions, gotten answers, or done your own research it would be great if you could share!

DAE fuck up everything as soon as there are expectations and evaluations?,38,mfo5m3,4,"I fucked up very college course I attended because either I had no motivation or I had too much anxiety to participate in classes or I felt too stupid to do it.

What do your weekly therapy appointments look like for you?,2,mg7dcj,7,"I've been in therapy a little over a year now, we started doing emdr around Mayish of 2020. We've done mostly emdr since but we've also done some other exercises that required bilateral stimulation such as resetting emotional circuits. I go every week for an hour and a half and my current appointments are almost always emdr, it feels like when we meet up my therapist basically asks ""what do you want to do emdr for today?"". I don't like doing emdr tbh, but I look at is as a chore that I have to do to get better. Still, I wonder if there's something that's missing. I love just traditional talk therapy but at the start of my appointments my therapist will let me kind of vent and then after a bit she'll steer us back to emdr, either recommending doing emdr for what I was talking about or letting me choose what I want to do emdr for. What do your therapy appointments looks like? How long are they? How often are you doing emdr? Just curious to hear others perspectives and experiences :)"

"How do people with cptsd deal with intimacy and vulnerability, how do you learn to hide it well so you do not attract predators?",35,mfo81g,23," I found that quote that could not describe me better, how do people with cptsd deal with initmacy issues. I always thought vulnerability is key and a power but it was only used against me so I try to no longer be vulnerable because that only attracts predatory people

I found people who mistrust others or fear intimacy have a difficult time forming close relationships. Perhaps they learned this a child or came from a chaotic home environment. Also, they (sometimes without knowing it) put that *vibe* out there and others pick up on it (usually through social cues and body language) causing more isolation.

To develop close friendships, you have to be willing to show vulnerability in front of others. This takes a certain amount of risk, people fear rejection or ridicule…especially men."
An employee came up behind me in michaels when i had my headphones in,5,mg33hk,6,"She stood there for a while, I turned around and *then* she asked if I needed anything. Like what the fuck? Then another guy came down the isle all creepy, said hey, and then kept passing by the same isle (which I was in, looking at yarn). I was already kind of dissociated today and this just freaked me the fuck out. I haven’t had a real in-public panic like this in a while, but I got into the car and started having a panic attack. Like why the fuck would you ever need to stand behind someone??? What if I had a fight response instead fold and I had turned around and fucking hit her? Like jesus christ dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?

College - imposter syndrome,7,mg0gdj,1,"My first semester back in college in 10 yrs. And while I felt pretty certain in my decision to return and my major...it’s all pretty triggering. Avoiding seeking help because that’s not been part of my surviving skills so my body is like “eject eject eject” and that inner critic is so abusive I start to feel like who am I kidding attempting to lead this sort of life. And during any wise-mind moments where I manage to reach out to say a professor for an extension on an assignment because of course I’ve missed it having spent all week over analyzing, that by the time they do respond my inner child is on the driver seat avoiding the email because “confrontation and they’re going to reject you and abandon you and find out what a fraud you are and how damaged you are” and it’s all maddening and exhausting. Do I remain transparent with my professor and just hope for the best?"
"I need help, but I don't know where to go to except here",3,mg4so0,3,"Yes, I should have started therapy, but more than that I need a support system really, really desperately. I've been prone to addiction my whole life and have also been diagnosed with two different types of eating disorders before. In terms of CPTSD, most of my friends have no idea what I'm going through. Some have, but we've grown apart. My 'closest' friend is someone who had ZERO reaction why I told her my diagnosis, and every time I bring it up she never responds in part. I think its one of those things that 'I have enough shit on my plate, don't give me yours', even though I try to listen to her every single time, and I respond to her messages she sends me every single day :((.

Recently, (I'm sure everyone has) I've been having a really tough time. On the outside, I seem to be doing well, but I'm falling behind on my studies and my work performance is lagging behind though I just began the job (there is a risk of getting fired). As said, I've always had a problem with addiction through my entire life (bad habits, escapism), but every year around high stress seasons, I default to sexual behavior. I spent 7-8 hours today sexting people (not even enjoying it, just doing to numb myself), and in between I  took a nap 'in the sunlight' on the kitchen floor, just laying there for over an hour. I have three deadlines tomorrow, none of which I have worked on today. Yesterday, I had a bit of a freeze-panic episode and when I woke up from my nap my grandma came over to me to see how I was doing randomly, and I started silently crying in front of her.

I feel like there is no one I can turn to except this group of online people that may truly understand how difficult it is to cope. Even after 'getting over the trauma', as soon as there is a daily stressor, there is no capacity for healthy stress management whatsoever. Plus, my trauma is sexual in nature, so the things I feel/think when I go through these episodes aren't only involving horniness, but guilt and inadequacy, to say the least.

I live with my Mum aside from my grandma, my dad left a while ago. My mum's hyper-religious, so I don't think I can turn to her either (not to mention I'm a closeted LGBTQ+ in my family, on top of all this difficult shit). I feel that as soon as I confide in her she will break down, and then I will break down and believe everything about God that I don't completely believe in, and go insane and start to rely on Bible verses to get through my day. I moved back home because of corona, and none of my friends are within bodily reach. I also messed up by missing one of my best friends' life changing events recently, and have been neglecting my friendships in general. Even work wise, I used to be able to stay up late into the night diligently working away, and I was a top achiever. Now? I can't even work during the day.

If anyone is interested in starting a support group or something please message me. Or anything. I feel so lost and I definitely can't be the only one."
Just keep swimming...,14,mfuqgd,5,"There are days i can't. Literally. Days my body shakes so badly that washing dishes or doing art or even standing is a a bad idea. Broken enough dishes, taken enough tumbles... sometimes i just can't.  And ideas like ""just keep swimming"" bothered me for so long... but not so much anymore. Because really... that saying isn't about the times you can't. It's about the hard days, where you can but you have to do it on purpose.

Today i can. I don't feel great. I don't feel strong or solid. I want to be still and quiet and nothing after a lot of EVERYTHING. And i will take time to let myself let go of everything. Let it out here and there. Acknowledge that i'm not okay. But also acknowledge that i don't have to be okay to keep moving. I just have to know when to stop.

Today i can. I can wash some dishes. I can fold some cloths. Brush my teeth. I can, and i am. I am up and moving, even if it's slow and uncertain. I can dangle the string for the cats. I can talk. I can smile, even if it doesn't reach my eyes. Today i can just keep swimming. I can remember that even though just standing up feels so hard, like my guts are caving in, and my body feels like i'm crumbling to bits, they aren't caving in, i am not crumbling. I can stand. I can breathe. 

Today i can remember that I never regret doing the things life needs. That a clean spoon, an empty sink, those always feel better than the alternative. I can  resist the nasty old idea that the days i can't do much define me. 

Accepting the times that i can't opened the door for me to be able to see when i can more clearly. It tore the shroud of shame that keeps me in cycles of being overwhelmed, hating myself for being overwhelmed, and being more overwhelmed. Instead of wasting energy punishing myself for ""weakness"" i have that energy to use. 

Today i can. And that is what matters right now. And if tomorrow i can't, well, there will be clean clothes and at least a cereal bowl. And i can appreciate that when i could, i did what I needed to do and it was good for me. 

When you're going in exhausted circles, stacking little mistakes and accidents, accept that you are expecting too much from yourself right then. Allow it. No judgement. Let yourself stop. Find a safe place. Slow down. Regroup. Release. Rest. Whatever you need. So that when you can, you can keep swimming."
Trauma Memes Are Dangerous,1,mgade1,3,
Realizations,2,mg6x4i,2,"I recently started seeing a new therapist and this is honestly the first time in my life I have really fully thought about how much my past trauma still effects me today. One example of this is the other day I realized for the first time that the reason I get so angry when my husband stands really close to me in a tight space is because my abuser would do the same thing and use that time to touch me inappropriately. I had literally never put two and two together. Something I also realized is that I’ve truly just been in survival mode the past 13 years of my life. The abuse I face started when I was 12 and continued till I was 18, but I still fear that it will start again. I suppose I’m just writing this so that If you’re going through this you’re not alone!"

Giving EMDR Therapy to Your Partner,2,mg6m9o,10,"Until just recently I was dating an LCSW specializing in trauma treatment. Early in our relationship there were conflicts that began abruptly and quickly became highly emotionally charged for both of us. After the second of such events my partner told me I exhibited a trauma-response (anxiety, emotional distress) and suggested she do EMDR on me. I didn't want to upset the apple cart so I went along with it to the point I had her EMDR light thing at my apartment. I was ultimately able to get out of it by saying I didn't want to do anything that may interfere with the work I'm doing with my own therapist. That was it; she agreed with me and it wasn't spoken of again. I think I know the answer to my question but this relationship had me doubting my feelings and intuition. I'm still trying to parse through it all. Was my intuition correct?

Medication vs. Therapy,5,mg2arm,7,"Hey friends,

A little stuck on making a decision to try an SSRI/SNRI etc for a mix of anxiety/hopelessness of future. 

When I spoke tot he psychiatrist we agreed to try sleep meds but they didn’t really work well and had grogginess and headaches as side effects.  

I have begun trauma therapy for the first time in my life (tried CBT DBT and IFS but not trauma therapists). 

I like the therapy but it’s a slow process.  

At night I’m hyper vigilant at times and other times I awake due to habit. It sucks. 

During the day I have had GERD/IBS type of issues and when my stomach is bloated, constipated, or the urge to go immediately it’s accompanied with anxiety and hopelessness of thought about my life and future.  

Not sure if anyone’s been in the same position debating therapy or adding meds too.  The psychiatrist was patient and kept reinforcing that I have clear reasons to be anxious/depressed (lack of social network as friends age and move or have kids while also being single and feeling lonely and hopeless a lot)

I'm in a healthy relationship now for the past year and a half and I've been healing. Over the last couple weeks I've been seeing glimpses of him in crowded areas and mistaking people for him. I don't know why suddenly it's affecting me. I haven't had many issues with it as of late up until recently. I think it has something to do with my depression acting up as well. Maybe it has something to do with my abusive parents being around more lately since im off work earlier. I just really needed to get this out. I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about it. I'm sorry if I used the wrong flair I wasn't sure what to choose.

DAE get more triggered by unfounded criticism than by well-founded criticism?,6,mfyzbd,4,"Recently I got into a few situations where somebody would accuse me of things that simply could not be true, things that were most likely projections of the other’s insecurities or trauma on things i said or did. For example a girl was accusing me of keeping people around just for sex, while in reality my sexual energy is quite low and I just need some support while confronting my trauma.

But instead of just brushing that off because it had very little to do with me, I got quite triggered. Normally I can take criticism well and can think about it and adapt my behavior, but in this case I felt a strong angry reaction. So I’m trying to understand where this comes from. My trauma probably stems from my mother not mirroring my emotions, playing with me or cuddling me, and in general not responding to what I was expressing. That gives me the feeling I don’t really exist sometimes, and it seems that if somebody creates an idea of me that has little to do with the actual me I get into a flashback. My mother also actually did that when I was older and I could get super mad in those situations. Could there be a link?

I'm saying this because where I go to school, we always have sexual assault awareness week, and i feel so invalidated because the speeches we're given are about women who were raped, who had horrible things done to them.

psychiatrist deines mistreating me,15,mfqqgk,3,"2019 I was at a psychiatrist. One year she tried to blackmail me and treated me very badly. When she went behind my back trying to harm me, my mother realised the danger she was and we never went there again. She also misdiagnosed me and admitted she never had the intention to do therapy. 

We didn't sue them because we had too much problems at the time. 

About a year later I got the courage to write a Google review. I wanted to save other children from going through that. 

I tried deleting my review since I was really scared but I couldn't find how. 

Now I got an email that I have to prove that it really happened or google will remove my review. The email came from Google and was partly written by the lawyer of the psychiatrist. 

I wrote back that my name is ...... and I was there in 2019. They should have my files. 

I so wish I had sued them back then. But I wasn't 18 back then. 

I live in Germany so you can't give me legal advise and I don't really want that anyways. I hope they just stop annoying me.

Emotional numbness with zoloft/sertraline,2,mg4eiu,9,"I recently started on Sertraline after having a few days where I was unable to calm myself and flipped between crying, being unable to get up, and highly frightened over nothing. I started on the 25mg and gradually made it to 75mg which seems to help me be a little clearer and assists me on not feeding on the strong emotions of my coworkers and students. I'm still connected with them of course, just not falling into a draining cycle. While talking with my doctor last visit she told me she didn't want me to become numb while taking Sertraline. After hearing that I started to look up what she meant and saw that it can create emotional numbness. I had experienced that to an extent when I had to take tylenol every day for years to manage arthritic pains (stopped daily usage because I realized I was so disconnected from my emotions).

I feel a kinship with tin masked WWI Veteran Richard Harrow in Boardwalk Empire,3,mg1nw8,1,"AFAIK the man is extremely lonely/traumatized/virginal/treated like a freak due to his horrid scarring from WWI.

He has a close friend with Jimmy. I gather Jimmy is running his own bootlegging operation (I haven't started watching the series yet, just watching clips here and there...I'm gonna purchase the DVD set probably soon).

He's a very tragic character but I just feel him so much. He was probably a friendly/kind/naive young man...then sent off to war and is a tragic shell of a man. His mental scarring is just as bad as his physical scarring, wears a tin mask. Gets treated like a freak. But his friend Jimmy understands him, fellow WWI veteran who also went over the top at times. Has a beautiful wife, kids, is set economically for life, and running a bootleg operation.

Richard is overwhelmed with emotion to be allowed in his house and mentions ""What's it like to have...everything?"" Everything Richard always wanted in life. And has an intense loyalty to Jimmy.

I find that character alone makes me want to watch the entire series because he is very relatable for  me in regards to my CPTSD, minus the horrible physical scarring. My CPTSD racks my brain...the memories just attack me. And I don't know a fix for it, minus ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" where maybe we could DELETE those memories from existing...which is a fiction."

DAE get scared by job opportunities because of triggers related to past trauma?,5,mfw9dk,2,"I feel like I have so much difficulty embracing new job opportunities. I have so much difficulty to trust.

I have a diversified background but a good overall profile nevertheless. That being said, I did a lot of short term work experiences that I had to take on regardless of the type of people it would involve (for financial reasons).

The result was disastrous: I was bullied, challenged left and right for nothing, basically being surrounded by narcissistic co-workers and bosses, etc. It was a lot. I never had a workplace where I felt good with the people or with I was doing. At best it was OK. 

Now, each time a new opportunity comes up I feel so scared. I don't feel I am able to endure more challenging environments. In the meantime, I have to work too and I am not getting offers every other day either so it's not that I can say no each time.

Last potential position: working at a rather good place in a great industry but the HR person has already been implying that the CEO was going to be difficult (""temperamental"" was the word). And to me it feels like a giant red flag, when for other candidates I am sure it wouldn't bother them and they would do what's best for them, like that wouldn't impact them negatively. 

Due to past trauma at work, I don't feel I process things the same way when looking for work. I should be happy and confident, and yet I am fearful. Any advice on this? (aside from sucking it up) 

Ps: I am not particularly insecure, I am good at what I do, and I stand my ground when needed. But in high-level narcissistic environments, I am out. I cannot."

[Trigger Warning: implied family trauma] Does anyone have advice for managing anxiety spikes in a setting you can't leave? Requesting Emotional Support.,3,mg0gjm,2,"Hi! I hope everyone's doing okay. I wanted to request advice or emotional support. 

I recently experienced something that reminded me of one of the biggest traumas I faced in my life when I was younger (that I have been working through for a couple years) and have been struggling with big anxiety/panic ever since being badly triggered. I am distancing myself from the stressor as best as I can but due to the pandemic and unemployment, I am unable to completely cut myself off from the stressor right now.

I have been trying to find a trauma-informed therapist but at the moment I've been trying to do DBT Progressive Muscle Relaxation, strategies from a previous therapist, and using PTSD Coach, though it doesn't help as much as I want it to. I'm just really overwhelmed and it's really difficult slipping into hyperventilation and freezing when my stressor comes back, especially since I still have schoolwork. It is hard to keep a level head when I am so anxious. I do have an outside support system and am trying to get more professional help but I would like to see if anyone has any insight in the meantime. 

Any advice or emotional support would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time."
DAE feel like unhealthy coping mechanisms are more reliable than just talking to people?,88,mfgkvo,15,"It’s often said that talking to people is a healthy thing to do. Except it’s also unreliable. People get tired of your problems eventually. Nobody can be there for you forever, except for a therapist who gets paid hundreds of dollars.

I used to self harm and do other messed up things to cope, and honestly? It’s actually easier that way for everyone. If you self harm in way that won’t leave visible scars, others won’t have to know. Others won’t have to take care of you. And others won’t have to waste their time on you. You can just do whatever you need to cope, get it out when nobody’s watching, and not have to inconvenience them. 

I think it’s easier for everyone. Getting a hug whenever I’m upset would be nice, but expecting to be comforted 24/7 is unrealistic. Meanwhile, I can turn to my addictions whenever I want. It’s so reliable. 

I still have panic attacks and flashbacks. I never ask people for help, because honestly, that would be burdensome. If I did that constantly, all the time, people would just get rid of me already. That’s why I have to deal with it myself.

I haven’t self harmed in years, but sometimes I really want to relapse."

Constantly on the brink of losing sanity. [TW: mentions of self-harm],3,mfz0am,4,"I know the title and this post sound a bit edgy and maybe a bit cringy, but it's genuinely how I feel. Over time I feel like I lose myself a little bit every single time. I always felt this slow downhill process.


Over time I've gotten more aggressive and less capable of feeling positive emotions. My fantasies and nightmare on a daily basis get more and more extreme and I bear a lot of hatred for people around me and for being forced into living in a world where I feel like an outsider. A world where I can't keep up financially. A world where taking care of myself is almost impossible. A world where I constantly get rejected for issues that aren't even my fault. I don't understand other people at all, never have. It's like they speak another language. I get more frustrated every single time. I hit myself out of aggression, because I can't get rid of those feelings.


I hate working, I hate school, I hate people. I despise everyone. I get rejected by everyone, even therapists. It disgusts me. People disgust me.


Every day is survival to me. I don't want to participate in a world where everything is upside down. 


Recently a friend of mine told me to watch the Joker (2019). I never watched it, because I don't particularly follow super hero movies. He said that I remind him a lot of the Joker in that specific movie and I can say why he says that. I've been rejected by almost everyone in my life, desperately reaching out my hand and calling for help, just to see everyone walk right past me. Then inevitably blaming me for what I'm like and ostracizing me. 


So as I got older, I tried to calm down a lot. I keep my thoughts to myself or try to bring them in a constructive way. I had some anger management along the way. I thought I had it figured out, but it feels like I'm always boiling over. I have inappropriate emotional reactions and they're becoming more frequent, I genuinely despise the world and every time I get rejected or forced into some societal bullshit, I fantasize about screaming in faces and hurting people. Nobody listens to me. I try so hard to make the change I want to see, but I'm always left there.


I'm so angry and I'm getting angrier by the second. Why do I have to be scared that school kicks me out for the so manyth time, because I don't fit in their fucking bullshit for ""normal"" people. This is my 6th school. I've been trying to get a degree 9 years. Schools have kicked me out, jobs have, therapists have told me they can't help me. I try so fucking hard every single day. I get up, do what I have to, but just because I need more time or need some days off I'm suddenly ""making excuses"", "" seeking attention"" or ""too complex issues to get immediate help"" ""too functional to get immediate help"". People mistake my ability to survive as an absence of my issues. And it's not like I don't talk about it, I do. Nobody listens. 


And there he is. My piece of shit father, walking around this planet. Money in his pocket, abusing women and kids freely because nobody is stopping him. Not even the police. But everyone tries to stop me in my tracks, despite doing my very best every day. 


I'm so tired."
Memory Dump [Trigger Warning],1,mg5vqt,1,"*CW: death of a loved one, alcoholism* 

Hi, long-time lurker, first-time poster. Apologies for any mistakes, and I hope this post is appropriate for this thread. 

I just got a call from my father that a really close family friend passed away. The wife of my father's best friend. I knew it would be bad news because he didn't text first to ask if I was free to talk, he just called. I don't have many childhood memories without her in them. It sucks, though, because many of those memories are actually tied to some intense traumas. My parents had me pretty young, my mom 21 and my dad 23. They weren't ready to give up their party lifestyles, especially after separating from the catholic church. M and T were their best friends; we saw them almost every weekend, but it was mostly them partying along with my aunt and uncle. Loud music, jagger shots, games, and us kids (my younger brothers and cousins) were told to stay away. Probably one of the most traumatic events I've lived through happened at M and T's wedding when I was 8. Then M got pregnant, and we stopped seeing them as much. Only at birthdays and graduations. I thought they grew up, got sober, were there for their son, giving him a wonderful life. 

Despite them partying just as much as my parents, I really idolized them. T was there when I was born, and M followed soon after. I thought they were just the coolest. I felt safer with them than I did my parents most of the time, especially M. There was just something about her. She was so beautiful, so joyful, so supportive. My hypervigilance started after their wedding, and I refused to leave the room they were partying in because I was so afraid something would happen to my parents and T and M. She would always keep me company (although in hindsight, why the f did these adults let me stay and party w them lol). But she made me feel so secure, and I knew she would keep my family and me safe. We went to their house to celebrate their son's birthday. I was playing with him in his bedroom, reading a book on his chair, and got my period and bled all over it, lol. I was so embarrassed, but she made me feel totally okay about it. I couldn't wait to have her and their family at my upcoming wedding. Although, I am only allowing enough alcohol at my wedding for people to have one beer or one glass of wine with dinner because I don't want to be triggered on my wedding day. Stems from the trauma of T and M's wedding. And my cousin's recent wedding. 

But now M is dead. From cirrhosis of the liver and kidney failure. I was jealous for so long, thinking if they could sober up and be there for their son, why couldn't my parents do the same for my brothers and me? It turns out they didn't, though. The pandemic was hard on her; she had been a heavy drinker, but this pushed her over the edge, working from home and not being able to go anywhere. Nobody knew how bad it had gotten.  It's tough because my mom almost died in November because of the same thing, but she survived and has been sober since, has healed almost miraculously, and doctors are almost shocked by how well she is doing. She will never be quite the same, of course, but she will survive. I can't believe we have now lost M to this disease. It is heartbreaking watching the effects of long-term drinking hit all my family members and loved ones. 

I will be okay. I have grown a lot, and I know I will heal from this as I have healed from other traumas. But this one has blind-sighted me. Thank you to those who read this. I feel better just by getting these thoughts out of my head. This subreddit has been so helpful to know I am not alone in what I've been through."
Is it true that my generation’s parents (boomers) don’t understand why we have gone no contact?,77,mfgbv3,47,"My parents were boomers. I am always seeing Memes about boomers who cannot understand why their adult children have gone no contact with them.

I have been completely 100% no contact for decades. And I’m curious, are the Memes accurate? Are they really trying to figure out what they did wrong? Are they still stuck in their hateful narcissistic loops? 

I realize it’s probably a case-by-case thing, but these Memes are popping up more and more often which makes me realize that while I may have gone through the past few decades alone, I am far from the only one in my situation."

Does anyone else feel like they always have to open to sex with their partner?,11,mfodla,5,"I have a hard time saying no to people generally, but it's worse when it comes to sex. I feel like I always have to be open to having sex with my partner because he so often rejects me when I really do want him. So I feel like I have to be ready for when he wants me. It often leads to me forcing myself to do things I don't want to and it's making me feel very anxious. He thinks that I have a higher sex drive than him and that I'm always horny. I don't know how to tell him that's not true. Any advice would be appreciated."
I feel like I'm the only one who can't speak clearly/with my own voice anymore.,8,mfpiv1,2,"After I dissociated my voice completely changed and it has never returned to normal. It feels like I am forcing sounds to come out of my mouth. It is my most annoying symptom. Like the emotions behind the voice aren't there and I'm just making my voice do things to get through the day. The only time I don't have trouble with my voice is when I get angry, then I just get swept away in the anger and I don't have to think about my voice, I can just talk. But usually, my voice is quiet, mumbly, raspy, non-existent. It makes socializing so hard because my voice sounds like garbage, then I feel shitty over how it sounds and get frustrated, and people pick up on that frustration and it kills the vibe.

Does anyone else struggle with their voice? It used to be smooth and I never had issues with it before but now I have to clear my throat before I speak every time. Like what the fuck? I just hate this man. Does anyone else know what is going on and has dealt with this? Your voice and how it sounds is a huge part of your personality and I feel like I don't even have one and it really sucks and I'm tired of it."
Stuck in freeze mode,3,mfwdmo,6,"Reposted this because a presumably transphobic person downvoted me immediately. I ask that if you hold certain beliefs on trans lives that doesn't match with mine, you choose to disregard my post rather than downvoting me and limiting my ability to receive the emotional support I am requesting.

I am a queer, trans non binary parent of a toddler. It's already difficult to find parent friends you actually mesh with, and is made that much more difficult as a big ol gay parent.

So over the past 2.5 years I've been hanging out with this mom friend on and off, but found that I can only really muster up the energy to hang with her about once every two weeks and I couldn't figure out why. As I began my trauma healing journey, slowly but surely I began to realize spending time with her and her kiddo was quite triggering to me. The way she talks to and about her kiddo and her parenting style reminds me of how my mom was - a combo of emotional abuse and neglect paired with excessive love bombing, amongst other things.

In the past I have attempted to open up to her about my trauma and its residual effects and have been met with indifference, minimization and invalidation. Because our kiddos are friends, and because in some ways I do enjoy her company I kind of continued to push through my discomfort in order to see her more regularly, as she texts me at least once a week to hang out.

I took about 3 months away from our friendship during the winter after I told her my grandma was in hospice and I was swallowed up in grief and she didn't respond for days, then told me I was letting my depression get the best of me and I should just try to have fun with her. I was incredibly hurt and at that time felt like maybe I was just done with our friendship.

As the weather has gotten a bit more bearable lately we have reconnected a bit, meeting at playgrounds for play dates and I began to think that maybe we could just be like base level friends. Like I mean I dont only ever want to talk about my trauma and I suppose its a good idea to practice spending time with people I have varying levels of closeness with, right?

So last weekend we met and took a long walk around a local island trail, and while hanging out on the beach she started expressing ideas about bodies and gender that felt deeply invalidating to me a d my experience as a living, breathing trans human being. This honestly felt like a slap to the face. We have been friends for over two years, the whole time she has known that I am trans. Later she began asking me my opinion of trans athletes being able to compete in events within their gender group in a way that felt really transphobic and was deeply upsetting to me. I let her know it's honestly a really triggering thing to talk about, and she kind of just dropped the convo. It felt so weird and upsetting, invalidating and antagonistic... right after that I let her know I was gonna head home.

I think I have finally once and for all decided I'm done giving more chances to see if this friendship is worth the triggering aspects of our interactions. The problem is I feel totally frozen and unable to communicate with her in any way rn. She texted me about hand me downs and if I wanted them, which I didn't respond to so then the next day she texted me again saying 'hey??' And I still haven't been able to even respond at all. I dont want to lambaste her, I think she's human and not a monster for having some ignorant ideas around gender. I just also dont want to continue being close for my mental health and wellbeing as I cant keep up with the energetic output being around her causes me.

How do I proceed? How does one break up amiably with a friend?"
Please help me find useful coping mechanisms...How do I stop having intense emotional reactions to older men,3,mfu64l,3,"I hate already asking this because I know in a way there's other people cant do that for me and then I have to do it for myself. But I am at a really low point in my mind right now that I think I've been avoiding. \[Trigger warning child sexual assault\] my dad left me when I was 4 years old and I didn't think it would hold a big impact on me since I didn't know him very well and the little things that I did know about him where on the negative side. I had a couple of other men in my mother's life after that were equally abusive, and three other men in my life who would go on to sexually harass me. It fucked me up badly, and I'm still getting used to just telling the story normally. Anyway it makes my I guess connection with myself a little bit blurry and growing up I often used to look for relationships with other older men to fulfill myself, they were meant to be non-sexual I think a connection with somebody who I would mistakingly place in a father role. And while I've become more aware of it how much has lead to my actions today it's still very difficult to stop doing that. The most recent case I've had, that I've been very angry about, is I had a ""friendship"" with one of my professors in college, again meant to be non-sexual and well there were definite red flags I've always had a hard time saying no, I ask myself now why I put myself in that situation or what I was looking for, and I wish I could go and at least anonymously tip the school about him, but he knows where I live and that makes me fearful. (he even mentioned that I wasn't the first student I had been talking to in the sort of manner). Eventually, I broke things off and I told him I felt uncomfortable and that he should probably stop trying to friends with his students, he actually ended up crying in front of me which felt like a total guilt trip but I stuck to it and I told him that I didn't want to have any more contact - later he messaged me and said that I apparently was in love with him and that's why I'm running away, but i ignored it, but i wish so badly I could of told him how much i hated his guts, and how gross he is for thinking that. I'm angry about it, and I want to hurt him in some way - to put it bluntly. 

&#x200B;

Anyway after that It triggered my cptsd with men and how they were only close to me because they want to use me for my body or for sexual reasons, and I've become increasingly fearful. I don't like being touched and yet I can't seem to find the response to say no when people ask for hugs or go ahead and do it without my permission. I have this very conflicting mindset because there's a part of me that is still trying to fulfill this father role through other people, a part of me who is fawning without any reason towards older men, and the part of me that's just straight-up scared and doesn't want to be in the same room as them. I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I want to stop having a strong emotional reaction, I want to be able to love myself fully and be my own father, and say no or even determine when I'm actually feeling uncomfortable because even figuring out when I want to say no - is so difficult.

Over-diagnosed or good coping strategies?,1,mg3e3h,3,"26, only really now coming to terms with some of the abuse I experienced as a kid.   
I'm starting to wonder whether I have developed really healthy coping mechanisms or whether I'm just over diagnosed.

  
Mum was generally not very responsive to my emotional needs and wants. She was also quite physically abusive on occasion. There were a few instances where she beat me (not bad enough to leave any real damage) and screamed at me.  
For some examples, when I was 8, I tackled a kid. She hates any shame being brought on the family so she beat me in the bathroom with a broomstick handle and left me a bawling mess on the floor for an hour before I saw myself to bed.  
When I was 10 I tried to run away from home, getting as far as two streets down.  
As I got older I started to really lash out at her (swearing, cussing back at her) in response and eventually ended up having a 3 month long dissociative event. I ended up in a mental health ward (I was 13).  
To top it all off, I was bullied (probably of my own making in part) and didn't have particularly many friends until 15.  
I got kicked out at 18 and had general counselling up until around 22.  
Cut to now. I have managed to graduate with three separate tertiary qualifications and have a well paying career as a secondary teacher which I absolutely love.   
I sometimes feel overwhelmingly sad (not depressed) and worthless for no real reason. I feel a constant unease buried in my chest that comes and gos.   
In the past I have struggled with intense feelings of rejection when I used to go out to parties where people are hooking up. I still get intense anxiety whenever it comes time to indicate any sort of interest to a potential partner.  
Sometimes I just get the urge to go somewhere quiet and dark and just be really sad. A few times in the past week I've just broken down and cried at home.  


Yet, the feedback I get from my colleagues and students is that I am excellent at my job. Most of the time I feel like I'm presenting as really well put together but underneath I'm struggling.  
My exercise and self-care routines (cooking, cleaning house) have gone out the window I'm starting to get anxiety around leaving the house again.  


Is there any way to really tell if C-PTSD is the right diagnosis as indicated by my online counselor and I have generally good coping mechanisms? I'm just worried that I may be getting over diagnosed."
I need to get this all out. I feel like my soul is dripping blood,27,mfirb3,4,"TW: Religious trauma and CSA, suicidal ideation and self harm
I dont want advice. I want support... I feel like I need love. 

I am so lonely.. I dont know how to explain how lonely and angry and helpless and afraid I feel. Theres so much. I just want to explain everything so I feel better. I've been getting flashbacks for the past month or so about a particularly traumatizing and isolating fee incidents that happened to me, which has been horrible. 

PLUS I got a call from CPS that I contacted a year ago for my brothers safety since they're still with my parents and they left me a voicemail cuz I couldn't answer at the time, saying it was related to the police report I filed about sexual assault towards my dad. A case where the cop didnt believe me and basically told me I was attention seeking and a liar. So anyways, the case CLOSED and even though CPS FAILED ME AND MY BROTHERS they're still calling me A YEAR LATER. I think it's because when I originally filed a report I had said that no sexual assault had happened to my brothers and only to me. But over the course of a year and working on trauma therapy with my counselor, I had a lot of memories come back. So when I reported the case to the cops, I had processed and remembered a lot more. I told the cops I'd walked in on my dad raping my brother and my dad had made me bring him daycare kids that my mom watched. Anyways, so THEYRE CALLING ME BACK AND IM SO FUCKING SCARED IM GONNA GET IN TROUBLE, even though I know I did nothing wrong. I'm just scared they're going to try to trap me into an answer or something. Idk, when i was interrogated by that cop, he was so gaslighty and kept questioning every little tiny answer I said until I just shut down. I'm scared. Im so fucking scared.

And I feel so lonely... it terrible. I'm having flashbacks to being isolated in that cult church I was in and I'm just so  isolated and feel so alone.. it hurts so bad.. like theres so much feelings and I dont know what to do with it all?

I just get home and cry in the shower every night and try and get some sleep. The shower is my crying place. I've been in fucking therapy for basically 3 years and been away from my parents, please dont recommend another therapist. I've fucking done a lot of grieving with my therapist and I've come a long way from where ive been. She says that what I'm experiencing isnt crazy and theres a lot of grieving to do for the things that happened to me, that it's understandable. 

I have no friends. I've literally been on my own. I have like one friend right now, my coworker. How sad.. I'm trying.. I'm trying so hard..

This hurts so bad.. idk what the fuck I did to deserve this. 

It sucks because I'm seeing cracks in this emotional flashback lens and seeing parallels and why I'm feeling the way I'm feeling in the present. 

Lonely and isolated in the cult where they kept everyone from me = feeling lonely and isolated now

Nobody cared about me back then = feeling like nobody cares or loves me now

Parents wouldn't let me be around anyone = I'm making myself isolated now (it's just how flashbacks work  I cant fight it. I'll get thru it eventually)

"How to go about getting a ""brain test""?",3,mfuucx,3,"In reading posts here, I've seen some people mention something about a ""brain test"", where the therapist looks at your brain waves in different states and it tells you something about your experience with trauma.

I feel a lot of tension in my body and jaw and I have trouble sleeping, so I was wondering if my cPTSD was manifesting physically or something, I don't know...

Trying to forgive parents who are trying to be better.,4,mfs4tb,2,"Does anyone have any experience with this or relate?

 They're not perfect, but they're trying so hard to understand me rn and get me the help I need and it's almost harder this way than when I was younger and trying on my own, before I even heard of CPTSD and thought my dirt childhood was just how things were.

 I feel caught between trying to meet my needs, being triggered for having to explain my needs, fighting the instincts to cater to my moms every need every time she sighs, being triggered for having to draw a boundary and being terrified that instead of it being respected they will abandon me. Every time one of my parents says something wrong I feel resentful and when they say something right I feel this huge wave of guilt.

 It feels so wrong almost trying to talk to professionals about my relationship with them from childhood and then say ""yeah, my insurance doesn't cover you so my parents are paying out of pocket"" (I'm 28 and live with my husband)"
Cracks in childhood memories (sexual and emotional trauma trigger). LONG,5,mfrz9i,3,"I will preface this with this: 
I am 36 years old, female from the U.S. born to a single mother with no idea who my father is and really no extended family. I have a mother and grandmother only.  I have two children and a husband, who I met when I was 19 and we’ve been together since. 


I have been  NC with my mom May 2020 and my Grandmother September 2020. This was a large downward spiral that I recognized that was coming leading up as my family hasn’t been the most ideal and perfect and comparing stories to other people in my adulthood.


My grandmother and grandfather and mother basically had 50/50 custody of me without being on the books for it on the court. When I was in roughly 3rd grade my mom met someone and things were O.K. But I also suffered by this person too, emotionally. 

My earliest memory as a child was when I was in 1st grade and this was the first time and only time before the “big move” as I call it to be. It was very short lived for less 3 months as my mon ended up getting evicted I found out In 2019.  My mom would drop me off early for school and I’d wait and then I would promptly take the bus home. 

My mom was either A) late b) forgot about me. I stood there for a while and couldn’t figure out what was happening so I walked probably a mile back to our house as we lived off a country dirt road. I couldn’t get inside the house as it was locked up so any child whose been instructed with some common sense walked to a neighbors house and off I went with my lace on top socks with keds and my backpack.  My
Neighbor met my mother but this was back in the day and no cells existed.  She gave me a snack after school and let me watch tv. She was an elderly woman and we sat there together and we talked about my day and myself.  It was getting dark and my mother wasn’t home yet as she drove us to the house and we waited for a few minutes and then we went back. Well, I went back. She drove me back and I sat inside and watched tv as she waited for my mom. No idea what happened during that time but eventually my mom came for me. 


Between the few months my mother lived there it was a common thing she wouldn’t just pick me up so I went home alone after that after the bus dropped me off. I watched other kids get hugged and picked up by their parents but I was alone. 

During this time I was sexually assaulted in my “sleep” by my moms best friends husband and so we’re her two girls. No one really knew about this and it’s been repressed for many years. One of those two girls went to go on and do great things and the other one isn’t and struggled and still is with addiction. 


I can’t really remember any thing much about my childhood with my mother involved. I remember some of the good moments like one or two things but most things are overshadowed by all the bad things I’ve experienced as a child. 


I was always alone. I felt alone for the longest time. My grandparents always got into it with my mother and begged for them to have custody over me as my grandfather was my rock, he made money and my grandma was home when school was done. My grandfather was my ultimate protector. He loved me, and I never struggled with him around emotionally, physically and everything was always met. By this time I was going to be picked up by then Friday’s and they’d take me to school Monday mornings and then my mother would be there. 


I was never eating a proper meal and if I was lucky to eat something other than take out pizza or Chinese I wouldn’t eat probably till 9-10pm. 


I was locked out of the house with just having to go to my best friends house to spend the night, and frequently left to eat over there after school while my mom locked me out. She would lock the doors on me and told me to go, “to ** house.” It was like this between the ages 7 to 14. 

I was sparked a lot by her, hit with spoons and belts if I spoke out of turn and questioned, left alone majority of my childhood, yelled at (and now even in arguments I totally disassociate and completely block out everything happening and freeze). I have issues with self worth but it has been getting better 


I never gave any reason to worry - I was the ugly duckling. I was “chubby” according to my mother growing up.  I was told not to wear tank tops or too short of shorts, and that I was a tom boy and I should be more girly. (In the photos I do have a few I look average weight and normal).  None the less, I do have a complex about my body now.  I never did drugs as a teenager. I never snuck out. I never did any thing bad. I was the good girl and only had two friends. I felt alienated and alone most of my childhood and into my teenage years and many of my early adult years. I always felt like if I am not good enough for my mother to spend time with me why would any one want to be friends with me?  Between 6th grade and 7th grade things changes drastically for me but because of a move to a different city. It was very hard for me, as I lost my only best friend I’ve known for the longest I’ve ever been friends with someone. I felt lost and had to make a new friend all over again. 

I eventually did Make 1 friend. I made mediocre grades growing up and struggled with a lot of foundation math and language arts only due to the fact between K and 3rd grade we moved a lot and I never stayed in a school more than a half a year to a year and an absent mother.

This all set the stage for where I am now as an adult. 
There’s more what happened as a teenager but it’s been a major struggle to recognize what I experienced as a child has formed me as an adult.  


I made it a goal when my husband and I had children no one would have them except us and one of us would always be home and no one else would watch them and they’d always always always have someone there no matter what. 


My mom doesn’t recognize the issues that she has caused growing up and how it was basically her fault. We say adults like this don’t have the proper tools in their tool belt and my grandma definitely didn’t but my grandpa did. Together they were incredible. But when he died when I was 20 the cracks in her started showing and she wasn’t a great mother to my grandma as her ex, my biological grandfather was an alcoholic and abandoned them when my mother was 1 so she had 3 kids all together alone for the first 6years of my mothers life.  She was raised by narcissist also, and majority spent her childhood and teenage years alone too and she has recognized my mothers issues and what she had experienced but says,”let bygones be bygones because your children deserve their grandmother in their life so she can make what she did wrong up to them”. 
I tried  doing that but she kept repeating the same
Stuff with them as she did with me but way more off hands, and way less attentive. She’s been known to leave games, concerts, ensembles, state and local level, tournaments midway. Cancel last minute or show up late to leave early. 

My grandma tried to do her best but she stands no matter what behind my mother no matter how awful she is and even one night I cried to her and asked her if what my mom felt was more important than how I felt and I was the child being left and abused? And her feelings being validated were more important than mine? 

She couldn’t answer me. So, here we are.

I do feel happier without them but I mourn for an actual family outside of my own. Memories and stuff to talk about it to my kids about what I did growing up and what fun stuff we did and the memories I have from my own childhood but I have very limited memories."
Christian with CPTSD (TW abuse),2,mfwy8o,3,"I wanted to post my story and ask if there are others with the same problems that I faced. I went to therapy for this, and was diagnosed with CPTSD, anxiety, and depression. Even if this could help one person or connect me with someone else that feels the same way that would be enough for me.

My mother is a narcissist undiagnosed, but that is the conclusion that my therapist and I came to. I had lived with my parents for 20 years. I feel that I fell into the scapegoat role, I took the blame for everything. My mother had divorced my biological father when she was 19 and I was 3 months old. After marrying my step father, anything I did was not good enough. My first step sibling was born when I was 7 years old, which made me feel outcasted only for that feeling to be seconded by my mother and step fathers behavior. My sister was treated much differently and I realized that nothing I could do would match the superiority that my step sister had. As I grew up my parents had 2 more children. All three of my step siblings were treated very well, new clothes, toys, experiences, etc. and I was not. This treatment however didn’t really cause a divide in relationship with my siblings because I was expected to take care of them. I would take them to school, bottle feed them, clothe them, take them to doctor appointments, clean up after them, everything. My siblings still look up to me as a caretaker and someone that they can fully trust. The issues I faced growing up was that I couldn’t have friends, and I was the problem in everything that happened. If my mother and step father fought, it ultimately was my fault. If my siblings were failing, it was because I wasn’t taking care of them. If the house was dirty, it was because I was lacking. Getting yelled at for my brother losing his shoes seemed normal which is crazy to think about now. When I graduated high school, I earned scholarships to go to a college 4 hours away from my parents. I immediately jumped on that opportunity but still held the grief of knowing that no matter how good my grades were and how I acted, my mother would be disappointed. I got a boyfriend in college, and I was terrified to tell my parents. They met him and immediately disliked him because he spoke very positively about me and spoke up when they were “picking on me”. A few weeks after my 20th birthday, my boyfriend (now husband) moved me in the middle of the night to live with him, which caused my mother to lash out very violently. I was scared to leave my house, I was scared to check my phone, the anxiety that I have from just seeing images of her causes life to be difficult. My biggest issue that I am currently facing is my faith. Christianity tells us to respect our mothers and fathers, but I am absolutely terrified of mine. The amount of emotional and physical abuse that I had endured throughout my childhood and young adult years has made the forgiveness and respect aspect of Christianity very difficult. I still live 4 hours away, and my siblings call me crying that they miss me, but I can’t bring myself to ever go back there. I am traumatized by my family. I got married quietly without them knowing and they still don’t know. It’s difficult to watch others in my community have this relationship with their families my husband included. I have a “fake family” in my head that I wish and pray was the reality. I plan on having a wedding in the church soon, but my heart sinks knowing I will be walking down the aisle by myself, and that my side of the church will be empty simply because I exist and my mother regrets it. The symptoms I have faced is anxiety triggers in loud noises, white cars, yelling, and failing/making mistakes. I personally am still figuring out the scope of my diagnosis and how it fully affects me. If there is anyone out there that could talk with me and make me not feel so alone, it would be appreciated. I am also always open to talk with someone that needs a person to listen because that is all I ever wanted. I wanted to be validated. I am in no way a medical professional but I am someone who will be a caring friend."

ashamed of myself,3,mft11t,2,"I left my family. But it didn’t get better afterwards. 

I started talking to an abusive therapist that now made me ashamed to even leave my house because she laughed at me.

I’m living alone in a lockdown and I’m too shy to even meet new people. Whenever I’m walking outside alone now I got such an anxiety and think that everyone knows how lonely I am and that I have no friends at all.

When I talk to people I think that I’m an embarrassing and weird person. My therapist laughed at me in a moment when I was so damn open and honest with her. That fucked me up so much but I try to overplay it.

I hate myself and I hate my live. I won’t ever be able to be confident or self-loving if not even my family loves me. I’m afraid to even form an identity because then someone will not like me for it. So I’m stuck here being a nobody. 

I’m so ashamed."

""The worst trick a childhood anxiety disorder pulls is, you spend your early years being applauded for being so much more *mature* than your peers, because you aren't disruptive, you don't want any kind of attention, you don't express yourself, you keep yourself to yourself - this makes you a pleasure to have in class, etc - and you start to believe it's virtue. But you're actually way behind your peers in normal social development, and who knows if you can ever catch up.""

I find this just so relatable. As a child I always prided myself in being more ""mature"" than my classmates, but I've only realized now how messed up that actually was."

"I hate the slangification of the the word triggered. I hate that people with CPTSD & other mental illnesses have been made to look like fools for saying, ""This triggers me.""",2319,j6byu3,197,"Triggered is a medical term for what causes people to re-experience trauma. It's not a synonym for offended. It's not a damn meme. 

I know I can't 100% avoid triggers. I do multiple things in my daily life that are triggering- making phone calls to my parents, going to counseling, having sex, etc. I understand I cannot bend the world to make me more comfortable and confronting triggers is part of the trauma healing experience. 

I appreciate people who put trigger warnings in their posts and I love how we have developed a new term for the long-lasting effects of PTSD (complex post traumatic stress disorder) and defined PTSD as not always being combat related. 

Yet there has been a huge backlash of people making fun of those who experience trauma. Triggered has been demoted to a mere meme, essentially becoming the new ""snowflake"" insult. The meaning of the word triggered has become so perverted and derogatory now, I don't feel safe using it outside of counseling or doctors offices for fear of harassment from other people.

I've tried to nicely correct people and let them know triggered doesn't mean the same thing as offended and the responses I've received in return were downright filthy. Triggered is just a buzzword now and trauma survivors are the butt of the joke."

Especially if it comes with a sense of disconnect from the world around you.

Does anyone else feel entitled to a stress-free life after all the suffering they’ve experienced?,2041,jih9zl,217,"It’s hard to explain.

I have zero tolerance for stress now, any stressor makes me rage and cry and break down. I’ve already endured way more misery than ANY human should be expected to endure in their lifetime. I reached my limit long ago. So every extra drop, every minor inconvenience, causes the cup to overflow. Every tiny piece of straw becomes the straw that broke the camel’s back. 

And I get so ANGRY, this voice inside just screams, ‘HAVEN’T I SUFFERED ENOUGH?!’ even when small uncomfortable things happen. I can’t meet the demands of society (like getting / keeping a job) because there is no more room in my brain for any more stress. My traumatized inner child deserves to float in a bubble of peaceful nothingness forever because she’s suffered ENOUGH goddamnit."
"""Abuse Makes You Stronger""...No. It Doesn't...",1948,gbrx3f,180,"My friend just told me this is something people say.

And I've never seen such a *steaming pile of shit* from a phrase. Ever.

Abuse doesn't make you stronger. It makes you *cold* and *hollow*. It makes you hurt others because you're scared of being hurt. It makes you act like a feral fucking animal sometimes. It makes people say, ""you're so brave"" or, ""look what you overcame"".

People romanticize it for movies. They sexualize it for their stories and books.

Abuse *breaks* people, and the people are so fucking broken that they don't even feel it. They don't feel it until someone points it out, and then they look down and see everything that has been *ruined.*

I can't cry. I want to. But I can't.

I can't feel half the emotions I'm sure I'm supposed to. I don't feel much of anything besides fear, pain, self-hatred, and a want to hurt/be punished.

I can't sit down or have my legs open without freaking out. I can't trust anyone, and have never made one connection to a person where I genuinely, truly cared about them. I sleep with my back to a wall. I vomit if someone raises their voice at me.

I'm not *stronger* for a decade of sexual and physical and mental and emotional traumas and abuse. I'm not.

I'm weak and I'm *tired* and I just want everyone to *leave me alone.*

EDIT: Thanks for your comments, guys.

I'll try and get therapy, but I'm really poor, and I don't know how to get help. I was seeing a university counselor for free, but she was forced to drop me because my case was ""too complex for the univeristy's services"". So...

But I don't even know if I want to go back. It made me weaker. It made me hostile. And it made me more scared and exposed. And after twenty-one years of hearing that therapy is for weak people, and for monsters like my brother, then...maybe I don't want to go back..."

I did not intend to hurt anyone's feelings with my post. My only point is that it's not something to be laughed at or shrugged off. It should be looked into. 

EDIT 2: PLEASE read the above edit i am acknowledging all of you who are saying this isn't true.

My parents screamed at me for every mistake when I was little.

Once my mom gave me a bracelet. I wore it to school and lost it, had a panic attack. 

The whole class looked for it, no one could find it. 

The teacher called my mom and said I was very distraught and spent the whole day looking for it. 

My mom acted shocked at my reaction, said it was no big deal... then my teacher and classmates just looked at me like I was weird and dramatic. 

But I wasnt dramatic, I was abused. My abuser was at risk of being revealed, so she acted like she wouldn't have abused me about it. 

It's not funny when a kid is anxious. It's not dramatic. It's a sign of trauma. Kids don't just learn to be anxious. I wish someone had seen that I was hurting and was not just ""eccentric""."
My mom killed herself 10 years ago today. She was physically and emotionally abusive. Everyone says I'm lucky I was spared the abuse but they don't know what I know,1928,h92t7k,130,"

She died when I was 8.. She hung herself in the basement.

She was physically abusive towards me. My earliest memory is of her covering me with a blanket and laying on me. I must have been 3. I was terrified and still am terrified of being confined or hugged too hard

When she was mad she would scream at me. That she wished she never had me, that I act stupid, that I only care about myself. That she doesn't want to be my mom anymore.

Sometimes she would grab my arm hard and throw me down. Sometimes she would dig her nails into me or punch me in my leg.

She was rarely happy. Our lives were centered around making sure we didn't set her off

I remember her crying to my dad that she was worthless, all the time. Just sobbing, rocking back and forth. Saying it over and over ""make it stop"" ""just kill me"". I would stand across the room and watch as my dad held her hand 

I heard more than I should.. More than she should have let me. But I feel that knowing about her traumatic past helped me understand and ultimately protected me. 

Her parents abandoned her, she was sexually abused from 5 years old, she was sold into prostitution as a teenager, she was bought and held captive by my biological dad (who I have never met) while he beat her daily and wouldn't let her leave. She was 18 when she got out and after that was with someone else who beat her. After that she met the men I call my dad

All she would get upset about was small things. Noise.. Movement.. Sometimes loud noises but normally anything. We could be in the car and my boot would fall off and she would scream until she couldn't breathe to stop making noise. 

She always said it hurt her

I remember her screams as she would repeatedly hit her head into the washing machine.. Sometimes over 100 times before my dad could get her held down. She would punch herself in the face, grab anything she could to smash over her head when she felt like that. She would hit her head and scream ""worthless piece of shit"" ""I deserve this"" ""I deserve to die""

I remember her saying more than anything that it all was her fault. How could someone look into a 5 year olds eyes and decide to ruin it for minutes of pleasure

It was always.. How could they look into my eyes and decide to kill me inside. She felt there was nothing in her. Those men looked into her eyes and saw nothing.. She said she must have been born with no soul and that's why it's ok to hurt her. They looked into her eyes and saw nothing, so it was ok. She would scream that she has no voice. No one can hear or understand her no matter what. She really truly believed that she was born inherently less than other women and deserved it all

I remember she would tell me that she's trying to see a doctor who can teach her to be nicer and better. I think she meant a therapist but we had barely any money and I don't know what resources were available to her at the time

She would tell me that it's not my fault. She would tell me that until you're 9 you don't have the ability to understand that people hurting you isn't your fault

She would tell me that if an adult hurts a kid, it is never ever the kids fault. There's nothing I could do that would make me deserve what she did to me. She would tell me that it's not my job to make her happy. She has to fix herself. It's not my fault and I don't need to fix it.

She told me about a rainbow.. She told me that you need all the colors for a rainbow. If you only have orange, it's not a rainbow. She said all of our feelings are like the colors that make a rainbow. She only had one feeling.. Sadness. That's why, she said, she had a hard time showing love. She said she loved me more than anything but didn't have the ability anymore to feel anything else

I remember her telling me that the mean things she told me weren't true. That what she said, she meant about herself. She didn't wish I was never born, she just hated herself for subjecting me to this and wishes it hadn't happened. She doesn't mean that I'm stupid, she means that she has anger towards herself for not teaching me better or for over reacting. Etc.. 

She would tell me that if she had given me away when I was a baby, I would have a nice house, parents who never hurt me and always love me, siblings to play, a pool and backyard to swim and have fun, always clean clothes, always enough food. She would sob and sob and apologize for not realizing that she wasn't fit before it was too late 

It was so much more.. She studied psychology on her own. Each time she had an episode.. She would explain to me from a psychology standpoint, why she does that, what it does and doesn't mean, what her intent is and that it's not ok, never ok to hurt me and that I need to grow up to know to never let anyone around me who is like her. My doctor told me it's not the physical act of abuse that scars.. Its the intent 

I think she felt like she wasn't going to be able to stop hurting me before it was too late and left life long trauma. I know actually because she told me.. She told me it would take years.. She told me I should have had a good life since birth.. I shouldn't have to wait for her to learn to be better. She talked about suicide often. Always accompanied by the thinking that she's worthless and can't make anyone happy 

Everyone tells me I'm better off without her but I know that she's dead because she was convinced no one could ever love or keep her and this was the only good thing she could do for me

I wish someone had loved my mommy.. All she needed was one person growing up to show her she's worth keeping and not abusing. All she needed was one person. She suffered for 25 years trying to hold on to hope that it would get better. She loved princesses I remember.. Even as an adult. She stopped watching the princess movies shortly before she died.. She started saying that it hurt her because no one could ever love her like that, enough to show her that she means something. She was like a child in a lot of ways. The extreme emotions, sensitivity.. She loved stuffed animal, we had a little family of stuffed bunnies. She loved bunnies. She loved pink, she wanted to make forts with me in the forest. She was very beautiful.. Shoulder length natural blonde curly hair, grey eyes. Sometimes she would dress up and say she feels like a 'person'. She loved to drive.. Said it calmed her. We would go on drives all around the province, sometimes random road trips where we would sleep on a blow up mattress in the SUV and spend the days hiking and swimming. 

I don't think she even ever was given flowers or a gift in her life.. My dad loves her but he never understood her emotions too well. He didn't go out of his way to do much for her and he would argue with her when she needed comfort. He was nice but not what she needed.. 

I wish someone had just protected her. Am I really spared? She left me knowing that I was loved by her, knowing that all her problems were hers, not mine. She left me knowing for the rest of my life all those men killed her and there will never be justice. They killed her inside.. She just took her body."

Children should be ALLOWED to be upset,1805,jwhbmd,198,"When kids are not allowed to be upset they develop horrible coping mechanisms, become ashamed of their feelings and don’t feel safe or secure in their own sense of self.

Speaking as an adult who was never allowed to express their emotions as a kid 👍👍"
"The reason why cPTSD and trauma are ""controversial"" and ""misunderstood"" is because if we were able to successfully reckon with the truth of trauma, there would be a lot of abusers who would need to be held accountable.",1811,jcn0yj,201,Thats it.  Thats the whole post.

Emotional neglect analogy that helped me see things pretty clearly,1757,keb5o4,218,"My therapist and I talked about an analogy to explain how my parents handled my emotions growing up and it really helped everything click! She said that emotions are real physical signals in our body. Actual physical reactions happen when we experience an emotion - we feel hot, our chest feels heavy, our heart rate increases, etc. We have other normal physical signals all the time, like the feeling of having to pee.

So the analogy is imagine a toddler clearly needing to go to the bathroom, like full potty dance. Imagine their parent ignoring it and avoiding it because of their own issues with going potty. Weird right? Now imagine the child comes to their parent and says “I need to go to potty” and the parent says “it’s ok, you’re fine, it’s not that big of a deal.” That would be really irresponsible of the parent. Then the child says “but wait I really need to go!” And the parent says “no you don’t. Stop saying you need to go potty. Stop having to go potty.” Now the parent is being downright cruel and unreasonable. The child then gets clearly upset their parent isn’t listening to them AND still really has to pee. Then the parent finally says “what is your problem? There’s something wrong with you if you need to go potty.” Now the parent is clearly abusive and really messed up. 

And when the child inevitably has an accident the parent yells or hits and says “go to timeout, I can’t believe you did this, you’re such a disappointment!” 

Having to go to the bathroom is a physical signal. Emotions are physical signals. Everyone has to go to the bathroom and everyone has emotions. These are normal human things. And in this analogy, it’s the parents job to teach their child how to handle going potty, where to do so, what’s involved, etc. 

So by my parents avoiding my emotions, minimizing them, invalidating them and shaming them, it is the emotional equivalent of not potty training me, a clearly abusive act. 

I laughed after talking about this and asked if that’s why I feel like I’ve shit all over my life lol."

I think sometimes people who are raised by very controlling parent(s) seem lazy to others.,1750,fr5ppl,136,"They come across as lazy and not showing initiative. 
I think this is because they learned early on that they were likely to be punished if they did anything the controlling person didn’t want them to do – – which included a great many behaviors.   They learned, “don’t do anything; that way you don’t do anything wrong.“. Wrong meaning anything the controlling person would get pissed off about."
I hate the romanticised portrayal of traumatised children,1740,l30z7s,200,"I really, really hate it. Media LOVE the idea of quiet kids with sad eyes, who are exceptionally mature and self-reliant.

In reality a lot of traumatised kids have difficulty seeing and respecting other people's boundaries because they weren't raised with healthy boundaries.

A lot of traumatised kids were ""the weird kid at school"", because their parents didn't pass on a lot of unspoken cultural norms.

A lot of traumatised kids had issues with aggression and tantrums because they weren't taught self-soothing or emotional regulation.

A lot of traumatised kids grew up without healthy hobbies and passions because they were busy surviving, picking up different coping mechanisms instead.

A lot of traumatised kids were behind their peers when it comes to different life skills, because nobody taught them or because their whole energy was burned on dealing with stress.

A lot of traumatised kids performed worse... Because that's what stress does to you. It affects your literal brain structures.

But this society loves the story of romantic underdogs, people who pulled themselves by their bootstraps. They want narratives spiced up by trauma, without the parts that look unflattering.

To be fair, the best portrayal of traumatised kids, for me, is Jay and Lola from ""Big Mouth"". Loud, obnoxious and clueless about social norms, which you realise is a result of neglect."
The thing about trauma...,1723,bmzb63,76,
CPTSD is a disorder that affects your ability to live a normal life- please remember that!,1716,iog2tw,228,"I read a lot of stuff on PTSD that specifically talks about how veterans will deal with every day life. Traditionally when you have PTSD it affects your ability to function because your nervous system is going haywire. Your body thinks everything is a threat around you, you feel like you’re re-experiencing events. For those of us with CPTSD, it can be even more difficult because a lot of memories we can’t even remember.

A lot of people post on here about how they’re wondering if the fact that they don’t clean up after themselves, or that they have no personality, or can’t connect with others - means something is wrong with them. A lot of people post about how they feel like they’re never gonna be able to catch up to those around them. A lot of people feel like they need some kind of manual to navigate life. 

In my opinion, and after years of therapy, the problem is that you have PTSD. You need to be treated for PTSD. You need PTSD targeted therapies. It’s very easy to feel like you need to address every little thing that’s wrong with you such as making a cleaning schedule or trying to learn how to make friends or learning to cook for yourself. But the real problem is that your nervous system is so unregulated that your brain literally cannot function in the present. It’s not because you’re stupid, it’s not because you’re socially inept, it’s because your nervous system is too preoccupied with other things to be in the present. Your body still thinks that you are under threat. 

When you work on the PTSD itself at the root, and you are able to release some of your pain and terrible memories, you will be freeing up space for your nervous system and your brain to focus on what’s going on around you. And you will fall into line, you will find it easier to connect with others and make new friends, and you will not exist in a hell of self analysis. You will not be afraid of people, and you will not have to live in a cocoon of safety forever. You will be able to experience real life. 

Anything that you are experiencing is not abnormal in any sort of way, but it is really really important to understand that if your mood is seriously up and down, you are not connecting with others, everything terrifies you, and you’re struggling to hold a job or feed yourself, you have PTSD. I wasted a couple of years in therapy trying to “learn” how to be a person again. Once I started targeting my PTSD it was like my brain AND my body already knew how to be a person. Two sessions of somatic therapy was the equivalent of a year of DBT for me. 

I just made this post because I feel like we try to downplay all of our symptoms but PTSD is a very real thing. War veterans come back and they literally cannot function and some of them become violent and some of them commit suicide- just like many of us do.  

Don’t downplay your symptoms!!! PTSD is real, and if you try to self analyze every “abnormal” behavior you have, you will spiral for a very long time. You cannot think your way out of PTSD because it is a problem with your nervous system. Yes, the brain is powerful, and sometimes talking stuff out and learning about stuff can help you relax. But once again I’m going to emphasize.... the PTSD therapy."

My therapist told me something that stopped me in my tracks. I no longer want to self harm because of it.,1644,ebosyi,137,"We did EMDR and are currently processing sexual abuse. During the roughest part of the session I had strong desires to self harm (my coping mechanism). It involved my child self and she was crying in a corner. 

Later, he said to me ""When you feel like self harming again, think of your safe space, or imagine cutting your child self. Imagine cutting a little girl who is crying in the corner.""

It took me aback. He made a point that I never thought of. Self compassion.

Thinking of cutting my child self feels disturbing. It also made me realize just how cruel I've been to myself. My child self just wants love. Why would I hurt her like that?

EDIT: Wow, thank you so much for the feedback and the gold!! I woke up to so many nice comments. Thank you all so much, I sincerely wish you all the best of luck in your journeys as well. :)"

"""Please do yourself a favour and replace the word 'attention' with 'support' in the words 'attention seeking.' It's just replacement of one one word but it makes all the difference. It's not attention that you are seeking. It's support.""",1614,miwsf7,91,"And let that sink in. For a while.

These were the words from my Trauma Informed Therapist in the very first session I had with her. It didn't strike me immediately...and then my entire life made sense to me.

My excessive yammering with anyone available to talk was not me seeking attention. Rather it was me seeking support saying, ""Please talk to me so that I don't have to listen to my mind."" Over the week a lot of things made sense to me.

My primary diagnosis is of C-PTSD with BPD and PTSD as co-morbidities, with four more other co-morbidities which pale in comparison to the three mentioned above.

Borderlines are highly stigmatised in the mental health community. We are called attention seekers, emotional blackmailers and manipulative, which makes even a few mental health professionals not trust us. 

I have been wanting to post this for a while now. I posted it on r/BPD first ([here](https://np.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/miwc67/please_do_yourself_a_favour_and_replace_the_word/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)) and now I am here: the place where I feel the most understood.

It's NOT attention seeking. **IT'S SUPPORT SEEKING.**

Kindly tell yourself that everytime you think you are seeking attention, or someone else says so.

*Edit:* Based on inputs from the comments, I am adding **CONNECTION SEEKING** to it too.

*Edit 2:* Adding **CARE SEEKING** to it too!

*Edit 3:* The alternatives for attention seeking that I have gotten till now are:

1. Support Seeking

2. Care Seeking

3. Connection Seeking

4. **Attachment Seeking** (which I feel could be taken negatively if people start seeing attachment as being clingy)

5. **Reassurance Seeking** (which could be helpful or unhelpful depending on the context or situation)

6. **Comfort Seeking**

7. **Validation Seeking**"

Just because you forgave your abusers and it worked for you doesn't mean I have to do the same.,1592,l7wb3y,191,"I'm tired of being told by those who have forgiven their abusers and it worked for them that I also need to do the same. They try to tell me that I can't possibly heal by not forgiving them and holding onto the anger towards them.   
  
#What's right for you in your healing journey is not always right for me in mine.  
  
  

I'm allowed to be angry with what happened to me and who did it to me. I don't allow the anger to consume me, and I work hard on healing. I am no-contact with my abusers and they hold no space in my life or head other than the trauma I'm working through.   
    

Continuing to tell me that I *have* to forgive them for what they did to me or else I won't ever truly heal is incredibly invalidating and I wish everyone who does this would just stop. 
 
Edit: this doesn't mean I think forgiving your abusers doesn't work. If it's worked for you, then I'm absolutely ecstatic for you, but at this point in my life it won't work for me, it will only harm my progress, and it may never work for me, and that's okay. There's no rulebook on healing from trauma that will work for everyone. 
  
 
Edit 2: I think it's been made clear by the comments that your individual definition of forgiveness is also what matters in this situation. In my eyes, forgiveness is absolving someone of their wrong doing and I don't believe my abusers deserve that. Individual definitions of forgiveness is important in this topic. I appreciate everyone who commented, even though who disagree. Thanks"

""Gaslighters tell you how you feel to separate you from your experience. It makes you easier to manipulate.""


My parents do all these things, but I couldn't investigate or consider their corresponding labels because these things are all so mean-spirited. I can't imagine my parents plotting and planning this out.

But I've realized that this stuff doesn't need to be planned out. In fact, it is easier explained by the lack of planning.

This stuff is the expression of extreme reactivity. No thoughts. In the moments of tension, my parents have a knee jerk reactions towards the most comfortable solution. If they did think, they'd pick a different route because they'd see their emotions, the situation and the impact of their actions. But they don't think! It's like a wall at the forefront of their brains - when something happens, it just bounces off before it can enter be processed.


They sense distance between us = they miss me and they want me closer, so they try to make amends by being overly sweet. Apologizing and changing behavior takes a lot of effort, and that's too much.


They fuck up = they think their actions are infallible because they feel justified, and my reaction made them feel shitty, so they attack me. They don't think about the situation as a whole. It is easier that way.


I am sad = my sadness makes them feel sad, and they want that sadness to go away. So they argue with me and get me to say that I'm not sad. Once I stop expressing my sadness, they dont have to feel uncomfortable. They dont emphasize with me because theyre consumed by their own mismanaged inner state.



They way that these behaviors are communicated, at least in English, makes it seem like there is deliberation and intention. Especially since it links action to desired outcome. But I really believe that it can all exist without consciousness or intention. And that helps to know."

"Today I realized when I drive, I am extremely concerned about the feelings of people driving behind me, it causes me a lot of stress, and this is due to lack of emotional boundary",1522,hwdn50,111,"Just want to share this epiphany today while driving. I was trying to turn left with a lot of oncoming traffic, there were cars behind me that had to wait for me to make the turn before they can go straight forward. During times like this, I was always incredibly concerned about their feelings. I’d be thinking: oh no this driver behind me must be really impatient, annoyed at me and cursing me under their breath... I just automatically imagine their anger and I got really freaked out by that. 

In reality, I don’t even see their face. I don’t know who they are. I don’t know how they feel. I was just doing “mind reading”. This is familiar for me, as when I grew up I always was hyper vigilant about my parents’ emotions. If my parents were potentially angry or annoyed, I really needed to be able to quickly detect it, and to tip toe around it, and to soothe them before something really scary happens. 

This manifests in driving where I got too stressed out by being hyper focused on the feelings of other drivers. It’s a lack of emotional boundary. Today I tried to tell myself, “hey I don’t need to know how the driver of this red car behind me feels. I am obeying traffic rules. I am a good driver. If they are fuming and angry in their car, it’s their problem, not mine. If they are calm then good for them. I have no way of knowing how they feel, and it’s not my business to figure that out. I am safe at this moment. I don’t need to figure out the emotions of everybody near me to be safe. It was so emotionally unsafe for me as a child that I learnt to be acutely aware of my parents’ emotions in order to predict and manage their behavior. That was past, and I am living as an adult in the present. My parents’ anger can’t hurt me anymore. I can just relax in my car while waiting for my turn, the potential annoyance of other drivers won’t hurt me now. Their feelings are their own business. I only need to take responsibility of my own. “

That was very eye opening. The idea that I don’t need to take care of any one else’s but my own feeling is so liberating. It’s exhausting to be in constant vigilance about other people’s feeling. Even if another person feels bad, it’s not my responsibility to fix that, nor would it be my fault. I refuse to take responsibility that is not mine. 

Imagine living a life feeling safe inside of my own emotional boundary! That sounds so safe and relaxing. I hope I will have more and more of that."

What I was thinking is that the feelings of our abusers shouldn't be centered in our own healing, regardless of their experiences, and that it's not our responsibility to provide them peace.

Has anyone else noticed that a lot of the “positive vibes only” and “I hate drama” types tend to be quite mean?,1496,hyq25v,272,"Like, I find that some of the “I hate drama” types often make quite passive aggressive, rude comments and frequently interrupt people when they’re speaking, and when the person who they are doing it to gets upset, the commenter complains at them for “causing drama for no reason”. 

And with the “positive vibes only” types, they get annoyed and uncomfortable if you display any emotion that isn’t unbridled happiness. If you have a bad day, instead of showing concern, they make it about them and get annoyed at you for “inconveniencing” them with your “negativity”. If they do or say something to upset you and you rightfully get upset, they berate you for being “negative” instead of being sorry that they hurt you. 

Has anyone else found this? Whenever I hear someone make comments such as “I can’t stand drama” or “I really hate negativity” or “I find other girls to be *so* bitchy”, I instantly become wary and they almost *always* turn out to be mean and slightly lacking in empathy.

Funnily enough, these types also tend to get irritated by others’ happiness as well. 

Edit: this of course doesn’t apply to people who complain non-stop about everything and dump all their problems on others without considering that the other person is going through their own stuff. I’m mainly talking about people who just need to vent occasionally when something bad happens, but get shut down and judged for that."

He sends you home, telling you to just focus on the bones that aren’t broken. “You should consider yourself lucky,” he says, “I’ve seen people with so many broken bones, yours is nothing. Just stop wallowing in it.”

So you go home, telling yourself you’re just being selfish. You commit yourself to focusing on the positive, non-injured bones in your body. Hell, maybe your leg is actually fine, maybe you are just crazy. It hurts, though. It hurts so much you can’t really walk at all, but you learn how to hobble when you really need to. And it refuses to heal. Most days you lie in bed. Maybe you end up drinking and doing drugs to help make the pain stop. You constantly wonder why the fact that your elbow doesn’t hurt isn’t making up for the fact that your leg is radiating pain 24/7. You think this makes you a failure. 

(...and then people will look at you and say “No wonder she can’t walk right! She doesn’t even try. She just lies in bed all day, wallowing about.”) 

This has been my experience with how people see CPTSD and childhood or traumatic experiences overall. People will say “At least you’re mother did X! You’re so lucky she was there for you like that.” Or “Well, you guys had money. You’re awfully lucky to have grown up with money! Just focus on that.” (I get stuck in that mindset constantly, thinking I’m just a big dumb dumb.)

Like gee, thanks. It’s pretty hard to appreciate the good things in your past when there’s a huge stream of painful memories that need to be healed first. You wouldn’t tell someone with a broken leg to just focus on their working limbs and get over it, so don’t tell people with trauma to just focus on what wasn’t traumatic and get over it.

"Does anyone else HATE the fact that people underestimate how much you're suffering because your experiences aren't as ""dramatic"" as the trauma that others have faced ?",1481,l8m55f,164,"I get the whole ""but my parents used to fight too"" or ""but you were never sexually abused so get over it"" arguments all the time when I try to open up about my trauma. For example, my cousins parents were very strict, and a bit cold but she had a normal life otherwise. My mom turned to me one day, and said that she has gone through much more than me because she doesn't have parents who show her ""love"". The ""love"" that I experienced was sharing all of my moms burdens, and being her therapist while my dad cheated, and emotionally abused her. My cousin didn't know what it was like to be so close to a parent that you share all of their burdens. Get sad when they get sad. Get anxious when they cry. Get angry when they get angry. Since her parents were a bit cold she developed separate from them mentally, and grew up as her own person. Developed on her own. She's a funtional adult now who just got married. I am the opposite. I just had my first kiss & sexual experience at 26 years old with a stranger that I will never see again. 

 At least once a day I lay in my bed, laugh to myself, then tearfully say that I want to die. I feel so weak & powerless compared to everyone else. That's why I can't date. I obsess over people in an unhealthy way (think about them all the time), and try to harm myself when I get rejected. Everyone seems so big, and I feel so tiny. I get so concerned over situations that I can't control whether they be personal, political, or societal. I feel as if I'm a bystander to all the problems in the world that I have no power to stop, and I get paranoid that one day these problems will come into my life, and destroy my happiness just like my parents marriage."

DAE Get gaslit into believing they were supposed to already know things they were never taught how to do and then shamed for not knowing how to do them?,1464,iyacql,189,"I had this happen to me a lot from my father who is an alcoholic narc. He would never ever ever ever ever be caught dead with wasting his time to show me how to do something or actually engage and 'teach' me anything. He always stood there and said figure it out while he would watch me fail and struggle really hard. Sometimes I think I'd even cry and just keep repeating that I don't understand or don't know what to do. He would get impatient and frustrated that I didn't get it immediately and then either do it for me or walk away and abandoned me. The rationale he gave me to believe wasthat by withholding assistance he would teach me to be independent and think for myself or something. 

I'm really good at pretending to have my shit together even though I know deep down that I don't and that I'm developmentally far behind on basic internal and external life skills. I dissociate a lot and I feel like I exhibit mild schizoid traits from my particular set of coping strategies. Everyday is a struggle to find passion and interest in things. I have this constant fear that I don't know enough or that if I could just read more and more philosophy books I would be okay but Where's the limit? Learning to be okay and vulnerable with not knowing literally everything is something that I struggle with because I feel that if I don't know something or my knowledge is incorrect or not interesting enough I am worthless. 

Covid has me living with my parents again and I feel just as emotionally distant from them when I'm 20 feet from them than when I lived in another state. Being an only child doesn't help either...

"I’m leaving the sub, I don’t need it anymore. You all rock.",1462,klj2rk,70,"I’m so fucking grateful for this sub and for all of you.

Thank you for commenting on all of my DAE posts while I was trying to figure out exactly what I was dealing with, trying to figure out who and why I am, and why some real bad shit ended up happening to me recently. Hearing your stories really helped me figure out my own shit in ways I don’t think you’ll ever fully know.

PTSD isn’t a mental illness, it’s a mental injury. Let’s say you get shot in the leg. There’s a chance it might not heal right. And sometimes life kicks you in that leg and you’ll fall flat over, and you’ll wonder “why? Why am I falling over? All they did was kick me, this is so pathetic.” Maybe eventually, you become afraid of being kicked in the leg because of how much it hurts. That’s real. It’s not an overreaction, it’s not anything to be ashamed of, you have a scar there that was made due to no fault of your own. Maybe it can be healed fully, maybe it can’t. That’s not up to you. What is though is how much you want to let that scar control you. Sometimes fighting your demons isn’t the best way about going about something. Sometimes you just need to make peace with them.

I know you may not feel it today, but you’re all fantastic and tough bastards for even just trying to get through life with this. 

You’re all honestly the kindest group of people I’ve ever interacted with. Thank you for the pleasure of your company on my very long journey.

"Was anyone else ever told that they daydreamed a lot as a child, when in fact they were frequently dissociating?",1451,ili9c5,180,"I dissociated a lot as a kid, and as an adult when my mental health dips.

I have just realised that when your response to stressful sounds and thoughts is to freeze for a few minutes in the middle of a public place, or to sit on the edge of your bed for 20-30mins and think/feel nothing at all, that's not normal.

"“I used to have PTSD, then I woke up one day and decided not to let it rule my life anymore.”",1443,m22552,352,"Does this kind of comment bother anyone else?

It feels like victim blaming, as though overcoming PTSD is “just a decision,” like you can “just choose” not to have mental illness anymore, which also implies that those who are still struggling are “choosing” to struggle.

Like, “Oh I used to be depressed, then I realized I just needed to stop feeling sorry for myself.”

They’re not explicitly saying “you’re not trying hard enough,” but their comments imply that healing from mental illness is easy you “just have to get out of your own way.”

It cuts an especial amount because I feel like they are misrepresenting what coping with trauma is like. Then people who haven’t experienced trauma point to these comments to invalidate survivors and claim anyone who is traumatized is “lingering on the past” and “throwing a pity party.”"
I broke up with my partner/soulmate/best friend because my needs weren't being met.,1447,lm07lx,232,"This is one of the hardest and most painful things I've ever had to do. I just broke up with my partner of five years. 

He was my best friend and felt like my soulmate. We could talk for hours about anything. He made me laugh. He accepted my mental health challenges. He loved me dearly and deeply. We had so many shared hobbies and interests.

But he couldn't address my needs. Any time I brought up an issue, he'd get defensive, blame me for bringing it up, and we'd circle the drain for hours in confusing meta-conversations about how it made *him* feel bad that *my* needs weren't being met. Or he'd promise me all starry-eyed that he'd address it because he cares about me and loves me so much, but then he wouldn't take any action at all. Rinse and repeat.

The relationship reminded me so much of childhood. That feeling that unconditional love is there, just beyond the reach of my fingertips, *if only I could stop having needs*. The relationship is perfect, the other person is perfect, the only problem is that I have needs.

I spent years trying to shut off my feelings. I walked on eggshells around him. I didn't bring up issues. I wrote letters to myself begging myself to stop caring about finances, sex, long-term planning, kids, domestic tasks, communication, boundaries. I told myself that if I could just accept whatever he gave to me, it would be enough. His love would be enough, and I'd never be alone again.

But I couldn't shut off the part of me that wanted more, and he could not give me more. So I left.

He is telling me I'll regret this. That he would have loved me for the rest of my life. I still can't really believe that I'm choosing my own boundaries and needs over someone who loves me, when all I've ever wanted is to be loved.

I'm hoping this is a positive step towards my recovery, and that next time I will leave the first time it becomes clear someone is incapable of respecting boundaries and responding to needs, instead of 5 years down the line.

Has anyone else stood up for their boundaries even though it was incredibly painful? Is there light at the end of this tunnel?

**EDIT:** Thank you so much to everyone who responded. The support from this community is incredible. I am feeling stronger in my decision, and I'm amazed at the serendipity of the number of us going through this same process with the same types of people at the same time! We will get through this!"

I let my cat say no. If she starts squirming when I hold her I put her down. If she's done being pet I leave her alone. My husband and I like to say she is her own person.

Therapist told me traumatized people are better equipped to handle the mental aspect of COV-19 pandemic,1433,fowk2x,213,"My therapist shared something with me this week that I thought you might find interesting. 

She said she read it in an article (I wish I had the article to read/share). But anyways, she said that people with cptsd are better equipped to handle how we’ve lost control of just about every thing in our lives, because we’ve experienced that so many times, for so long, while being traumatized. 

Of course, not everyone will relate to that, but I definitely do. And it made me feel a little bit better about my mental illness, cause in this situation, it kind of feels like a strength. Especially because I find myself thriving being told to shelter in place, and not work. 

Hope you are all doing well!"

Who else feels intense shame and anxiety when expressing an opinion or setting a boundary?,1413,du9pbj,130,"As a kid, everything that came out of my mouth was labeled wrong, stupid, ridiculous, whining, or just laughed at. I learned early on that keeping quiet was the only safe option that didn’t result in ridicule or physical punishment.

And as an adult this isn’t serving me well. I fear asking questions and asking for help, but it’s so much worse when expressing an opinion or setting a boundary with someone.

And in the past this has caused so much additional trauma. I was raped and never reported it because speaking out felt worse than the rape itself. I was bullied in school and it actually felt okay because punishment just for being myself felt normal. I was stuck in a job for years where I was taken advantage of and treated badly, but putting my foot down and standing up for myself felt impossible through the feelings of worthlessness. And I’d never challenge friends or partners because I was conditioned to put everyone else’s needs and opinions first.

And even though therapy is helping with this, it’s *so hard* to battle through this when online culture is so argumentative and full of black-and-white thinking. If I say something online (which I try to limit as much as possible), there’s bound to be a hateful, pushy person to trample on that opinion. Stuff like “I really enjoy X movie” results in “You like that piece of trash? Pathetic.” And that causes panic, self-doubt, and the compulsion to run away and never say anything ever again. I regularly uninstall all social media apps out of shame for saying things that are not shameful at all, just because it feels like the punishment is coming just for existing.

Also, I’ve noticed that when quiet people start testing the waters and having opinions, people don’t take too kindly to that. If you’re quiet for years, then speak up a little, some people suddenly react as if you’ve done something very wrong. IMO this is because keeping my mouth shut and not being disagreeable and not setting boundaries had attracted too many strong personalities who don’t like to be challenged, and other people who were downright abusive who can’t deal with someone else rocking the boat.

So...this turned into a messy, ranting post.

Does anyone else deal with this on a daily basis? Has anyone made progress with this?"

Society makes it harder for traumatised people to heal and recover.,1415,jqgi5l,123,"This is something I’ve been thinking about for a while now. Western society is organised in a way that is so deeply ableist. Instead of living in a world that works to serve everyone’s needs, those of us that fall outside of the “normal” category are tasked with hiding/ masking every symptom, pushing our already sensitive nervous systems to the brink and we have to make sure we do it with a smile, no matter how drained we are.
The more I read and learn about CPTSD, the more the importance of a healthy diet, sleep and rest keep coming up but I can’t help be bitter about it sometimes because the question of who has access to all these things is a very political one. How much rest and sleep can you get when you spend every minute stressing about bills+rent, how healthy can you eat when you make to little no money. 
I haven’t even touched on how incredibly discriminatory the world of work is and how we’re encouraged to take these views and internalise them as though there is something wrong with us and not this world that puts productivity before human lives. I’m current unemployed but have worked in the past in random temp.agency jobs, I didn’t work these jobs because I enjoy having little rights as a worker or because i enjoy getting shit pay but because before I even knew I had CPTSD i knew that I was easily triggered and had intense emotional, psychological and physiological reactions to everyday happenings. It was actually smart of me as young as I was to be aware of what I couldn’t handle and try to work around it. Sadly, everyone around me felt the need to slyly diss me because I was apparently “smart” and not living up to my “potential”. Never mind that using all that I have for surviving is an accomplishment itself.
I’m grateful for all the knowledge I have from the books, videos and even this place for giving me the hope to believe that recovery is possible and that CPTSD is not a death sentence but the hope is quickly dampened when I pay attention to this world we live in. Could you imagine what recovery would look if all our most immediate needs(food+shelter) were met, the amount of time that would free up for us to focus on nurturing our well being .What if we lived in a world where people that can no longer perform/function well in a deeply sick society weren’t thrown to the wolves to suffer silently and deal with the crushing isolation that comes with being on the fringes?"

But for me, as I'm always downplaying my struggles and second guessing my traumas it felt nice being seen like that, because I am in pain, we are in pain, and most days it feels like no one sees us and we suffer alone and even when we try to explain, even if they try to be empathetic, you know that they'll never understand, and it hurts, god it hurts so bad, and hearing this from a mental health professional, from a psychiatrist!

In fact, she told me that from her perspective, they seem to have an awfully hard time. This is because they have perfected the mask and the functionality at a great cost.

Self care is the hard work you put in to build a place that you no longer need to escape from. Not indulgence,1376,hmx06i,76,"I read something similar on reddit earlier this week, or month, but can no longer find where I saw it, so apologies if it's been seen here.

-----------------

I, and most people, probably have this notion that 'Self Care' is indulging in your 'comforts' in order to bring yourself out of a negative place, but in my opinion, that is **not true.**

Most self indulgent practices come from coping mechanisms of the past that have been ingrained to escape from reality. Things like overeating, or indulging in sugar, or hiding away and binging tv and movies for a week. While it does help in the short term, it can hurt you in the long term.

The advice that instantly changed my way of thinking about self care is this: **Self care is the hard work you put in to build a place that you no longer need to escape from.**

Now, I wake up every morning, and I go on that run. It sucks, and its hard, but I know I feel great for the day after.

Now, I eat healthy, even though unhealthy alternatives exits, because I know how much better I feel.

Now, I don't browse reddit 8 hours a day to escape my emotions, because I know the importance of connecting with my emotions, even if that emotion is pain.

Now, I meditate every day because it brings a sense of clarity and awareness to everything I do, and lets me acknowledge my problems, but not become emotionally attached to them.

Now, I (am still working on) journaling every day, so that I don't retract into the bottle that I end up in if I go long times without letting it out.

-------------

All of these things are **HARD** to start, and do consistently, especially when you feel like not doing them, but these things, for me, *are self care*, and they have improved every aspect of my life and headspace."

I also realized I need so much sleep because of how exhausting life is. I used to *need* 10/12 hours just to go to work, come home, and go to bed. (I have kids now, so sleep isn't a thing anymore, lol.)

Edit: Thank you all for the awards, support and conversation! I'm pretty bad at interacting with humans, so I hope I don't offend anyone."

I Enforced A Boundary-AND HE STILL WANTS TO BE FRIENDS?!?!?!,1359,fqmkg1,51,"So I have a really close friend who's overweight and has decided he wants to try losing some weight while in quarantine. He's been excitedly telling me (and others) about his plans, and his victories, in hopes we would hold him accountable. The thing is, I'm a recently recovered anorexic, and talking about weight loss is triggering to me. So last night, I told him this. I told him I respected that he is an adult, and that he can do with his body and time as he sees fit, but given my background and my specific trauma, I would feel better if he did not involve me in conversations about his weight loss plans. And....he respected it? And he wasn't mad? And he still wants to be friends???? What??? He told me it wasn't his intention to trigger me in that way, but he heard what I was saying, and he would do his best to respect it. He also told me it was okay if, should he forget, I call him on it. He even ended by congratulating me for sticking up for myself and protecting my own needs. The thing is, he made it so damn easy because as much as the weight loss talk was hurting me, I knew if I talked to him about it that he'd care enough to honor me and change his behavior. I feel...I feel very honored to have him in my life as a friend."

&nbsp;

I wanted to share this because I thought my experience of Childhood Trauma was uncommon so I was shocked to found out how prevalent this was. I wish we would do more to protect kids."
"Nobody cares about the ones that don't 'overcome' and go on to do great things. No one cares unless you're the troubled kid who goes on to make 100K a year. No one cares about the ones who were smart, quiet, 'good' kids who couldn't handle it.",1337,dqlvyk,152,"Who were only smart, quiet and 'good' to please the ones hurting them and minimize reasons to be hurt. Who feel so useless they put all their self esteem in school because that's the one place they're praised. Maybe you end up dropping out of high school. Maybe you finish and drop out of college. It catches up to you. 

All I'm saying is that everyone cares about the bad kids who do well. No one cares if you have severe concentration issues from years and years of abuse. I feel all the success stories make it seem as easy as making a choice to succeed. And if we fail its because we are lazy and making excuses. If we drop out it's an excuse. No one sees the hours it takes to write a single essay because turning on my brain forces me to face all the trauma I'm constantly blocking out."
"People care. They just can't help us heal, because they're not professionals, and it's not healthy for them to parent us",1335,fgz9lr,134,"I am so tired of seeing ""no one cares about people with PTSD"" on this subreddit. I know it feels like people back away from us because they don't care, but the more I heal the more I discover that's not true at all. 

I am concerned when I see others struggling with trauma and mental illness, because my own experience makes it pretty easy to spot. But jumping in and trying to save them would be inappropriate, unless they're a very close friend already. It would also be useless, since what trauma survivors need is copious amounts of therapy and to learn and practice self compassion and self love, which I can't make anyone do. 

The healthy process for growing up is to get our needs met by our parents, while they slowly teach us how to meet those needs ourselves. When we discover that never happened, our first desire is to find other people to meet those needs. Trauma recovery, in my experience, is in large part learning through therapy that we are adults now who are responsible for meeting our own needs, and that looking to friends and strangers to be our parents will only perpetuate and deepen the harm. 

Luckily, self-parenting *does work*. But it takes a lot of courage and self compassion to do the work our parents should have done when we were children. There's also a massive grieving process for what we should have had. But I promise, putting off this process of becoming our own need-meeters will only compound and prolong our pain. 

People *do* care, but they *can't* give us what we need. If they tried, they would just be acting codependent. And I don't think I need to explain the toxicity codependency causes in relationships. We need trained professionals, and our own self-love, not parentified friends. 

Please stop saying people in general don't care. It's not true and just perpetuates the feelings of hopelessness we all have too much of already

(Yes, I know there are exceptions, and toxic people out there. I'm talking broadly about the majority of the population)

--------------------------

Edit to add: since people keep interpreting this as ""don't ask for any moral support ever"", **this is not an all or nothing scenario**. 

Of *course* a supportive, caring community is helpful to *us* when we heal ourselves, but they cannot do the healing *for* us. 

Friends, family, and community are like scaffolding; they're helpful but they are not the actual building. By all means, have all the scaffolding you can, but you still gotta build something solid underneath it."
I hate it when people say that I should just let go of the past. The past affects how my brain works now as an adult.,1328,mgkxfq,109,"I'm not obsessing over past trauma but my involuntary fight or flight responses, anxiety, and depression are caused by the stuff that happened to me. I don't actually care about the events that happened to me anymore but my brain is wired to react as if I'm still in those situations. It's not hard to understand if you're able to have at least a little empathy, and a basic understanding of mental health topics like depression."

Did anybody else not realize their parents were abusive?,1324,lqtp4g,336,"My parents were ""strict"". That's what I grew up thinking, that every shitty thing they did was acceptable because they were strict parents and that's what strict parents did. It wasnt until this year that I started therapy for something else, that I realized my parents were flat out abusive. My T has pointed out many of my current actions and thoughts and explained how my childhood experiences influenced me. She doesn't even know the full history yet, just what is currently affecting me, and is firm that both my parents are and were extremely abusive and that I've been traumatized as a result.

It's crazy to me that here I am, 24, just figuring out that I was abused my entire life, and not only that, but I'm messed up because of it. Looking back at what I *can* remember from my childhood with this different lense is insane, everything is starting to make sense, I had no idea how bad things were because I was just trying to survive."
DAE’s brain try to guilt you into believing that you’re being too hard on your parents and your childhood wasn’t THAT bad?,1322,l3aazy,131,"Dude it was bad. It was real bad.

Am I alone? I feel like such a POS right now."
"I hate that now I'm considered an adult, my trauma is always being downplayed as ""You're an adult already. Get your shit together!""",1311,har2a5,110,"The amount of abuse I received all throughout my childhood, the way my dysfunctional family never teach me nor treat me right.. how can you expect me to magically get my shit together just because I'm an adult?

I am proud of you. Yes, you, reading this because if you're reading this, in this subreddit, then chances are that you have this same awful condition as me. Our circumstances may be different but our trauma is complex and we are living with that. 

I know what hell this thing has put me through. I know it has been hell for you too and I'm proud of you because you're still here. I'm proud of me too. 

So celebrate. Maybe that's feasting like we do on Jewish holidays but maybe instead it's simply feeling a bit of joy, listening to your favourite song and throwing a middle finger up at the odds that you're beating every single day.

Pro of having trauma: I know and practice the importance of being kind to others. Con of having trauma: I have no idea how to be kind to myself.,1313,dhvg7j,55,"My therapist recently told me that i'm really mean to myself. I was perplexed, and I asked her what that meant. She said, ""You just called yourself a f'ing idiot because you don't think you should be sad about your childhood. You're allowed to be sad. You're allowed every emotion in the book. Trauma doesn't make you any less human. It just makes being human take a lot more practice."" Basically, she suggested that I list off things that bring me joy, or happiness. She also wanted me to try to be more compassionate or sympathetic towards myself.  


After the session, I ran to the store because my girlfriend has been having a rough time at work, and with other stressors. I picked up things that I thought would cheer her up, or help her relax. Bubble bath, candles, these fuzzy socks she's obsessed with, etc. I looked down at my cart and asked myself, what would I put in this cart to make me happy, to brighten up MY day? I walked around Target for an hour, and couldn't really find anything. I started to ask myself, who am I? I realized my therapist was right. I (and probably many of us) have no idea how to treat ourselves. I'm hyper-vigilant of the way I treat others. I don't understand how people can cause pain in others. I don't understand how they live with themselves. Yes, sometimes causing pain can be unavoidable, but the pain we've all gone through? That never should've happened. So, I just know to be kind. In my own head, i'm an asshole to myself, and I barely even realize it. I gaslight myself. I question every emotion, every motive. I'll feel some form of empathy for myself and then squash it.   


Anyway, my goal for this week is to try to be nicer to myself, to find a few things that bring me joy or happiness or even just a second of peace. I'd like others to join me in this goal and to keep me updated on what you've found, how it all felt, etc. Even if for one day, try to be nice to yourself."
DAE require a lot of alone time (and/or sensory deprivation) to avoid a meltdown or freeze state?,1309,k460kg,120,"I often hide in my music studio when I get stressed. Even if I’m not working on music, I just need that time away from everything. Friends/girlfriend don’t seem to understand and think I’m just alienating myself or pushing people away, but to me, it just feels like having time and space to be my authentic self, relax, process things, create things, and get away from all of the stimuli of the world around me. 

If I don’t get this time to myself, I end up burning out and having a mental health crisis. I loveee alone time."

It's finally clicked that no one is coming to save me.,1305,ky8bir,121,"I want to share my most recent breakthrough in case it can help someone else out. It took me awhile to realize the pattern I kept acting out, and what it was I deeply wanted. 

As a child, I was abandoned in an incredibly dangerous situation. 

I have carried with me, since then, a desire for rescue. And I have acted out putting myself in vulnerable positions or emotional spots, trying to find someone who would save me. I would overexplain myself, my needs, or my trauma all the time. Because I believed that if someone didn't see I was in pain or needed help, then it was my fault for not explaining it well enough.  

But that's not how it works. It was and isn't my fault if someone doesn't want to understand or are so uncomfortable with the truth they want to gaslight me about it. If they don't approach with care & curiosity to my needs. That's on them, and no amount of me giving 'because' reasons to my needs will be likely to change their minds. 

I get to decide what happens to me. I get to decide how I approach life. I have agency now.

I have grown into my own rescuer. And it is incredibly heartbreaking and sad that no one was able to help me as a child and teen. I am still grieving that hard. I will be for awhile. 

But there's freedom in knowing that I can rescue myself. I can pick up that abandoned child, and take her away from everything that was bad and ensure she doesn't ever have to go through anything like that again.

I'll never be powerless like I was as a child again."
"For those of you who struggle with the ""it wasn't that bad/other people had it worse"" thought",1302,ldxjfm,155,"If thinking about what happened causes fear, panic or distress, then yes, it was that bad.

If you have difficulty verbalizing what happened out of fear, embarrassment or shame, then yes, it was that bad.

If you have to rationalize it as I wasn't hit, or I was never really beaten or any other number of conditional statements, then yes, it was that bad.

The words bad and worse are very vague and allow you to move the goal posts on what is considered traumatic and how you are supposed to react.

Abuse is abuse and since no one could ever argue abuse is a good thing, then all abuse is bad. If you experienced any level or type of abuse (or neglect) that still causes you pain, then yes, it was that bad.

You are valid.

And I see you."

"So I'm reading through ""Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents"" and this passage just made me so sad for my childhood self",1299,koimcc,100,"&#x200B;

""This inconsistency means that, as parents, emotionally immature people may be either loving or detached, depending on their mood. Their children feel fleeting moments of connection with them but don’t know when or under what conditions their parent might be emotionally available again. This sets up what behavioral psychologists call an intermittent reward situation, meaning that getting a reward for your efforts is possible but completely unpredictable. This creates a tenacious resolve to keep trying to get the reward, because once in a while these efforts do pay off. In this way, parental inconsistency can be the quality that binds children most closely to their parent, as they keep hoping to get that infrequent and elusive positive response.""

Oh my god, I was a rat in a skinner box. No wonder I was miserable and confused and thought I was crazy. My father would be incredibly abusive one moment and then turn around and buy me a gift the next. I had a detailed, almost computer-like mental system of what input would yield a positive or negative response from him. It was constantly being revised because the responses would change drastically with his mood or his day, so I eventually started assuming all responses had a higher chance of being negative. I obsessively filled the role of surrogate wife and marriage counselor to him from an early, early age, because the most reliable way he would be nice to me was when he was telling me about how my mother was evil and crazy and ugly and how god put me on this planet just for him. Oh my god.

I am so angry with how gaslight-y/invalidating everything is right now,1296,lcjbcr,113,"Like what the actual frick? AOC shared her SA trauma and then shares how the insurrection triggered her even more because she thought she was going to literally DIE and people are calling her melodramatic because 'they weren't that close'. Like that is the most gaslight-y bullshit I have ever heard in my entire life.

Like when someone who dealt with yelling being a precursor to physical hears people yelling and flinches, telling them 'they weren't even yelling at you' doesn't fucking help. Telling someone that is triggered by a smell or a specific sight or event, telling them that 'oh it's not like that's what it means anymore'. Literally there were signs threatening her and saying they were looking for her but they're trying to feed her that she's being melodramatic and lying??

I get triggered by the knowledge that my ex MIGHT be in the state. The entire fricking STATE. Is he anywhere near me? NOPE. That doesn't mean jack to my PTSD. I am terrified of being found and being hurt all over again. When keys jingle a certain way I am slammed back into childhood. If a room looks too similar to something or I pass the chain name of a place where I was molested I still feel my heart squeeze so tight I think I'm going to vomit. Like you can genuinely tell who have actually faced trauma and who hasn't by their audacity to speak on this situation and tell someone 'oh it's not that bad, stop being dramatic'. But what kills me the most is how terrifying it is that so many people in the world just thinks we should 'get over it' and that we truly can't trust...anyone on a broad spectrum

Anyone else have that thing where you waste something because you’re “saving” it?,1288,gf7sby,173,"If something is “too nice” I’ve always had this complex about not deserving to use it like a normal person would. Skin care products are a big one. If someone gave me an expensive moisturizer I would let it expire and eventually dry out because I was too hesitant to use an appropriate amount, rendering the gift useless and my skin worse off. 

This morning I applied a relatively expensive sunscreen/moisturizer I was given without hesitation. When I noticed it is running low I just thought I should buy some more myself and didn’t even feel any guilt for “wasting” it on its intended person! Small victory but it meant so much to me!"
"""A person raised on Love can't handle a person raised on Survival""",1285,m68mv1,152,"I just saw this on a tiktok video-the young man went on to explain how this is with a conclusion which essentially took pride in the strength a person raised on Survival has. 

I appreciated his desire to end the video on a positive note, but I was also so very sad as well. I, and those of us on this subreddit, are strong people and we should have confidence, and self-love, in ourselves. But we also so often sabtague healthy relationships because we don't know how to change the language of love that we've been raised to instinctively act upon. 

So I'm sharing this saying here, when you find yourself with that great healthy person and are terrified, maybe you can help yourself understand what's happening by reminding yourself of this, ""A person raised on Love needs help understanding you who was raised on Survival.""


Edit- I am flabbergasted that this thing struck a cord with so many of you, in good ways for some and in bad ways for others. I wrote this as a 4am thought after trying to wake up with some tiktok laughs; I had no idea this is what Id come back to after work and a nap. I have read every single comment and I'm honestly overwhelmed with the amount of things I'd like to say to a lot of you.

 But let me clear first on what my intent for this was-the original video essentially validates that a lot of us feel unworthy of love due to the way we cope, or don't cope, with things. Yet the word ""can't handle"" made me sad because of the implied impossibility of us finding love and that we have to be ""handled"" if we want love (implying there's something we can't change because of our powerlessness). And I fundamentally reject that. We all deserve love and care, and just because your partner is from a fundamentally different background, doesn't mean we can't have that. What we must do is take more time and more kindness to ourselves and truly embrace Communication. If you have a good partner, they want to understand you so forgive yourself if you just had a panic attack, your not bad or less than or something your partner has to ""ensure"", and help them to understand where this came from (if you can) and how they can help you. 

Nothing about the original two paragraphs is validating poor, abusive, behavior. Its final sentence is a call to embrace the hope that you have the power to Help make things better for yourself and for your partner-by helping them to understand.

Personally, my SO had a super hard time understanding how different our raising was until I described the Morning Sneak and the terror of a doorknob squeeking. And for me, as a partner, I want him to understand me and I want to understand him. We've got grandkids and we are still seeking that because we love each other and doing so has made each day a... adventure. It is so nice to have that lightbulb moment which lets me appreciate even more of his depths. And it's gloriously foreign to my instincts when he has his moments with me-they remind me of just how very far I have come."
The weird contradictions that are CPTSD,1284,alodbo,52,
"just made the connection that when people say to forgive my abuser, they’re still trying to put the abuser first before myself and my needs and experiences",1279,lx55wq,140,"some people who know about my trauma have insisted that i forgive my abuser for “my own sake.” that if i forgave him, i would find peace and move on. but i wish people would acknowledge that even if this feels like the right thing to say, it completely erases the pain that *he* caused me and people are expecting me to cater to him (“for my sake”) and think of him first to solve my problems... again. me not forgiving him is HIS problem, not mine. telling me to forgive my abuser so i can move on sounds empathetic and supportive; however, i just feel like i’m being put on the back burner because, *again*, i have to change my feelings and thoughts about my experiences and the abuse that i suffered from. they just say it from a different angle that makes it sound better than it really is (and it’s something very damaging that could also be potentially re-traumatizing to someone).  

why is everything i do to try to heal always go back to problems that aren’t even mine? HE was the one that abused ME. it is not my problem or my responsibility to forgive someone who abused me. it is not my problem or responsibility. don’t try to make it my problem or responsibility.  

i know i’ll never get an apology from him and i’ve stopped waiting. he sure as hell won’t get forgiveness from me either. and fuck anyone who tries to put that pressure on me to forgive him, the person that caused me all my “problems” to begin with."
Self-abandonment could be the root cause of most of our struggles,1277,kcfs3j,127,"I think the reason why so many of us struggle with what we want, don't trust ourselves, get stuck, and feel alone is because we totally abandoned ourselves. Abandoning yourself is always a way of staying safe and it happens unconsciously. A lot of us don't live a life full of thriving and going for the things we want, we are just surviving and we strive to keep ourselves safe. A child has the choice between being authentic and being attached. Growing up healthy means you didn't have to choose between the two. You could be authentic (e.g. act out, express anger, cry, complain, etc.) but most of us had to choose between the two. Well, it was not much of a choice since a child will always choose attachment over their authenticity because to a child abandonment means death. We are wired for survival. This then becomes our default pattern in life and whenever we find ourselves in a situation where the choice between authenticity and attachment (staying safe) is presented to us, our emotions compel us to choose the latter. That's what has always kept us safe up to this point.

Growing up, a lot of us had to cut off our emotions and desires in order to survive. We couldn't express ourselves because that meant danger, so we cut off the emotions and desires at a certain point because we realized that that freedom would not be granted to us. Our emotions drive our desires and wishes. They make you excited to get up and do something. If you suffer from CPTSD, you must have buried at least one part of yourself. That's what trauma is. Not what happens to you but what happens inside of you as Gabor Maté says.

Now, why don't we trust ourselves? We first have to answer when do we not trust someone else? When we perceive them to be a threat to our safety. We don't trust ourselves because we are scared of the consequences when we do trust ourselves. When we trust ourselves, we are standing up for ourselves, for our values and people in our lives tried to push us down when we spoke up for ourselves and our opinions. Now as adults, we feel when we trust ourselves and stand up for ourselves and our opinions, we will be hurt or abandoned. It will be the exact same feeling as in childhood. Our brain tries to protect us from danger, and the biggest danger is being completely abandoned because in our history being ostracized meant death.

The feeling of being stuck is a fight within ourselves. Part of us wants to move forward but another part wants to stay. The part that wants to stay has a reason for keeping you where you are: safety. A lot of us are terrified of not being stuck, being happy, and doing what we want. Of course, we are. Looking back at our earliest moments of being happy and carefree experientially show that the usual consequence is punishment or abandonment. When we strive towards that as adults, our brains tell us that this will be dangerous and puts us back down to earth. Being miserable is preferable to being completely abandoned.

It is totally normal to feel like you want to interact with others but the form of loneliness we sometimes experience goes much deeper than a simple desire to connect. For us, it's often the feeling of abandonment which is a lot heavier than traditional loneliness. When this feeling hits us, we can easily feel like no one cares about or wants to interact with us. The reason for this is not necessarily others abandoning us but again, us abandoning ourselves. To not feel lonely we have to connect. I think we all know that we can be in a room full of people and still feel completely alone. We can only connect when we are completely authentic or rather the degree to which are authentic determines how connected we feel. When we feel defective and think that our authentic self is not good enough, we censor parts of ourselves to keep us safe from others seeing the parts of ourselves we are ashamed of. We abandon these parts of ourselves and say ""you are not worthy of being seen, you just get me into trouble"". This creates a really hostile and fragmented inner world and this breaks the cohesion within us apart more and more. After some time this can lead to total confusion and chaos within us. Of course, this is then reflected in the outside world and we don't know why things don't work out for us. It's because we split off so much within us that the 100 different parts of us want to go in a different direction. We are completely stuck and don't know what to do."
Does anyone else feel like they’re always going to get “in trouble?”,1273,jjj1uf,150,"I’m far away from my abusers, haven’t been in close contact for years but I still can’t shake that anxious feeling I’m going to get in trouble for the stupidest of things. I’ve made a few small mistakes at work lately and have been anxious/in constant fear I’m going to be called into the office for a “chat”, when in the past 99.99% of the time nothing happens. Maybe I’m fucking up on purpose as a cry for help? Maybe it’s a sign my workplace is so toxic I need to quit? Idk It’s so frustrating living with this disorder.

One of the biggest turning points was realizing that progress doesn't feel good.,1266,lzfw08,121,"Progress HURTS, especially with CPTSD. Right now, progress looks like having 10 hour somatic flashbacks, overwhelming anxiety and feeling everything during a flashback. Because Im finally feeling things in my body.

Progress looks like asking for an extension for every single assignment. Because I'm finally integrating my ""traumatized self"" and ""healthy self"" and healing my structural dissociation. Now I realize that my cPTSD is always present, not just during breakdowns, so my accommodations are valid even if I dont have obvious evidence.

 Progress looks like being paralyzed in bed bc how can I do anything after what happened to me? Because that means I'm finally accepting that bad things have happened to me.

Progress is that next wave of ~too much~ that comes even before you've mastered the last wave of ~too much~. It's that hill that comes before you've caight your breath from the last one. It's the overwhelming breakdown that shatters you so you can rebuild.

I thought that as my mental health got better, I'd be more functional and able to do my schoolwork. I was wrong. What's happened is that I'm just able to mote painful trauma work. My trauma capacity increases while my schoolwork capacity stays the same. I wish it wasn't this way, but that's just how it goes for me.

I am now dealing with another hill, and just reflecting on how during this journey I've just wanted rest. I've just wanted to exist in a manageable headspace before progress hits me on the head. What a goddamn wild ride."
"I truly cannot ""multi-task"" in life. I can't be a student and have a job. I can't regularly go to the gym and have a boyfriend. I can't eat the amount I need to and also do my chores in a day.",1268,jdiyjs,100,"I can't be more than one defining thing at a time.

I can't be a friend to my friends and have a boyfriend.

I can't go to the gym regularly and be a student. I can't be anything at the same time as another thing. 

I am on disability now for almost 2 years because I can't be reliable enough to work. I am failing at being a student because I have a boyfriend. I don't go to the gym regularly this past week because everything is so extreme.

I am scared I will end up a lonely woman who has no friends and no boyfriend because it was all too much work to maintain multiple relationships. I won't ever go anywhere but one place because committing to multiple places will be too much emotional strain."
"No wonder I have no clue who I am. I've been ""masking"" my entire life to protect myself. It's exhausting. I'm just so tired.",1268,i6nuz6,151,"TIL about ""masking,"" and you might like to too. 

From Wikipedia:

Masking is a process in which an individual changes or ""masks"" their natural personality to conform to social pressures, abuse, and/or harassment. Some examples of masking are a single overly dominant temperament, or humor, two incongruent temperaments, or displaying three of the four main temperaments within the same individual. Masking can be strongly influenced by environmental factors such as authoritarian parents, rejection, and emotional, physical, or sexual abuse. An individual may not even know they are masking because it is a behavior that can take many forms.

Each person masks their emotions differently. During one's childhood, an individual learns to behave a certain way when they receive approval from those around them and thus develops a mask. The individual is ""not conscious of the role they've adopted and is projecting outwards to people they meet"". In some cases where the individual is highly conscious, they may not know that they are wearing a mask. Wearing a mask takes away energy from a person's consciousness and, in the long run, wears out their energy.

Masking tendencies can be more obvious when a person is sick or weak, since they may no longer have the energy to maintain the mask."
"When most people don’t get enough sleep, they have an extra cup of coffee and do their job. When I don’t get enough sleep, I have vivid flashbacks that leave me struggling to function.",1267,lw6n52,99,This occurred to me today after going back to work after a week off. I got four hours of sleep last night and today I’m sitting at my desk having a personal battle while trying to do my job. Just a reminder to everyone to give yourself a little extra kindness.
"I wish I could be admitted to an in-patient rehab for C-PTSD. I just want to rest and get effective, intense, professional help. I just want to be taken care of without feeling guilty.",1257,gi9uqw,182,"I wish I could go away for a couple of months and really kick-start my recovery.  
I wish I could be admitted to an in-patient rehab, where all the resources I need are provided. There would be trauma informed psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, occupational therapists, physio therapists, dietists etc.   
I wish you would be served 3, healthy and nutritious meals a day without having to cook it yourself.   
I wish there would be group therapy as well as individual sessions.  
I wish there would be animals and beautiful nature.   
I wish there would be someone that would hold me accountable for dissociating all the time and someone forcing me to start exercising in a healthy way.   
I wish they would take care of me so that I could focus on therapy and recovery.   
I wish there was help, compassion and understanding.  
I wish that every patient would get an daily agenda related to different forms of therapy and recovery.   
I wish there would be other patients that I could relate to and form life-long friendships with.   
I wish this was something that we all could have access to.   


I wish this wasn't just a unattainable dream.

"Had my hearing. He called me a liar but I fucking won $10,000",1259,fl4u02,116,"I had a teleconference hearing through victim services yesterday. I waited 10 months for this. I filed the application, going over every detail of the abuse. I got and then sent in counsellor, doctor and psychiatrist letters. There was so much paperwork for my 5 abusers. 

The adjudicator himself was domineering, rude, loud, condescending and invalidating. He told me over and over and over ""you're stretching your imagination"" when I told him how I was abused. He spoke over me and brought up how tax payers would have to pay for me. He asked about irrelevant things and said my mother's abuse was just her bathing me despite none of it occurring in a bathtub. It was 1.5 hours long. 

I cried so much. 

He delayed reading his verdict. It was like being on The Bachelor where they take long pauses to build suspense. He was infuriating. 

But I got over 10 grand. Every single moment of pain was worth it. Every time he called me a liar was worth it. I can get counselling. I can have medication. I can be more than one month away from homelessness. 

I won. I fucking won."
"Funny how my ""severe treatment resistant schizophrenia"" vanished once I'm living somewhere with a modicum of physical and emotional safety. I want to share many miracles and successes. [TW: brief mention of CSA]",1255,ho5rqb,49,"I lived under sexual, physical, and emotional abuse for the first two decades of my life. I'm 20 now, and just moved out from either of my parents' homes. Whenever I protested the BS my mom would have me committed to psych wards for months on end. These were due to legitimate dysfunction, but I just needed someone to listen to me. I was given electroshock. 16 fucking times. My dad got me addicted to intravenous methamphetamine and morphine while I was living with him. Once I got clean, I ended up homeless because I had enough. best friend of 12 years and his mother got me up to their house in a separate state. I had been doing Lacanian psychoanalysis which offered me a way out of chronic psychosis. 

I feel like I've woken up from a dream. I love my best friend and his mom. I expressed in every way that I won't be a burden, but they are totally building a home for me in ways that strike me with their kindness. I owe them an unpayable debt, and I am so incommensurately grateful. I have left the spinning circles of inferno in my mind that I mapped out to cope with the horror I endured, and have taken up life in the world. I am trying to commit to the world and all its imperfections.

Through it all I am so grateful for the multitude of loved ones (friends, or surrogate family) that have stayed with me. The community college here, which I start in the fall, goes all the way up to Bachelor's. And I am going back to my old workplace. I am giving up the lost possibility of a childhood where I am not raped and beaten because I trust deeply that the universe is fundamentally good, even miraculous.

Thanks all for listening."
My heart goes out to Asian Americans suffering right now,1251,m7su4i,95,"I’m an Asian American, and the shooting in Georgia on Tuesday has brought out a lot of anger for me. I want to show my support and provide a safe post to vent on for any fellow Asians in this sub. Please share your experiences and feelings if you’re comfortable.

Growing up it was like I was too Asian to be accepted as a “real” American even though the United States is the only home I know. I was the only non-white kid in my class so by the time I met other Asians my age, it was like I was too white to hang out with them. All this anti-Asian violence that’s been escalating since the start of the pandemic and culminating in this shooting has really brought out my feelings of being an outsider. If anyone else is feeling like this, please know you’re not alone."
Does anyone else feel like CPTSD makes you feel both unemotional and extremely emotionally volatile at the same time?,1247,m9gmhq,97,"It takes a lot to make me cry. I feel mostly unemotional a lot of the time. 

But also, when I do get into a place where I’m upset it’s really bad and I’ll be bad for a while. Whether it’s something triggers flashbacks or loss of a friend or something, it lasts a long time and I can’t deal with it.

Edit: thank you for all your responses. It’s really validating to hear that we’re not alone."
I realized something today.,1246,kwyrdt,317,"My entire personality is CPTSD.  I am a mental illness in a trenchcoat.

My uncanny empathy is just there to predict what others will do so I can get ahead of them being angry and hurting me.

My lavish attention on friends is really a veiled effort to fawn like a fucking deer so I build up social credit and make it less likely they hurt me.

The way I am the guy who will bend over backwards to help is just so I can be so busy with other people I don't have to look in the fucking mirror for even a second.

I could go on but you get it.  I'm not even a real human being.  I'm just a walking defense mechanism.



Edit: I just wanted to thank every person who responded.  I really do appreciate your time, stories, resources, and insight.  I don't feel ""better"", but I do feel less alone."
My therapist cried today.,1245,k0u3qu,73,"Because of social distancing guidelines, I’ve been doing all of my therapy through phone calls with my therapist. Today I was having a really hard session because I was recalling really traumatic memories. I cried pretty heavily through the entire thing and was trying to explain that I’ve never had any happy memories after around age 11. Everything after was just pain and complete, genuine terror. 

My therapist was telling me that he understands that remembering all this stuff is painful for me and then he said “I’m even crying right now just because I can hear how painful it is for you in your voice” and I immediately started crying again. The kind of sobbing where it starts with a silent scream. 

I’ve never had anyone ever care about how I feel like this. I’ve never ever had anyone do anything but diminish my experiences, gaslight me about them, berate me or try to change the subject. Nobody that’s ever fully understood what I’ve experienced and how devastating and excruciating it is every day to wake up and carry it with me in my chest, every single day. Nobody who’s ever been able to fully understand the magnitude of it.

I’ve always had a hard time crying in front of anyone, including him. I’ve been in therapy with him for almost two years and I finally told him specifics today, instead of talking in generalizations. And today we cried together. He told me that what my mother did to me was horrific. And that what I’m feeling is natural, and that what happened to me wasn’t fair, but that I survived and I am safe now. 

I can’t stop crying.

EDIT: hi, folks. Thank you all so much for your comments, I’m feeling really overwhelmed with all the care and support and it feels good. Sorry I posted and ghosted!! I cried myself to sleep for the first time since I was a kid. Which was really cathartic but also exhausting. Still feeling super super tired and exhausted so I probably won’t be around to respond to anyone here still for a bit but I wanted to give and update and let you all know that I did get to read over all of your encouraging words for me and I’m so happy that we built this community for ourselves out of our pain. We all deserve to be validated and cared about this way."
You can’t properly heal your trauma while you’re still being actively traumatized.,1248,mkefrj,107,"I had this epiphany today while I was thinking about my trauma.

EDIT: Wow, I didn’t expect to get so many responses! Thanks everyone for sharing your own thoughts and experiences. 

Here’s a little backstory of how I came to this conclusion. I’ve been in counseling for three years, I haven’t lived at home with my parents for several years, and I’m married to a loving, supportive husband. And yet, I’m still struggling with my trauma far more than I would like after three years of therapy. I’ve been feeling incredibly discouraged and like there is something wrong with me. And while I have been NC with my narcissistic mother for months, I have a close relationship with my dad and it’s very difficult to navigate since he’s still married to my abusive mother. 

I realized yesterday after talking to a friend that my on-and-off relationship with my mother over the past three years, combined with hearing about her abusive behavior towards my dad from him (I know I need to set firmer boundaries with him about this, I’m working on it) have really stunted my progress in therapy and healing. Even though I’m not physically in that environment anymore, continually hearing about the abuse is triggering and prevents me from feeling completely safe, even though I am living in a safe environment. I need to reevaluate my boundaries and do what I can to further distance myself from this situation so I can actually begin to move on from it. 

My heart goes out to all of you that are still struggling with trauma too. Sometimes it feels like an uphill battle, but no matter how bad things are, there’s always hope. I wish you all the very best!"
I was a child,1243,ib5ilx,60,"""You never take responsibility for anything.""
Because I was not responsible. I was a child, you were an adult you were responsible. 
I never took responsibility for what? 
For being abused?
For being loud? For breaking things? For not understanding? For wanting attention? For your anger? For your faults?
I never took responsibility for my emotions? 
I was a child you were an adult you were responsible.
When I was uncomfortable(nothing's wrong)
When i was sad (you just want attention)
When I was angry (your being unreasonable)
Children are unreasonable, children need attention...
I never took responsibility for my actions?
I put holes in the walls? (I punched and kicked and screamed and yelled out my abuse)
I spent your money? (I just wanted to get out of the house for a little while longer)
I ruined your life? (I was a child. You were an adult. You ruined your life.)
I'm a liar? I'm crazy? I'm abusive? 
I have been saying the same things for years. My story never changed. 
Reactions to abuse are not the same thing as abuse.
I was a child. You were an adult, you were responsible.

"Stop trying to convince me to have a baby, I CAN'T HAVE ONE",1229,mavgo5,186,"Update: well, I sent my friend a message and took her a while to reply. She apologized and said she would be more careful about this subject. I was happy and thought we were good. We live in the same complex of apartments, but different buildings, so sometimes we ran into each other when walking the dogs. So I was walking my dog and saw her boyfriend, I gave him a hi and he approached me and started to tell me how much I hurted my friend's feelings and if I hate kids and don't want to have any, I should stay away from them. So yeah... I had a bad week. 


I almost lost it when my pregnant friend (that knows about my condition) lectured me about why I shouldn't wait to have a kid. I started to dissociate until she left and I could cry and feel something. I'm being responsible here, just because I'm fertile, doesn't mean I can be a parent. It's not my fucking choice. My family has a lot of mental issues, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, you name it. I'm not emotional or financially stable. I rely on medications that aren't allowed for pregnant women. I have great days, but I also have bad days. What will I tell my baby? ""Sorry, sweetie, mom won't feed you today because I can't get out of bed, I'm sure you understand it!"". After all, I went through with my parents, I don't want to be a parent as well, I'll fuck up.


Edit: Wow, I didn't expect so much love and support. Thank you, I'm reading all comments and trying to reply to everyone. I'm feeling so much better about my decision. I'll text my friend later and I'll update here. Lots of love ❤️"
"Never actually an introvert, just a traumatized kid who felt safer alone.",1233,hlf2tz,127,"I've had this thought before, but sitting here alone, and lonely, it is hitting me again. Even though most of my life I thought of myself as an introvert, I think I've come to the conclusion that I was actually a closet extrovert. 

Fear, shame and necessity drove me to finding more comfort in solitude than in the company of other humans. Even though I needed them so much.  

How sad. 

I'm kind of having a pity party lately. Trying to grieve my lonely childhood...and get past it.

EDIT: Wow, this got a lot more attention than I expected, which was honestly zero. Just a random thought I cast out into the universe. I'm glad this post and the conversations it prompted have made so many people feel less alone. Introverts or extroverts, doesn't matter, you are all completely amazing. I love you."

How do you deal with realizing you could’ve been really successful in life if you didn’t have all the damn trauma?,1229,j7nviy,263,"Currently looking back at my life and struggling to let go of the grief associated with who I  could have been if I didn’t experience all the trauma I did. I struggle with this and it goes away and comes back. Does it ever stop completely? There’s some opportunities that were literally taken in traumatic situations, not to mention all the ones lost to mental illness caused by the trauma. How do you let go of the life you could’ve had and I don’t mean the dream childhood I mean the constant symptoms of complex trauma and all the things having this fucks things up and will continue on fucking up in the future?"
Mind blown in therapy,1224,gqztcw,149,"I'm still recovering from what I just learned. I was catching up with my therapist and talking about how now things are going pretty well, more constant than anything (which is nice), and I said, ""I'm gonna ride it as long as it lasts until that shoe drops again.""  Normal thought, right? Things are good but they will inevitably go to hell, that's how life is. 

The conversation continued and she mentioned that yes, life ebbs and flows, there's lows and highs, but the lows usually aren't catastrophic. Okay, I get that, but there will come a day when it is catastrophic. 

""That's a trauma response. People aren't generally walking around in full body armor waiting for an ambush.""  The hell? But.... no one expects the Spanish Inquisition (I actually said that to her, which made her laugh).  Why \*wouldn't\* they? I just sat there and fought to form actual words and thoughts while my mind was just spinning.  

While sputtering she continued. ""You're aware of that now. Take it home, sit on it, reflect on it. I am not expecting you to accept it right away, and I'm not asking you to take your armor off because you are not ready. But think about it and remind yourself that you are safe now."" 

I needed to get this out to try to make some sense of it because honestly, I can't understand why people aren't emotionally ready for an ambush. In my life, the moment I am not ready, it happens. I don't want to not be ready. I can't grasp that people are okay with not being ready."

No one saw. No one helped. I tried to call the children's helpline several times but every time the call went through my throat closed up and I couldn't speak. I just cried. Neighbors didn't notice or care about the crying, red-eyed child walking around aimlessly outside in just underpants and a T-shirt. No one batted an eye all those times I came to school disheveled, a sobbing mess. I didn't say ""I hate my parents"" because I was an angsty teen - I genuinely did, and I still do. No one believed me when I told them it was bad, because how bad can words be? I honestly found it hard to understand too, just how bad it was. I had no marks to show, just tears and a broken heart.

Guess what, parents.

I counted down the years, then the days, then the hours. When I grew old enough to move out, I moved out immediately, just like you had hoped for all those years. I didn't just move out, I moved far, far away and started a new life away from you.

Now, at best they get to hear my voice once every few weeks if I feel like calling. They get to wonder what they did wrong, and why I told them they failed as parents before I left. Because to them, emotional abuse isn't a thing, and no family is perfect, and how dare I call them abusive, don't I know I hurt *their* feelings with such a strong word? They never did anything wrong, it's all in my head. It either didn't happen or they don't remember it.

Guess what? You're wrong.

You spent 18 years hurting my feelings as if it was a sport.

You should have been my supporters, my safe space, my family.

Before I moved out, you begged me to leave. Now that I'm gone, you say you miss me, acting all sweet and innocent as if none of this happened. Now, you suddenly respect me like a human being, realizing that you have no power over me anymore. Now, I'm living a better life, trying to find myself again, learning what a real family is like. Seeing me live a happy life without you in it must only confirm your fears - that I wasn't the problem, it was you. You destroyed your family. You ruined your marriage.

You hurt me.

I was just a kid.

Now I am the one who hates you.

And I wonder why I even bother calling.

If I have children, I swear to love them and tell them that every single day. I swear to make their home a loving and safe place. I swear to help them thrive and grow into their own person. I swear to support them, to hug them, and to be the good parent I never had. I swear to be proud of my children and hope that someday my children will be proud of me, too."
do you ever feel like sometimes the reason you hold on so tightly to your pain is because it’s the only thing that “proves” what happened to you was real?,1218,k1a181,100,
My therapist undid years of work on my own in one session. I’m heartbroken and disenchanted.,1219,liab0s,175,"I finally found a therapist and have been seeing her weekly for about a month and a half. She kept praising me for being so stoic and put together and praised my extreme compartmentalizations as a “talent”. My session yesterday I finally felt comfortable to be expressive instead of my studied, calm, trauma response voice. I spoke with passion and inflection. I allowed myself to cry and to voice that I felt lost and stupid for getting caught on simple road blocks due to my trauma. I barely scratched the surface of the pile of trauma I have been working through alone for a few years after past negative therapy experiences. I cried for the life I could have had. Her response was to say my options were do an intensive expensive outpatient program I can’t afford that would “teach me to regulate my emotions” or to get on anti depressants, that’s it. I instantly shut down. I feel so invalidated that the one time I expressed any emotion it was dismissed and instantly just too much to deal with. I wasn’t hysterical by any means, just finally not wearing my mask of fawning and calm. It’s 5:30 am, I should be sleeping but I’m laying in bed having flashbacks to abuse I haven’t had in years. I feel completely derailed and like giving up. I’m trying so hard to live but any time I show life people react poorly. She triggered me and I am so lost and feel so unsteady.

Edit: Holy shit I did not expect this many responses. I am heartbroken to know so many of us have shared this experience. I wanted to say THANK YOU to everyone who commented with their own stories and advice. Most importantly thank you for understanding, for sharing with me and for validating that emotions are not wrong. It’s been a long journey that had already included EMDR, CBT, antidepressants, etc. Most of my healing has come from my own work with journaling and meditation, I sought out a therapist because I had gotten to a point where my mind was unpacking all that trauma and needed someone to help me sift through it and help guide me away from the negative thoughts surrounding it. It was extremely triggering to instantly be shut down (her body language and tone of voice also changed significantly) because I have spent my entire life being told I’m “too much” anytime I express any emotions. I have done a lot of work to be able to not be a shell, to be able to express what I’m feeling and she destroyed that (mind you I know it’s only temporarily) in 30 minutes. What started as anger and feeling hopeless has grown into a drive to do better. Seeing all the responses I am even more determined to go back to school to be able to help others not feel this sting. You are all beautiful souls and I hope everyone takes a second to recognize their own power and strength. Again, Thank you from
The bottom of my heart (and now I’m ugly crying, It’s amazing!)"
wanted to say thanks to you guys and give a crab analogy.,1215,cn52yc,187,"
just bear with me, okay lol

I have kept my crab analogy close to me for years but had forgotten about it until I was ranting in therapy Monday.  My therapist really loved the analogy and seemed genuinely touched by it.  I never know how to say thanks to a group of people that makes me feel more at ease and less alone, but offering something like this seems as good as anything else.  So, preface--you guys are amazing and I can't thank you enough for your support.  

So crabs, yeah.  I've raised crabs around 14 years now (go ahead and laugh) both hermit crabs and a few other varieties.  They're delicate, sensitive, need specific habitat and food requirements, and are mostly vastly misunderstood.  Another rant for another day.

But the analogy starts by comparing another human/animal growth parallel: humans and butterflies.

I've always thought it was a terrible comparison.  Butterflies are caterpillars and then mold into goo and then emerge as beautiful butterflies only to die shortly thereafter.  Where's the parable?  Seems unnecessary.  And linear and short and not at all like my life.  Unless I am in chrysalis literally forever, because a lot of the times it does feel like dark goo and not much else.  

Crabs, however...take a crab.  He's got a hard shell for protection and it above all else serves to keep his soft mushy body safe.  But what happens as a crab grows?  The same shell that protects it constricts it.  Parts of his leggies might fall off from stress--either poor diet, or lack of food, or a billion other stressors.  Parts of the shell can become deformed from birth or the previous molt.  He might have broken off another leg or two to get away from a predator. 

This badass crab is being squished in his hard, brittle shell.  His leg hairs are almost gone, the bright color on his carapace has turned dim and grey, and most importantly, he needs to keep growing, so what does he do?  Digs underground or goes into a dark place and literally bursts out of the shell.  It's not a slow, steady growing.  It's painful and dangerous and quite honestly really ugly to see.  

But that's not even the best part.  This shell is full of what he needs to survive.  (Calcium and magnesium among other things)  It will strengthen his mushy body and assist his new shell in hardening quickly. 

This shell that has served him so well until he needed to grow now has another purpose.  The crab will eat the shell for sustenance.  Most crabs *only* need to eat the shell while molting; they don't need anything but themselves, literally.  And this violent growth helps with any leftover wounds.

Any leggies that have been shed will regrow.  Any claw deformities will correct.  

A few days of sitting in the dark and this crab emerges with a radiant new shell.  His leggy hairs are stupendous.  All limbs intact and strong, and *bigger and better.*  What a transformation.  

And the crab just keeps doing this, over and over, his whole life.  

Growth isn't a one time butterfly thing, and thank god, because how boring and cliche.  We all have multiple shells and we will all outgrow them and that's okay.  You don't have to shed and discard the old shell.  Eat it and use it to strengthen you from the inside out.  It's all still you, you are in charge.  

When people tell you to let go of the past, pinch them, and then eat your past shell and take its nourishment.  Don't ever let go of what you don't want to let go of, and make sure what you keep has nutritional value--most of it does, even if it tastes terrible, like old claw.  

What I'm trying to say here is thank you for all that you do to help me.  Your posts are more valuable to me than just about anything.  I'm happy to be a crab among you all.

**edit: wow! gold! thanks guys!  I'm so glad you feel empowered by this, that's seriously great for me to hear.  I never thought I'd ever say anything eloquent, and lo and behold, it's about crabs when I do.  I'll post a photo in a bit when I am off work.**

**edit edit: I'll get the pics tonight hahaha. My crabs thank u. Also this whole philosophy can be summed up by the amazing Joshua Graham (Fallout: New Vegas) ""For many of us, the road is a difficult one. But the path is always there for us to follow, no matter how many times we may fall."" **

HOLY SHIT PLATINUM WHAT EVEN YOU GUYS"
"""Your anger is the part of you that knows your mistreatment and abuse are unacceptable. Your anger knows you deserve to be treated well, and with kindness. Your anger is a part of you that LOVES you.""",1208,h8k77z,115,"This quote  from a person's therapist has been making the rounds as a twitter screenshot among my friends today, and it hit me like a ton of bricks.

I find Anger to be so, so important.

What are your thoughts?"
Brushing my hair doesn't need to hurt? Washing my face doesn't need almost-scalding water??,1212,m13jx8,182,"My parents are SHIT at physical self care, and it took me YEARS to rewire my habits.

I learned to brush my hair from my dad, who viewed it as an inconvenience and would scrape it all back into a tight ponytail for school. My blonde hair was almost white at the time, and this ponytail made me look bald. I compared myself to my classmates, who had cute butterfly clips and scrunchies.  
\[In the past year, I learned to brush from the tips and work up to the roots. Who knew my scalp didn't have to hurt? And I have a selection of hairclips - from classy gold bars to kiddy clips with animals on them.\]

Their approach to skincare was 'hot water and bar soap'. No fancy 'nampy-pamby' cleansers and other nonsense! My teenage acne never stood a chance - I would use super hot water and strip away all my facial oils, then be frustrated when my acne got worse.   
\[In the past six months, I've finally found a cleanser and moisturiser that works for my oily skin. I don't wash it three or four times a day any more to strip away the 'disgusting' oil - it's just my skin looking after itself. And I drink hella water and eat nutritious foods to help my skin, too.\]

Growing up, baths were a luxury. And if I spent more than five minutes in the shower, the hot water would be turned off at the boiler and my shower would suddenly turn freezing. (I mean, how shallow is your sense of self confidence if you're stood in the kitchen listening to and timing your daughter showering? Never thinking 'hmm, maybe I'm being too controlling'.)

\[But now? Bitch I love my baths. I have bath bombs, cute bubble baths, face masks and even bath toys. I put on music and sometimes light a candle. And I have fluffy towels, not bleach-stained thin raggedy ones. Because I deserve nice things. I don't have to torture my body.\]

&#x200B;

I know the above things are common for children of toxic parents - that lack of physical self care. As if your body's needs are a burden and you shouldn't treat yourself nicely. 

I have a hypothesis that such parents, wrapped up in their own unresolved childhood trauma and lack of fulfilment, feel unconsciously that THEY don't deserve luxuries. Their inner sense of toxic shame won't allow it. And they teach that to their children. Because why should anyone else be allowed nice things, if they themselves can't have them??"
I gave my daughter something my mom didn't give me and my inner child is thankful me,1208,djosr5,90,"It's picture day at the elementary school. I carefully arranged my daughter's hair in a ponytail with twists that I thought was pretty cute.

She hated it.

She pulled out her ponytail holder and tried to style her hair differently, but she clearly needed help. (I've been trying to help her learn to how to care for own very thick, mid-back length hair but she's not ready yet).

So I calmly escorted her to the bathroom mirror and asked her how she wanted her hair done. 

Her brother was ready and wanted to rush her. Her dad kept saying ""It looks fine!""

I told him, ""You don't get to decide that. It's her hair and it's fine when she likes it and when she feels good about it.""

I gave her a hairstyle she liked. Then she asked if she could wear lipstick today. I said sure. It's a subtle shade very close to her natural lip color and she always feels pretty and special when she gets to wear it. 

She kept looking and smiling at herself in her little mirror the whole time I drove her to school. She had a little bounce in her step as she exited the car, blew me a kiss, and said ""I love you Mommy!""

**cranky old timer voice** ""Back in MY day""

1. When my mom gave me a hairstyle I didn't like, let's just say that by the time I was my daughter's age I already ""knew better"" than to protest -- even politely! I already knew at this point that no matter how many speeches I practiced in my room, rephrasing, adjusting my vocal inflection, etc, I would *never* be able to disagree with my mom politely enough nor respectfully enough to avoid her wrath. I had already learned to shut up and take whatever, real quick.

2. Lipstick? Yeah, even as an 18 year high schooler I would have been scared to ask about makeup. 

I didn't even get to play with makeup for fun at home or with friends the way I heard that most girls do at sleepovers.  

I was a grown-ass 21 year old college student when my friend bought me a cute little black dress and tried to get me to wear lipstick and I panicked, y'all. 

I let babygirl play around with makeup at home and wear a little lipstick for special occasions.

3. ""Oh, you think you look cute."" Or ""You trying to be cute."" That was always said to me in the nastiest, most judgmental tone. My mom couldn't stand to see me happy with myself. I used to believe her pretense, that if I could just ""get my act together"" then I could earn the right to feel pretty. But now I know better. What I mean by her pretense is stuff like,

""While you prancin' round in front of the mirror thinkin you cute you need to be cleaning your nasty room"" 
  or
""The same way you grinning at your little earrings is the same way you need to be grinning when I tell you to wash the dishes. Look at you. Bet you ain't grinning now.""

I was never free to truly like the way I looked or god forbid actually cultivate my beauty and femininity.
 Yet when I was too depressed to practice impeccable hygiene I got railed on for ""walking out the house looking and smelling any old kind of way.""

My daughter walked out of the house this morning looking and feeling pretty on her terms, knowing that her mom likes for her to feel pretty. My daughter knows that even though she doesn't maintain her own hair, it's still HER hair and she most definitely gets a vote on how she gets to wear it. My daughter knows that it's safe have feelings around me. It is safe to have her own opinion about what she should with her own body.  My daughter knows that when she smiles at herself in the mirror, I smile too.

While my daughter is at school today, my inner child is inside my head wearing her hair down in ringlets with a satin headband, twirling around in a pretty dress, wearing a sheer shimmery lipgloss and singing ""I feel pretty! Oh so pretty!""😊"
All of the people in this subreddit are intelligent,1202,jmduly,210,"I have never seen an average person as smart as the people in this subreddit; reading the posts I can easily see everyone displaying an extreme sense of self-awareness, which is quite rare in the real world. I can see emotionally literate people all over the place, which is also quite rare. I can also see psychology, politics and philosophy educated people.

There is no way that the people here are average, an average person can't be this self-aware, emotionally literate and educated.

does anyone spend hours imagining conversations with your parents where you actually stand up to them and tell them tell them they're wrong about everything,1205,j34kgb,142,im very interested in hearing your thoughts if your comfortable sharing

"Of course non-traumatized people will never truly understand how we feel, they will never be able to comprehend the visceral pain of living but never being allowed to exist as your true self",1206,kt1p9g,115,"Because for some of us that true self was never even allowed to exist to begin with, the supression and erradication of who we were meant to be started as soon as the though of us were born.

Who else has mastered the skill of sobbing silently?,1201,k7ch3b,151,"I’m just laying in my bed, crying about a lot of different things, and realizing that I do everything I can to make sure no one else in my house can hear me cry. It’s a hard thing to actually accomplish, especially with those huge sobs. It’s like, holding in your breath and letting the emotional release come out in the form of shaking. It’s probably not the best way to do it (I always get a headache afterward) but I’d rather do it that way than for my roommates to figure out I’ve been crying.

I’ve also been waiting for my roommates to clear from the living areas so I can dart into the bathroom to take a shower and hopefully make myself look like I haven’t been crying.

I know WHY I learned that I need to hide my emotions, it’s just weird that I still do it even as an adult woman living independently from family."
Trauma is the real gateway.,1202,di6zvl,191,"Things like cannabis, caffeine and alcohol are not the gateways. Things like molestation, childhood abuse, neglect and TRAUMA are the real gateways. These things manifest into addiction, hyper sexuality, violent tendencies, self harm etc. All of these things are the SYMPTOMS not the cause of a much larger issue. All of these manifestations stem from some sort of emotional trauma or childhood abuse. This is why traditional 30 day rehabs and medications don't typically work. We need to get to the root cause of the trauma that leads so many to look outside of themselves for relief from SELF.

Addiction is manifested in any behavior that brings temporary relief or pleasure yet causes negative consequences. This behavior is then difficulty to give up. We need to realize that addiction is not a CHOICE, addiction is not an inherited disease. Addiction is a physiological and psychological response to a painful life experience. 

I think so many can agree, if able to put their egos aside, that many people have dealt with some sort of traumatic experience. Maybe not as extreme as something like sexual assault, but maybe growing up in a toxic household around parents who yelled and were always stressed or even depressed. Trauma doesnt have to be so significant it can be anything that our bodies/minds (especially when children) cannot comprehend or process. These past experiences subconsciously manifest in creating barriers or walls to protect ourselves. When we become adults they really reek havoc and manifest in all types of issues as noted above. I'm sure many of us can also agree we have at one time or another had some sort of addiction behavior whether it be, overworking, shopping, unhealthy/over eating, gambling, sex, drama, codependent relationships, etc.. We need to come together and stop judging one another. We need to stop bandaging our issues and get to the root cause, the root trauma and reach out for help when needed. This is a sign of strength not weakness. Trauma can also store in our physical bodies which can also manifest into sickness and disease, making us more at risk for cancers and things like autoimmune disease.

TRAUMA is the real gateway."
Anyone else have a whole days where functioning is impossible?,1200,l4ydrq,136,"Crying, feeling confused, can’t organize my thoughts, chronic pain on blast- I did have an argument last night with my husband that ended in me having a meltdown so I’m very tired today and feeling worn out. Do you ever have a whole day where you’re sort of a blob of symptoms and can’t behave even slightly normal? And I feel so lonely as well. Like “hey I’m so traumatized I can’t take a shower or eat or do anything other than cry and dissociate, how are you?” Not exactly a great conversation starter so I don’t reach out to anyone."
On one of my last posts a few people commented about how they struggled with learning to cook as adults. I thought about linking some recipes and then realized that a lot of recipes presume some level of knowledge. So I decided to write out my own recipes with detailed instructions.,1197,k32nyp,141,"&#x200B;

I have a few simple how-tos that recipes might not give you along with a couple recipes and then a few dessert recipes! :) If there’s a favorite food or kind of food you like that you’d like a recipe for, let me know and I’ll try and see if I have one!

First, here are a few things that recipes tend to assume you learned but that’s not always the case:

Boiling pasta:

So, to boil pasta you’re going to want to fill a pot mostly full of water and sprinkle in a bit of salt. Then put the pot on the stove and turn the stove top to the hottest setting. Wait for the pot to boil (you can tell by when it starts bubbling) and then put in your pasta. If you plan to put sauce on it, cook it to one minute under what the “al dente” time is on the box. Be sure to be careful when you’re straining the cooked pasta since it’ll be super hot. If you’re not serving it immediately, put some butter or oil (a vegetable oil) on the pasta to keep it from sticking.

Carmelizing/sauteing onions/garlic/spinach:

A lot of savory recipes are going to tell you to saute onions, garlic, spinach, or similar things. It’s a great way to bring out the flavor in these foods and it’s relatively simple to do.

1. Put a bit of oil or butter in a frying pan on the stove. Turn the stove to medium heat.
2. Melt the butter or wait for the oil to heat a bit. Then put your garlic/onion/spinach onto the pan.
   1. Some recipes will say how it’s so wrong to use pre-chopped onions or garlic. It’s not wrong. It’s still tasty and it’s much less time consuming (and less painful to your eyeballs!) than chopping garlic or onions is.
3. Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper to the mixture.
   1. If you’re doing onions or garlic, you’ll probably be adding that to another dish so you don’t need much more seasoning
   2. If you’re making spinach, you can stick with salt and pepper or you can add more seasoning. I personally like garlic powder, onion powder, rosemary, and a bit of parmesan cheese
4. Use a wooden spoon to move whatever you’re sauteing back and forth and around in the pan.
5. For garlic and onions, you’ll know when they’re done by the aroma. For garlic, it should be fragrant and the garlic should be lightly browned. For onions, they should be soft and the smell should be sweet. For spinach, you’ll be able to tell when the spinach has somehow shrunk down \*much smaller than is reasonable\* and it’s a darker green and more limp.

Eggs:

Eggs are a staple kind of food to make but sometimes it’s hard to find good recipes! Here are a few go-to egg recipes:

Scrambled eggs:

1. Crack as many eggs as you’d like into a bowl.
2. Pour in about one teaspoon per egg of heavy cream/half and half/milk
3. Sprinkle in a bit of salt and a bit of pepper
4. If you’d like, add in some lightly carmelized onions, garlic powder, or other seasonings
5. Lightly butter or add oil to a frying pan
6. Put the pan on the stove on medium heat
7. Whisk the egg mixture with a fork or whisk until combined
8. Pour into frying pan
9. Use a wooden spoon to move the scrambled eggs around until cooked to your liking

Fried eggs:

1. Lightly butter or add oil to a frying pan
2. Put it on the stove at medium heat and let it heat up a bit
3. Crack an egg onto the pan
4. Add salt and pepper to taste
5. Add onions of other seasoning if you’d like them
6. Fry the egg until the bottom is opaque white and starting to brown slightly
7. Slide a spatula under the egg and flip it
8. If the egg breaks, that’s okay!
9. Cook the other side until it reaches the desired doneness

Poached eggs, for when you want to be fancy:

1. Boil water with a bit of salt
2. Once the water is boiling, turn down the heat a little
3. Crack eggs into small bowls, one bowl per egg
4. Take a wooden spoon and stir the water in a circular motion
5. Pour the eggs into the water one at a time
6. Cook for four minutes, longer if you want the yolk to be less runny
7. Take a slotted spoon and scoop out each egg, letting the water drain
8. Season with whatever seasons make your heart smile

Now, a few recipes:

Roasted broccoli:

The broccoli can be substituted for cauliflower if you’d like! Or you can mix them together!

1. Preheat your oven to 400F
2. Melt some butter on the bottom of a baking pan
3. If you have whole broccoli heads, chop them into your preferred size
4. Put them into the pan with the melted butter
5. Sprinkle on salt and pepper along with some rosemary, basil, and garlic and onion powder (the spices can be removed or substituted if you don’t like them or don’t have them)
6. Add some onions and garlic (raw or carmelized)
7. Sprinkle on a bit of cheese if you’d like. I’d recommend parmesan
8. Add purple grapes if you want a sweet and salty combination
9. Mix them all together in the baking pan
10. Bake for 10 minute increments in the oven, adding a bit of butter and salt at each increment. Stop when you can put a knife into the broccoli relatively easily

Spinach and cheese galettes:

This looks beautiful but is relatively simple!

1. Preheat an oven to 350F
2. Take pie crust (you can use refrigerated pie crust, I always do) and spread it out on a baking sheet
3. Put raw spinach on the pie crust
4. Put on some mozzarella cheese
5. Put on some parmesan cheese
6. Chop some baby tomatoes in half and sprinkle them on
7. Add some sauteed onions and garlic
8. Sprinkle on some salt, pepper, and rosemary
9. Fold the pie crust so that it contains the mixture
10. Brush the crust with an egg wash
   1. To make the egg wash:
      1. Crack an egg into a bowl
      2. Add in a sprinkle of salt
      3. Add in a bit of heavy cream or milk
      4. Whisk with a fork
11. Bake until the crust is crispy, try 15 minutes to start and then 7 minute increments after

Vodka sauce pasta:

You can remove the vodka if you don’t want any, the alcohol cooks off but I can understand not wanting any in your food!

1. Boil your pasta and set the cooked pasta aside
2. Add some butter to the bottom of a sauce pan
3. Saute one chopped yellow onion until soft but not browned. Saute 3 cloves of garlic with the onions
4. Add 1/4th a cup of vodka
5. Add one can (4 1/2oz) of tomato paste. Cook until the tomato paste is fragrant
6. Add 14 1/2 oz of crushed tomatoes. Mix together with the mixture and let roast for a few minutes (maybe 10 or so, but this part can be skipped if you’re under a time constraint)
7. Add 1 cup of heavy cream and mix together
8. Add ½ a cup of parmesan cheese (or more, if you’d like to!) and mix until the cheese is melted
9. Mix in a blender if you’d like it to be super smooth, but this isn’t needed
10. Put the pasta into the sauce or vice versa and cook over medium heat for two minutes
11. Sprinkle with cheese and serve!

Now, for some dessert :D 

Bread pudding:

It’s like baked french toast!

1. Preheat oven to 350F
2. Take brioche bread or challah bread and cube it (cut slices and then cut each slice into smaller cubes). Fill your desired size of baking pan with bread cubes.
3. Add chocolate chips if you want to 
4. On the stovetop, heat together 2 cups of milk or heavy cream, ¼ a stick of butter, 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract, ⅓ a cup of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a sprinkle of cinnamon until the butter is melted
5. Take the mixture off the oven and let cool
6. Put 2 eggs in a bowl and whisk with a fork
7. When the milk mixture has cooled, add the eggs to the milk mixture
8. Pour the mixture over the egg cubes
9. Bake for 30-45 minutes, until the custard is set but a little wobbly
10. It tastes great served with fruit or sweetened condensed milk (or both)

Please let me know if there are any other recipes you'd like to see! My best advice for cooking is that even if you mess up, that's okay. Maybe you've discovered a new, tastier thing! And even if you didn't, everyone messes up when cooking sometimes. It's just a lesson for the next time :)"
DAE feel abandoned by the fact that hardy anyone has a clue about cPTSD except those who have it?,1195,khpo3m,151,"The worst is when I try to relate my experiences to others, then they claim to understand it and relate to it, but it’s clear that they don’t. You can never conceive of something u haven’t experienced before. People with good childhoods and healthy development really have no fucking clue how lucky they are. They have a self, we don’t.

We need a rehab program.,1188,lbtpkr,194,"You can be treated for an eating disorder or addiction, or if your spouse used you as a punching bag. Recently suicidal? We've got a program for that. 

But if you've just been slogging along, watching your life and your body fall apart in slow-mo for *decades*, that's your problem. Being a loser isn't inpatient worthy. Having no support system isn't a medical disorder. 

But here we are - so close to being functional people - still, we fail. Why? We understand our distortions. We have tools in our therapy toolbox. What's missing? Could it be that we just need to feel what it's like to live in a supportive environment? 

Living accommodations that help people ""re-learn"" how to be around others. Space for those who need space. Healthy food prepared by the community, shared with the community (or in the privacy of your own space because that's what you need.) Opportunities for enrichment. Opportunities to learn to work together and to learn boundaries.

"I brushed my teeth, showered and exercised today.",1191,jflj4a,67,"For about two months now I’ve been getting worse and worse with my motivation. Most days I just sleep all day and when I have to work, I sit most of the day. I’ve been drinking a lot and my back always hurts and I keep forgetting to shower and brush my teeth. When I eat I just eat garbage food anymore, and it makes my stomach hurt because I have IBS. I’ve gained weight and that just makes me hate my body and then I self soothe destructively even more. Two years ago I was in the best shape of my life and I was powerlifting, I had energy all the time, I felt genuinely happy. I hate that I’ve somehow reached this point now. 

For the last two days I’ve done nothing but drown myself in alcohol, eat cheese, and sleep. I woke up today and I washed my face, I drank water and Gatorade, I brushed my teeth and I showered finally. And then I went to lay back down but I decided to get up and go to the gym instead. 

I only made it about 25 minutes on the elliptical before I felt too drained to keep going, but I’m really proud of myself for finally doing it and I’m really hoping I can keep the momentum with it. I feel totally exhausted now but I’m glad I finally got out of bed. 

It’s probably sad and stupid, but I’m gonna make a goal for myself to shower and brush my teeth every day this week and hopefully I can get myself up and stick to it."
this is kind of specific but you know what gets me every single time?,1191,ja3klx,187,"the part in some movies when the teen girl is in her room and she’s crying or upset about something and her mom knocks (knocks!! can you imagine) on her door and then says “hey” all softly because she can see her daughter is upset and then the mom comes closer and the daughter breaks down in tears and the mom just holds her and strokes her back and comforts her while she cries 

can you imagine having a parent so emotionally intelligent that they recognise that you’re a complex person capable of feeling sorrow and needing comfort? not only that, but they also know how to provide it? 

and also, like, imagine being so comfortable with your parent that you are freely vulnerable around them because you know they’ll take care of you 

DEEP SIGH"
"You are 100% allowed to leave ANY situation, ANYTIME you want.",1194,li47xh,106,"I'm not sure who needs to hear this today, but I sure did. I've been in therapy for almost exactly two years now, and within the last few months I felt convinced at times that I had ""uncovered"" my most profound breakthroughs during my weekly sessions. I felt a lull of sorts within my continued efforts to dig deeper within myself and realize something new. But today, my therapist said something so seemingly simple, and put something in perspective for me in a way that I'm not sure I would have figured out on my own. Our conversation went a little like this:

""Just remind yourself that you are NEVER trapped. You can ALWAYS leave--in any situation. You are allowed to just walk out, and leave. If you're with a friend, just say something came up. If you're in an uncomfortable situation, you don't even have to give a reason. You are allowed to walk out, WHENEVER you feel like you must.""

""I know that's logically true...but I ALWAYS feel trapped. I always feel this inside. No matter what I do."" 

What she said next I don't think I will ever forget. She said, ""Yes. When you were a child, you didn't have the option to just ""walk out."" You had no choice. When you were sexually assaulted later in life, you were trapped too--no way to leave your body. No option to just ""walk out."" But you have the choice now. And you can leave ANYTIME you want. You do not owe anyone, anything.""

And I just cried with crushing validation I never even knew I needed. 

We are allowed to leave. We don't owe anyone our time, at the expense of our comfort and health no matter who they are. We don't need to be afraid of what they will think, or how they will feel about our choice to leave. We can choose ourselves 100% of the time. We don't need to stay somewhere we don't want to be in an attempt to ""spare"" someone else's negative emotions. 

We are allowed to leave ANY situation, ANYTIME we want, and are valid in doing so, no matter what we try to tell ourselves."

I saw a little girl picking flowers from my lawn,1193,hsamwa,80,"And as I looked at her I was reminded how when I was her age I used to always pick flowers for my grandma.  I looked at how Young she was, how little, and it dawned on me that I was around her age I started feeling guilt, shame, anxiety and a mess of other things like ""everything bad at home is my fault"" and the big one... ""I'm such a burden on the family because I need ______"". 

I looked at her and thought ""how could anything in this world be your fault... Look at you!  You're a tiny child!  Nothing is your responsibility yet"".   And I was just in awe looking at her.  Really, I was looking at me. Past me.  And while I've known logically nothing was my fault for a long time, I felt it emotionally for the first time watching this little girl pick yellow flowers from my lawn."

I realized I’m 40 in a few years but I’m feel like a scared child inside. Does anyone else just feel like CPTSD has stolen most of your life so far and a bit gutted that you’ve still not figured it all out?,1181,ma4m6l,198,
Shout out to all the beautiful pets helping us get through each day,1181,igbkte,100,"During recent EMDR I realised my angelic, calm and unconditionally loving cat from childhood was the only secure adult in my household. I always wondered why my sisters became narcissists while I held on to my empathy, and I do genuinely think having her in my life kept me going. She was a healer. My mother had her put down without telling us and I am only now able to grieve her death. 

Do you guys have a pet that keeps you going through your recovery, or that helped you in the past?"
DAE get jealous when they meet “average” people that remind them of what they could have been?,1180,fez3pk,134,"Yeah... as per title... I notice this popping up more and more in my life and I’m not sure how to deal with it.

It sucks seeing all of the happy, bubbly, social, successful women... and I am just a shell of what I could have been. I don’t speak or express myself in any way in fear of judgement. I don’t really have a personality anymore, besides that of a victim.

So when I see someone my age, doing well, being social in ways that I would have loved to be as a child, and especially now, but was/am too scared... man, it’s a punch in the gut. I automatically feel some resentment towards them (or at least life in general) because they always overlook me or even *look down on me* because I am so quiet, and internally I am crying, “I should have been just like you... deep down I am... please see that” but I don’t know how to find that within myself and let it out.

I know because of my silence/avoidance that I’m probably just coming off as a cold bitch which is why I can’t connect to people... but in reality I am so empathetic, compassionate, kind... I wish people could see the truth and understand. I wish that I could put my true self out there without fear. Has anyone here ever found this place within themselves...?"
I hate that I have to learn to validate my own feelings and to value myself,1177,hpm2x6,110,"I hate that I have to fix myself, that no one else can do it for me, that I have to learn to validate my own feelings and show myself compassion. I get it, I really do. I just hate that it has to be like that. 

It feels so deeply painfully alone

I don’t want to have to learn to care about myself. It doesn’t feel fair. It’s like I missed out on the years when other kids received unconditional love and developed a sense of self worth. And now I have to try to not need the parental kind of validation and unconditional love without ever having really gotten to experience it.

It was supposed to be my parents’ job and they fucked up. And now I have to learn to value and love and myself because I didn’t get that kind of love from someone else back when I needed it and now it’s too late.

I don’t want to have to accept that.

I still feel like a lost unloved child who has to love herself because she’s not worthy of or deserving of that kind of love from someone else.

I imagine it as being a child curled up in a ball sitting on a cold concrete basement floor all alone, crying. I am in the center, slightly illuminated, but surrounded by total darkness. Somehow the space around me stretches on forever, completely empty except for the floor and me. I'm hurting, but no one will come to comfort me. I'm supposed to comfort myself. I want someone to be there, to hold me, but I'm all alone and I have to wrap my own arms around myself in some semblance of a hug and rock myself back and forth, and have that be enough."

Too much in you

I DONT NEED TO FIND A MEANING OR PURPOSE TO THE TRAUMA I EXPERIENCED.,1174,ijngjc,183,"A bit of a rant. After seeing my therapist recently I have been upset about a comment she made. She said the trauma I experienced has a purpose or meaning. To help others and to become a better person. 

Honestly, I told her flat out  ""f"" that. I was born as a beautiful human being. I didn't need abuse to make me strong. I was born strong. I dont need the trauma I experienced to have meaning. It was barbaric and what I needed was to be loved and cared for. I am not a sacrificial lamb to be abused to end up helping others in adulthood. The tip of the iceberg was when she asked well what did I learn from my experiences. 

I explained, that the things I learned I didn't need to know. I didn't need to learn how truama can steal a person's soul. I didn't need to know that a child could survive heinous crimes alone. I didn't need to know what it's like to be trafficked. I didn't need my eyes to be opened to the atrocities and suffering of others because I lived it. 

I am unapologetic in saying, NO, what happened to me and others like me DID NOT, need to happen. If it helps some people to believe this than I'm all for it. I'm just saying, that asking me what I find empowering is more helpful then telling me what I should believe about myself. After all, the people who harmed me stole my choices from me. Now is the time for me to decide for myself what I believe. 

~ End of rant









Edit: I didn't realize this post would blow up so much. I did not respond individually to each reply but I am so thankful that so many of us could have such a lengthy discussion on this topic. I appreciate every single reply and thank you for the amazing show of support! I also really appreciate those whose viewpoint differ from mine. I think it's important for all sides and voices to be heard regardless of whether or not we agree. 

I will be continuing to see my therapist because believe or not, she is the best I can find in my area. She has helped me in other areas of my healing. I think since she is religious that's where or ideals of what healing looks like differ and conflict arises. But it's okay cause its apart of life and I believe I will find another therapist in the future that will be better suited to what I need for my own healing. 

Yall are awesome and thanks again for a great discussion!!"

"When I was 11 my abuser used poetry to groom me, raped me, and destroyed poetry for me for years. I just wrote a poem for the first time since then about what he did and I wanted to share",1169,jn45h9,112,"There’s a stuffed animal in a box in my basement.

Alone, its fur matted and full of dust. Every week I go down and look at the box.

I don’t open it.

I don’t throw it away.

"As I heal, I care less and less about people understanding me.",1170,ieyp5y,73,"When I lived with only the threads of an identity, I absolutely needed people to understand me. I needed them to see and accept the few interests/personality traits I had, and to understand my struggles. I see now that I was so lost that I needed to be seen to feel real.

At first, mostly during my childhood spent dissociated, I never shared. I kept it all in because of the fear of being misunderstood. And it was a reasonable fear - I would be absolutely demolished if I couldn't get people to understand me. So I kept quiet.

Then, when I had my first PTSD breakdown, I overshared. I told everyone everything, usually while drunk. I needed people to see me, and to know everything. I would go through the list of tragedies in my life one by one.

When I shared personality traits, I'd sometimes get protective over them. I never was a one-upper, thank God, but I did want to make sure that I was seen. I would get tense and insecure  around others who had my personality trait.

But that's changed now. I feel.... good. I feel stable and sure.

For example, I sent a friend some of my thoughts on our shared favorite band. I sent some insights I had on certain lyrics, and instead of replying to the points I made, she said, ""I'm so glad you're getting into them!"" ... This band has been my most-listened to on Spotify for three years. But I've also sensed some competitiveness in her when we talked about this band before, so I just thought, ""This isn't a topic I can connect with her on,"" and I just let it be. She thinks I'm just getting into this band, and you know what? That's fine.

Another example is that I caught up with a childhood friend the other day. He knows I've been through it, and when he asked me how I have been, I said, ""You know, I've been through a lot lately, but I won't talk about everything. There is one thing I want to share with you, just because you knew me as a child and know my parents. Very recently I've realized that they are emotionally abusive and neglectful.""

He then said something really sweet, ""I saw that. You were ALWAYS the last to get attention.""

And while that is sweet and true, it isn't quite pin down the neglect I carry. I carry the neglect of blank faces and self-absorbed reactions. The ""Your negative emotions are an insult to us; we will only love you when you are happy"" kind of neglect. The medical and material neglect.

But, I let it go. I thought, ""That was really sweet. He doesn't really get it, but that's ok. I don't want to nor need to explain it; I will not come to him with this kind of stuff again.""

There have been a lot of other little examples of this lately. I'm not completely rid of the habit, particularly around new people, but I am leagues better than I have ever been. It's not something I actively worked on. It is the symptom of healing, of reparenting, of feeling strong, of having boundaries. Of being me, instead of what they conditioned me to be.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has commented on this. I didn't expect this to get any attention. I'm really happy that my experiences are helpful, and I want you to know that whatever stage you're at is exactly where you're supposed to be right now."

A weird CPTSD metaphor that works.,1163,ktfeqi,116,"My boss is a good friend of mine and my workplace is a good one. But my boss is also pretty much the single most mentally healthy person I have ever met, so I've had a hard time describing what I need for my work to accommodate me, because he doesn't quite get it.   


So I told him it's like diarrhoea. Bear with me.   


I told him, you can be feeling absolutely fine and then suddenly, you have this agonising lurching feeling - you come out in cold sweats and start shaking. You have no idea where it came from, or how long the pain will last, or how much shit will come out, but you know in that moment it's absolutely unbearable. You can't exactly attend a meeting or sit in the cafeteria and a cup of tea won't fix it. You cannot plan ahead and politely excuse yourself. It could be that it lasts five minutes, or you could be there for days or weeks. It could result in a bit of self-care or it could result in serious harm or death. You can have as many rational thoughts as you want while it's happening and hypothesise about why it's happening - it won't stop it happening. It is also not sustainable to live in a constant state of it. And no matter how ill you are... you don't want ANYONE to see! And no matter how much its not your fault, you still feel embarrassed!   


I saw him kind of have this lightbulb moment and he said, ""I actually feel like I understand so much better now."" ...I hope this shitty metaphor can help some of you guys out too :)"
DAE dislike most sitcoms due to secondhand embarrassment?,1170,jv9j0j,238,"I just get so uncomfortable watching a lot of sitcoms out there because I don't have it in me to laugh at the situations that people who did not experience the trauma I experienced tend to find amusing.

I recently talked to an old friend who offered to talk to me about some stuff we talked about years ago, when I didn't know yet that I was abused. Now that I know it all has such a _weight_ for me that I feel unfair to put in anyone even when they're offering it. I've been isolating myself from my friends for so long, even when I am physically there I can never be myself, because myself is just not a fun person right now.

Real conversations with me are sad at the moment, because _I am_. And I don't want to make them sad, so I isolate until I have found a way to deal with it myself. However, sometimes, when someone really tries to crack my surface or I am drunk enough, I share, and then everything breaks out of me. And I just feel so guilty for dumping all of that unprocessed emotion onto that person who just wants to have a good time with a friend. I feel so guilty and ashamed for having let my guard down. And I am so afraid that person won't come back because they realized what kind of sad and broken mess I really am behind that mask of a happy, normal and hardworking person. I feel guilty because they're just not prepared and not responsible to deal with that messed up stuff in my head.

DAE feel like this? I already feel stupid and cliché re-reading my post. But that's as true as it gets, I guess.

You don't need to explain your trauma— period. It doesn't matter if they don't understand. Friends/Family/Dates,1157,m3zaz0,88,"I recognized that I started talking about my trauma to my friend whenever they'd ask me to elaborate on something I did or felt and the conversation would go deeper into my trauma where I was trying to explain everything. This was extremely triggering for me and my friend treats it like a conversation, going deeper and questioning things. I've realized I need to set a boundary very early on and not talk about my trauma. It's my ego talking if I want to prove them wrong or educate them. A real friend will accept that you have CPTSD and your boundary without you having to explain everything.

Thought this would be helpful for others since I know we have people pleasing tendencies."
"Why this childhood trauma recovery is so very, very hard.",1150,jazbah,137,"First you have to figure out that something is abnormal. That the way you were raised wasn’t healthy, wasn’t right and that normal people aren’t raised that way.

Then you have to figure out how to ask for help when asking for help is a foreign thing. Or have to figure out how to ask for it when you have a history of being punished for asking for help.

Then you have to have people around you that actually are able to help.

Then you have to relearn “normal”. You have to pause at everything that doesn’t feel right and ask “am I reacting because I’m triggered? or reacting because this really is a situation that is wrong and needs to be addressed?”

Then you need to figure out how to mitigate your abnormal responses.

Then if you’re in a business or learning environment you have to figure out what accommodations you need to try to level the playing field - when you’re still not sure what a normal playing field is. Then you have to figure out how to communicate those to “normal” people.

THEN, after all this, you have to be able to recognize when the difficulty you’re having is a normal learning curve or if you’re starting to get overwhelmed and need to get some more help.

And you’re doing all of this in a world that assumes that we’re operating at the same baseline normal that they are unless you figure out and communicate all of that.

Editing to say that I’ve been a bit overwhelmed by the response, the upvotes and the awards. Thank you everyone for contributing to this. I hope that it’s provided something tangible to help you on your journey to find healing."
"Fuck parents that convinced you that you were faking sickness. (tw: family trauma, emotional trauma)",1149,kggg1q,95,"We live in a pandemic right now, yet I struggle to believe myself and my body. I’m currently having issues with tasting, I’ve been coughing more, and my body just generally feels unwell. I’m going to get tested asap and have taken myself out of work just in case, I’m doing what I should—so why do I feel guilty and like I’m a liar? 

It’s because of my upbringing. My dad never believed me when I said something hurt or if I said I felt sick. Even if I said I’d puked, he would think I lied just because I’d already flushed it. I’ve practically shit straight up stomach acid before in school (for a whole class period) but he still thought I was lying and running from responsibilities. 

Because of him being shit, I as an adult struggle to fucking trust myself when I say I didn’t taste a whole ass pizza. I don’t trust myself and it’s hard to pinpoint when there IS something wrong. It’s the worst time to have this specific trauma and to be in the midst of a goddamn pandemic. Fuck you dad."
A story for those suffering with emotional neglect: Finding the right shoes,1149,kn6u1a,77,"At this time of year, it’s cold, wet and often snowy and icy where I live.
I went out for a walk the other day across some fields and the ground was muddy in places, with fallen snow sprinkled across the grass.
I made sure I put on some heavy duty waterproof walking boots before I went out so I’d be able to handle the terrain.

While I was out, I was thinking about emotional neglect and how some people seem to be able to handle the ups and downs of life with much more ease than I can. And I realised that I’ve never been equipped with walking boots.
I’ve been trying to climb up icy hills in my bare feet, wondering why it feels so difficult. Wondering why other people are able to trudge through the mud and get to where they want to be. I’m there feeling like I just can’t make it through the terrain.

And it’s not just that I didn’t have walking boots to wear. I didn’t know walking boots existed. Lots of kids got given their walking boots when they were young and have been taught how to use them over the years by their parents. I’ve only ever known about my feet. They’re great for walking on the flat in nice weather, so that’s all I’ve done. I’ve often tried trekking up the hills but I’ve always given up quickly as it’s been too hard.

All my life, I’ve wished that the hills didn’t exist. Why can’t it all be flat plains in nice weather? Then I could get to where I want to go.

Deep down, I’ve always known that the terrain can’t be changed though. There are always going to be hills. There’s always going to be mud and snow.
And I realised that I was trying to solve the wrong problem.

I wanted the landscape to change when really I just needed to find the right shoes.

EDIT: I've posted a follow up. What are the walking boots?

emotional abuse is still physical abuse.,1150,kh2moe,157,"Grew up thinking being yelled at was so much better than being hit - that I never had it ""that bad.""

But emotional abuse causes brain damage/changes, and our brain is part of our body. Our body was still attacked. We did get assaulted. The separation of our psyche from our body is ridiculous. You can't pierce someone with a thousand barbs - verbal or otherwise - and not have it cause damage. It's still not ok. Purposefully diminishing someone is still an abusive act no matter the method.

Verbal abuse hurts just as much. It is still an attack. Your trauma is valid, your pain is real."
"Did anyone else's abuser tell you that what they were doing to you was ""nothing"" compared to how they themselves suffered, or compared to others in the world who were suffering much worse? How did you get over that?",1147,ibwfen,215,"I'm trying to process some bad memories and I keep getting the echo of my father's voice, saying, ""This is nothing!"" Anything he did to us, we had no right to be hurt because other people had it much worse -- including him. Compared to him, we were lucky, spoiled even. And it's true -- we definitely had it better than a ton of other people. I don't even know that what he did to us counts as abuse, it's so darn ordinary: just an angry man raging, threatening, shaming, sometimes hitting, but not hard enough to bruise. And he was nice the rest of the time. Isn't that just a normal childhood? Isn't it pretty much ""nothing""? What if he's right, and the fact that I'm bothered by ""nothing"" just proves that I'm spoiled and weak and ungrateful?

I'm trying to work through these memories by providing an empathetic witness to my child self, but I keep getting thrown by how much my father's argument seems to make sense. I know there are arguments against it -- suffering's not a competition, would you think it's fine to treat another child that way, etc -- but I can't seem to believe them at a gut level. I can't connect to any anger or indignation or even hurt, because the shaming message just seems so true. 

If you've faced a similar problem, how did you work through it?"
One of the hard things about CPTSD is that acknowledging things that heal means acknowledging a different thing that hurts.,1149,gm51c3,143,"For example, if I acknowledge that **it was my parents' fault**, then that means **there was nothing I could have done to help myself**.

If I acknowledge that **my abusive parents are now powerless over me because they're actually delusional**, it means that **I no longer have trusted guides/mentors in life**.

If I acknowledge that **I can self-mother now**, then that means I have to admit that **I never had a proper mother**.

If I acknowledge that **I'm grown up and don't need their approval anymore**, it means that **any hope for a real childhood is gone**.


This is why I often feel like I'm stuck in limbo on certain healing aspects. I don't want to acknowledge something that would heal me, because in doing so, it means a different hard thing is true.

EDIT: I did NOT expect this to blow up the way it did.!! I just want to clarify. I do not mean empathy without boundaries.

I had a Skype therapy session with a new psychiatrist who told me my trauma was ‘insignificant’ and C-PTSD doesn’t exist.,1142,k5y5pn,257,"My GP managed to persuade a local psychiatrist to give me (M53) an urgent appointment to renew my antidepressants. It was by Skype due to the current COVID-19 restrictions in place in France.  


The psychiatrist didn’t renew my antidepressants because asking me lots of questions about my past trauma ( which triggered a lot of anxiety and stress due to previously being abused by a psychologist when I was at school, as well as a doctor), in her medical opinion my traumatic childhood experiences were ‘insignificant’ and even the emotional neglect on the part of my parents wouldn’t have caused any significant long lasting damage. She told me that since I’m capable of going to the local sports gym ( after my GP issued a medical certificate stating the urgent need to do sport as part of the therapeutic process) and I go to work every day I’m not in urgent need of antidepressants and that  I’d been misdiagnosed. 
Even after telling her that I suffered regular mental/physical/sexual abuse by my sports teacher, his wife, a local policemen, a lawyer, a doctor and a psychologist my dad sent me to see between the age  of 11 and 15, and after showing her some of my self inflicted scars, she said I lacked mental strength and that practising boxing should  toughen me up mentally. That triggered me since it was almost what my dad used to tell me ‘stop whining, grow up and be a man’, when I told him my sports teacher was doing ´things’ to me. 

Finally, in her esteemed medical opinion there is no such thing as C-PTSD, and obviously because a so called medical definition was established since it was done by Anglo-saxons, the French medical professionals require more proof. 

I cut short the session after telling her that what she said was unfair, unprofessional and ethically out of order. She told me that since she has the medical knowledge and I don’t I should perhaps arrange to see somebody else....she also overcharged me. 

This comes after what I posted the other day about my history of childhood abuse. 

What happened today has sadly just reinforced my fear of sharing my trauma with a psychologist/psychiatrist."
"I'm traumatized, I'm not stupid",1135,l7b6dg,74,
One of the most important things I learned in 2020 is that you don’t *have* to forgive someone to heal from what they did to you,1134,knt58m,112,"I’ve spent a lot of time trying to force myself to forgive the people who hurt me. Searching for things in their history to justify what they did, trying to find reasons why it was actually my fault, exaggerating things I’ve done wrong in the past to try and convince myself I have no right to hold a grudge, diminishing the severity of the abuse, everything. 

Then I wondered, why am I trying to delegitimize my own pain? And I realized it’s because the only way I could forgive them is by saying there was nothing wrong with what they did in the first place. Because they never apologized. Never made amends. Most importantly, they never tried to change. 

I’ve learned that apologies are best seen as promises for changed future behavior. If my abusers had apologized (genuinely apologized by taking responsibility and not making it out to be my fault or just a misunderstanding), tried to make amends, and then shown a clear change in behavior, then maybe I could forgive. But I wouldn’t need to. 

I think one of the most important things I’ve learned this year is that forgiveness is not a panacea and refusing to forgive won’t prevent healing. Not forgiving just means acknowledging the lack of apology and changed behavior. For me, it also means validating the impact their cruelty had on me. It doesn’t rot my heart or anything like that, and it doesn’t prevent me from moving on. It doesn’t make me a bad person either. It’s a genuine acknowledgement of my feelings towards these people and that’s healing in its own way."
I don't want to reparent myself,1129,lau1dk,131,"There's no adult part of me. Just a screaming toddler and a slightly older child who is tired. T I R E D. I don't want to fucking do it.

I always got farther on pain and love does nothing. I need a paycheck, not niceness.

Unfortunately we may have grown up around people that were supposed to protect and love us but instead of doing that they convinced us that we were not enough and not worthy of love. Those are not our thoughts. I know they're hard to let go but it is possible. 

So please share with me all of those great things about yourself, something fun you did over the weekend, any accomplishments you made, details about your monday morning routine! Anything really, whatever you do for yourself that makes you  smile. You are interesring! You are worthy! Take up space and share, the world needs your light.

You are not alone
You are loved, because you are Love
Everything you need to heal and be whole is already in you.

💚🙏🏽

Edit: 
I am so lucky to share this space with so many incredibly interesting and talented people. I love you all. I made this thread because I had a rough night last night and I woke up this morning sat with that sadness and decided to turn that sadness into love. So I posted this. I am going to try to go through every single post and read it with an open heart because you all deserve that. I will respond to them all because that makes me feel good and I am sure it makes you feel good too. Sometimes accepting that good feeling we get inside us (it may even feel foreign to some of us) is really hard when we grow up feeling like shit our whole life. 

Thank you all for sharing a bit of yourself with me today. 💚🙏🏽

Edit number 2:

Wow what a day! I enjoyed responding to all the replies. You all made my day and showed me so much love by bragging about yourselves. 

Maybe we'll have to do this again sometime."
I'm goo!,1130,c3mnu7,34,
"I AM GOING TO LIVE! No matter how much I've been abused, betrayed, bullied, taken advantage of, beaten, diminished, confined and crushed. I will live. I will love. I will smile, dance and laugh with all my heart. It is my goddamn birthright to live without the mountain of trauma I carried with me.",1126,lkbzre,60,"I am 34 years old now, and my life hasn't even started. I am bawling everyday. The last year consisted mostly of me trying not to drown in the tsunami of repressed trauma that has been shooting up like a volcano.

Guess what?! I haven't drowned so far and I intend to learn to swim with ease. Fuck giving up!

That's all. I will live. Whatever it takes. Starting therapy in less than a month and honestly I can't wait!

EDIT: this sub is one of the kindest places on the internet. A random vent spurs so much emotional peer support, that's just amazing! You are all amazing ❤️"
I’m so fucking sick or childhood bullying not being taken seriously. Especially if you had no support system.,1126,m0lmdq,126,"I was suffering alone wanting to kill myself in 4th grade, and somehow that type of thing isn’t mentioned when talking about trauma.

I’m so thankful for this sub for opening my eyes to stuff I’ve repressed for years.

Edit: this isn’t to downplay people’s abuse if they did have a support system, I was just venting about my experience. Thank you all for sharing your experiences, this discussion will be helpful for people today and in the future when they stumble upon it trying to learn more about their own trauma."
Schrodinger’s trauma - it’s both the worst conceivable trauma and “not that bad” simultaneously,1122,i38o9g,80,"Except there’s no box to open. No objective truth to observe. It’s all just ... you, in a hall of mirrors."

"DAE go back to songs you used to like when you were younger and realize the lyrics hit the nail right on the head for how you felt, but you couldn't recognize it then?",1126,mjuyvl,256,"i was a teenager in the late 2000s/early 2010s and was really into all the emo/post-hardcore/metalcore/pop-punk bands. i've been listening to a bunch of my old favorite songs recently and realized all the lyrics are quite literally how i felt about things but could not express, especially taking back sunday lyrics (i cried uncontrollably when i heard the song ""my blue heaven"" again).

weird how even when we are completely unaware of our cptsd and ongoing trauma (or at least it doesn't register as trauma), our brains still somehow *know*.

edit: wow, did not expect this passing thought to resonate with so many of you. thank you for the awards and song recommendations! I hope you all are having a great day and hanging in there (I know I'm trying)."
I GOT PROFESSIONALLY DIAGNOSED WITH CPTSD TODAY!!!!!,1121,jfxfmc,43,"This is very validating for me. This diagnosis means to me 'awful shit has happened to you. people traumatized you and being in pain is not a character flaw. it just means that you've been through way too much"". The psychiatrist is so amazing and understanding and helpful. When he mentioned cptsd I looked up at him and said 'yes yes yes yes yes' lmao (i rarely look people in the eye bc i feel deeply ashamed of myself. when he said cptsd i felt immediately validated). I feel very exhausted now but also relieved."
Warning to users on this subreddit!,1121,g850lv,163,"Hi to whoever is reading this and I hope you are doing well! I just wrote a post about a nightmare I had and mentioned a bit about my step-dad and trauma. I quickly got a reply from a user (who due to the rules I can't name) who responded kindly saying that if I wanted to talk further to dm them. I accidentally clicked their name and it lead me to all of their previous posts and comments to subbreddits including ""rapekink"" and others with similar names, including posts about how this user would love to speak to survivors while sexualising trauma. I told a moderator about this who gave me a lot of support and information and said that posting this would be okay as long as I don't say the users name (thank you again mod).

Please be careful who you respond to! Check their post history before giving any information! This really freaked me out and I hope nothing more than this happens to any of you guys.  


EDIT:   
Thank you everyone who's responded to this post this past day, I've tried to reply to as many as I can but I have read every message and I want to add some things:  
\- I'm not giving more information on this user on this post because I just want to spread awareness to check people's posting history before direct messaging to protect yourself.  
\- If this has happened to you and you feel comfortable enough to tell a mod, please do. Mods can't do anything without enough reports and it helps. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, that's okay. Block them if you can and there's a list of what you can do to keep your own posting history more private below.  
\- From the mod I talked to that helped me understand why this situation worried me:  
\[SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIGGER WORDS\]  
 ""As a survivor myself, I am also vigilant about this. It also bothers me as an active bdsm advocate. Rapeplay is a very niche kink, and calling it a rape kink is really not good. Rape kink itself is the ‘kink TO rape’ not of the act itself. In the community, kink is more attuned to power aspects, play is more towards action. So those with rapekink are most likely those fantasizing about actually raping, but rapeplay is more of nonconsesual consent, or the act out rape, or the consent being like ‘im going to say no but in this scenario, no is not no’ and also requires a safe word to stop the scene altogether. While rapeplay is acceptable, and actually helped me personally deal with my trauma, rapekink is really dangerous and harmful. Just something for you to understand that your worries are valid, but to also understand a bit of what you are worried about""   


\- I have just been messaged by a moderator of the r/rapekink subreddit and I want to share what they've said:  
"" 

Hello,

I hope I'm not intruding. My name is Lauren and I'm a fellow rape- and CPTSD-survivor. I also happen to be one of the moderators at [/r/rapekink](https://www.reddit.com/r/rapekink) and I noticed your post on [r/CPTSD](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD).

First of all, I want to apologize for what happened to you. Neither I personally nor the subreddit condone that type of behavior. We are a victim-focused community and our primary goal is to help those who whose way of processing and overcoming our trauma may be unconventional (and definitely not for everyone) but still need a safe space where we can express ourselves.

I understand you couldn't share the name of the person who sent you those messages publicly, but would you mind telling me? We do not tolerate that sort of behavior and will permanently ban anyone who engages in it.

I noticed that other people responding to your post said they had also been accosted. I don't want to intrude on a subreddit where I might not be welcomed, so maybe I shouldn't reply publicly, but could you let them know that they contact me personally or the [/r/rapekink](https://www.reddit.com/r/rapekink) mod team and we will deal with infractores swiftly and harshly.

Thanks and sorry again for dropping in your inbox uninvited. Stay safe. ""  
After talking to them they said that they have been working with other subs for the last several weeks for sexual assault awareness month, and that they will contact this subs mods to help get rid of toxic members. I informed them of the specific user that tried to talk to me and they had already been banned from the r/rapekink subreddit almost a week ago. This message was given by u/lauren_4a who has given me permission to say her name and has asked that people who experience this report these users to her/ the subreddit's moderators too.   


I know this is a long edit and thank you for reading it all, but as a short summary:  
The moderators are doing their best to keep us safe and we need to help where we can in keeping them informed of toxic users.   


I hope you are all doing well."
What do boundaries feel like?,1118,bgegf6,116,
Is this true for most people here? I am definitely my best after midnight though I get annoyed when I hear birds chirping when I am trying to go to sleep. I always hope that the good feeling will carry on to the next day but it never does,1113,bhsice,91,
I only have one friend. I just had to defend my trauma to her. So I guess I have no friends now.,1109,l3n6i2,167,"I met my friend after a therapy appointment and was explaining what EMDR is and she told me that I'm no more screwed up than anyone else and that if I would just stop thinking about it and reading about it I would get better. She also told me to work out and eat more veggies. 

I'm reeling. While she was talking I made a mental note to never tell her anything important ever again. Surface only. Or just stop the friendship.

Why do people have SO MUCH trouble with empathy? Why can't people just sit there and say ""Wow, that must be hard"".

Edit: I just want to say thank you to all of you for your insights! Each comment is very appreciated. Everyone's input is very valuable to me and I'm so happy we have this community to give us advice and tell us hard things ❤"
DAE have an intense sense of urgency about everything?,1106,iu1wi3,136,"My anxiety and trauma manifests like this a lot. It’s like perfectionism but way, way beyond, like ‘everything will fall apart’ if I don’t resolve the source of anxiety RIGHT NOW. And every task is a stressor and source of anxiety for me. Everything feels like such high stakes. I have this constant sense of desperately holding the world together by a thread, this dread that my world will collapse if I don’t immediately do things ‘right’ and follow where my anxiety and sense of urgency is telling me to go.

Edit: Wow thank you everyone for this amazing response, I feel so much less alone! The people in my life think I’m absolutely crazy and irrational for the frantic and panic-stricken way I move through life, so it’s really helpful knowing others can relate."
"DAE feel like an imposter when they describe abuse, even to themselves?",1112,m3201s,97,"""It wasn't true physical abuse. He didn't hit ME, just the wall he had backed me up against. He didn't grip ME up, just the front of my shirt while he screamed in my face. He wasn't always like that, he was often so helpful and loving."" <--- me talking myself out of acknowledging abuse.


""Maybe I am exaggerating it""...

***Years of gaslighting makes you constantly doubt your own perception. Abuse is abuse, regardless of how 'bad' it was.***

""There were some times when they were good to me and we had fun""... 

***Years of guilt tripping makes you feel mean for insulting/hurting the abuser by reducing them to their worst moments. You are not responsible for their emotions. You do not need to justify their actions.***

""I still care about them""...

***Trauma bonds are addictive and not easily broken. You need to care about yourself for once.***"
When I was 12 my dad smashed up my guitar. 11 months ago today he died. Today I burnt his old guitar. It felt like relief. I promise I’ll allow myself to let go of the fear and pain that connects me to him. We can heal our past traumas.,1108,lut2al,40,"I believe in the strength of our survival and each day we become closer to letting go of our pain. I feel that I accept him for all that he was, a rounded human, who was himself traumatised. I’m shedding a skin and it feels painful but good.
I hope that we all feel that one day 🔥❤️

EDIT: I woke up today with so much support. Your words of kindness and encouragement are so so valuable, thank you. Not everyone can fully understand what this means to me in my day to day, but knowing you do is amazing. I love this community ❤️"
"Yesterday I grieved the loss of my childhood, it happened when I learnt to be there for myself, for the scared lost little boy inside. I cried for hours and something that felt fractured inside of me now feels whole. I don't feel split internally. No more self hate, I WILL be there for myself now...",1096,k7tf58,73,"I want to start by saying this information is just my-story I am not advocating anything nor do I believe the way I did this is the only way to do it. I wanted to share my story because I want to let other know it is possible. Until yesterday I had only ever read about grieving the loss of your childhood or being truly there for yourself, I had never experienced it. My whole life has been plagued with self loathing and emotional surpression. It seemed liked a fairy tale to me. I would read these things and my inner critic would say ""That might happen to others but not you your too fucked up and broken"" Lies lies lies mr critic... 

The story starts about a week ago, I went from regular dysfunction into a deep depression and self loathing. I couldn't live with myself anymore. Everything about being myself seemed painful and that pain was overtaking my desire to live. It got so bad that I planed my own suicide and was only a step away from buying the necessary tools. I thought If I'm going to die I might as well try everything to see if I can shake this, I had some LSD lying around the house in a little box which I hadn't taken for a long time, I have had some experience with tripping in the past but hadn't taken anything in a while. I had been going through a period of stopping drinking and smoking cannabis and was trying to clean up my act so to speak. It also seemed like the last thing I would want to do in that head space.. seemed like a disaster waiting to happen but I did it anyway. It didn't seem like it mattered if I had an awful time, or lost my mind or anything else... I was going to die soon I thought, what do I have to lose?

I took it, had a shower, listened to some music and when it hit me I had this urge to be in the dark, no distractions just go into myself, I wonder whats there? I thought if it turns bad I can all ways leave. So I closed the blackout-blinds and put on my noise canceling headphones but not attached to anything It was just white noise. I was now in silent darkness with myself. At first usual trippy stuff, patterns and sounds.. my body felt great like it was being massaged by one of those vibrating chairs! Then I felt my eyes water and I cried a little... and then a little more... and then I cried harder than I ever have in my whole life. I cried and I cried and I cried, I cried so hard I could control my body I couldn't stop... It almost became too intense, after maybe 20 minutes I cried so much I became nauseous, I thought this was getting way too intense and thought I might be sick so I managed to sit up and turn the light on. Everything became so intense and I felt terrified, the terror felt old and overwhelming. Then suddenly from the depths, I said to my self ""Shhh shhhhh shhhh its okay... its okay.... its going to be okay"" and put hand on my chest and stoked gently."" I then had the incredibly strong image that I was soothing a very young child about 4 years old. The child was me. I was soothing myself. I was soothing my inner-child. He was so frightened. I stood up and said, its okay if you're going to be sick, you don't have to be though it's just fear but you can if you need to. I left the room and walking down the corridor the nausea subsided. My inner child was now stood next to me, he child wanted to see that the flat was safe, so we walked hand in hand as I slowly and gently showed him around the flat, we shuffled around at the most gentle pace. We looked out the kitchen window ""See nothings outside its okay"". Then the lounge, then my work space, under desks and tables ""see theres nothing here, you're safe now, I wont let anything happen to you, I'm here now"" In that moment I became aware that I had just parented myself. 

 I began to cry again, but this time was different, it was like a father morning the loss of a child. The morning was for the childhood I lost... I morned the years living in fear because no one told me I was safe. I morned the years I had spent attacking myself into trying to become a lovable person, believing the only way I could ever fill the void was to have others love me, not knowing that love is within and I could love myself. I morned the years I had spent harming myself with negative coping strategies because I didn't know better. I morned that for my entire life up until that point I felt unloveable.  

After what had now been about 3 hours of crying like I had only ever seen in films or on the news after some horrific tragedy... it began to subside. I had at this point I had been on the floor for quite  sometime, exhausted I picked myself up. I felt a deep stillness and peace and sense of wholeness, as though two had become one inside myself. Usually I have a feeling of sadness behind my eyes, like water, deep under ground but with no well to access it. The well felt dry, empty, and I felt/feel lighter. Where my head would usually be filled with attacks from my inner critic there is now silence, I am able to appreciate what I have and enjoy the little things. I still have anxious thoughts come and go but now when they do I simply say to myself ""shhhh shhh shhh its okay, its okay"" Then the thoughts go and the peace returns. 

To close I just want to say that LSD is NOT the only way to do this AT ALL. It's a bit like taking a flame thrower to an ice sculpture. You could have just turned up the heat and watched it melt drip by drip. A practice of meditation and self compassion will also lead you to the same place. I really recommend a book called ""Reconciliation, healing the inner child"" By Thich Nhat Hanh. The practices he teaches will also lead to the same place. If you find yourself in the same boat I was in, if you find yourself berating yourself, hating yourself and the idea of self love or sitting with your inner child seems like nonsense, painful, pointless ""It will never happen to me"". Please remember that I thought the same thing. It is real, radical transformations and healing do happen!

If you made it this far, thank you. I love you, please be kind to yourself, you are enough. Change is possible.

Was it that obvious?,1101,j3wp93,46,"My grandma is a touchy person, and growing up (and even now) I would try to avoid it. This morning I bit the bullet and wanted to explain to her that I don’t like being touched because I have CPTSD, I wasn’t planning on discussing the CSA aspect of it. I actually wanted her to be out of the loop because I didn’t want to put unnecessary stress on her. it went like this:

“Grandma, I wanted to explain to you why I avoid being touched. I have CPTSD. Do you know what  that is?”

At this point my grandma just blankly stares at me for a moment. And then she blurts out

“Were you molested?!”

Well, there’s no avoiding that now lol. I explain some things and eventually I asked her if it was that obvious. She tells me I used to be a very adventurous kid and then suddenly I closed off everyone. We have a heartfelt conclusion and she tells me she still loves me no matter what. Cue the waterworks.

I’m grateful this went as well as it did!

Edit: spelling"
PSA: You don't have to eat burned toast to punish yourself for burning it.,1103,esvxy9,106,"One of those little shocking realizations that came from hanging out with healthier people was that it's not normal to eat burned food?! If I accidentally put the toaster on the wrong setting, my parents always made me eat it as a sort of punishment, so I just internalized the idea that you had to still eat food if you burned it. 

I was making toast at my boyfriend's house one day a few years ago, and burned some toast. I was like, oh well, and got ready to eat it but he started making me more toast. The following conversation happened:

> Me: ""Why are you making me more toast? I already have some??"" 

> Him: ""it's burned, don't you want some not-burned toast?

> Me: ""Of course, but I burned this one so I have to eat it."" 

> Him: ""Why?""

> Me, confused: ""Um, that's just what you do??"" 

> Him: ""But eating burned stuff can be carcinogenic [studies are inconclusive], and we have plenty of bread! You don't need to eat the burned stuff, just throw it away and I'll make you a new piece.""

> Me: ?????????!!?!? *Dawning realization that I don't have to force myself to eat burned food as self punishment* ???!?!!!!??!??!!? ""Waaaat??""

> Him: ""Yup.""


In conclusion, *you don't have to eat food just because you burned it*. If money is really tight, you are allowed to scrape off the most charred bits to make it more edible, and that's *okay*. 

Hopefully you don't relate to this, but if you do, I hope this PSA leads you to a perfectly toasted buttery future."
"I constantly expect everyone to be angry at me and live in a constant state of damage control. It feels weird that the people close to me now don't resent me, and I don't know how to stop assuming they do and live normally.",1099,kjx4s5,40,
"We were robbed of a basic human right and are now expected to behave like the humans that weren’t robbed, and that makes me so angry.",1096,f6e700,132,"MaheehusyebeheuehHSJSUEJBRBRBR I HATE THIS

Edit: I don't want or expect to be ""babied"" by humanity. I love to work, I love to be kind and understanding, I like to keep up with everyone else. I just wish we were allowed a little time to learn and heal before being tossed into humanity and told ""go do what the other humans do."" Not to compare this to military PTSD, please don't be mad. I'm just trying to think of something somewhat similar but a little more common, but, when someone comes home from war, they are in shock. They should be given the time and space to talk about what happened, to process it. To be angry, tired, sad, not themselves. They too are thrown into this world and expected to do all these functional, human things right away, after living through a certain evil that remains unseen to most. ""Don't talk about it. Don't move in ways that say, ""I've been through something.'"" It's too easy for us to let our demons run rampant when society kind of tells us that there is no time or space to address them. In a way, we've been through a certain war ourselves. Meanwhile society is like, ""why are people so sick? why do they snap? why are they unkind at times? what is all of this anger and sadness? what is this mental health crisis?"" By expecting these people to tuck away their demons and ""go do,"" you're enabling their demons. You. are. enabling. 

I am not trying to compare my war to that war, I'm not trying to compare their significance. I can't speak on that war because I've never seen it. I'm ranting, but what i'm saying is...it's very difficult for me to process and heal while working five days a week, maintaining or creating relationships, buying groceries and doing the laundry, and being expected to evolve into a husband, a wife, a parent and grandparent, or even a person that can step outside in the morning and appreciate the calmness in the fresh, quiet air. That calm is chaos, because we are living in a world where we only have time to talk to our demons  while everyone else is quiet."
Does anybody else overshare their trauma in such a “normal” conversational way that people in your life constantly invalidate you?,1101,j21s4s,139,"I’m not even sure if this is a thing, but it’s incredibly therapeutic to discuss my trauma and I find myself over sharing to a fault. While speaking to very casual friends about relationships or family I will casually talk about my abusive ex or sociopathic father and then almost brush it off. When pushed further, I am extremely open about abuse and trauma that I have occurred. Now, most of my friends and people close to me constantly talk about how strong I am or how it’s great that I’m “over it (my trauma).” 

It’s difficult to be open with my feelings when I’m feeling weak, sad, triggered, anxious, panicky etc. because friends/partners get confused. Everyone expects me to be strong and composed all of the time and when I’m not it’s like I’ve fallen off a very tall pedestal. 

Does anyone else have this issue?"
"I recorded myself standing up for me and confronting someone calm yet assertively. When I listened to it back, I was flooded with a deep self love.",1093,hgbnf5,29,"No one ever stood up for me but today I got to witness someone who did
😭❤️"
Anyone else just feel completely unsuited to living in capitalist society?,1099,e9ma6v,242,"Interviewing for jobs; fronting like you give a damn about profit; the pressures that come with being obligated to a boss and a company and the fear generated by failing to meet these expectations (since a lot of us are estranged from our families - destitution/potential homelessness).

I'm too sensitive for all of this shit."
"Does anyone else feel like the reason their emotional neglect during childhood effected them so much is because they are naturally very deep thinking, and intelligent with a broad emotional range.",1095,jp8cfr,195,"I recently discovered this sub and just finished reading “Running on empty”. I remember reading a post recently discussing how a lot of the users on this sub sound very intelligent... 

What I have running through my mind right now is I feel like the reason I suffer so greatly from the emotional neglect I encountered during childhood is because my mother wasn’t able to fully take on complicated subjects with me. I can remember questioning God & religion at a very young age and just being told “you believe, don’t worry” and literally at a young age I did have complex thoughts going through my head and I don’t think my mom was able to partake in those conversations in the degree that I needed. I can remember her telling me that she thinks I’m “an old soul”

I also feel like my natural state is just overall more spiritual, more observant, more focused on energy and the flows of energy between people and that is just my NATURAL wiring and to have that denied is what caused me so much angst.

I feel like my sister doesn’t have the same level of range in intelligence, observation, sensitivity etc , and that’s why she wasn’t as negatively affected as me.

DAE feel this way? Can you recommend other sources on this? Is this just another symptom of me not fully understanding myself?"

I just realised my lifelong battle with social anxiety is mostly a result of being traumatised,1091,jog0f6,88,"For the longest time before I knew I had CPTSD, I just thought I was very shy. It’s been a couple of years now of educating myself on complex trauma and I now know why I never felt like the term “social anxiety” made sense to me. I always felt like there was something deeper there and that a 12 week CBT therapy course just couldn’t address it. Lately I’ve been really being mindful of myself and paying attention to my reactions, thoughts and bodily sensation when I’m interacting with others( strangers or not) and I’ve realised any authentic self expression is incredibly triggering for whether it be dancing, singing along to music, standing up for myself, telling a joke etc. It’s seems like there is a very harsh cruel judge inside me that is always evaluating and skewering me as I try to connect and show myself. After even the most basic and minor social interaction, i pick myself apart for hours and sometimes days which always triggers me into a self loathing and depressive state. I now understand  why I have had an incredibly hard time making friends as a teenager and even now as an adult. Like this might be just my own theory but I feel like others can subconsciously pick up when somebody is very hyper vigilant and wound tight and they gravitate away from them especially in social settings. I know for me when I was a little girl that I was very afraid of being myself around my father because he was judgmental and had little tolerance for kids being self expressive. It’s crazy because I read Pete walkers book and I remember him talking about this but it didn’t really resonate until very recently when I went back to read it again, I feel like I’m always learning something new when I read that book. I’m grateful for the breakthrough but I just feel kinda hopeless because my inner critic is so easily triggered which means I have to do a lot of work countering and diffusing it’s hold on me before i can even be myself around others which bums me out because I’m just now waking up to the fact I want to have friends and a community. This is my first post on here and I just want to know I’m not alone and commiserate with others who might be going through the same thing."

Anyone else mortally terrified of getting in trouble?,1091,hmjrcj,101,"Like, every day I go to work, spend the whole time scared to death I’m gonna make a mistake and people are gonna get mad.  Then, if I do make a mistake, I panic and do my best to make sure no one can ever find out.  Which I know it’s best to own up to mistakes instead, but most of the time I would rather die than confess a mistake to an authority figure and have them be mad at me.

Anyone else not socialized properly?,1089,ih1wmy,171,"Not allowed to go to other kids houses, not allowed to play outside without someone watching (they never wanted to watch anyways), scared by parents into thinking of everyone as untrustworthy, not allowed a phone, not allowed to get a job, only spoken to when being scolded or told to do something.... On top of all that, outcasted by classmates because they could sense something was 'off' about me. I can only handle small talk IRL but that drains me a lot. No offense to autistic people, but I feel like I have autism due to just how little I was socialized. This kind of neglect makes me constantly feel like I'm just making it up. And my parents now blame ME for not being a normal person (school, friends, bf). Well where the fuck was that foundation? I was raised basically in isolation, studying and doing chores. At 20 they eased off alot, but nothing was ever discussed, and their neglect became so ingrained that I basically just isolated myself on purpose because that's all I knew. But its apparently not their fault because they were just 'busy with work'."

"My therapist gives this amazing tip: always think of what do you value, before you react to a situation",1077,ledsqp,42,"I came to realize that I value freedom. And that is going to be my north star. I grew up in an authoritarian regime, but now lives in democracy. And now I learn the meaning of freedom. 

I will let people be tired, grumpy or disassociated sometimes, because people have the freedom to have emotions. I will not take other people's emotion personally. Because I deserve to be free of that burden.  

I will accepts different opinions and perspectives. Because we all need to protect freedom of speech. 

I will take care of my spouse and children. Because I made commitment to them. Other people deserve to feel free to trust me. However, I am not responsible for my parents, because that relationship was never my choice, and my parents have failed to provide for me. 

I will be frugal because having more saving means more financial freedom for my family. I will not subscribe to vanity spending because that only gives me short term gratification. 

I will make donations to organizations that fights for freedom. I will boycott companies that employees modern slave labors."
I had planned to commit suicide today,1085,ixp7u1,131,"I counted all my antidepressants. I had over 200. It was my plan to die from overdose. I’d lock the door to my room and move my wardrobe to block the door. 

I wrote my “will”, elaborated on what to do with my belongings, things yet to be done, what to donate, what to be given etc. 

As I wrote, I kept crying. I told myself to stop. I knew what happened every time I cried too much. I knew how much my head would hurt. I willed myself to stop, yet the tears wouldn’t cease. My head didn’t just hurt. I felt so nauseous. It got so bad I really didn’t think I could swallow pills. So I just laid in bed doing nothing for a long time, trying to will the pain and nausea away. Then I started writing this. I’m not sure why I’m writing this. I must say I felt really close to death. I once told my friend I feel as though I wouldn’t live past a certain age (which I’m now nearing). For the longest time ever, I’ve been unable to imagine a future, a way out of this. It feel as though I’ve hit a wall and that there’s no way further into my life. To those of you who’ve ever been close to death, what went through your mind? What reflections did you have? What changed?

"When you have your abusers nose, a rhinoplasty isn’t necessarily for the sake of vanity.",1076,jt1e3x,124,"Anytime I express the desire to save up for a nose job everyone around me is surprised. “But your nose is fine!” “Don’t do it! You won’t look like you!” “If you change one thing on your face it’s a slippery slope and you may never stop!” 

The thing is, there’s no chill way to say “I, a woman who was sexually abused by my father and all 4 of my brothers, experience distress over the fact that I have the EXACT. SAME. PROMINENT. FEATURE as all 5 of my abusers. Right in the middle of my face. Every day in the mirror. In ever photo. If I don’t get a nose job, an exact replica of my rapists nose will be in my fucking wedding album...Would you not want to correct that if it were you?”

Edit: I just got back on Reddit, and seeing all the support and kindness for this post was so heartening. Thanks to everyone for your encouragement, and empathy. I’ve been saving up to be able to get a nose job for years, because it’s such a painful thing to see my abusers nose in the mirror every day, but have had one stumbling block after another. Either a more pressing medical issue that needs to be taken care of has taken priority, or I’ve had to spend my savings to keep myself afloat. After losing my job to the pandemic I’m back to zero again, but will be starting a new job in just a few weeks and will start to put a tiny bit away each week. I just want to look in the mirror or see a picture of myself without seeing a part of them. Thank you all for being so kind and supportive."
"Gaslighting is when someone lies to you about what you see, in an attempt to convince you that you don't actually see it. When you believe something about yourself that isn't true, it's called a cognitive distortion.",1083,i179cx,90,"Edit: Actually it’s become quite clear to me that gaslighting doesn’t need to be intentional at all in order to be gaslighting. I was horribly mistaken in my assertion that it has to be and I do want people to know it doesn’t matter the intentions of an abuser, if someone has made you question your reality throw what I say in the trash. What’s more important is you identify harmful people in your life and stay away from them if you can. And if someone is invalidating you, denying, dismissing you all the time it doesn’t matter why, that probably will affect your perception of the world. The way you see things is how you see things and it deserves to be met w compassion and worked through regardless. I’m afraid some people may have left my post wondering if they have any leg to stand on for how they feel, and I feel ashamed for that. So I think it needs to be said, YOU know best what you go through and a stranger on the internet cannot determine that for you.

Gaslighting is not just invalidation or something that makes you ""question your reality"". It's specifically when someone tells you that what you witnessed is not what you witnessed. It does make you question reality, not ""your"" reality but the shared experience of reality. Things are either true or they aren't, and the person is trying to convince you that untrue things are true.

That is not the only thing we experience that may make us question reality, but it's one of the few times we are questioning reality because another person is lying to us. Because of the nature of gaslighting, I would say it's impossible to do to yourself. A lot of people who believe things that aren't real about themselves actually *believe* those things and are no trying to convince themselves to ignore reality. 

They think the terrible things about themselves ARE reality. Those thoughts are called ""cognitive distortions."" They are called cognitive distortions because they're mental habits that produce thoughts  which are a distortion of reality. ""If he cares about me, he will text me back quickly."" That's an example of a cognitive distortion called ""Black and white thinking"" and maybe even another one called ""jumping to conclusions."" I recommend you look up cognitive distortions to understand why. In reality, people do or don't text quickly for lots of reasons, and there's no way you can know which one of those reasons it is without being told.

How do you beat gaslighting? Trust yourself. If you know what you saw, and you trust how you feel, you don't need anyone else to tell you what you saw or how to feel. If someone is trying to convince you--not share their perspective, but actively convince you--that what you are sure you saw is not what you saw, then leave them alone.

""But what if they're right though?"" Maybe. For example, if you've got distorted thinking, and you interpret someone's lack of response as emotional neglect, when in reality they were just busy, you may feel absolutely sure they were ignoring you even if they weren't. How do you account for these moments? You don't. You take risks and hope they pay off. That is life.

You will never be able to predict what comes ahead with 100% accuracy. We want to, because then we feel more prepared for it. But the truth is that you CAN already handle whatever life throws your way. TRUST YOURSELF. Learn about cognitive distortions and be mindful of when you're distorting reality. If someone is trying to convince you what to think or how to feel, that's a red flag. Not necessarily gaslighting, but it could be."

Any other black/POC folks here? Anyone have trauma from internalized racism?,1068,huj62e,122,"For the majority of my life I just kind of stuffed down my feelings and tried to ignore them, especially while I was in the thick of the child abuse. I’m half black but I’m brown skinned and get dark during the summer, and I was raised by racist white people. I’ve faced such an astronomical amount of racism from my own family (ex. My white mom calling me a n****r and monkey when she was mad at me, never letting me see my black family, ect), on top of all the racism I’ve faced from everyone else around me. Sometimes I feel like it’s all just crushing down on me. Lately I’ve had a lot of time to be alone with my thoughts and I’ve been extremely aware of how much pain I’ve actually accumulated from my entire life’s worth of this

I always feel worthless and inadequate and UNHEARD and inferior compared to white people. Especially white women, with how much everyone fawns over white women and then makes jokes about how ugly black women are. I feel like I’m judged just for existing because of my skin color. I’ve had white people who I thought were my friends come out and say extremely racist things. I’ve always felt so alone and unprotected and hated and unwanted by my own white family and it feels like the entire world also feels that way. 

I just have so much pain that I just walk with in my chest every moment of every day and if I stop to think about it even for a minute I start sobbing 

And then every new racist experience I have, which happens daily, just adds more to my trauma

I feel like I’ll never be able to crawl out of it because I’ll never get a break. 

Can anyone else relate to this?

&#x200B;

My kitchen is in my relatively small apartment but it's open to the living room/dining room area, which makes it feel a lot bigger than it is. I have lots of fluffy carpets on the floor so your feet won't get cold. One cozy couch if you'd like to sit there. A few chairs at the kitchen island and around the small dining room table. If you like being tall, the ones around the kitchen island are barstool height. There's also a strange chair I named Bouncy Boy, it's made of stretchy rope so it catches you as you sit down on it. It's very silly and very comfy.

I always have a scented candle lit so the room smells nice, almost like cinnamon. I just put a pie in the oven and so the smell of apples caramelizing with sugar, mulling spices, nutmeg, and cinnamon wafts through the apartment. The heat from the oven keeps the apartment warm, but not too warm.

There's lots of food to eat. You can have as much or as little as you'd like, I love to cook so I'll just make more if you'd like! Or if there's anything specific that you like to eat, I really like trying to make new things.

I've made some warm apple cider. It smells like fall. I can make hot chocolate too, or lemonade, or whatever you'd like. 

My biggest skill is making vodka sauce pasta. I'm good at Alfredo too, and macaroni and cheese. I could make you salmon with honey and lemon or grilled chicken or steak. If you're a vegetarian I can make pizza with parmesan cheese, mozzarella, garlic, and a homemade sauce. 

I have silicone molds shaped like flowers. I have baked eggs inside of them. I am an agent of entropy, I assert my dominance over the universe and that which it has created. The flower-eggs are surprisingly good. You too can be an agent of chaos if you'd like and bake whatever you'd like in the silicone. Some are shaped like different kinds of flowers, some are shaped like dinosaurs, some are half-spheres. I've made brownies in them too. They're mixed with condensed milk and smell like hot chocolate.

There are lots of board games and card games if you'd like to play. My girlfriend and I have lots of books if you'd like to read as well. Ir we can just hang out and chat. 

If you want to learn how to cook and don't know how, I can teach you as well. Or you can be my taste tester. No matter what, you're welcome in my kitchen and it's always open to you :)"

Does anyone else struggle with ‘adulting’ because your whole childhood was ‘adulting’ and therefore being an adult is inherently triggering?,1050,dx37q6,96,"My father is a sexual abuser. My mother is a narcissist control freak and kind of an alcoholic. 

My childhood basically involved me shutting off emotionally. I lived purely in a survival mindset. I never hoped for anything. I never allowed myself to want anything. I lived out of a bag because I was ferried between parents and family friends. I was scared for my life sometimes. I just had to keep my head down, and not complain. 

I cooked for myself from ten years old. I did my own laundry. I never asked for anything. I waited to see if I’d get new clothes or anything remotely nice at Christmas, and never any other time. When I was with my father he sometimes didn’t feed me. He would watch child porn while I sat in the other room, trying to block it all out. 

Now that I’m an adult, I realise that I struggle to ‘adult’ consistently. That’s because ‘adult’ like feels so much like my childhood, that I get severely triggered. 

Adult life in your twenties: involves having few possessions, often unstable living or having to really work hard and grind for a home, often alone and isolated, often treated poorly and bottom of the rung, having to do everything by yourself, having to put your head down and not complain, having to keep up appearances of being ok when you’re not in order to keep your job/have friends/a partner. 

That is what my childhood already was. I’m really struggling to be a functional 20 year old because what is required basically forces me to go back into that mindset I already developed as a kid. That shutting off, that head down, that not wanting, that worrying about housing and stability and food, the being ok with being alone. 

It’s like other people who had relatively normal childhoods can cope with this - it’s new, it’s scary but in a moving forward way, they haven’t had to do this already for 25 years by the time they are 25. 

For me, it’s exhausting. It’s too much. I’ve been doing this for decades already. When do I get to feel safe? When do I get a home? When do I get to feel not alone? When do I get to put my guard down? When do I get to not live out of a bag? 

I don’t know how to fix this. I want to be a self sufficient adult, but it’s like we are all given a ration of self sufficient juice when we are born, and the idea is to use it between 18-35 ish before you get your next family and can rely a bit on others, but mines all gone already. 

Some people maybe relish the idea of being away for college and working and maybe only having family at the holidays. I hate it. I want a family. I want a home. I want to feel like I have a safety net. 

I am terrified and I’m tired of being terrified. I’m so tired."

Anyone else overexplain things or feel they have to justify or prove themselves?,1044,ffxior,97,"I wish I didn't do this as I'm sure I annoy people with it or actually end up more misunderstood in a way but I can't seem to help it.

Working through this shit is time consuming, extremely painful,.... did i mention time consuming?? Frankly it’s made me feel a bit insane over how long it’s taking. I’m too tired to focus on much else.

We’re weeding the potential arsehole right out. We’ll go on to become kind, decent people, and that’s exactly what the world needs.

"Childhood trauma begins in infancy because of ""cry it out"" (nighttime anxiety)",1041,kqzb9e,284,"TLDR: ""Cry it out"" is a technique promoted to teach children how to sleep in their own bed, in their own room. It's unnatural and bad for a few reasons:

&#x200B;

1. In the entire history of humankind, and for our predecessors, an infant left alone was as good as dead
2. Infants and toddlers cry for a reason - to get closeness, safety, comfort, and attention
3. Depriving infants and toddlers of basic comfort and safety sets them up to be anxious for their entire life
4. This is because their nervous system and body are regularly put under high stress
5. Children eventually learn to sleep on their own by learning to tolerate abandonment and suppress important emotional signals in their minds and bodies

&#x200B;

[Dangers of cry it out](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/moral-landscapes/201112/dangers-crying-it-out)

When you combine this with [Dr. Tom Boyce's work on intrinsic differences in sensitivity between children](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_vcWB43W7Y), the inevitable result is that some people are going to be harmed far more than others, often scarred for life.

When you look at how ""primitive"" people live, infants and toddlers are rarely out of arms reach from parents. This gives them the baseline security and safety they need to survive in the wild.

# What can you do about it?

If you are a parent, consider [cosleeping](https://www.verywellfamily.com/co-sleeping-benefits-and-criticisms-284570) (what humans did for forever) or at least keeping a bed/cradle in your room. **Update:** yes, cosleeping can be dangerous, that's why there are a [a number of products](https://parentingpod.com/best-baby-co-sleeper/) that can make it safer and more sustainable. This includes beside-the-bed basinets as well as in-bed cosleepers.

If you were a victim of this (as most of us were), this is perhaps the most difficult trauma to address. Before your brain and body were even fully functional, you were conditioned to ignore your needs. You were left to be profoundly lonely, to the point of absolute terror. I have not yet figured out how to get over it, but I have at least gotten in touch with the pervasive, deep, underlying sense of loneliness and abandonment. It's particularly bad when I'm trying to sleep (go figure!). Here are some things I've found that help:

&#x200B;

* **Deep breathing exercises.** This is a physiological trick that tells your body to downregulate your nervous system.
* **Yoga and stretching.** This can release tension in the muscles, which is actually just upregulated neurons that are firing too fast. The muscles just do what your nervous system tells them to do. Stretching provides feedback to your nerves telling them to relax.
* **Recognize and accept** the emotion and sensation when you feel it. I have started **labeling** the bed time anxiety for what it is: infantile abandonment. It seems to help.

&#x200B;

So far, I haven't fully overcome this nighttime anxiety, but now that I recognize it I think it's starting to fade. But at this point I'm fighting with my oldest neurological programming, patterns that have been there literally my entire life.

# Update

Someone pointed out that this idea was greatly boosted in America by [Dr. Benjamin Spock](https://www.phillyvoice.com/screaming-sleep/). I'm finding that reading up on this whole thing is very validating and helpful.

But I have learned that I can be my own family. I am trying to learn to forgive myself for the negative effects my severe child abuse had on my behaviors in my adult years. When I went into recovery, everything changed.

I will say that I am a survivor of a suicide attempt. I learned about my child abuse case in the county Court about 7 years ago. I came across it accidentally. I had been told I was born disabled by my parents. To learn at the age of 42 that I was not born disabled;  it was simply a result of my child abuse was my life's greatest nightmare. I broke. Rebuilding my life after I had tried to end it, has been the hardest thing I've ever done. At some point, I decided if they did not see my value, then I needed to see it. I worked really hard over the last 5 years. My child abuse, unfortunately, put me into renal failure. I have had two organ transplants, and  I had surgeries to get me out of a wheelchair from the bone brakes of my childhood. 

But tomorrow I turn 50. Regardless of what you did to me, I made it. Regardless of what you said that I was of little worth, I now know my life matters. I let you go, and allow myself to feel like I deserve a happy life. I will let go of my past mistakes. After my recovery, I changed quite a bit. I am not who I once was. And those who have walked away, you're missing out on the healing version of who I have become."
Struggling to cope with residual anger from fawning in light of the death of George Floyd,1044,gtr45a,136,"Edit: I just want to say I really appreciate the support from this community. I know that that’s the point of posting here, but still, I’m always deeply moved by anyone who reaches out. I didn’t know this would take off — I simply vented before going to my friends to get wasted and play video games. I appreciate everyone who responded but if I don’t get back to you for sometime forgive me as I’m a little overwhelmed. 

These past few days have been emotionally intense, especially as a black male. There have been countless times where I fawned around police out of fear — excessive smiling/eye contact, an eagerness to respond or be helpful so much so that I even waived my rights — but my anger toward them and authority figures has deeper roots in my home, and the intergenerational trauma that many African Americans carry with them because of American chattel slavery. 

My father was and still is a bully. He’s left me alone since I’ve gotten bigger and learned to stand up to him but I’ve never felt safe around him, or my
mother, who is also prone to violence because of what she has to deal with from him. Admittedly I have a harder time standing up to her — I can threaten my father physically but my mother will use her femininity to make a victim of herself, so I often just become passive around her. 

This is generational. My parents grew up around whites and know how to be presentable — wear nice clothes so they can’t smell the poor, speak “proper” english (there was a strict no slang rule at home), don’t wear baggy clothing, look people in the eye hold doors etc etc — so as to resist being seen as a stereotype. I didn’t become aware of how deeply ingrained this was in me until high school when a white friend made a sexual pass at me and I tensed up because all I could think of was reading Othello and the words “lascivious Moor” rang through my head. I immediately remembered a friend laughing about how one of our white friends definitely wasn’t a virgin because she had a black boyfriend and everyone except for me seemed to automatically understand what that meant. 

The fawning around whites could be attributed to what WEB Du Bois called double consciousness in which racial or ethnic minorities become aware of their otherness in the presence of a majority and shapeshift so to speak in order to gain acceptance and climb up the social ladder. This becomes unhealthy when it’s rooted in feelings of shame and cultural inferiority, making it different from the simple act of speaking a different dialect in a particular neighborhood. This was a survival mechanism for many African-Americans. 

These last five years I’ve been uncovering my people-pleasing and it’s been really difficult. I’m certain my ancestors were house-slaves and I’m almost always angry. Always. And what makes me really fucking angry is learning  that George Floyd didn’t resist arrest and was still murdered. And his death was only reported because it was caught.

All the bending over backwards,the shapeshifting, the denial of my African-ness is and always will be pointless in a police state with virtual immunity. And living at home is no different. The fear of violence if I don’t wash my dishes properly or lock the door to my mother’s arbitrary satisfaction mirrors the fear of violence if I absentmindedly walk into a grocery store with my hands in my pockets. 

And right now I’m exhausted. I’ve cried a well of tears. I fear the part of me that enjoys seeing the police face indiscriminate retaliatory violence. I’ve picked fights with bullies on behalf of my friends and enjoyed intimidating them. Landing blows, posturing myself as threatening, yelling — there’s a sense of pleasure I derive from it that I fear. I’ve had dreams of being able to kill murderous police officers with my bare hands. Ive had dreams of fighting my parents. 

But I choose to remain polite and respectful. Around my parents and around the police. Because even if I defend myself or respond with an OUNCE of the violence directed at me, no matter how just or fair or righteous, I know it will be a death sentence."
I had flashbacks all nite but I still got up and took care of myself,1044,lt3are,59,"Because I'm not going to abandon me. I thought about staying in bed & wasting the whole day but I got up, meditated, did yoga, took a long shower & made some hot coffee. My brain is still foggy but I feel much more at ease. I'm learning how to treat myself like someone I love."
Did anyone else just become a vegetable due to trauma?,1046,lp119e,231,"Like, I literally do nothing all day but play TFT/League or end up in my bed awake, but not able to get up. What am I supposed to do, I have no movement impairment conditions or anything, yet I just can't?"
This is terrifying because I’ve only shared this with my Psychologist.,1037,mf6vdx,205,"I’m scared to put my story out there but I’ve been lurking on this sub for awhile and everyone seems so supportive.

I was raped by my biological father from the age of 4 until I was 9. He tormented me physically, emotionally and psychologically until I was well into my 30’s. 

I’m sorry. This is all I can handle disclosing. It’s not much I know but it’s a big step for me. 

Much love to all survivors. We’re not victims anymore. ❤️ 💪🏻

Edit: My biological father committed suicide 3 weeks ago. I feel guilty for not missing him."
DAE want other people to notice that you're physically sick and exhausted but your body automatically hides it when someones around?,1040,lxj85i,111,"I'm often so physically sick that I'm extremely dizzy and in pain (often after I had triggers and stuff) but whenever someones around or asks me if I am, my whole body changes and keeps it together for as long as someone is there
And then even if I manage to tell them I feel bad they never believe me how bad it actually is because my body just hides it
I don't even want to do it
It just happens"
gentle reminder,1041,buk171,57,
There is a lot of gate keeping in the ptsd community by older white men (vets),1039,kkez4b,208,I find this in the fb groups I’m in. Since I’m a mid 20s brown guy people instantly question what I’m doing there like I should just be worrying about solving math problems or something. Especially by old white people. Is it really that inconceivable that someone can be suffering from ptsd without having been duped to serve ulterior motives under the guise of patriotism? I didn’t realize that mid 40s white men had a monopoly on suffering.
DAE get tired of their childhood trauma being such an ongoing central theme in their life?,1039,k6rhl5,74,"The abuse and neglect that I experienced from my early childhood through my teen years seems to affect everything about my life.  It affects my ability to hold a job (I've had close to 30 jobs in 20 years), it's affected my marriage (I'm separated), my health (depression, anxiety, history of hospitalizations), my ability to socialize (social anxiety), etc.  I feel so defective and broken at times.  It seems so unfair, especially when you know that most people seem to have been raised by loving supportive parents.  I wonder what their day to day lives are like if they aren't having to deal with this stuff on a daily basis."
Anyone else ever worry that THEY’RE abusive or manipulative?,1034,e8tofq,223,"Any time someone misinterperates my intentions or accuses me of this or that, I always think “wow maybe I did? Did I? Maybe I’m so blind to my own bullshit, like my mom is, and I’m just as bad as she is? AM I MY MOM? AM I MANIPULATIVE? FUUUUCCCCKKKK”

Sorry bout the f bomb. Anyone else experience this? It’s so tiring"
I asked an attractive woman out today - I was determined to overcome my fear of rejection - she said yes!,1038,kp3sig,128,"Hi, I thought I would share this anecdote with you. So I asked a barista out today during the end of her shift when the shop was quiet and she said yes and said she is looking forward to seeing me. 

The above is a huge deal for me. I was rejected by my father, and my mother, well, my mother died when I was five. The fact that both my parents were absent in some form made me fearful-avoidant in relationships. I mean, being rejected is bad enough, but being rejected by a parent and sexually/emotionally abused on top, is something else. 

I want to stress how proud of myself I am, I conquered a fear and I was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. I am an attractive and young man, but that is besides the point. People assume that by virtue of being aesthetically pleasing to the eye that that in some way that equates to how the person feels about themselves on the inside.

Lastly, I want to add that asking someone out is anxiety inducing enough, doing it with C-PTSD and in a public environment, even more so. I hope you all find yourself in a place where you can begin challenging your fears one at a time. 

Take care all.

Edit: I had a nightmare before waking up about my abuser strangling me for his own pleasure. This nightmare then turned into a realisation that I had subconsciously repressed a memory of my past. I then began to cry and proceeded to have a panic attack. I didn’t allow this to deter me in my pursuit of asking the barista out though, and merely ten hours later she said yes. 

I hope that you all continue fighting, it all counts in the end.

Turns out she isn’t looking for a relationship. To be honest, I don’t think I was either. I think I jumped at an opportunity wanting more than anything to prove myself wrong, and I did!"
Blaming CHILDREN for their daddy issues when it was the adult father who failed,1030,iwts8z,92,"Hate this so much! Definitely experienced this. Friends jokingly say I have daddy issues and don’t truly believe me when I say I was abused.

Princess Bride (Sexual assault POV changer),1029,m7ar3r,81,"I made a post in another sub about this. Not entirely sure how to flair this or if it needs a trigger warning or what to do, so if I need to delete and repost (or just delete) just lmk. Anyway, I personally lost my virginity to rape. This has been a huge struggle for me, because I hear other people talk about their first times being great and loving and ""he didn't want to hurt me, but I was ok"" or even awkward. I feel like I have to apologize for mine. A few years ago, I was in a stage adaptation of The Princess Bride. This conversation made me think:

**Buttercup**: Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?  
**Westley**: What hideous sin have you committed lately?  
**Buttercup**: I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.  
**Westley**: It never happened.  
**Buttercup**: What?  
**Westley**: It never happened.  
**Buttercup**: But it did. I was there. This old man said, ""Man and wife.""  
**Westley**: Did you say, ""I do""?  
**Buttercup**: *\[confused\]* No. We sort of skipped that part.  
**Westley**: Then you're not married. If you didn't say it, you didn't do it. 

If you didn't say ""I do"", you aren't married. If you didn't say ""yes"", it wasn't sex. Idk I just found this exchange really comforting, thought it might help someone else."
"An apology to the BIPOC who use this space, and a reaffirmation of the mod team's stance against racism.",1034,l1jrsw,62,"*EDIT: For those looking for a community focused specifically on the needs of BIPOC, check out /r/cptsd_bipoc!*

*EDIT #2: I've taken down this sticky, but this is not the end of this conversation. Read more [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/cptsd_bipoc/comments/l1juta/rcptsd_an_apology_to_the_bipoc_who_use_this_space/gkdn5mx/).*

Hey all,

A snafu by the mod team (me, specifically) yesterday has [cast doubt](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/l1g6hj/calling_on_rcptsd_mods_to_condemn_racism_or_step/) on /r/CPTSD's status as a safe space for BIPOC. So I want to take a moment to do two things: Apologize, and reiterate where we stand on racism.

Yesterday, a user publicly apologized for their participation in an argument that happened the day before, in which a white person argued with a black person about the existence of white privilege. I'll be honest with you about the main mistake I made here: I did not read this apology thread carefully. I mistook who was speaking, I glanced through it to make sure it wasn't hostile, deleted a hostile comment, wrote a stickied post about why I was leaving up a positive call-out to another user even though we typically remove call-outs (they are virtually all negative), and didn't think much more about it. The result: A thread in which someone apologized to a racist for upsetting them stayed up for 24 hours with apparent moderator approval.

Finding the right amount of energy to spend on moderating posts here is a difficult balance between burning yourself out on one extreme, and making bad calls on the other. Normally I do pretty well; here, I made a bad call.

People often come to the subreddit and express apologism for abusers of all kinds, racists included. There is a time and a place for compassion for abusers, and ""In front of an audience of their victims"" is *not* the place. We consider these Rule #1 violations, and it's under that rule that the apology post should've been removed. Instead, it stayed up, which is a betrayal to the BIPOC trying to use this space to heal. I apologize for that betrayal, and for any emotional damage it caused.

I also want to bring attention to a post the team made following the murder of George Floyd, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/comments/h0d9bn/a_note_on_current_events_racism_trauma_and_this/). That post acts as a statement of our policy regarding racism on this subreddit. I also want to draw your attention to our [Rule #3](https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSD/wiki/subrules_revised#wiki_hate_speech), which is our most strictly-enforced rule. If you see a violation of Rule #3 -- which includes overt racism, subtle racism, veiled racism, even just an indelicate discussion of race -- please report that post immediately.

I'm not really sure how to conclude this. I took my eye off the ball and I screwed up. The mod team is not in the practice of double-checking each others' work, but we may have to consider making a habit out of it; that may've caught this much sooner. This will be on my mind for a while, and we'll make whatever changes we need to on our end.

In any case, thank you all for being a part of this community.

A friendly reminder that it is not your responsibility to help others through the trauma this pandemic is creating,1026,fsuuot,92,"A common sentiment floating around trauma communities right now is that a lot of us are handling this situation more smoothly than the general population. I feel this way too. However, just because we already are accustomed to feeling this way and many of us already have coping skills for this sort of thing *does not mean that we are responsible for anyone else's emotions*. 

This is not intended as permission to be an asshole, rather a reminder that there is a difference between friendly support in rough times and emotional labor. If you struggle telling them apart (I definitely still do), remember that supporting people is usually something that makes you feel better because you helped someone out. Emotional labor generally makes you feel drained because you just took on the other person's trauma *for* them, rather than simply holding a sign that points to the next oasis. 

And remember to put your metaphorical oxygen mask on first before you help someone else with theirs."
You don't have to be a doormat to be a good person,1027,hqx5t9,67,"My trauma response is to fawn, so I have always given in and given up what I need if it meant avoiding hurting/annoying/irritating someone else.  But today I realized that being a good person does not mean hurting yourself to avoid inconveniencing others!

I can be kind in how I express my needs, and I can be a good person in how I empathize with how my needs impact others. 

Suffering is a part of life, and that's ok. The needs of others might inconvenience me, and my needs might inconvenience others. That's normal! Your needs are just as important as anyone else's! Your needs matter even if others might have to compromise for them!"
"Please support each other here. We usually don't downvote each other because this a support group, a different kind of sub than what you might be used to.",1030,l20vkt,108,"It's different if someone is causing problems or breaking rules though, be sure to report it to the moderators.  But generally if someone has an opinion we don't agree with, unless it's invalidating or offensive we generally don't downvote just because we don't like it."
He just... apologized.,1023,ggtp50,56,"I left an abusive marriage a little over a year ago and now I am dating a man who is just a wonderful human being. Today he made a joke that just sort of hit me the wrong way and I told him it made me angry. 

And he didn’t tell me I was overreacting. He didn’t tell me to stop being so sensitive. He didn’t gaslight me. He just apologized - and meant it. He was genuinely sorry for hurting my feelings in even a trivial way. 

It was all over in less than five minutes, but it was such a validating experience."
DAE feel jealous of children?,1025,loi5tr,153,"Before I get downvoted for this, hear me out. 

Ever so often, I catch myself getting triggered by my 9 year old niece, a lovely little girl. As petty as that sounds, I think I know why. 

My niece is an only child and is loved and pampered to bits, sometimes to an unreasonable degree. She has this unshakeable sense of protection, of being loved and treasured. Every time she is not the center of attention, her parents makes sure she is. They cajole her and shower her with attention. She is never allowed the opportunity to feel like she's second-place, ever. Never had to experience shame or fear for being who she is.

I catch myself feeling uncomfortable when this happens. And as a woman in her mid-thirties, it's followed my toxic, internal shame. 'Get a grip woman! You're not a child! What's wrong with you?'

But I know why. It reminds me of my days as an emotionally neglected child when I had no one to protect me. To prioritize me. To make me feel secure. To make me feel loved. I grew up with a skewed view on love and life. And when I look at her, all I feel is envy. I am filled with grief for a childhood I never had. The hard lessons I was forced to learn as a young kid that the world doesn't revolve around me. That I never had the luxury to grow up feeling safe or to feel enough. Hell, to actually dare to feel like I was entitled to love or happiness. I am jealous. I am jealous and angry. 

And in moments like these, I try to speak to the child within me, to remind her that she is safe. But the journey has been long, hard and exhausting. Sometimes it feels undoable and I don't know whether she(the child within me) will ever feel whole. But I guess I owe it to her to give it my best shot

Thanks for hearing me out"
Emotional neglect is hard because you have to manually rewire your brain,1022,hhl80x,90,"I think that most healthy people are in touch with their emotions, and so they act according to them. They aren't ashamed of them, they don't hide them, they just act accordingly.

Having always neglected my emotions, now when I am in touch with them and act accordingly, it feels super different, like I'm thinking in a different dimension.

That's why emotional neglect is fucked up. Your brain is hardwired in a **false, unhelpful** way. And to heal you have to manually rewire your brain to the true human emotions."
I wrote a research paper that got the attention of experts,1022,kwazee,64,"Hey fellow cptsd people, I'm in the middle of a huge victory and just wanted to share.

&#x200B;

For the past year I've been working on a research paper about language, and after months of debating whether to share a draft version (And certainly, I thought, be ignored or hated!), I went ahead and put it online. It... actually got a pretty big response, and a positive one at that, at least here on reddit. Yesterday I reached out to experts in the field and I'm getting some critiques from the big boys! I never had a teacher in this subject, so being treated in a teacherly way feels rewarding somehow.

Like yeah, I might cry a little, but it will only be a little! Just being seen feels overwhelmingly positive."
"As an American, I am so sick and tired of having a new trigger every damn week. There is no peace here. :( Anyone else?",1013,kusftm,149,"hatred, violence, gaslighting, narcissism, lying, people building very strong beliefs based on nothing factual, racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, more gaslighting, a government under attack, invalidation, government attacking us, divide, anger, I can’t find a moment outside of a trigger. And those triggers make me so vulnerable to my actual CPTSD triggers, and I’m tired and I’m scared and I’m sad and I just want all of this to end. Like I want to turn off the news/social media for the sake of my mental health but also I can’t because I need to know if/when I’m in eminent danger."
"""Only toxic people have trouble with maintaining friends"" Don't make me barf",1008,jpzjf6,115,"Saw a comment of this nature as a post reply and it really rubbed me the wrong way. Because if anything it's the people that don't conform to the toxicity of the groups is when other people see them as flawed and shut them out in a million different spoken and unspoken ways. What many of us do here is a response to the chronic social rejection. It's isolation from toxic people that only want to do whatever they can to you until you eventually burn out and give in to their every whim and become a shell of a person.

In fact, I've noticed that in most friend groups they  are basically just crabs in a barrel that don't want you to reach higher than you already are. Or think too much outside of them.

It's the people that don't instantly fit in that push away these toxic forms of living and then have to suffer for it. I'm sick of people that job hop, don't have friends, and don't have real family being demonized. I'm sick of it!


So anyone that thinks a lack of friendship or close familial relationship is a sign of a toxic person can screw off!"
"DAE feel like they can’t handle life, and wish they could take a break to heal?",1008,j138th,183,"Sometimes I get overwhelmed with things in life. Things that I feel are relatively easy to “normal” people.

Sometimes I wish I could take a break from everything, that I could do some kind of emotional “rehab” to get well enough to function again.

It’s weird how small failures can sometimes make me want to give it all up."
Why isn't their mandatory therapy for every person before they bring a child into this world?,1013,i5nx97,93,"I know money can be an issue, but that's why I think it should be available to everyone regardless of income bracket. 

Do you believe that this could be useful?"
"Reminder: Attacking people, excluding people, or generalizing based on a diagnosis (BPD, NPD, etc) is against the rules.",1015,jjtgta,87,"Hello all,

Over the last couple months, we've received some feedback that too often in this community, people direct hostility or unfairly discriminate against other people with certain diagnoses. We've encouraged those who gave that feedback to report more instances of it when they see it, but that doesn't seem to have improved the problem.

We do tolerate a small degree of this hostility, partially because a large portion of our community comes from /r/RaisedByNarcissists, a subreddit that is basically built around hostility towards a diagnosis, and because of the pervasiveness throughout the psychological community of an anti-BPD bias. These are pretty big forces acting on the community, and we therefore tolerate a low-level of struggle with these ideas, in hopes that people would use this space to grow out of an ""Us versus Them""-style mindset, where there's ""Those bastards who abuse people"" on one side and ""People like me, who got hurt"" on the other, and nobody in between.

But that tolerance only goes so far. We want to emphasize: Hostility, discrimination, exclusion, or generalizations about a given diagnosis fall under Rule #3, which prohibits hate speech. Using a diagnosis like a slur is hate speech, as is casually subbing out words like ""abusive"" or ""toxic"" with a diagnosis.

Remember: CPTSD is a relatively recent concept, and there is a lot of overlap between it and other diagnoses, especially the need to recover from trauma. This subreddit does not in any way narrow its target audience by an actual diagnosis. If the conversations here resonate with you, you are welcome here. It's that simple.

Thank you all for being a part of this community.

"It's okay to need certain levels of convenience for your living situation (eg. spending extra on take-out, cleaning services, higher rent for a single bedroom or a place closer to transport). You're not being spoiled, you simply understand what you can and can't currently handle.",1011,ef7j8d,92,"This one's a tough one, and I know obviously not everyone can financially afford what they need. But I just wanted to speak out that it's *okay* if you need certain things to help with your emotional/mental/physical state. You're not being spoiled, you just know that without certain conveniences, things can go downhill *fast* for you. 

You know what you can and can't handle right now, and it's okay to say ""I can't handle meal-planning and cooking every single day, I'm going to budget more for buying take-out"".

In fact, the ""spending on take-out"" one is the one I allow myself the most. I spend a *lot* on buying take-out food, because 99/100 days I am not in a state to get up and make food, much less plan meals for the week. It's either I spend on take-out, or I end up not eating.

Can everyone do this? No. And I get that. But if you can reduce spending in other areas like I do (since money is limited), then it's okay to do it. If it means I actually eat and the chore doesn't mentally cripple me for days, I will budget for it. I will reduce spending in other areas so that I can spend on food. Because it's what I need.

This also goes for others who may need to pay for a cleaning service, or pay for higher rent so they can get a single bedroom instead of having roommates, or to live closer to public transport or to their workplace.

It's hard to explain to others sometimes that you'd rather do handmade Christmas presents this year because you need to spend it on take-out food, or that you can't save on rent by moving in with roommates because your mental health would decline *fast*, or that your gym membership is *absolutely necessary* because exercising at the gym is the only thing that's keeping you afloat.

People who say things like, ""Just move to a cheaper place"" or ""Just get your friends to help for free"", may not understand that in fact *they* are the ones with the luxury. 

But at the very least, know that I get it. I know there are certain things which others may see as ""spoiled"", but I see as you knowing what you can and can't currently handle. And I don't think you're spoiled at all, but that you're smart. You're not hurting anyone, you're just trying to get by. And that looks different for everyone, and I get it."
DAE want to stay in state of deep chill far away from people?,1007,mh4niw,144,"I just want to lie in bed, in a cute cabin in a forrest with a beautiful lake view, watching funny videos, not having to talk to any humans or do any adulting.

"""You were never listened to, and that's why it hurts you so much to be unheard now""",1011,fx5io9,38,"Hi everyone. I hope you are all taking things slowly and being gentle on yourselves today. 


My childhood was quiete hard. To condense a long story, my paternal family sexually and emotionally abused me, and because my mother is on the spectrum she was never able to understand or protect me from said abuse no matter how much I begged her to. 


Today I came downstairs in tears. I'd had the same nightmares of screaming at injustice and being unheard. I wanted to get in a physical fight, to hit a wall or harm myself, just to get some of the tension and rage out. I admittedly projected it a little onto those around me, while simultaneously apologising for being demanding of rights that no one has denied me in a long time.


My mothers sister, who is neuroptyical, said the words I've always wanted to hear. Throughout my childhood I was always told I was too much. That I needed an inhuman amount of love and attention which no person could provide me, that the reason I felt unloved, unheard, and unimportant was because I was asking for too much. At some point, I began to believe it and project it onto others. I started to become angry at anyone who wanted my love or my support, because I was so convinced that my lack of these things was the norm. I though that anyone who lent on me was asking too much, or manipulated me, when I wanted a shoulder just as much as them if not more.


She told me ""you were never listened to, or given the love and attention you deserve. (My mother) loves you, a lot, but she has never in her life been able to show that the way other people do even as a child. You dont have to forgive her for that, but you do have to let go of the anger, because you're the only one suffering for it. You didnt need too much, you had not enough, and that wasnt your fault.""



I almost cried. I dont think I've heard anyone tick so many boxes of what I needed to hear before. That it wasnt me being a brat, that I didnt somehow traumatise myself by needing more than was fair, I was just a child in a bad situation.


I feel heard, finally, about not being heard. I feel believed about not being believed. And it's so cathartic.




(I'm not at all trying to suggest autistic people are abusive or bad or anything like that. I love my mother dearly and have autistic friends and room mates. She just wasnt equipped emotionally for me, which wasnt all her fault but also isnt mine. Every person on the spectrum is different.)



Edit: I know this is regarded as cringe but I wanted to say thank you for both the guild-ings and for the up votes. Karma isnt important, but knowing nearly a thousand people have heard my story and could relate to it overwhelmed me with the fact that we arent as alone in this as we feel. I'm sorry so many of you can relate, but thankful not to be alone in this."
Does anyone feel like learning a skill is a huge barrier thanks to their trauma? Like even attempting it is a trigger?,1010,llbbl4,113,"I want to be good at things instantly and have no kindness for myself at all. I’m highly critical of myself in all that I do. 

My mom was my primary bully and tormentor growing up. She didn’t teach me any skills because it was an inconvenience to her. Until she saw value in me and my “natural skill” for cooking did she allow me in her kitchen. She barred me from ever going in there. 

She wouldn’t let me watch the Food Network because I was overweight from how she fed me and medical treatments for asthma—I remember being 8 years old and her telling me “only fat people watch these shows”. And I didn’t bother watching them again for a long time. I don’t enjoy cooking or any hobbies at all because of things she’s done. When I made desserts for friends during high school, she told me to stop because “only fat people bring those things to potlucks”. She told me stories about how the fattest grossest people randomly bring in food to work and people secretly made fun of them. So I just stopped bringing things for people. I wasn’t even that fat but she ruined food for me. 

She refused to teach me anything. As an adult, she laughed at me for not having skills. I taught myself everything I pretty much know. But when it comes to complex things like wrapping a present or learning art, I give up almost instantly because I have no patience for myself. 

I really want to learn guitar, roller skating, and sewing but I know it will be a self-critical and angry journey for me. I want to do it for fun and for me, not for attention either. But I really struggle here. 

I have to be patient with myself to even do hobbies—which should be enjoyable! I wish I was a good enough person to be valued and interesting enough for my parents. It makes navigating adulthood so much harder. I feel lower than dirt more often than not. I can’t believe I have to go to therapy to do a fucking hobby.

ETA: I’m so sad so many of you can relate. I hope we can heal and have access to these fun things like our peers. I know I said I feel like dirt but I’m working on fixing that narrative. I know we deserve better, even if we don’t feel it right now. Thanks for commenting."
Anyone else have NO major life celebrations?,1003,jutfk5,164,"I turned into a sobbing mess at work the other day because a co-worker was throwing a baby shower for another co-worker, for her fourth baby. Somehow, a switch went off in me and I very suddenly realised - no one ever celebrated my life events with me. 

No wedding celebration. ""No one is going to want to come to your wedding - they are a waste of money.""

No college graduation. ""You just did what was expected"".

No baby shower. ""A friend has to throw one for you. Not family. If you don't have a friends willing to do that, maybe you just don't have any real friends.""

No gifts for my wedding. No flowers or gifts from anyone when I had my daughters. No ""congratulations"" when I graduated or got a great job. 

There was one celebration - a high school graduation party. High school was hard for me, due to a school shooting. I managed to pick myself up enough to graduate a year early, homeschooling myself. My mom threw a party for herself to celebrate that she ""got [me] through high school"". She invited her friends. None of my family or friends. The party was really for her, not me. 

I'm not a materialistic person. I live simply, within my means. It isn't about the gifts. It's about how inhuman I feel, knowing that no one saw anything worth celebrating in my life achievements. 

I can't be the only one, right? Please, someone say they've experienced this, too. 

How do you learn to celebrate your own achievements?"
Just because they were doing the best they could doesn’t mean it’s wasn’t abuse,1004,cvxnu1,117,"Your parents may have been doing what they thought was right for you. Or they may have been barely scraping by emotionally themselves. But none of that has any bearing on whether what they did to you was traumatizing, or whether it indirectly encouraged unhealthy coping mechanisms that you’re still struggling with today. There intentions don’t make your pain any less real, and don’t let anyone ever tell you otherwise."
I think eventually we'll find out that untreated Cptsd/Dtd is so endemic that it's basically the source of most mental illness.,1002,c7e2g4,259,"This is just a theory, and I might be wrong. Let me explain.

I think that, at least in the West, we will come to realize that untreated developmental trauma, or interpersonal trauma, is the reason of most mental health issues, at least excluding those with a heavily genetic cause.

Trauma is the core experience and then, it takes different forms according to cultural configurations and temperament.
This is why you often have families with ""narcissistic father and codependent mother"", or the reason why psychiatry believes borderline is more prevalent in women and narcissism in man. Basically, we get traumatized and then the hurt and coping strategies follow a cultural pattern/script. Men are more typically socialized into resolving trauma with aggression or lack of emotion, women with submission and emotions.

 As long as the cultural pattern is followed, society as a whole don't see the problem with dysfunction and abuse and it get normalized.

Purely my belief, but people with other kind of symptoms that dont follow a strict cultural script, including us, are the ones that are ""pathologized"" and suffer the most because we also feel like we don't belong in the madness without knowing a true alternative. But honestly, we're also the ones that have the potential to heal the culture just by healing ourselves. Remember this the next time you're feeling like your recovery is wasting your life.

Maybe we wouldn't have chosen it.. But since we're in it, seeing the bigger, bigger picture might help.

Edit 2: Thanks for the Silver and Gold!"
DAE feel like you just want someone to be proud of you? Well I'm fucking proud of you,1002,kvox4r,53,"I feel like I just want someone to be proud of the progress I have made, what i have had to overcome just to be normal.

I find with my parents I tend to not be good enough. And right now i may not be 100% better but god damn i am trying and i honestly feel if no one else is going to, I am fucking proud of myself for getting this far and achieving what I have no matter how small.

And I'm fucking proud of all of you too, even of right now you think you're in a hole and making a mess of things. I know it's not your fault and you are fucking trying even when you think you've given up, some part you hasn't and you know that.

Not only are we aiming to fix our own trauma to live a richer, more fulfilling life for ourselves but we are aiming to end the cycle of abuse and that my friend deserves recognition."
"Tried talking to my closest friend about trauma. Told him that without medication, I constantly want to kill myself. Wondering if his response was as shitty as I think it was.",1005,kmm7ea,247,"He criticized me for taking medication, as he often does, and I told him that without it, I'm suicidal all the time. His response was ""No one can know that they want to die, because no one knows what dying is like.""

What an invalidating load of pseudo-philosophical bullshit, IMO. When I was being vulnerable and opening up about something serious. 

And he seems to think that his statement should just cure me of suicidal tendencies. 

How would you react to being told this?"
"In the past few years, I’ve noticed that my tolerance for being treated badly has gone down a lot. It prompts me to remove myself from bad situations, but it also means I’m spending a lot more time feeling annoyed and upset over small things.",999,kkv4j3,80,"When I say mistreatment, I’m mainly talking about subtle things like someone snapping at me or saying something to me in an irritated tone, interrupting me and not seeming sorry about it, having a question I asked/a suggestion I made being ignored, passive aggressive remarks directed at me, or having someone nitpick/disagree with me over something extremely pedantic, or seeing someone roll their eyes at something I do/say. 

When I was younger I would sort of “brush off” mistreatment directed at me. I was treated a lot worse back then, and it did upset me of course, but I often wouldn’t even notice when I was being “subtly” mistreated in the ways I listed above. I guess I was very used to mistreatment, hence why I was more able to tolerate it. I often attracted very unhealthy friendships as a result. 

Nowadays, I pick up on “bad vibes” quickly. If I’m around someone who is displaying those behaviours towards me, I notice. I get stress tummy aches and my heart rate increases, and I just feel the urge to get away from the situation as quickly as possible. It’s so much worse if I’m the only one being treated that way. I find that I dwell on things for ages and just feel really annoyed and upset. I’m a lot more quick to cut off friendships in which I’m treated badly and my standards for close friends are a lot higher, whereas when I was younger, I would often endure having the most unbelievably rude things said to me, just for the sake of not wanting to be friendless. 

Obviously this is really good, but I also wish that I didn’t get upset and bothered so easily by these things. I just felt like sharing this because it’s an interesting thing I’ve realised about myself upon reflection. Can anyone relate? It would be interesting to hear people’s thoughts.

Edit: Wow this blew up. Thank you for the awards! I’ve read all the replies and they are so good and insightful! The solidarity has been lovely!"
Dae feel like the parent that stands by and does nothing was being abusive too?,1006,jadryx,190,"I just had an interesting therapy session in which my therapist said that basically both my parents were abusive. My father physically and my mother by doing nothing to protect me. She says that they were both extremely harmful. 

I'm finding this really hard to accept even though I know it is true. My father was a monster, but right now I'm actually more upset with my mother. She was supposed to be the decent parent, but I'm starting to realize she possibly harmed me just as much.

She never protected me. She would make me hide the abuse, I was told to never tell anyone, to lie about bruises and broken bones. I was told to adjust my behavior so as not to enrage my father and basically I was told to just accept to be treated like crap. And to this day I struggle with protecting my boundaries and even accepting that I have boundaries that need to be respected. 

I'm just so angry, but also feel really bad that I'm now realizing that I really had nobody. I kind of don't want to accept that. I just want to view her as the one good parent I thought I had left.

Can anyone relate? And if so, how do you deal with it? Did you confront the enabling parent about their behavior? 

It's one thing to come to terms with having one abusive parent, but to now see that I actually don't have anyone... Feels like a whole new kind of pain..."
My mother said something to me that amazed me and pissed me off at the same time,1001,hgxhhy,85,"""Ever since you were little you would apologize to me all the time like you were scared or something.""

WHAT AMAZING PERCEPTION PAIRED WITH COMPLETE LACK OF SELF AWARENESS"
I feel so gaslighted by the constant societal messaging of: “you need to learn how to validate yourself and not rely on others”,1005,mfqtlm,161,"I really do get where people are coming from but come on. This whole concept makes me angrier than I can explain. As much as it is partly in truth, how could it actually be possible to embody a feeling you’ve never even experienced before? 
I just read an article that said, “If we want to connect with a person, we do it because we genuinely want to connect with him or her. Not because we want something back, or we’re afraid of being alone.”

Honestly, I would do anything to be able to exist this way in the world. Of course I genuinely want to connect with people authentically. But when I grew up in a “family” that makes me feel no sense of worth, belonging, or love, how could I seriously NOT be afraid of being alone or wanting a certain outcome, like a healthy version of love being given back to me? Is that seriously too much to want out of life? 

What about all the studies that prove a greater feeling of well-being in people who feel a sense of community and support by those around them?  

Ugh I just feel so frustrated and stuck about how to overcome this I can’t even think straight sometimes. As much as I hate this concept I actually wish it was true so I could stop feeling so controlled by my trauma...

"I didn’t have poor social skills, I had trauma",1002,i0acxh,142,"One of the dead ponies my family likes to beat is my poor social skills. I’ve been told by my family that I have poor social and emotional skills since childhood, starting around the first grade and intensifying until I moved out. It’s still the accepted story that comes up every now and then. 

Well, guess what. I don’t think it was poor social skills. It was trauma. Besides, what child actually has good social skills? They’re still learning! Maybe help them out or explain what they did wrong instead of putting them down. 

Such a productive thing to adopt as a building block for one’s identity too. By the time I was in my early teens, I decided that since I was so bad with people, I couldn’t let people matter to me. I could not value personal connections highly and get rejected daily, that would destroy me. Smart kid, well thought out! But see what I did there? I assumed that the “bad with people” part was an immutable truth (I had it repeated to me often enough), so I had to change something else. What if I had believed otherwise?

Just the other day my sibling told me my social skills are “elementary”. Just. Thanks. That’s such very helpful, actionable feedback. How come nobody outside of my immediate family ever tells me this? Is it something people are too embarrassed to say to my face? How come I get along nicely with 99% of the people I meet and people seem to generally like me well? Well enough to make me feel like such a fake, because actually I’m bad with people. Sure, I feel like an awkward shit in social situations and sometimes struggle. But I guess everybody struggles sometimes and that’s normal?

Just. I’ve believed I have poor people skills since before I understood the term. How would I even know if that’s true? Do I feel awkward because I’m awkward or because I’ve been made to believe I’m awkward? How do I rewire my brain to look at social situations without the lense of awkwardness?

I hate how unpacking my trauma keeps turning everything upside down and inside out. I feel like can’t trust anything I know about myself or the world &amp; like I have to relearn things other people learnt before their first full decade."
"DAE feel triggered when hearing people use the generic term ""they did the best they could"" when referring to parenting?",1002,jnah6y,108,"No sorry, sometimes parents don't do their best. They can do better.
Sometimes their best is shite.
Sick of hearing that phrase as if just having children and hoping for the best is ""doing their best"""
AskReddit is driving me up the wall right now,1003,jj2b3b,176,"CW: mention of suicidal ideation and conversion therapy 

There's a question asking, ""teachers of reddit, what's a sign a child is being abused?"" with teachers cascading their FBI skills in how they could tell a student was being abused.

I remember in high school up going to the counselors and telling teachers about it, but because nothing ""physical"" was happening and I wasn't on the street, nobody was called. I was suicidal, not doing too hot in my grades, and crying a lot. I had to send my mail to the school when I was applying to colleges so my mom wouldn't find out, and nobody batted an eye.

Nobody was called. I felt like I had slipped through the cracks. I can't emphasize how much better I'm doing now that I left that house. I'm close to graduating cum laude, two degrees, and applying for law school.

It's not about how I ended up, though. It's that loss of potential if I had also done well in high school. It's the therapy sessions I had to go to and still need. I felt like I was parenting myself in high school, and now I have to reparent again to get rid of the instincts I no longer need and are holding me back. If someone, anyone, had been able to get me out of my house earlier, I would have fared better.

I was a teenager. The adults did nothing for me other than, ""of course your mom loves you!"" and ""oh, just tell her you're bi/atheist, she'll accept you!"" Bitch CALL SOMEONE she wanted to enroll me into conversion therapy and is cutting my communication off to the outside world.

I know teachers are underpaid and there are the ones that are just in it for the summer vacation, but shit. It didn't have to be this way.

EDIT: Checked back to this post, and I see a really struck a nerve. I'm sorry y'all. Many of y'all wished me healing, and I wish y'all healing as well. We should be the adults we wish we had as a kid."
Just wanna say thanks 💜. This is almost the only non-trans specific subreddit where I feel safe being out as trans. I appreciate it,1003,cwxzf1,127,"Basically just what the title says. I’m sure it’s partly cos a disproportionate number of trans people have CPTSD but I still appreciate that I’m not scared to talk about being trans here. 💜

Edit: Folks thank you all so much for the support, this means so much. I didn’t realise this would get so many responses, and I appreciate the support and love so much!! I also wanna say that personal experiences with being trans or gender diverse are complex — there have been lots of times I’ve needed support trying to figure stuff out to do with my gender and also support for trying to survive in a transphobic society. I’ve put the information for trans/LGBT counselling lines and/or trans networks, in case seeing this post caught anyone off-guard and they’re wanting to reach out and get support.

DAE feel like they can spot toxic/dangerous people better than others can?,1003,j7chc3,176,"I've encountered manipulative people over the years that I've known were trouble but others have just brushed their actions off and acted like I was overreacting when I brought their attention to these people's behaviours/comments.

I feel like because of my experiences with people close to me (family and ex) which resulted in my C-PTSD, I can spot people like them from a mile away. 

It feels like a crappy superpower because no one else seems to see what I can until it blows up in their face or someone else's or even mine.
 
Does anyone else feel like they can see the world and people more clearly than NON-C-PTSD sufferers?"
I feel like I have to work through all the generational trauma shit while everyone else in my family is having a better life because they threw their unprocessed shit onto me,996,j1ddlo,78,"This makes me feel so helpless, infuriated and being treated unfair, that I honestly feel like detonating.
I want to fucking throw all of their goddamn shit back and punch them so hard, they won’t ever get up again. Not only did they pass on their traumata but they also gave me new ones. 
I don’t have much contact to them but what I see from time to time is that they’re doing the things that I secretly wanted to do while I am left with their problems from the last time I saw them. Like they swap and steal everything that was good from me and shove their ugliness inside of me, their fears, problems and so on.

Might be not what’s going on but it feels and looks like this at least for one part inside of me and what I read about systemic therapy, epi genetics and transgenerational traumata, wants to make me throw up so hard.

I DONT WANT THIS TO BE FUCKING HAPPENING !!! THEY SHALL DEAL WITH THEIR SHIT AND NOT ME JUST BECAUSE THEY MADE ME GO TO THERAPY WHILE THEY CAN LIVE WITHOUT PAIN. 

gaaa. I don’t know if that makes even sense to anyone but I feel like I am burning inside and cannot direct my anger to the responsible persons.

EDIT (attempt 2) 20:36, 03.10.20

i tried to respond to you, first attempt about 2hrs ago failed miserably, I don’t know if it works now. 

I don’t know what to say or how to (idksndlxofkamnxlnyk) <- summary of thing I don’t know and cannot describe and makes my entire ME .... (jwnabxkskybyjfj) .....cannot verbalize, brain error, probably limbic and trauma stuff)

have to stop, too close to trauma"
"On going no-contact: ""But she's your *mother*!"" ""Exactly. So think about how bad it must have really been then, for me to choose to go no-contact with them.""",995,dcjefp,109,"Sometimes I want to respond, ""Do you think I'm any different than you? Do you think I somehow had a very small threshold for forgiveness, or that I am cruel, or that I just didn't give enough of a damn? 

No. I am a human, just like you. And I wanted a good mother, just like you, and just as badly as you. And I could *never* have imagined going no-contact with my mother, just like you can't imagine it right now. 

So the fact that I *did*, and the fact that you are reacting this way, demonstrates *exactly how bad it was*. It was *so bad* that you, like myself, could not even *fathom* doing it, and yet still had to. 

*That* is how much pain they caused me. An *unimaginable* amount of pain."""
I was going to kill myself this morning and disassociating saved me.,997,i9lst7,156,"I had a huge fight with my partner and she told me to go kill myself. She added that I should have done it 6 months ago and she and the kids would be better off without me. 

I wrote my letters and loaded the gun and walked to the dam. I was trying to figure out the best shot for success and set myself up. I fired a trial shot to make sure the gun was working ok. 

I was flicking between hysterical crying with full body pain and disassociating. Every time I disassociated I was calm and figured out I couldn’t guarantee a clean kill. I knew a failed shot would cause a terrible situation for myself and my kids. 

That’s what saved me. My partner found me and took the gun off me while I was disassociating. 

There’s no magical happy ending. She rang my father who said I should be hospitalised. Instead we went to our marriage counselling appointment. 

We are working through our shit. This may be the absolute low point that saves our marriage and family. And it might not. 

But tonight I am calm and don’t have ideation. I’m planning for my future again. I’m sober. 

It’s ok to disassociate to get through trauma. It’s a skill that has saved me as a child and it saved me today. It’s not a weakness."
"If you think you're being overdramatic and it wasn't that bad, that is itself an indicator of trauma!",1001,erwyxy,71,"\*bangs pots and pans\*

If you think you're being overdramatic and it wasn't that bad, that is itself evidence that you're NOT being dramatic and it WAS that bad!!! 

When you try to minimize and invalidate your feelings by saying those things, it is actually validating your trauma. It is a trauma response. If you have a trauma response, you have trauma. Your brain is trying to protect you from feeling the full force of your pain. Your inner critic is trying to deceive you into blaming yourself for abuse that's your abuser's fault, not yours. Who benefits from the narrative that you're overdramatic and it wasn't that bad? Your abuser, who needs you to keep believing you're overdramatic and it wasn't that bad so they can keep getting away with the abuse and keep you blaming yourself and not them. Did your abuser tell you or otherwise make you feel that you were overdramatic and it wasn't that bad? Then that's your abusive inner critic talking, not you. And if your inner critic is telling you you're overdramatic and it wasn't that bad, then buddy, I have some news for you.

DAE find themselves intellectualising (defence mechanism) due to childhood trauma?,992,jvyhp4,156,"I do this all the damn time. When something traumatic happens I try to figure out why said person has said or done that one thing, or try to figure out and justify the psychology behind their actions rather than exploring your own personal difficult emotions associated with that event? 

It would be great in the context if I were to be a therapist/counsellor one day haha, but I really struggle to accept my own emotions as they are, letting them sit there and process them is probably one of the most difficult things I’m doing as I embark on my path to healing from childhood abuse. 

Please tell me I’m not the only one!"
"I am so tired, and so sad, I just want to lay in bed for a few days and turn my life off, but I can’t... does anyone else ever feel this way when the weight of your pain is just too heavy to bare?",988,krfpgm,72,"This has been the hardest year of my life by far. My abusers turned my life into a living hell in the later months of 2019 and the first few months of 2020, which luckily pushed me to finally move out. But then I was all alone, locked down during the pandemic with all the pain that comes along with being free for the first time. I failed my last semester of school when I was supposed to graduate instead. I lost my two best friends in the world. My only remaining friend tried to take sexual advantage of my emotionally vulnerable position. A guy I began seeing raped me multiple times because I was used to people bulldozing over the boundaries I set and I kept giving him second chances. 

The summer and fall brought a lot of lovely times as I continued therapy, made healthy friendships and a healthy romantic relationship, and took much better care of myself. However, to end off the year, amidst my abusive family making many more efforts to get in touch with me even though I’m NC, and spending Christmas all alone, I had an unplanned pregnancy and abortion. 

Now I’m just exhausted. I need to feel this sadness, I need to let it roll over me and just collapse for a few days. I can’t be strong anymore. I’m so tired of being strong, getting out of bed everyday and seeing people and trying to enjoy happy moments, fulfilling my roles at work, getting groceries and keeping my living space clean and tidy. I just need some time to break down. But I can’t. 

Has anyone else felt this way before? Maybe I need to call in sick to work and have a small stress leave."
Anyone else really good at predicting behavior and outcomes?,995,kbrfur,209,"Not sure if I’m just a psychic or very traumatized, but I’m very good at predicting what someone will do next and the outcomes of certain situations. I tend to see through people’s bullshit and deception very quickly and it’s almost scary how accurate I am. I also have a very strong kind of like gut feelings. Like if I feel like someone is sus, 9 out of 10 times they are actually doing some really shady things. I’m not sure if this is just something I learned to do through self preservation and survival, because otherwise I don’t know what it is."
Do you ever doubt your own sanity because nobody in your life acknowledges that you’ve had a toxic and traumatic childhood full of emotional neglect and abuse (including the people that caused the trauma)?,994,m191hg,102,"I feel like I’m totally stuck in life because of my traumatic childhood, but the moment I started setting boundaries (for example by canceling family meetings because of my burn out) most family members just ignored me, criticized me or even got mad.

They know that bad things have happened and most of them are in therapy for it, but they don’t seem to acknowledge part of the trauma and the severity of it. It’s like they are in denial or just don’t see it. Or maybe it was different for them. I never shared my troubles/emotions with anyone because I felt like there was no room for it and I had to be the strong and supportive one, so I guess that's why they don’t see how hard it has been/still is for me?

Anyway, I was wondering if more people felt the same way. It’s always ‘good’ to know you’re not the only one..."
As much as I love this sub I think it does more harm than good long term. To heal is to leave here imo.,987,j80sgr,197,"When I first figured out  that I had CPTSD I loved coming here and having people to talk to about my issues.  But as I've started working to heal myself and make myself a better man I find this sub to be terribly triggering and negative to my mindset.  Seeing post after post about the pain and suffering you've gone through doesn't do me any good when I'm trying to heal from that pain and suffering.  My advice, don't stick around here too long. Learn what your problem is, be content in the knowledge that you are not alone and take hope from the fact that you can heal and then get to work.   I can't afford therapy so my healing comes in the forms of yoga, meditation, exercise, reading, journaling and affirmations.  I spend my time on reddit in subs that are helping me put my life back together with practical advice such as personal & poverty finance, yoga, meditation and fasting.  Good luck everyone."
"Emotionally immature people who think emotions are weakness and who turn to ""pure logic"" think that not having emotions is strength. It's not. *Having* emotions and doing what you need to do anyway, is strength.",984,i7cyp4,67,"They can't deny their own humanity, as much as they try to. They believe that logic is truth and emotions are an illusion. But in reality, both logic and emotions are truth, they're just too afraid to learn to navigate the latter and so deem it some ""unknowable"" distraction. Just because something is more easily written down doesn't mean it is ""better"" than things that are more complicated. Their lack of ability to fully explain emotions doesn't make ""emotions"" at fault."
"If someone tells you they don’t like being touched, STOP TOUCHING THEM",992,j4rxa9,97,"I can’t for the life of me understand why people ignore this. I have told people I don’t like being touched because of sexual abuse and within a day they’re still lightly touching me because it’s their “way of affection”. 

I’ve complained to others about someone touching me after I told them not to, and I hear crap like “well that’s just how they are, that’s how they show affection”.

People don’t get it. At all. I literally dissociate, feel anxiety, disgust, and fear when I’m touched. My body goes into fight or flight. If you really cared you would take what I said seriously and stop triggering me. All you’re doing is making me hate you. 

Maybe people think that a rub on the arm or a pat on the shoulder is “okay” because it’s quick and innocuous for the average person but that’s not what my body reads. When I say I don’t like touch, I MEAN IT. 

You don’t have permission to cherry-pick a couple gestures and assume they’re harmless to me after I have already explained my boundaries. “I don’t like being touched” does not mean “a quick pat on the shoulder is okay”. 

Why is this so hard for some people to grasp?"
DAE feel like they would’ve been an extravert if they didn’t have a terrible childhood?,987,ifhckt,132,"In fact, I was quite extraverted and outgoing as a child, always getting in trouble with the teachers for talking too much, and trying to make friends with everyone, and I mean *everyone*. But my spawn points “punishing” me every time I would talk to much, kids bullying me for trying to be their friends, teachers constantly singling me out, and not be allowed to hang out with friends because of all the stress placed on getting perfect grades and being the best of the best lead me to eventually becoming a socially crippled introvert. 

I’m not even sure as I count as an introvert because i’m extremely outgoing with my friends and people I know for a fact that i’ll never see again, but i’m so cripplingly anxious around other people and enjoy being alone because I know I wont be hurt. Is anyone else like this?"

I wish more people would understand that many times abusive people aren't abusive 100% of the time.,982,cnys8f,95,"""Hey Pattyice, your family can't be that bad, they took you to disney land!""

16 years of therapy, a suicide attempt, three addictions, rehab and raising myself thru self help books and tv/movied.

"So many ''helpful'' mental health/spiritual concepts are really a trap into self-gaslighting, or have pitfalls",985,hx8a48,174,"So many supposedly helpful concepts and quotes really aren't helpful when used by toxic people or people who're simply traumatized and conditioned into doubting their own reality and sanity. I notice within mental health-like circles, some spiritual stuff and peer support that these concepts come back time and time again, but in a way that, to me, feels invalidating and sometimes even mean and manipulative. The things is-- a lot of these general ideas can be twisted or mis-used.

''You're responsible for your own emotions and emotional reaction''-- I can say whatever shit I want and I'll leave you to deal with the mess

''Don't judge''-- Don't have any standards for me or my behaviour, be eternally forgiving

''Be mature/take the high road/let go of ego''-- Let me do whatever I want and I'll mock you if you get angry or upset

''I'm setting a boundary''-- I need you to stop talking now, and I don't want you to say *anything* that I don't want to hear or that doesn't fit my narrative. If you do say *anything* that I don't like, I get to abuse you because you stepped on my boundary. (my mother's ''boundaries'' weren't boundaries, but attacks and repression. it's like my ''boundary'' would be ''you're not allowed to say the word cat in my presence'', or ''you're not allowed to look at me with your head tilted''-- just generally insane and controlling rules that're imposing upon others)

''If someone annoys or bothers you, the problem really is inside yourself, your annoyance is a mirror of your own inner world/issues/fixations/views''-- Self-explanatory. Any form of annoyance or being bothered is entirely within yourself and within yourself to resolve. So if someone treats you like crap, you need to reflect on why you hate being treated like crap. (oh, and that's just how *you perceive it.* There's no one single reality after all)

''I' statements''-- Is a nice one, right? I see great value in it. But... with the wrong people, they just insult and manipulate you in ''I-form''. To a dedicated abuser, it's just a shift in use of grammar.

''You can't tell others how to feel''-- very very nice one. But.... it can be twisted into manipulation (''I'm so incredibly disappointed in you because you didn't ask me if I wanted a cup of tea and I'm really hurt right now'' in a completely benign setting) or it can be used to justify general toxicity and even pathological rage. It becomes more difficult to question manipulative or abusive behavior.

''Think positive!""-- You seeing the reality of your horrible situation is a sign of your negative personality and negative thinking

''I need to take care of myself and make sure that I don't work too hard''-- I don't do anything, leave you with the mess, and call if self-care. (I hate this one, because it's very important when taken at face value. But I've seen it be abused so much!)

''Bad/evil people don't exist''-- I think this is a very complicated one and I haven't fully figured this out yet myself. But... my parents have both done things that were *outright sadistic* over a *very prolonged period of time,* while *whitnessing the suffering and thinking it right.* What I'm trying to say, is that not every abuser is just a poor troubled soul who genuinely can't help themselves in the sense that they just lose control; there're people who genuinely have no empathy, compassion or conscience and who deliberately plan and enjoy the abuse. Such people exist. I don't know what you call evil, but this comes close if you ask me. The faux ''understanding'' or ''not-judging'' can imo only exist in the delusion that all people fundamentally mean well. To me this seems invalidating to a lot of abuse and neglect victims.

''Likes attract likes, and you attract what you send out''-- feels really empty and meaningless. People who were taught to hate themselves and be ashamed of themselves don't send out ''good vibes''. They struggle to move with ease in social situations, their anxiety or defensiveness (or simply not having learned yet that the world ISN'T full of dangerous abusers who fly into a rage over the most minor things) hinders them in fully expressing themselves or showing their kind, sweet side.

''Don't assume, ask''-- even when it's blatantly obvious that I'm being abusive and mean by passive-agressive, you saying something about it, is wrong as you're making assumptions. Obviously, I'd never outright say ''yes, that's exactly what I mean'', unless I want to, to humiliate you further and mock you. (like my dad liked to do, gleefully doubling down and outright insulting and humiliating) But in a lot of cases, this principle just enables further mindgames and twisting of words.

&#x200B;

(there're a lot more of these platitudes, just mentioned a few that came to mind)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

My parents are both incredibly sick and abusive in their own way. But my mom, believe it or not, works in mental health and has done a lot in new age stuff, and she's learned all these platitudes, and while she's sticking to all these rules (at least superficially) she's just as twisted, manipulative and mean-- she just minces her words a tiny bit more. To her, all these phrases and principles are just a grammatical thing.

You can communicate very well according to all those supposedly wholesome words and principles, while being incredibly mean, manipulative, invalidating, and casting unfair blame.

I sometimes think about these concepts to see if they could help me, and they do, but almost every week I experience one of the pitfalls, or realize that there's also a ''but'', or an ''and, also'' that should be added. I have a teacher who's a great example. He's actually really unempathetic and mean, and victim-blaming, while sounding like the most helpful person ever. (his mask slipped once, making several students cry in a fit of abusive rage)"
I think so many people have CPTSD and don't know it. People are so often misdiagnosed. Let me tell you why I think so.,984,fhgino,133,"I grew up in a horrible family situation. I was abused and neglected which stunted my mental growth. My self esteem was completely ruined. Relationships were almost impossible for me - even into adulthood. It took me so many years to realize that what was wrong with me was not simply just ""a chemical imbalance"". Reading ""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Dr. van der Kolk and Pete Walker's ""Complex PTSD: From Survivng to Thriving"" was like I was reading my own autobiography. It was mind blowing. I actually wept throughout both books. Every diagnosis I ever had didn't sit well with me and now it all finally makes sense. Nothing in my life has ever been so eye opening. I could go on forever about my specific story but this post isn't about that.

Because of my ""learning disabilities"" in school, I was put in a smaller classroom setting with similar children for all of my elementary, middle and high school years. Every. SINGLE. child that I met throughout the years had extremely dysfunctional families. I heard all about it. Abusive families, drug and alcohol addict families, narcissistic parents, absent parents, the list goes on. Also almost every child came from a very low income household. I attended weekly group therapy with many of these children. I don't think it's simply a coincidence that every child in my classes that was being abused/neglected was also diagnosed with learning disabilities as well as anxiety, defiant disorders, anger problems, personality disorders, drug addictions, depression, you name it. I've seen some kids go through some awful things that they should not have had to go through. I've had to try to stop multiple other children from killing themselves or from overdosing. These children did so badly in school because school was NOT the most important thing in our minds. We were in survival mode. Either way, we were treated like we were broken and like we were delinquent. My heart breaks for all of the children that have gone through this. 

On a side note: never think that your trauma isn't ""bad"" enough. Never say things like ""but I wasn't hit"" or ""I wasn't sexually abused"". Your trauma is *valid*. Emotional and verbal abuse/neglect is so traumatic. Never downplay your trauma. My emotional abuse completely destroyed me - worse than any other abuse I had. Unfortunately some children are neglected in their very early years (first 4) and while they do not even remember it, *it can still affect them as adults.*

Recently I was talking to my coworker who has extremely awful anxiety, almost to the point of her being unable to function. It turns out her father sexually and physically abused her as a child. I told her to do some research into CPTSD, and sure enough. It's bizarre just how many people have had awful childhoods but it is completely ignored by medical professionals. Even the person themselves is trained to think that what is wrong with them is just because they're more or less ""broken"" and their brain isn't working correctly. When that isn't the case at all! Their brain is doing that it is supposed to do and is doing so very well - trying to keep you alive. You're in survival mode.

So many mental health professionals are not looking at the root cause of these people's issues. I can guarantee that most of those children I went to school with were suffering from CPTSD but would never know it. Instead they would be medicated for a ""chemical imbalance"" just because their brain was ""off"" because it just *was*.  That personality disorder you have, your anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, whatever it may be, may actually be caused by trauma.

Trauma is also generational. My mom was abused, as was her mom. My family is laid upon generations of abuse and neglect. All of us are still struggling with the effects of it. My grandmother was sexually and physically abused by her father and also had to watch her father beat her mother. She also grew up in the depression. Even now at 90 years old, she is a shell of a person and refuses help. She is the definition of a person with CPTSD. I gave my cousin Dr. van der Kolk's book and she said it was the most eye opening thing she has ever read. It has helped her forgive her mother for the abuse she recieved from her. She realized that, while it wasn't necessarily okay, her mother wasn't a good mother because her mother was trying to parent while in survival mode. My mother is currently reading the book and our relationship is better than ever. We finally understand why things are the way they are and are in the process of healing.

My hope is that CPTSD becomes more recognized in the mental health community. I hope that people start realizing that a HUGE amount of mental illnesses are caused by trauma. Please help me spread the word. It may really help someone out there.

I am so passionate about this."
"DAE notice that their ability to handle ""normal"" life stressors plummeted since they started healing?",978,j4he3q,118,"When I first started trauma work, my therapist was really surprised that I felt comfortable living with 5-10 roommates, I was having sex semi-regularly with my partner with no flashbacks or other issues, I worked 2 jobs, and I had no somatic symptoms. On the surface I seemed functional enough, which was in direct contrast to the immense turmoil I felt inside.

After a few months of trauma work, I am realizing that I was only able to handle all of those things because I was literally dissociating *all of the time*. I remember the first day, after a trauma-focused yoga class, that I looked around my apartment and realized that everything was in 3D, and that it was actually *my* apartment. I felt like I was on drugs - it was so intense. It feels like I've been living 100% of the time with three layers of dissociation - the world doesn't feel real, I don't feel real or like I'm a person, and my body doesn't feel like mine. With tons of therapy, slowly I've able to be more present in each of the three realms (though usually only one at a time for now)

But now that I am more present and dissociating less, I just cannot function. Even the idea of sex sends me into a panic attack, and I feel sheer terror when my partner of 5 years simply brushes up against my hand as we are walking. I feel like I never want anyone to touch me ever again. Living with people is fucking terrifying and every little thing is triggering. It takes tons of energy to have a 15-minute phone conversation with a friend I've known for 3 years. Being somewhat present in my body for the first time ever is also now bringing up tons of weird somatic things - my right arm shakes when I am nervous (which is whenever I am around another human being now), I've developed really weird eating and drinking habits, and my sleep is thrown off. 

Everything feels like too much. I feel like I need to go to a little cabin and be alone for a long time, because I feel too overwhelmed in the world. I am craving a quiet, safe space where I can work on my issues from the bottom up - and right now that feels like having multiple therapy sessions just to figure out how to take a freaking shower, or how to sit outside in the sun without feeling watched even if there's no one around, or how to find out what my hobbies are. I'm getting so dysregulated by all the people, all the noise, all the pressure, and all the guilt that I'm putting my partner through all of this.

Has anyone been through something similar? Is it helpful to keep yourself exposed to all the triggers and eventually become desensitized to them, or do you need to adjust your surroundings to meet your new lowered capacity as you are healing? When does this get easier?"
I hate it when people recommend The Body Keeps the Score,978,jq76fe,247,"How can people read the first part about the American soldier who raped and killed a Vietnamese family without thinking about how awful it is? I don't care if the author said he wasn't glorifying that man's actions. Why help him when he doesn't deserve it? I hope his actions haunt him for the rest of his life. There was a discussion on how he couldn't interact with his wife properly. Pray tell, what do you think of that woman you raped back in Vietnam?

If it had been a white family, this man would be in prison, and there would be no sympathy for him. But the Vietnamese aren't people apparently. I simply cannot read a book, as a Vietnamese person, that offers any sense of compassion towards the type of men who ravaged my country.

There's the argument that many people make of ""well, he has PTSD, even if he's not all good, it should still be talked about.""

What about all the Vietnamese people who have PTSD? Do they not matter as much as the white American soldier? I'm sick of it. I'm well and truly sick of it. And I know the majority of this subreddit is likely white, so I don't expect this to be received positively in any way (mods, looking at you.) but I'm so frustrated. I hate how this book is seen as the ultimate bible for PTSD sufferers."
It’s Actually “Family” that Hurts You the Most,982,bjotly,46,
Does anyone else feel the constant need to rest?,976,lqhm4k,114,"I usually just wanna sit back and take it easy. After my mother and I escaped my abusive dad, I allowed this desire to completely take over my life for four years - four years of isolating from the world and doing literally nothing. Playing games all day every day, no responsibilities at all. It was a time where I felt both fully alive and completely dead.

Currently I'm already exhausted just from the very thought of lockdown ending, and returning to the working week. I just don't feel like I have the energy to do it - throw into the mix a retraumatising abusive workplace where I experience the same treatment I got from my dad; impossible expectations and grand verbal punishments for failure, right down to the exact same look of absolute disgust.

But haven't I rested enough? I'm not getting any younger, and at 27 employers are starting to question my lack of work experience."
"""Emotions are irrational"" is Victorian era BS and why older generations are emotionally stunted",983,i78f3z,121,"The idea that ""emotions are irrational"" is a very recent concept and it's rooted, as best I can tell, in Victorian England, when a particularly toxic brand of stoicism took root. High society in the British empire fixated on things like etiquette and decorum. Emotions were seen as the domain of ""savages"" and women. It was just one more thing that privileged classes used to separate themselves. 

This is the period of time when repression took over. Sex was bad, emotions were bad, etc. This idea was so deeply ingrained that science was bent to support it. Prevailing theories in early developmental psychology said, basically ""emotions are irrational and dangerous and should be avoided at all costs"". 

That's where you start seeing ideas that infants should be separated from mothers as quickly as possible after birth. That trend persisted through the 60s and 70s until people started noticing that emotionally deprived children were incredibly maladjusted, often violent or sick. They called it ""failure to thrive"". It was subsequently proven that infants of all primate species need close contact and emotional support. 

But guess what? Plenty of folks that are still around today, specifically Boomers, grew up when emotions were still considered bad. So when you see a ""Karen"" throwing a temper tantrum like a child, it's literally because she was emotionally stunted by that idiotic belief going back to Victorian times that emotions are bad and irrational. So she was never taught to manage her own emotions. 

We've been groomed to parrot that idiotic slogan ""emotions are irrational"" as a method of self neglect and self abuse. It's one of the ways that abusive parents justify neglecting us. 

So let's leave that idea where it belongs: in the 19th century. 

Emotions are 100% rational. When you see a Karen throwing a temper tantrum, it is completely rational because that has always worked for her and she doesn't know any better way to behave. Think about toddlers and small children. When they don't get their way, they might throw a tantrum to get attention. Karens just never grew beyond that phase because their parents believed that emotions are irrational, so they never responded to their children's emotional needs correctly. 

After a few generations of emotionally stunted and emotionally incompetent parents, it's time for us to move on as a society. 

Emotions are ALWAYS meaningful, rational, and valid. They are only mysterious to society because they've been neglected for the better part of two centuries. 

/Rant"
If you ever even once felt like your trauma wasn't scary enough to have CPTSD.,977,d5iqhc,134,"""The developing brain reacts to different types and degrees of trauma so similarly because all the categories of Adverse Childhood Experience stressors have a very simply common denominator: they are all unpredictable. . . .In classic studies [about chronic unpredictable stress], investigators expose animals to different types of stressors for several weeks . . .In the group exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress [in comparison to predictable stronger trauma], she and her team found significant changes in the receptors in the brain's hippocampus - an area of the brain associated with emotion, which would normally help modulate stress hormone production and put the brakes on feelings of stress and anxiety after a stressor has passed. . . .The bottom line, McCarthy says, is that the brain can tolerate severely stressful events if they are predictable, but you cannot tolerate even mild stressful events if they are unpredictable."" - Childhood Disrupted: How Your Biography Becomes Your Biology, and How You Can Heal, by Donna Jackson Nakazawa (pgs 41-42)

They have SCIENCE that says it doesn't matter if the trauma is small. It matters way more if you couldn't predict it.

No more trauma olympics. No kid can predict an adult's abuse, no matter how small or seemingly insignificant."
"It's frustrating that to most people in your life, any amount of sharing is oversharing",975,jg798b,65,"Even the tiniest most surface level hint that I'm going through something serious right now has only gotten the response of discomfort and subject-changing among people I think of as friends and it hurts. I can't ever tell if I'm *actually* too much, or if I misjudged our relationship, or if it's just the other person."
"Today, I stopped myself as I was about to overshare to a sympathetic person!",980,f08x9m,132,"I caught myself before I said anything! This is a person that is very sympathetic and good at mirroring and validating. This person also has absolutely NO need for the ""information"" I was about to go into.

I saw it just as I was about to say something. I took a slow, deep breath instead, and it felt like I managed to put up a healthy boundary around myself! No stress or triggered body, just a healthy appreciation for what was appropriate and necessary for that situation!

This feels like such a small, but huge victory! ""Small"" in the healthy way. Like it wasn't a big deal. Like keeping personal stuff inside the ""personal"" boundary is normal and nothing  worth overthinking about afterwards."
"My dog park story. Something I had to learn is that as an adult, you don't have to fix everything around you in order to be safe. You can just walk away.",981,d3e28b,67,"I brought my dogs to a dog park a few days ago intending on having a nice day out. It was really nice and peaceful, and my dogs were getting along really well with everyone else. 

All the dogs were well-behaved and having a good time, and there were a couple of toys/balls/frisbees around which they were all sharing and playing with.

About half an hour in, this lady starts screaming that someone took her dog's ball and was using it and that they ""stole it from her"". I had actually seen what had happened: her dog had a ball that he was playing with and he brought it to another person and indicated he wanted the person to throw it. So the person did. 

Anyway, as the others try to calm her down, she just starts to accuse everyone and their dogs (yeah, she started pointing and yelling at other people's dogs) of not being inclusive (errr okay).

I was already on-edge and uncomfortable with her raising her voice, but when she started to yell at my dogs I started to panic. I kept thinking of how to calm her down, how to get her to understand, how to empathize with her so she would feel reassured, how to apologize, etc. 

Instead of doing that, I just got my dogs and walked away. Could I have stayed and helped? Maybe. But I think it was better for everyone at the time if I just removed myself and my dogs from the situation.

It felt SO counterintuitive and it took 3 days to calm down about it. I *still* don't feel completely emotionally safe. 

**What I realized is that I don't feel safe even *knowing* that there are people out there like that, because growing up I couldn't get away from my abusers. My only option for survival was to calm them down.** So now, when I *can* get away, it feels very counterintuitive. It doesn't feel as safe as knowing I calmed them down, because I have no historical record of it working. Even after I've walked away, I keep thinking of ways to ""fix"" the issue. Just knowing they exist somewhere out there makes me panic because I am still working under the assumption that I have no escape.

I guess I need to learn to be comfortable with the fact that ""walking away"" *is* a solution and it *does* keep you safe. It just doesn't feel that way right now."

The trauma of learning you’ve been traumatized,978,fv27ds,160,"For me, the moment I realized that I had been abused and that it left me traumatized was in and of itself a traumatic moment

Like, sure, it was kinda validating to finally understand. But it also felt like getting hit by a freight train

Suddenly *every memory* is seen in a different light. Of course some you unravel later, but even that initial wave is nearly unbearable

We tell ourselves it’s “not that bad” to survive, and taking away that security blanket is terrifying. I think it’s why so many people say bullshit like “it happened to me and I’m fine”—because accepting you aren’t fine is awful

I think it’s necessary to ever recover, but it makes sense why people work so hard to avoid the truth"

I don’t ever recall you starting to get ready for work then passing out from physical exhaustion just at the thought of clocking in. I don’t ever remember you talking about how every single negative interaction stacks and stacks over the course of hours, days, weeks, months, YEARS until your blood pressure is through the roof, you’re seeing red and your ears are pounding. I don’t ever remember you mentioning that every single negative emotion and every bad memory you’ve  ever had your whole life can all be brought out by some guy cutting you off in traffic. 

Most importantly, I don’t ever remember you having a mental breakdown to the point that you couldn’t leave your house for several months even when it meant possible eviction.

So no, babe, I don’t think everyone “hates” work the way I do. I don’t think everyone “feels like shit” the way I do. I hate that you always compare what I do to what you have done or would do in a given scenario. I hate your little “well if *I* didn’t do this, if *I* did do that, then...” as if that makes any goddamn difference to me and how I’m feeling right now. I absolutely fucking HATE that your only words of consolation—the only thing you ever have to say to me when I try to discuss my issues with you—is “we all feel that way sometimes.” 

No. 

You.

Fucking.

Don’t."
DAE not feel like an active participant in their life?,965,k0bfsf,99,"Since I was young, the way I’ve coped with trauma was to regress into my mind and not engage. I would daydream and read and pretend I wasn’t there. Honestly, with therapy I think I’ve learned that I was in a dissociative state for a *very* large portion of my childhood. I never grew out of it (because trauma isn’t something that just goes away on it’s own- surprise!) and now it feels like my primary coping mechanism and my default/preferred state of being. 

Now that I’m an adult, this has translated to me never truly taking the lead in my own life. This wasn’t something I was consciously aware of until recently, but it’s been eye opening. I go through the motions to get through the day and when I’m alone I completely disengage and regress into my own head again. The truth is, I don’t think I’ve ever actually *cared* that much about my life because it was so out of my control when I was a kid and when I got older, I never really switched gears. 

So now I’m trying to daydream less. I’m listening to my own wants more instead of agreeing with others to make things go by quicker. I’m trying to do tangible things to make myself excited about life instead of putting more mental energy and care into the world I’ve built in my own head.

I feel like I could write a novel here, but is this common for people with CPTSD?

Does anyone else get this feeling?"
I fucking did it,959,eguhn5,36,"I did it. I broke up with my abusive boyfriend of 3.5 years. I feel so free, i’m still so scared, but I did it. I don’t have to be scared of the manipulation and the guilt tripping and I don’t have to sit in my house alone on weekends being scared that he’s tracking my location so I should just stay home. i don’t have to listen to him yell at me and ask why i have nothing to say because i was so stressed that i just shut down and couldn’t say anything or stand up for myself. I can do things. I can hang out with whoever I want. I can reconcile all the friendships I had to ruin when he threatened to kill himself if I didn’t. I can make new friends without being accused of cheating. 

I did it."
"I hate the saying, ""That which does not kill us makes us stronger.""",961,m055r2,120,"Like I really, really hate it. Not only is it not true, but it makes me feel like I am somehow at fault for feeling weaker due to my experiences, instead of stronger. Some things don't make us stronger; they just leave us traumatized. Some things make us chronically ill.

Not every cloud has a silver lining. It seems that every new trauma I face leaves me weaker than before- physically, emotionally, and mentally- and there's nothing I can do about it, but it would be nice to know that at least people understand that. This supposedly inspirational phrase negates my entire existence."
It truly baffles me that the typical child is fully allowed to express themselves.,963,j072zj,105,"I can never quite understand how parents simply allow their children to speak in silly voices, say ridiculous things, or do funny stuff; like, that was so monumentally-not-allowed in my childhood that I still have problems expressing myself at 27. I still expect the soul-crushing glare of contempt from every witness any time I do/say anything rooted in my own self-expression - and more often than not, I stop myself long before I get to that point.

Why doesn't the typical parent crack down and micromanage everything their child does? Why isn't the child's **every** word and action monitored, questioned and corrected? Why are they not excessively-shamed for every silly thing they say or do? It makes no sense to me.

My self-expression being something of shame is so matter-of-fact to me that I genuinely can't see why it wouldn't be shameful."
Last night I came to terms with the fact that I was sexually abused. Today I called and told my abuser I was not coming for Thanksgiving.,961,e323yr,77,"I'm spending the day with my friends instead because that's what I want to do.

I see you all. Do you see me?

Edit: you see me! I'm real. I made such a good decision. Love you all. Do the same thing. Eat your own bullshit. Live your own story. Be your own person. And when it's better give it to someone else.

Double edit: Yesterday was hard.  All day.  Even when I was having fun, it was hard.  It came in waves.  I'd feel this immense weight and sadness at the haunting thought that ""I am a sex abuse survivor.""  It's a heavy thought. Then the pendulum would swing back to all the love and acceptance I was getting from everyone around me.

The real payoff came this morning.  When I woke up it was immediately clear.  I did what I did for myself yesterday to feel better about myself today.  I felt so good about myself and my ability to heal that so much of the pain was just melted away.  Had I gone down and seen my family?  I wouldn't feel the same way about myself or my life this morning.  And that's really what this whole journey is about isn't it?  Doing what you can today to make tomorrow feel a little better.

Is anyone else vehemently opposed to the idea of work?,960,lst56c,254,"I was reading Graeber's Bullshit Jobs and there was this thought that stuck with me. He says all work, in a way, is the work of caring for other people. Unless all your work is to grow your own vegetables, mend your own house etc. But most people work for other people and it's always, whether you actually take care of a person as in being a nurse, or build bridges for other people to drive across, it's care work. 

And it stuck with me but in a bad way. I've never liked working but recently I'm starting to think it's not just that I don't like my current job, it's that I dislike work in general and I wouldn't like it even if I ""did something I love"". And that fragment gave me an idea as to why I dislike it - because I'm fucking tired of caring for other people. Meeting their expectations. And my job isn't even stressful or connected with any stupid or excessive expectations. I work 4 days a week, I can dress how I want, I'm not required to talk to people too much. But I'm still so fucking salty that I have to work. 

I think it might be because of all the work I had to do as a child to keep my mother un-bothered by my needs or problems. To hide my existence as a separate person with their own needs and personality and sadness. I don't want to work anymore, in a way I just want to lie down and be the useless sad fuck that I am. I know it's not healthy but right now I just want it so much."

I grew up thinking that everything was my fault, I was such a naughty kid, I was the reason for my mom’s health problems. I was shocked when my therapist said that was unfair, that there was no way I could have caused my mother’s health problems, and it was abusive of them to say things like that to me.

Like, there are people who just walk out into the world, feel at home and comfortable and just talk to people, all without a second thought!! There are people who just get out of bed and simply go about their day without a thought, without feeling pain, anxiety, and instantly putting a huge amount of effort toward fighting it and pushing it all down the second they wake up and all day long just to stay sane and even halfway function. There are people who don't feel pain and fear while talking to people. There are people who just feel like they're good enough, aren't fighting constant feelings of inferiority. There are people who feel loved, who don't question their worth or feel like a fragmented fraction of a human being, they just feel whole and ok in who they are. There are people who aren't so full of trauma and emotional turmoil that they spend their whole lives dissociating, numb, and fighting their emotions. There are people who actually look at the world, know that they can get what they want in life and know what their mental health is going to look like in 6 months, a year, etc. to even be able to plan it out. There are people who know their family's behind them and actually there to support them, who don't feel like if they fall apart a little there's nothing to stop them from crashing and burning in the big scary world.


What the actual fuck. How did I, and a lot of us, get so unlucky? How the *hell* is this what I'm stuck with in life, for my whole entire life, just because of decisions made by 2 people?

It is not necessary to know the origin of your trauma for your trauma to be valid and real.,951,ikl481,85,"Some people say, ""I think I was abused as a child, but I don't remember."" ""I don't know why I'm like this, but... (I'm afraid of him/her, I am afraid of small spaces, I get angry when my uncle is around, etc.)."" 

The typical response they have to this is, ""how can I find out why I'm like this?"" or ""Is my truama real?""

So, trauma is a reaction, not an experience. One person can be slapped in the face by their mother and it can cause them agony for life. Another person can be unaffected by it, flip her the bird, and saunter off. So there's no ""event"" that we define as trauma, there is a REACTION that we define as trauma. 

The most important thing to understand if you can't remember the source event or events of your trauma is that THAT DOES NOT MATTER. Yes, I shouted it. 

If a person was dropped on their head in infancy, we have no way of knowing or finding out. That event, however, is there in the subconscious mind forever. If it caused trauma, the trauma is there, too.

When you get a nail in your tire, you don't sit around and try to figure out when and where you got it and who caused it. You acknowledge there's a nail, you take the car to the garage to be fixed. That's it. 

We don't know when or where you got the trauma in your tire. We just know it's there. So the fix isn't to sit around for eight months trying to figure out where the nail came from. *We just fix the tire.*

Don't obsess about finding the source. You might never be able to. Just accept that you have trauma and take action accordingly. If you can't find a therapist, try the book ""Complex PTSD, from surviving to thriving,"" by Pete Walker. Or something else! But let go of putting more emphasiss in finding the event and a put it on getting the ""nail"" out of the ""tire"". (The trauma out of your life to a degree that you can function well)."
Emotional neglect: Watching a small interaction between my dad and my toddler son put some stuff into perspective,953,j9614q,185,"Lurker here. So I’m not sure if i have CPTSD, but I’m starting to think my parents might have neglected me emotionally. 

I’ve always thought something was fundamentally wrong with me, that I was just different from other people. I remember growing up thinking that there must have been some class in school where everyone else learned how to be normal and I missed it. I have a hard time relating to people. Can’t be vulnerable. I reject people before they can reject me. Always keep people at a distance. I always assume I am in the wrong and others are right. Always defer to other people’s opinions before my own. My SO is the only person I feel like I’ve “let in” and I’m realizing I have displayed a lot of co-dependent behaviors and honestly don’t really know who I am a lot of the time. I feel like fearful-avoidant attachment describes me well. 

I was really depressed as a teenager, hating myself, wishing I would die, thinking I was unlovable. I would fight with my parents all the time. Today at 34, I am better but still struggle with self-worth, self esteem and self-confidence. It’s not as overpowering as it used to be but it’s still there. It’s like that scene at the end of in A Beautiful Mind when Russel Crowe’s hallucinations just follow him around but he can ignore them. I still fundamentally think something is wrong with me, but I’ve had to just come to terms with it and try to stay as invisible as I can. I am always longing for deeper connections, but just accept it’s not in the cards for me. 

My parents never hit me (although I do remember being spanked when I was younger and one particular time when I was teenager during a big fight). We lived in a nice house in a nice suburb. I was given every opportunity you could hope for in life, and I have a good relationship with my parents today I would say. But I’ve been trying to figure why the fuck am I like this? I’m realizing this isn’t normal. 

Reading this sub makes me realize that maybe I’m not just wrong, maybe this was done to me. I’m still trying to figure this all out. I don’t have a lot of memories of my childhood, which apparently is also sign of this. I literally can’t tell you wtf happened from elementary and most of middle school. High school is fuzzy and mostly bad memories. 

Anyway, the point of my post...I was visiting my parents (we live out of state) and I was resting in my room while my dad played with my son. It was time for his nap (he’s 3) and my dad was taking him upstairs. Of course being a 3 year old he starts crying and saying he doesn’t want to nap. I laid in my bed listening to their interaction. I realize what I’m about to share is so insignificant compared to other people’s experiences, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

First my dad tells my son “oh stop crying” “don’t cry” 

So I sat there thinking you can’t tell a toddler to stop crying, it doesn’t help, and they can’t help how they’re feeling.

Then my son started calling for grandma (my mom) and saying he wanted Grandma to do nap time. My dad said “well what about me? Why don’t you want to do it with me?”

So again I sat there thinking wait, why are you making this about you? And he’s already upset, why are you trying to make him feel bad for your sake on top of it? 

Then my dad started saying “you’re going to make grandpa sad if you don’t take a nap, you don’t want to make grandpa sad” 

Wait so first YOU are allowed to have emotions, but he’s not? You know since you told him to stop crying. Then you’re making him responsible for your emotions? And finally, why is being sad seen as the consequence like it’s threat? 

So I had this moment of projecting out this small insignificant interaction across my entire childhood, just in normal day-to-day regular moments. Invalidating emotions, making me responsible for their feelings and making certain feelings as “bad.” 

I’m not sitting here thinking my dad abused my son in any way and they are really caring grandparents, but like, if this is just a snippet of the kind of relationship I had growing up, did that contribute to why I am the way I am? 

Then I start adding in the shame and guilt brought on by being raised in a strict evangelical household annnnnd I’m starting to realize maybe my childhood wasn’t all that healthy. Maybe there is a reason for the way I am. 

I really don’t remember a lot of interactions with my parents growing up so seeing this small interaction with my son was a little eye opening. Maybe I’m just seeing things not there? Again, I know this is NO WHERE near as bad as the horrors other people have experienced. Just thought it was interesting. Thanks for reading.

Edit: wow, I just...wow. The outpouring of validation and support right now. I can’t put into words how I am feeling (cause I was never taught to amirite!) But truly, I have a lump in my throat and tears swelling in my eyes staring at my phone. These comments are taking my breath away. To say my mind is blowing right now is an understatement. I cannot thank you all enough for your comments. I honestly thought I was alone, just a broken person. Someone who will always be on the outside. I mean this sincerely that today is the first time in my 34 years that I am feeling like maybe I don’t have to just accept these tortured thoughts as part of my innate being, maybe I don’t have to be like this. Wow what an incredible community I have stumbled upon. I know my journey will be long and difficult, but I am looking forward to learning more from all of you. Thank you so much."
"Weird how we remember ourselves as the ""dramatic"" ones... for standing up for ourselves after being abused or disrespected?",946,j0mp3q,73,"I'm going through a bit of this with someone right now. Looking at possibly severing ties after they called me some choice words tonight. And I can almost guarantee that when I bring it up with them soon, I'm going to be painted as ""dramatic"" for ""making a big deal"" over it.

And it has me thinking about all the relationships which have crumbled, that I feel at fault for. And this time, for once, it actually GOT me *thinking.*

In almost every single instance (not EVERY single one, but most)... what I now feel subconscious shame and ""accountability"" (the bad kind) for... was telling someone what my boundaries were. Or telling them not to insult me. Or letting them know that I was hurt.

I'm not and have never been the kind of person to throw around accusations. I've, very rarely, snapped when I asserted a boundary and the boundary was STILL disrespected. Not ""snapped"" as in yelled or screamed or threatened or got violent or insulted. But told someone very firmly that their behavior was not welcome.

Example:

Ex girlfriend frequently made negative comments about my weight. I was a size 10. She was a size 2. She would say things like ""you don't need to eat all that"" or ""you shouldn't wear shorts with those legs.""

A year or more after we broke up, she said something again about weight that I had gained. A dress size or two. And I told her that her comments hurt my feelings. I remember myself as being the ""aggressor"" in that interaction, because her reaction was to double down, and then accuse me of instigating a fight with her.

There are countless more examples like this one. A friend who was unhappy because I asked her for space took a box of my things I had in her garage and threw them against a wall in front of me. Besides this, I've had psycho bosses. That's a different topic for a different post and I'm losing steam.

I just think it's... exhausting, and maybe a little discouraging? That we've been led to think these things are our fault, like we're responsible for someone else's toxic and unacceptable behavior. And for many of us, it's been a contributing factor to developing CPTSD later. My soul need a year-long nap.

ETA: Well, it went over worse than I expected, but not that different. I wasn't only called dramatic but accused of being a narcissist and a terrible person. 😂 So I guess that's the end of our story. But my karma has exploded because of this post, so thank you all! I fully intend to respond to some of you but it's been a crazy day, so I'm not sure if and when I'll have the emotional energy for it. Cheers! 💖"
My Girlfriend's Dog Saved Me From A Panic Attack,953,lo36jm,35,"My girlfriend was hospitalized tonight due to a severe emotional breakdown that sent her into cycling mania. I'm watching her German Shepherd at my apartment until she gets out. Clover is seriously the best fucking dog I've ever met. She's very calm for her age, she listens, she's cuddly, loves other animals, just all around great. 

She's been a little stand offish from me because she doesn't know me well. I started having one of my quiet panic attacks while she was laying next to me on the couch. Sometimes I don't realize when one is coming on until it's too late. I tense up, I start trembling, overwhelming waves of terror wash over me, and I completely freeze. My girlfriend gets these too but I don't think she realized what they were until recently. Clover immediately got up and asked to go outside. I took her out, she walked me around the sidewalk, then back inside. She didn't need to use the bathroom. Now she's laying here with her head in my lap for the first time since she got here.

Dogs are fucking beautiful.

But I’m bothered by how shocked everyone is.

I think I’m just angry or jealous about their ability to be in their 30s and 40s and so blissfully unaware of the existence of these issues.

Someone's wealth or status does not invalidate their traumatic experiences.,944,m539si,202,"I have not watched the Oprah/Markle interview. But all of the memes about their wealth, and posts about it on communities like r/TrueOffMyChest infuriated me. These posts have made me so sad. People seem to be saying that because maybe Meghan lives her life with an amount of luxury that a lot of people don't have, she can't experience racism and depression? It was a bit triggering to me in that these people were downplaying a sad and awful situation. Again I haven't seen the interview, I think it would be too much for me. But just knowing that she was sharing her story of how she was treated (I don't want to use the phrase ""traumatic"" unless she herself used it, but it definitely could have been traumatic) and seeing people online make fun of her was hard. Someone can be extremely wealthy and that does not make their trauma any less valid. Having things, or having money, does not change what the mind and body interprets as traumatic. Many people have less, and living a life in constant poverty can ALSO be traumatic. But someone else's story not including what YOU YOURSELF have been through does not make their trauma less than yours. End rant.

Edit: I did NOT mean to start a political discussion about Meghan and Harry. I am sorry for anyone who felt unseen and frustrated at this post. There is way more nuance to their specific situation that I do not know about, there are way more resources allowed for people with wealth and status, and I know that people here have experienced poverty trauma. I meant more than anything, to highlight how seeing someone mocked online in a way that was meant to invalidate what they were saying, was triggering to me and could be triggering to others. I could have made this post about anyone, but this was a recent situation so it was on my mind. I also could have focused way more on my reaction and what I was feeling rather than phrasing things toward Meghan. So again, I'm sorry to the people who were hurt by this post, and I hope all of you have a lovely day."

They say it like it’s some sort of compliment. Like I should be proud. The only reason I’m “strong” is because it’s not socially acceptable or realistic to be “weak.” And as soon as you start showing weakness, the same people will tell you to just get over it."
I think that one of the hardest things about learning to advocate for yourself is the anxiety that comes from potentially creating tension.,934,gzbvli,58,"Whether the possibility of creating tension is real or imagined,  I find the fear that can come as a direct result of ""rocking the boat"" to be debilitating. And when I'm talking about learning to advocate for yourself, I'm not just talking about the big things; I'm talking about the little things, too, like getting seconds because you're still hungry or knocking on the door of a public restroom to ask if someone's in there or if it's just closed (I've stood outside of closed doors to public restrooms for very long amounts of time because I was too afraid to test whether or not they were locked).

&#x200B;

It's already really difficult to ""convince"" yourself that you're allowed to have needs. But actually pursuing those? Not ignoring them when they pop up? I think that one of the scariest things is that we'll \*keep having needs\* until the day we die. More than once I've wished I could just phase into a cloud of, like... consciousness that didn't need to eat, drink, sleep, or be noticed. I'm terrified of being hungry because every time I get hungry it's easy for me to become convinced that I'll never be able to access food again- I've struggled with eating disorders from a very young age and a lot of that has to do with the way food was restricted and guarded in my household growing up.

&#x200B;

I hope to get to a point where I can advocate for myself and ask for things (from those I trust) without being terrified before, during, and afterward. I often feel weak and ineffective for it being this difficult. Fawning and freezing have dictated huge parts of my life, including most interactions with those who have treated me decently.

DAE feel like they’re behind in life and struggling to catch up because their trauma has made them miss too many opportunities?,937,er9s24,185,
Part of recovering from CPTSD has involved realizing that the person my Inner Child has been waiting for to save me/validate my experience is actually adult me,936,edwpi6,102,
"My son (5) is exactly how I remember being as a child. My Dad “doesn’t remember” but thinks my son is hilarious/entertaining. I remember getting beat and yelled at for acting the same way. TW: childhood physical and emotional abuse, ADHD shame",935,ju3302,85,"28F, CPTSD, ADHD, GAD, clinical depression, high functioning ASD. 

I have huge gaps in childhood memories, but have been having repressed memories come to the surface with the help of therapy and watching some old childhood videos. 

When I was younger than 5, I remember being really silly, goofy, liked being the center of attention, and was generally “all over the place”. I wasn’t diagnosed with ADHD until I was 20, but looking back, I was a pretty “typical kid with ADHD”. 

I could write a book about my narcissistic mother, but this story focuses on my Dad. They were together until I was 17. My Dad always worked a lot my entire childhood. My memories of the weekends when he was home were mostly filled with yard work, going to my brothers baseball games, and other trivial stuff. 

I feel like I focused so much on my Mom’s abuse, I’ve spent most of my life blocking out the abuse from my Dad. I couldn’t handle both my parents being garbage and I spent more time with my Mom. 

My Dad remarried when I was 18. My step mom is one of those people who comes off “so nice and helpful”,  but now that I’ve known her for 10 years, she is manipulative, narcissistic, garbage. She love bombs (using my Dad’s money), is a helicopter parent to her adult children, and seems to “wear the pants” in the relationship with my Dad. She has an adult son who also has ADHD. She constantly makes jokes at his expense, mostly about how hard it was (for her) to raise him (no validation for his personal struggles). 

I’ve seen my dad less than 20 times in the last 10 years. I mostly see him for Christmas, or other random things my step mom has planned, but he has mostly ghosted my brother and I. He plays the “woah is me, why don’t my children love me?” game, but has been barely involved in our lives since he got remarried. 

My son is 5, and his Dad and I both have ADHD. We saw the signs early, and are in the process of getting him officially diagnosed so we can get him into OT. We both aren’t “ashamed” of being ADHD, but we both regret getting diagnosed as adults instead of as children, because we feel like OT would have been helpful for us. 

Edit to clarify: my parents don’t know I’m in the process of getting him diagnosed. I don’t share many details of my life with them. 

My son (5) is kind, goofy, empathetic, but also understands the art of sarcastic humor. He enjoys being the center of attention, especially around all adults. He loves to dance, sing, perform for family, and generally be “the life of the party”. I’ve realized more and more recently after watching childhood videos, this was me as a young child. Memories are flooding back of me being confident and silly. 

Okay back to current day. 

My Dad recently moved back closer to me. I was stuck in a childcare pickle and had to work, so I asked my Dad and Step Mom to watch my kids (5 and 2). 

My husband and I went to pick them up after I got off work, and we were met with love bomb central. They had bought hundreds of dollars worth of stuff for my kids to play with at their house. It was clear they were pushing the “cool grandparents” narrative pretty hard.  My son also told me that my step mom told him “every time you come over, I’ll add money to your Xbox account so you can buy whatever you want! “ (🙄). 

My Step Mom kept talking about how hilarious my son is. She said “I asked your Dad if you or your brother were like this, and he said no! He doesn’t know where he got it from!”. 

This rubbed me the wrong way, but I mostly grey rocked and tried to focus on getting out of there. And then she said “You know who WAS like this? ‘step brother!’ Good luck! You know how ‘step brother’ was”. 

I was initially pissed for my son and my step brother. I’ve stewed about this for weeks. Fuck my step Mom for shaming my step brothers mental health struggles, and fuck her for implying my son was a “lost cause” hidden under a “joke”. 

Then I started looking at it from my Dad’s point of view. He “didn’t remember” me being like my son when I was a kid? And then came the memories. 

The last week has been flooded with things I blocked out. My Dad used to “spank” me as punishment for being too wild, annoying, or really anything other than silent or a “good girl”. I remembered that I used to get “spanked”, but now I remember the extent of it. I also talked about it with my older brother (who also has huge gaps of memories) and he told me that he remembers my dad going into rage outbursts and spanking me so hard my butt was red and bruised with his hand print. He remembers crying and begging him to stop. 

I remember bits and pieces of this now. I remember my butt always being sore, and it hurting to sit down for weeks at a time. I also remember my mom “checking” my butt to look for marks after I had been alone with my Dad. I also remember my mom generally “shushing me” and telling me to “behave myself/settle down” around my Dad. 

Once I started school, I felt like my parents relied on the public school system and my older brother to “raise me”. I seemed to generally annoy them, and I feel like they “conditioned” my personality out of me. In school I was shy, quiet, and CRIPPLED with social anxiety. 

So to wrap this up. FUCK MY DAD. I see him beam with pride watching my son act in the ways that he HATED when I was a child. He encourages my son to be himself, but I wasn’t “allowed”. I was basically told to STFU and if I didn’t, he would spank me so hard I could barely sit for weeks. I wasn’t allowed to have fun or be goofy. I wasn’t allowed to be myself. FUCK YOU DAD. Is it because my son is a boy? So he is “allowed” to have a personality? My 2 year old daughter is starting to really let her personality shine, and I think she is going to be incredibly similar to my son. Will she be “allowed” to be goofy and silly? Or will she be shamed because she isn’t being a “good girl?”.

GAHHHH, okay rant over. Thank you for reading. 

TLDR: I had undiagnosed ADHD as a child. My Dad hated me for my symptoms and found me to be disruptive and annoying. He used to scream at me and “spank” me until I had hand shaped bruises on my butt and could barely sit for weeks. My son is incredibly similar to me as a child, and now my Dad thinks he is hilarious and entertaining. FUCK YOU DAD.

EDIT: 

Thank you for everyone who responded. I needed to rant about this, and I didn’t expect this post to blow up so much. I appreciate this community so much. I’ve never felt so validated and understood. I’ve spent 28 years looking for you wonderful people, and I truly appreciate all of you! 

Thank you to those who said I’m a good parent. I put every ounce of my mental energy into healing for the sake of my children and myself. My parents showed me exactly “what not to do” in almost every single parenting situation, so I feel mentally prepared to “do the opposite”. It does make me sad that I learned all of these lessons at the expense of my own childhood and happiness. 

I’ve been in therapy for 10 years. The first 5 were mostly spent on validating that my childhood was fucked up, and the last 5 have been spent “using the powers for good instead of evil”. I never planned on having kids because I was too scared of fucking them up. My son was a “happy accident” who ended up genuinely saving my life. I realized I couldn’t let all of my trauma eat me alive anymore. I needed to be the parent I wish I had as a child. 

Some days are harder than others, but I “ground myself” by looking at my children and say this mantra in my head: “the generations of abuse and denial stops with me”. 

I would also like to thank Lexapro (SSRI) lol. Medication isn’t for everyone, but I NEED it, at least for the time being. 

I recently left my job and am fortunate that I no longer have to rely on outside help for child care. I’m working on a plan with my therapist to go very low contact/no contact after the holidays. 

Thank you again to everyone who read and responded."

I got a promotion!!!,928,kv3aek,55,"Today I was having a pretty emotional meeting w/ my supervisor about an incident that happened at work. I was having a straight up break down, crying my eyes out in front of her. She was being really empathetic about the whole thing, and told me she luckily had some good news for me.

I got a promotion! I had applied like 2 months ago against 40ish other candidates for one open position, and she told me I was by far the best interview they had! I just genuinely can't believe it, one moment I was completely falling apart, and the next she hit me with that.

3 1/2 years ago I was homeless and jobless. Now I have my own car, my own studio apartment, and I'm a part of the 20$+ an hour club 😭😭😭

Every step has felt impossible, but I just keep pushing myself through the thoughts of helplessness, and little by little I am carrying myself out of this hole. A big part of me feels I don't deserve this, and that it's just going to get taken away from me. But I KNOW I do deserve it, I have worked my ass off these last few years to get here, and I am really proud of myself for never giving up.

Validation,928,df9lpc,45,"I ran into someone who used to work with my father the other day. We chatted for a while and towards the end of the conversation, he said, ""Well, you turned out all right after all.""

I thought it was a setup for a joke and asked what he meant. I wasn't prepared for his answer. 

Apparently, there was a group of people (when I was around 11) that discussed trying to have me removed from my home.  But they had no proof of anything substantial, so it fizzled out.

""Now why,"" I chuckled, "" Would you do that?"" Because of course, a good child pretends that everything is perfect. 

""He brought you to work one day. He sat you in a chair in his office and you sat and stared at the wall until he called you to go for lunch.""

""Ah, so I was well behaved?"" Because of course, a good child takes every opportunity to point out their parent's good parenting. 

""No. There is no normal 7 year old that sits silently, motionless,waiting to be told that they can even move. You were **traumatized**.  You were **terrified**. We were frightened for you.""

And I politely thanked him, made my excuses and left. And then I went home and cried. 

Because, as a child, I **was** traumatized.  I **was** terrified. But they were not tears of fear or tears of self pity. They were tears of gratitude. 

Because *someone* saw me. Someone saw how much I hurt, how afraid I was. And even though they couldn't help, I was **seen**. 

It was real. 

I was validated.



Edit: You guys are so awesome! I wrote this last night, because I needed to actually tell someone. I didn't expect it to resonate with so many. 

This actually happened a couple of years ago. Since then, I've made some subtle inquiries and learned that there were multiple people who were concerned at various points in my childhood. Authorities investigated at least three times, but never found evidence of abuse to actually take action. Twice, extended family picked me up from school and hid me, but again, had no proof of abuse and eventually gave me back  People recognized that I was terrified, but could never *""prove** why or of whom.

I never realized that any of this happened. I always thought no one knew. I thought I was alone. 

Maybe you thought the same thing. But I think someone did see you. 

Maybe they *didn't* help - or maybe they *couldn't* help. 

Maybe they sat up late into the night, brainstorming with their spouse about what they could do, only to realize they had no power to help you. 

Maybe they cried tears for you, maybe they spent hours worrying for you, and maybe they hated themselves that they couldn't help you. 

But I promise you that someone saw.

I promise you that it was all real.

It did happen.

You are validated too."
Realizing you have CPTSD is the king of all mindfucks.,934,ctb4qv,150,"I don't know where to begin. This will probably be so long that only one or two will read it. That's ok, I just need to vent to SOMEONE who might understand all of this. People without CPTSD seem to have a very difficult time grasping the significance of it. They seem to think it's like depression where people can come out of it fine and never visit it again. CPTSD as I understand it is something that will need to be continuously monitored and worked on for the rest of my life.

Anyway, I just realized at 23 (M) that I have CPTSD. My brain keeps trying to deny it but Pete Walker's book on it is irrefutable evidence that I have it, and my psychologist agrees.

Realizing that **so much** of ""you"" is actually just a set of reactions and defense mechanisms that your brain built up and stuck to all these years is insanely life changing and **destabilizing**. I feel like a fucking shell of a person. I can't deny that a lot (probably the majority) of my day-to-day behaviors and interactions are dictated by the set of responses I learned when I was developing as a kid.

Symptoms that I've had for years (or decades) that are tied to CPTSD (and unbeknownst to me until a few months ago):

* hypervigilance (never knew this word existed but as soon as I heard it I knew I'd never forget it because I've **always** felt extremely hypervigilant)
* muscle/body armoring (never been able to fully relax my body)
* chronic, recurring depression (flares up ""randomly"" but is really abandonment depression upon close inspection)
* anxiety (for me, the flip side of depression, when I have more energy)
* emotional flashbacks
* relationship/closeness/trust issues
* nightmares (would wake up ex regularly when we lived together by yelling things at my abusers in my sleep, having no memory of this in the mornings)
* chronic feelings of alienation (like i'm **fundamentally** and **irreversibly** different and will never be a normal part of society)
* irresistible urge to isolate myself where no one can find me (i've moved to a relatively remote location in a woodsy area where I know no one in the state)
* negative outlook on life (it has so much to offer, but not for me because I'm an outcast)

It's like the fog has lifted and I can finally see the way out. But it's an absolutely enormous trek and even focusing on one or two bits at a time can get so overwhelming.

I've gone no contact (NC) with both parents since a couple of months ago when I asked them for financial help with my therapy. That was the last straw. But now I have almost nobody. Nobody I can **really** explain this to in any depth with any hope of receiving empathy in return.

This is a really fucking **tough** condition, guys."
Does anyone else get anxious when you feel calm? Like you can’t be calm because that means something will go wrong?,927,l3ykc7,63,"My therapist wanted me to get some good routines on food, sleep and studying, so I’ve really challenged myself on that this week. However, I find that when I kind of forget my thoughts and lose myself in my chores like studying, I start feeling calm. Then, when I realise that I am feeling calm, I panic because I assume that means that I’m missing some important information and that something will go wrong if my nervous system is not «activated». As a child I was the emotional support of my mentally ill parents from a very young age and had to figure out lots of things on my own because my parents weren’t there to help me. Because of this I was constantly stressed and anxious.

The C in CPTSD should stand for Capitalism-PTSD,924,fdg3ar,265,"I think all of us who have been through this generational trauma are feeling the effects of a 2-300 year capitalistic society that pressures its people to do do do do do, determines their worth, determines good and bad and has completely destroyed basic humanity of it's people while at the same time replacing ours with artificial feelings and reactive behaviors. The system creates it's own trauma and then makes money off that trauma. It's makes it's own symptoms and then blames the people for having those symptoms. It removes and controls time for people and eliminates their ability to heal. I'm thinking the limited number of sick days from work, or take a week off when a family member dies. Then come back it's all normal. This shit is sick. And like any society the people are a reflection of the culture that binds them. My abusers were never given the chance to heal, they couldn't they were forced to SURVIVE, get food, make money, whatever. Worked obscene hours and do all this stuff. This doing doing doing keeps people in a reactive state where they can never fully settle on down. This stuff is all so pervasive and insidious and most of us living this have been born into the bird cage and don't even know it, and are finally coming to see it for what it is. 

It's really interesting, you can take almost any post in here and every time someone mentions their abusive parent replace it with 'society' and it still stands as an accurate post.

For example:

My parents neglected my feelings - society neglects your feelings

My parents told me I wasn't good enough - society tells you you aren't good enough unless you PRODUCE

I was never allowed to relax - society wants you to do dododododododo

My parents didn't feed me - society doesn't feed you

My parents made me self-critical and care what everyone thinks - society makes you self-critical and care what everyone thinks so you can fit in and be accepted 

My parents tell me I'm a bad because I don't obey them and I'm a problem child - society tells me I'm bad because I don't obey and follow the broken rules.

My parent's tell me I'm making all this shit up - society tells you you're making this up (because this is JUST the way life IS)

\--now the crazy part is you can even go one more layer down and replace 'My parents tell me' with ""i tell myself"". Why do I tell myself what I tell myself? Because a higher up told me, and who told them? It's just a crazy ladder of bullshit.

My parents are just a reflection of the bird cage they grew up in and they passed it on down to me. The only difference for why people are seeing this stuff now I think is partly the internet and books and spread of information and being able to finally see HEALTHY HAPPY FAMILY COMPARISONS. 

Now I still want nothing to do with my parents because I know they are very ingrained in their ways and will continue to be abusive, but I also don't hold them accountable for this stuff. I don't think there is anything to forgive, because they didn't actually do anything wrong. They were reacting to their environment. I probably would have done the exact same shit. Anyway, I would much rather I go my they and they go theirs and as more and more people grow up seeing all this trauma and bullshit for what it is I think it will all slowly disappear generationally."
I'm in a healthy relationship and it feels incredibly uncomfortable,924,m5o823,68,"TW: sexual, emotional trauma

I met this girl right before valentines day, and so far things have been going wonderfully! I just.. I dont know I'm uncomfortable with how wonderful she is. My last (and only) real relationship was full of things I know logically are unhealthy, but not seeing them in this relationship is setting off false red flags. 

For example, she doesn't feel the need to grip me and pull me around by my hips in public. She doesn't grope me while we walk around in public. This was my ex's way of ""showing affection."" In essence, don't get uncomfortable with her around children because I won't have to worry they'll see softcore porn. This is odd to me, and while I admire her for not, I also can't shake the idea that I'm not doing something right, or that I'm not attractive enough because she isn't treating me like a sex object. 

Another example: she saw me completely break down the other day. I was completely non-verbal and couldn't speak or really do much else than tug on her arm or whimper to get her attention. She gave me her phone, and I typed out what was going on, and she didn't once make it about her, she didn't say it was unfair that I'd vent, or even show my trauma, she just listened and that was that. Just.. the fact that a person was able to not make it about them made me so happy, yet so simultaneously scared I was scarring her. 

She is the perfect gentlelady, so sweet and generous, yet dry and sarcastic. But I'm worried I'll ruin it by not understanding what healthy relationships look like. What can I do?"
Who else is unlearning your own creepy and red flag behavior due to it being “normal” due to past abuse?,921,f1e4hi,111,"Who else is unlearning your own creepy and red flag behavior due to it being “normal” due to past abuse? 


I used to stalk and obsess over crushes and friends due to my insecure attachment style. I would call them frequently and prank call them. I would always compliment them and take their abuse. I was so desperate for connection. I think this was a huge reason why I struggled with maintaining friendships.

Due to having a creepy sexually abusive father my whole life, I normalized creepy behavior and would seek out creepy men...but I also was creepy! I would sometimes touch men when first meeting them to flirt, Stare too long, tell them my whole life story, try to fix/save them (codependency), ask personal questions, stalking/researching all about them on social media and writing about them, changing my personality into the person they want me to be, not taking no for an answer, getting mad when others set boundaries, pointing, standing too close, overly trusting strangers, not laughing at others jokes unless I thought it was funny, making sex noises when I was excited and hungry, sexualizing myself because I wanted them to violate me (re-enacting trauma), etc. If I was a man, women would have been reporting me nonstop!!

I definitely creeped out people in my life which explains why I was only attracting other unhealthy/creepy people. If someone else wasn’t creepy, it didn’t feel like love. I almost feel like I have autism but my therapists say I don’t. I need to read a book on social skills (dbt was helpful) to learn how to interact with others appropriately. It sucks because since I normalized toxic behavior, I often didn’t know when someone was being creepy and increased my chances on being victimized again. I was so disconnected from my intuition. 

I feel like a kid again, starting all over again. Even though I hate small talk, I’m learning how it is important to build rapport instead of trusting someone right away with your deep thoughts. I used to be stubborn about changing even though everyone called me weird because I wanted to be authentic.. now I see the weirdness was creepiness that scared and bothered people. So now I see the importance in following social etiquette. 

Who else relates?"
I’m a ghost.,919,iys2vh,105,"My boyfriend and I assessed the way I walk.

When he lived in the apartment above me and I had his key, I’d often scare the *shit* out of his roommates/our friends. And him. And his dad. It’s never been intentional, not ever. I always feel absolutely horrible. I come up near them, and though I speak, I guess it’s soft enough to not hear. To not hear my voice, my feet, my shifting of weight. Nothing.

For two days when my boyfriend and I went out this week, I was completely ignored. Entirely un acknowledged by workers. My heart sank and I cried in the car the second day. *Am I really that invisible?*

That night we took a walk. I realized so much of what I do is a safety tactic. I subconsciously learned to walk quietly for stealth. I called it “walking internally,” where my feet land on my toes and hardly swing up or down. My voice is fragile and I taught myself to break silence timidly to avoid being yelled at and berated. I realized I ask so many questions because it’s a *safety tactic* to gather information and calculate, based on past and present experiences, whether or not a person/place/thing is safe for me.

I cried a bit when I realized this. When I realized that I don’t allow myself to be vulnerable. I don’t let myself be large, either. 

I’m just a ghost.

Edit: Thank you all for being proud, relating, and encouraging me. I woke up to essentially a symphony of your voices making a bad day a great one. I love you all.

"I didn't only deserve to be in an emotionally safe external environment, I also deserved to be emotionally safe in my inner world.",923,i57hj2,52,"I think we spend a lot of time thinking about how our caretakers let us down and made us live in an emotionally unsafe external environment, but we should also think about how we deserved to have an emotionally safe *internal* world.

Of course, they are related because our caretakers teach us how to treat ourselves and their words become our inner voices, but for me at least I found that it helped to acknowledge that I deserve both.

Because of them, my inner world is unsafe. Like an immune system attacking itself. My own inner world that I can't escape (since it's my own mind) was made to be dangerous to myself.

How horrible of them to do that to me.

My therapist solved a dilemma that has been keeping me awake for nearly a decade in a second.,911,fy8cs6,89,"I'm almost mad. I... dont know. It was clear and almost casual to her. I didnt even ask the fucking question - she found the answer and made the connection based on something adjacent.

She's almost too good. 8 therapists before her. 8. And she makes them all look like idiots (theyre not, but... fuck).

I mean... what do I do now? I have this massive weight now. This massive thing I have to process and come to terms with. It is overwhelming.

I'm going to share it, if that's alright. I feel like I need this energy out of my body.

................ TW ...............

As a child, I went online. I met older men. I did what I did to maintain their approval, attention and what they convinced me as love. I've never known why I did this, and it is a huge source of shame for me.

I told my therapist today that I noticed how I desperately yearn for the approval of my older male professors. There is absolutely 0 romantic interest, I explained, but I am hypervigilant for anything that might indicate rejection. I even get jealous of other students who seem to have a good relationship with them.

She asked if this was similar to my mindset during my childhood SA. It is important to note that I've only ever told her once or twice that I was abused online as a kid. I kept it vague and objective.

She said that I may be looking for something I didnt have as a child.
I said that that is weird since my father is the smothering one.
She asked if I ever felt loved by him.
I said, yeah. I was his favorite growing up, even though I didnt want to be.
She then said, ""But did you feel loved?""

I was gobsmacked. I've often thought that ""I've never felt loved,"" but have dismissed it as me overreacting, since my father obviously loved me (dont get me started on my mom)

She went on to explain that being smothered, obsessed over and controlled wasn't love. In fact, it didn't benefit me at all.

That kind of relationship is about him. And that dynamic often leaves those who were obsessed over quite lonely. So I looked for it elsewhere. And I found something that looked like it.

She told me that I was uncomfortable because I never had a relationship with an adult man that was purely transactional. I don't know what that looks like because I have always been trying to fill this gaping emotional hole left by dysfunctional parents.

She answered why I engaged with men on the internet and, though at times I was threatened, I was most captivated by those who feigned emotional intimacy.



I guess I look forward to going through the rest of my traumas with her.

But today was really really hard. And I just need someone to see that.

Police Officer said that children do not understand the consequences of reporting their abusive parents.,917,equc8n,200,"I swear, I am not here to farm karma. I was literally shaking when I heard this. 

I was making a police report when the officer got a call, and I heard the details of half of his phone conversation. As I sat in front of him as he went ""oh, how old is the child?"" ""This is a Child abuse case? Ok""...Briefly, I wasn't really listening there were many other questions. Anyway he hung up and looked at me and sighed and said ""Children these days don't really know the consequences of making a police report on their parent, just because the parent hit the child."" Apparently the child made the report on their own parent.

I was flabbergasted and i stuttered a feeble reply (lol) and I said something I read on someone else's post here... I said ""if this was an adult calling into to report another adult, it would be one count of assault and battery and maybe even intention to cause grievous hurt"" he brushed me away and said that ""you have been watching too many American police movies""

I don't get it, hitting an adult is not ok. But hitting your own child is? So what if the abuser gets arrested and removed from the family? Is it the child's fault for calling the police on the abuser? Why is the family unit so important that it must be protected at all costs?? What about the child? Can't the child's safety be the important thing???? 

The child didn't break up the family. The abuser did. The concern about the consequences should not be carried by the child, but the abuser who decided to physically abuse his own flesh and blood. 

tl;dr - some 60 year old police officer has some worrying views and I am sitting here realllyyyyy shocked. Pls let me know that there are people who don't share his world view."

Types of Emotional Neglect and Emotional Abuse,917,i46qgn,202,"I highly recommend a book by a group of scholars and clinicians who have followed in van der Kolk's footsteps - Treating Adult Survivors of Emotional Abuse and Neglect: Component-Based Psychotherapy, Hopper et al, 2019.  It's the best trauma book I've ever read, including Body Keeps the Score, even though it's geared to therapists not clients. 

The book includes a taxonomy of types of emotional neglect and emotional abuse which was very helpful for me. 

**Types of Emotional Neglect (Absence of Warmth, Support, Nurturance)**

* Caregiver is not physically present
* Forced to be physically absent due to work, military service, hospitalization or incarceration
* Choosing to be absent due to substance or alcohol abuse or prioritizing another family
* Caregiver is emotionally absent due to dissociation, severe depression, chronic mental illness, or developmental delays
* Extreme family stress due to poverty, lack of social supports, or dangerous neighbourhood interferes with caregiver’s emotional availability
* Caregiver ignores child’s bids for affection or shuns child
* Caregiver abandons the child for periods of time with no indication when he or she will return or imposes extended periods of isolation from others

**Types of Emotional Abuse**

* Caregiver calls the child derogatory names or ridicules and belittles the child
* Caregiver blames the child for family problems or for abuse of the child
* Caregiver displays an ongoing pattern of negativity or hostility toward the child
* Caregiver makes excessive and/or inappropriate demands of the child
* Child is exposed to extreme or unpredictable caregiver behaviours due to the caregiver’s mental illness, substance or alcohol abuse, and/or violent/aggressive behaviour
* Caregiver uses fear, intimidation, humiliation, threats, or bullying to discipline the child or pressures the child to keep secrets
* Caregiver demonstrates a pattern of boundary violations, excessive monitoring, or overcontrol that is inappropriate considering the child’s age
* Child is expected to assume an inappropriate level of responsibility or is placed in a role reversal, such as frequently taking care of younger siblings or attending to the emotional needs of the caregiver
* Caregiver undermines child’s significant relationships
* Caregiver does not allow the child to engage in age-appropriate socialization
* Child is exposed to relationship conflict between caregivers"

Your pain is real. Your abuse was real. Your body kept the score, and the fact that you’re experiencing CPTSD symptoms means that you experienced trauma.

I have so many childlike qualities, mixed with the angst from the teenager I was but could never show, and all of that mixed with the responsibility and maturity of a 50 year old.

why can’t someone take care of me for once?,905,lv93yv,105,"I’m such a doormat people pleaser and I hate it. I’m doing horribly and I just want the affection I give to others returned to me, just for a little while, I want to hang out with someone and be able to talk about how I am feeling without being interrupted with the other person’s problems. I want to be held while I cry. Nothing feels safe for me right now. It fucking sucks.

eta: I left a lot of context out of this post. My friends are not treating me poorly. I care about them deeply and they care for me as well. They all just happen to be going through crazy shit right now, which, we all are. I am too. It’s just hard trying to be supportive to people and not necessarily receiving it back, but I also can’t and don’t expect it. I barely even ask for support from anyone, which is totally on me. 
It is not their fault I’m over expending my emotional energy, it is entirely mine. I realize I should set boundaries to protect my emotions and well being. It is the thing I struggle with the most as a freeze/fawn. And I realize I can never truly be taken care of or rescued in the way I desire. 
This was just intended as a vent to get things off my chest."
"DAE find it difficult to actually refer to your mom as your abuser? For context, her abuse is primarily neglect, gaslighting, and she does the victim reversal thing whenever you try to be vulnerable or even, God forbid, remotely critical of her.",911,ljqqdw,152,"I have only recently come to terms with the unfortunate fact that my mother abused me via neglect when I was very young and hearing impaired to boot. I still want to have a relationship with her but it's hard. Whenever I want to reveal to her that my childhood wasn't as rosy of a picture as she paints it to others, she does the whole ""Oh, well, I guess I'm just a terrible mother"" thing, making it impossible to have a constructive or insightful conversation.

Is this even worth pursuing? I sometimes question the purpose of digging up the past and showing her my perspective. ""It would just make her upset,"" I think to myself... And yet, I can't stop thinking about having this conversation with her. I think it's coming from a sense of wanting to clear the air between us, although it is mostly one sided with myself being the one harboring unresolved feelings. 

I just can't look at her the same. The illusion of a nuturing mother has been shattered. How can I see her in any other light? Why is it when she expresses pride in me, her daughter, all I feel is disgust? Is it repulsion that she would claim pride in something she doesn't deserve? Or is it that lingering, deep-seated insecurity that's clinged to me since childhood? I think it's a combination of the two.

Needless to say, I feel like I'm being denied a critical part of my healing or moving on with my life when my mother refuses to acknowledge the damage that she had inadvertently woven into me. I say inadvertantly because I do not believe that she had malicious intent while she was raising me. She was just utterly depressed and alone and not in a good headspace. She really shouldn't have tried solving her problems by having a kid--poor advice she had received from trusted family members.

This post kinda turned into a journal entry, but maybe some of you out there can relate. I'd be appreciative of any insight or advice. It may be that I can never get what I want out of my mother and seeing a therapist, which I've been admittedly putting off, is probably a more ideal start in my road of recovery.


EDIT:  I am overwhelmed with the amount of positive support and good advice that you all have posted. And I'm so glad to see that I'm not alone! It'll take me some time to go threw all of these insightful comments, but I intend to over time. Again, thank you all so much!"

Gynecologist told me my husband would leave me if I didn't get over my Vaginismus,899,k0n4ox,101,"Hi, I'm fron Kuwait and I wanted to share this traumatic experience I've had yesterday during a GYN appointment. A bit of background, I've been diagnosed with PTSD and have been in treatment for over 4 years with a great therapist. I've been experiencing vaginismus ever since I could remember.

This morning, I had an appointment with an OBGYN doctor. I'd taken this appointment a month ago because that's how packed this doctor's schedule was and she works at a really prestigious hospital in Kuwait, she had a nice reputation hence one of the reasons I chose her as my doctor and was willing to wait a month for this appointment.


I went in, doctor greeted me all that. I told her I was there because of difficulty with penetration and some birth control advice. She immediately said I had Vaginismus which I expected and presented me with a pamphlet of dilators. She also told me off the bat that it is simply psychological and I also needed to see a therapist. I told her I did. And she asked me if she can examine me and I was like yeah sure.


She examined me, obviously I jerked a lot when she tried to take a swab from down there and also this thing that shows what's inside my uterus (obviously that wasn't able to go in). The entire time, she was telling me, multiple times, that my husband will leave me if I don't get over this, that triggered me so much alongside the fact that she was a stranger that's trying to put things into me down there where I'm not very comfortable.


I plain out told her ""if a man would do that for this reason, he would be a shithead.""


She replied. ""We're talking about a Kuwaiti man though."" insisting that he would leave.


I ignored her, I couldn't even listen to her at this point. Then she tried to insert the device that supposed to show the inside of my uterus and I jerked.


She looked at the nurses then at me, then she said 


""Is this what you do to your husband!?"" wide eyes, pointing at me down there. shocked.


she basically shamed me for my condition.


I started crying, I couldn't hold it anymore. The tears won't stop. The doctor and nurses stopped; nurses got me some tissues. Doctor doesn't seem to understand why exactly I was crying and said she was joking and she jokes with her patients.


I get up, dress up, I couldn't stop the tears. I then go to sit at her desk.


She told me she couldn't help me because I have deep psychological issues and needed to see a psychiatrist asap, she also told me that I needed to take anti-depressants (because anti-depressants cure vaginismus lol). She also told me not to visit a GYN doctor because they can't help.


I don't remember how it exactly went from there but she asked if something had happened when I was young and I bawled. Sobbing, I couldn't stop myself.


She immediately said ""Uh please I have patients outside! I don't want them to think I did something bad to you"". Tells you a lot about where this person's priority lies, obviously in their image more than her patients.


I felt like a crazy, deranged person. She made me feel that way. I thanked her and left. holding back my tears. I bawled again when I got into my car. I called my husband and told him.


My husband got so angry, he immediately drove over to the hospital and went to the manager to file a complaint against her. For telling a patient that their spouse would leave them for a health condition and insisting so, as well as shaming a patient for their condition. 


I never cried so much in my life; I haven't felt this traumatized in a very long time. I haven't felt shame this great. She made me feel broken, dysfunctional, weak, crazy and deranged. That I needed to stop being sensitive over this and get over it so I can be normal for my husband.


It's hilariously sad. All the GYN doctors I've encountered treated me with the goal of pleasing the husband rather than my own health and well-being. Everything is centered around 'fixing me' for my husband. or else he'll leave me like this doctor insisted. It a sad mentality that the doctors seem to have here in Kuwait.


My husband told me; we should seek a GYN doctor abroad if we ever decide to travel because it seems like doctors in Kuwait have a toxic mentality that centered around pleasing the man rather than treating the woman's health. It fucking sad, and that's probably the most heart-breaking part for me. Unless somehow, I find someone who is professional and is a trauma-informed GYN doctor.


I was really shattered today, but I'm thankful for having a support system today, my husband as well as some of my family.

This has caused me to avoid really good opportunities and makes me awkward around people.

My parents were physically, emotionally and verbally abusive and I understand nobody gets a manual, but they were still extremely incompetent at what was supposed to be their job its almost hard to even fathom, honestly I’d rather not have been born. 

I get filled with so much anger thinking about how I was treated, but I also get filled with sadness because this is something I’ll have to undo for the rest of my life. 

I hate how I have a wall up that keeps me from being vulnerable with people. I hate how I have no personality outside my trauma responses. I hate how fragmented my identity is. I hate how I don’t care about myself at all. The only thing I care about is validation from strangers and friends. I hate having to grow up in a fucking cult.

I have so much trauma to undo and it affects me in almost every interaction I have with people. I wish I had even discovered this later, because I’m only 19 and discovering how disconnected from my friends and myself I am. I at least wanted to fake it a little longer, because knowing how much I’m traumatized I feel so suicidal. I really hate my life and I wish I had the strength to just end it.

"DAE feel like there are so many past “versions” of you, but you can’t connect with them or accept that that was who you were, at one point in time? Is this having different “parts?” SOS",899,ixgjqf,107,"Sometimes I feel very ...fragmented? Like my past is cut into sections and though I was myself all along, I look back and think of each section as if it was a different person. When I try to connect with that section or phrase, I can just feel my body and kind rejecting it and I think “no no that wasn’t me.” I think of my life as living through different lies. Different versions of who I thought I was. I move on from things quickly and can burn something down that meant the whole world to me two days ago. I just 100% switch gears. And then I can’t be reminded of it or it gives me a flashback, even though that particular time wasn’t traumatic. It just wasn’t me. Mostly because I’m ashamed of that phase, or it just hurts too much to connect with it. Like, if I see clothing that I wore three years ago, I just dissociate and/or panic. I don’t want any of the past to be real. Not last week, or last month, or last year, etc. it’s like I’m walking through life setting fire to everything behind me, each step forward, I burn down the last. Like, my therapist has a bag of clothes that I couldn’t stand to look at. I was too scared and confused and sad and brainwashed when I wore those clothes, so I get rid of them. Idk what I’m talking about but help me out here lol. Is this having different “parts”? What does that mean? I guess I maybe reject past parts of me because they believed in something that wasn’t true.

Edit: I guess this is called structural dissociation. We don’t like to remember past-versions because acknowledging them would be painful, and we fear feeling those emotions or pain again. To me, it almost feels like their pain is contagious and deadly. I run from it. But through healing, when you are ready, I think it’s important to address each phase and make peace with it. I have done this with child-me, and my dissociation has slightly lessened!  I mean, I still have like 10 other me’s to heal. 

So maybe we are on to something here. We need to connect all of the fragments so that they make one person, one experience, so that we can feel present now. I mean, how are we supposed to feel present when there are 14 hurting versions of ourself running amuck? Hope this post helps you! Hope it helps me, too  😂 Remember that there is a whole community rooting for you."

* refill it regularly to remind yourself that you care about yourself
* take it everywhere (even when your brain says ""we're late, we can't afford the 2 extra seconds to put it in our bag"") and don't ever leave the house with it empty

Does anyone else wonder who they could've been without their trauma?,892,g2vkjb,122,"Bit of a trigger warning because I show a very negative outlook in this post that isn't necessarily the whole truth of C-PTSD. 

(pinning this because this seems to be a very common thought/idea/whatever, maybe someone could benefit from seeing this.)

&#x200B;

Sometimes I'll see someone, a really good musician, artist, writer, scholar, whatever, and I'll just think ""God fucking damnit. I could've been that. I could've done that."" And I just imagine what my life would've been like without my trauma. I was always intelligent to begin with, so I know I could've done something fulfilling and satisfying with my life. But now, I just think of where I am.

I'm failing most of my classes, I can't ever do anything or go out or entirely enjoy anything, my trauma's become inseparably fused with my identity and my personality and it affects every aspect of my life. Can't go out to certain places or do certain things because I'll get panic attacks, I'm always, constantly, in hyper-vigilance mode and I can't ever relax, loud noises and sudden movements scare me and certain faces that look like my abusers and certain behaviors or sensory things that remind me of my abusers trigger me in ways I don't know how to explain. I can't focus on schoolwork at all because I'm constantly having flashbacks, panic attacks, and dissociating, can't wear short sleeves because of my self harm scars, can't go out to a restaurant or eat normally because of my anorexia, can't be non-obsessive about germs and hygiene because of my co-morbid OCD, which was caused by my trauma, there's so many things that I can't fucking do because of this and it just reminds me that I won't ever be *normal* ever again, this is a part of me now and there's no getting rid of it.

Even if I manage to recover from this, this has permanently affected me in certain ways that will never go away. I used to dream of going to college, going to a nice school like Cambridge or university in Europe, maybe studying philosophy or chemistry or physics, but that's all out the window now and there's no chance I'll ever get that back.

I'm fifteen and supposedly I've got my whole life ahead of me, but I have nothing to look forward to, it feels like everything's behind me and like nothing will ever change.

I'm fixated with the idea of being ""normal,"" not being fucking covered in scars and constantly dissociating and being anxious about everything and being tense, and not being the one that people pity and always say things like ""*you can always talk to me if you need help*"" even though, as much as they try, they could never fucking understand what it's like to live like this. It feels like my life has been taken from me, my potential to ever *be* anything or anyone significant, gone forever. And fuck, most kids my age are dating and having fun and getting good grades and they have so much to look forward to, and I don't mean to sound whiny but it feels so fucking unfair. Most kids my age don't spend every waking minute thinking of ways to harm themselves, they don't obsess over whether or not they deserve to exist, they aren't fucking paranoid about turning out like their abusive parents, they don't spend hours and hours dissociating or having flashbacks or anything. They don't fucking know what this is like, and as well-intentioned as they sometimes are (I'm fortunate enough to have some wonderfully supportive friends), they just couldn't begin to conceptualize what it's like to live like this.

It's so fucking isolating and I feel like, outside of other C-PTSD survivors, I won't ever find someone who understands me and can empathize with me, instead of just sympathizing.

My beliefs have been irreversibly changed, and my mindset about most things is quite different from most people, not in the sense that it's immoral but my thinking patterns just aren't the same. I don't quite know how to explain it and it's just so, so alienating and it feels like I have a level of awareness about everything that most people don't have, and it can be so painful sometimes.

Anyway I'm sorry for ranting so much (and I might've repeated myself a bit), but I'm just fucking angry and confused and I'm trying to figure things out. I know this post is very negative and I don't want anyone to be affected by that, I know that I'm hyper-focusing on all the negative aspects of C-PTSD and I don't want to trigger anyone or cause anyone to lose hope in recovery. This kind of deviated from what I originally wanted to write, but I hope it still makes enough sense and that I was able to convey my mindset about this. (If you've read all of this, thank you!)"
Trauma made me a bad person and I can't stop it.,891,imcp68,127,"I envy people who are able to say they became compassionate and kind/understanding to others while working on their trauma. I'm working hard on improving myself, but I constantly feel like a bad person. Moody, irritable, angry out of nowhere, annoying, needy. My emotional instability gets the best of me very often, and I can't control myself. I act like a total d*ck. 

None of this is intentional, obviously. I wouldn't hurt anyone. I can be quite volatile and chaotic if something feels like a threat, though. I'm also very cynical and suspicious of people's intentions. I always assume the worst about others. I'm bitter and resentful, and I hate most people. I hate socializing in general. I feel like a boiling pot of hatred sometimes.

All this makes me feel very guilty and broken. I wish I could be calm, sweet and caring to others. I'm just like my abusers.


Edit: Okay, you guys are impressive. I didn't expect so much support from you at all. It's impressive to know that each of you has been through highly difficult times as a child, perhaps horrible times, and yet you are able to give the motivation and compassionate advice you must've been deprived of. Reading your comments, I feel understood and accepted like nowhere else. Only you guys know what this whole thing is about. 

I get that sometimes our skewed perception of ourselves makes us feel like bad people. Monsters, even. Other times we might we make bad decisions and unintentionally hurt people with our symptoms. I hope we can learn to be more forgiving to ourselves, while still taking responsibility for our actions, unlike the people who hurt us."

Can we talk about being a perfectionist that puts high expectations on yourself but DON'T end up being an overachiever and successful and instead fail over and over again?,888,l9zfet,114,"Because that's me. Whenever I hear or read about someone being a perfectionist and put high expectations on themselves they actually seem to have some degree of success, ex.

2.)Posting this and seeing everyone’s responses, I think collectively we feel these things not because we hate the people who had the normality of it all or because we don’t wish those well who went through normal teen issues or downplaying anyone else’s experiences. We feel this way because not being able to go through the motions of childhood and teenage years without abuse and neglect, stunned something, took away something from us and we all crave a life where it didn’t exist. It’s not that we wanted the childhood teen issues in the movies, no one does - it’s because we knew something entirely different. 

3.) That being said - I just wanted to share some things my husband and I do to combat that feeling of having lost our childhood. It may sound funny, but it’s been a god send to us and doesn’t have negative consequences. We can never go back in time or recreate memories that never existed for us. We can’t change the childhoods we had. But sometimes you can make new memories of things you couldn’t do before. Every holiday for us is like a first. Holidays were some of my worst times, it was like the abuse would get worse around them. So - We set out cookies and milk for Santa, and make gingerbread houses. We dye eggs and hide gifts on Easter for each other. We always watch cartoons on Sundays. We always carve pumpkins on Halloween and dress up even if we don’t go out. We try and do something at least once a month that we wanted to do when we were kids. For instance we went apple picking and went on a hayride for the first time just a week ago. We learned to ride scooters, my husband got on a bicycle the other day for the very first time and we have quite literally done chalk drawings on our sidewalk. These small sentiments of childhood don’t affect our adult life, let us break through sometimes, and have been quite healing for both of us. 

I was deep in a YouTube binge and came across a channel I used to watch when I was a preteen (the girls running the channel were my age so I liked it at the time.) There was a new video so I decided to watch it. It was a video about these sisters childhoods, teen years, bullying and so forth. I sat there listening to them talk about how they got into a fight with their friend over an early 2000’s instant messaging system, and the boy they liked didn’t like them back, and one year they didn’t make the cheerleading squad and got really sad. And watching it made me break down because I would have done anything to experience a “stereotypical” teen issue. (I say stereotypical very loosely because there is no normal, but you know what I mean. Acne, school dances, crushes, feeling sad about a bad grade.. etc..)

I am a firm believer that pain is relative and you never really know what someone went through. In no way am I down playing whatever they went through. I’m sure it was difficult, especially at that age. I’ve never been one to compare trauma, stories or issues. But listening to this made me jealous. I’m jealous and envious that I didn’t get to be a normal teenager. I wanted a first heart break, I wanted to fail that test, i wanted to try out for a team. I wanted to worry about things like if that boy likes me or if my outfit was “cool” enough for the school dance. Not - being 13 years old and wondering do I have to fear for my life when I go home today, will my mom threaten to leave again, will my brother hit me again, is my abusive boyfriend going to hurt me again or force me to have sex, do I have to cover my bruises again, will the kids at school tell me to kill myself again, am I going to hurt myself today? 

I know I shouldn’t feel this way and it’s an unhealthy habit because it sounds like I’m comparing or downplaying someone else’s pain, but im really not trying to. I just wish I could have had one day that had a normal teen issue."
"DAE expected the world to be wonderful and kind because you were isolated and treated so poorly at home, only to realize that actually the world outside is kinda shitty too?",891,lji7vh,116,"Don't get me wrong, there have been some great people and here and there... but somehow I was hoping everything to ""get better"" once I grew up and got out of my abusive household.

Who else NEEDS information like we need air?,890,kw55rw,162,"I just know that this is some sort of maladaptive trait, but I become obsessed with information. I need all the data, the variables, the info in order to deal with things. I spent so many years trying to understand what was wrong with ME that by the time I realized that it wasn't me, it was them, and now that I understand more about CPTSD and the early childhood trauma that I suffered I can finally start to heal. I think that after a lifetime of gaslighting, I need reality to comfort me. Fairy Tales are harder to believe if your life is a nightmare."
To the male-identified of our community 🌸,883,b3e3co,54,
It just hit me hard that I will never have the same outlook on life as non-traumatized people.,884,lmphmi,70,"I know that there is always a chance to heal my wounds and that eventually I can become better than I am right know, but I will never be as carefree. 

I realized this when I saw a couple laughing and goofing around with each other. I just don't have this sense of security or playfulness. They were so enthusiastic and energetic and it hurt seeing this scene. It made me realize how forced my live might seem to others. How even when I am having a good day or spending the day with a friend I care about, they might still think I don't enjoy being with them. 

They too have to get up every morning and make something out of the day they are given. But they still find the energy and happiness to be like that. I guess true happiness and security are different than the level we teach ourselfs. It makes me feel bad for the people that still hang out with me. I know that whenever I am with them, they will not have as much fun as they could have with some other, healthy person. 

People always say that friendships, relationships etc. are all about being there for each other, even in hard times. But I am not sure if they understand that hard times and the level of suffering are different for anyone. I am not sure if a person that has always had a good support system knows what this crippeling loneliness and constant need for approval feel like. They really have a hard time understanding how much work it is for me to support a good friendship and how much I fight for something that they percieve as little. 

I guess this just overwhelmed me a bit, thanks for reading to this point.

Edit: Thank you for all the comments and opinions, I really love this place for all the kind people you can find here. Even if I can't reply to all of them I really apprechiate it."

Does anyone else seem to live in max difficulty setting where everything they try to do always goes massively wrong?,880,ktu0di,128,"The convoluted ways in which almost everything I do goes completely wrong never cease to amaze me. From simply buying a game (which, despite the disc being perfectly okay, doesn't work) to the pursuit of my dream job leading me into the most nightmarishly-toxic workplace imaginable.

It's as though the decades of intense daily abuse simply weren't enough punishment for my existence. No, in addition to drowning in CPTSD, everything I do has to go not just wrong, but turn into a total disaster. Literally worst-case scenario, every single time. Why? Why does it have to be this way?

And above all: There's always some damn abuser nearby, no matter what. It's almost like there's a massive global conspiracy of abusers who are assigned to make my life as miserable as possible wherever I go; whether it's a family member, a neighbour, a coworker, or a classmate."
"Is anyone else the absentminded, forgetful, clumsy friend whose usually the butt of every joke and who everyone kind of infantilises only to realise those qualities are from trauma and you hate yourself for it?",883,jxnm7q,131,the above.
"DAE feel unmotivated to do things for themselves, and can ONLY do things for others?",882,io0oq4,85,"For example, I have trauma surrounding cleaning and tidying up. I can let months go by in between vaccuuming or sweeping. Even though it bothers me, I cannot clean up if it's just for my own benefit. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But if I'm having someone over, or if there's a chance someone may stop by, I can panic-clean. Part of it is I feel shame at letting it get so bad, but the other part is feeling like I'm letting the other person down by inviting them over to a messy space.

&#x200B;

I also do a lot better if I have someone helping me, whether they're nice or not. My default setting is ""other people are better at it than I am, I always do it wrong."" so it's nearly impossible to motivate myself otherwise.

&#x200B;

However, this doesn't always work... it used to work 100% of the time, and now, it's pretty unreliable... I can't get my self to do ANYTHING, no matter who it's for. I'm not even sure if I can blame depression for this anymore. I've just... given up. Showering, eating, plans for the future... none of it matters. I'm not worth the effort.

&#x200B;

I can get some work done w an accountability buddy, but I don't have a lot of close friends around me, and my closest friends live far away.

&#x200B;

I love stories where one character is struggling but another character just comes into their life, upending it but also making it better. I've longed for that for myself, even though I know that it's no one's responsibility to save me. I have to save myself. 

&#x200B;

I hate being around people but feel like I need daily check-ins or social interaction, or else I will do literally nothing and find that acceptable. Idk. Is anyone else like this? What can I do?"
Who else has failed classes/semesters or dropped out of school because of mental health?,877,dvjnvy,152,"I have CPTSD, BPD, BED, SAD, GAD, MDD with psychotic symptoms, and more. Every day is a fucking nightmare for me and there are so many days where I have to spend all my energy trying to talk myself out of suicide. 

A couple of years ago I flunked out of my community college. I'm now in vet med school.. and it's hard. I've failed so many classes already that I'm an entire semester behind. I had to take 9 classes this semester, and so far I've already failed 3. I might fail more depending on how I did on an exam today and how I do on some other exams next weeks. I just feel like such a failure. I used to be a gifted student, I graduated at the top 5% of my high school. Look at me now."
“Reminder that a toddlers behavior is never their ‘fault’”,881,kxnmuj,78,"This was just posted on r/toddlers, and I felt this in my soul. Between two of my most traumatic memories happening at age 3-4 and trying to heal my own inner child and consoling myself that my own instinct took over to survive, this hit hard. I hope it helps someone else tonight too. 

>”I know it’s hard to remember sometimes but your toddler’s behaviour is never their “fault”. You can be mad about what they’ve done; but you can never be mad at them for doing it.

>No matter what parenting strategy you subscribe to, the science is pretty clear that up to about age 6 kids do not have the ability to be malicious or manipulative. No matter how much their actions may seem that way remember - they are not trying to hurt you, anger you or hurt/break other people or things. They are simply learning boundaries and exploring limitations. 

>”But he *knows* he’s not supposed to pour his milk onto his plate” yes... he may know that, but he doesn’t know what happens when he does. And he wants to explore that. 

>Consequences are the reason we adults avoid doing things. Incentives are almost always the reason we *do* things. 

>Eat healthy food, feel better, live longer. Good. 

>Throw a glass on the floor... broken glass, big mess, possible glass in foot. Bad. 

>A 2 year old does not understand both sides of this yet. They don’t even understand incentives yet let alone consequences.

>Above all be patient.”


Edit: formatting

Edit edit: UPDATE- I just want to clarify in posting this that it’s trying to be helpful and it seems like it has been for a lot of people. I also want to validate the parents here too- toddlers are illogical, emotional and irrational and if you find yourself struggling with some elements of CPTSD because the toddler’s communication style and functionality isn’t exactly as comprehensive as you need to get talked down. it’s okay. Just be calm and give your kid what you need too: empathy and patience."
Had my first truama free breakfast in 15 years.,883,hf9re1,61,"For context I am a 37 year old man who lives on his own. Long story short I have a lot of truama around being home and the morning. My whole life I've always rushed through the morning, eaten a granola bar or bought food. I never had a calm, relaxed sit down breakfast that I made. Until today.

Last night I prepared by buying eggs, cheese and tortilla wraps. It was difficult to go to sleep.

Today I woke up at 8 and went to the kitchen. I walked to the stove. Then I was compelled to hunch over down to the floor. It was like I was the height of a 5 year old. Then I was compelled to start crawling on the floor like a baby, and I did that. Then I laid on the wood floor with my head down and curled up, like I was a newborn.

After that I was able to get up and begin cooking. It felt very present, zen and right. I ate the meal and then had to go back to bed and sleep for 8 more hours. It totally knocked me out.

[my trauma free breakfast](https://ibb.co/x1cb1c4)

There's a lot for me to unpack. One of the biggest things was me going to the floor to be the size of my old self from a elementary age. It made me realize how terrifying it must have been to be that size and be powerless around toxic people. Today tho it felt different. Today, in this house, little Pattyice was safe and ok. It is possible to be safe. Nursery rhymes made me feel safe, and this new one came up and I've been singing it all day ""I am safe, I'm ok, things are good, for me today."""
DAE verbally say “no” / grit their teeth / make sounds of pain / shake their head involuntarily when they feel shame or remember something shameful?,874,d8ufny,141,"I’ve noticed in the last few years this has gotten worse. I’ll catch myself involuntarily reacting to shameful thoughts or memories and my reaction is like if I badly hurt myself. I grit my teeth, repeatedly tell myself “no” or “stop it” and shake my head."
"I've just started reading ""Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving"" from Peter Walker and I have never felt so good about myself in my life",878,k3lyyd,104,"I feel so understood. 

Chapter 5 on emotional neglect has finally convinced me that I don't have to feel like I'm not allowed to be traumatized because other people have suffered more abuse than I have.

I felt proud after finding out that my observations of our family dynamic have always been *correct*, and that I figured out some of the ways to heal instinctually. I can say that now, that I'm genuinely *proud* of something I've done without being ashamed for having a positive thought about myself.

**And now the real kicker**: **I've only read two chapters so far**. I wanted to share this experience here with anyone who, like I was too, is hesitant to read this book. I was scared I'd feel invalidated, scared that it wouldn't offer me any new perspectives on top of those I've already gotten through therapy and other self-help books. Now I wish I bought it sooner.

I'm sure I'm a little high on it all right now and that I still have a lot of healing to do, but for the first time in years I feel like I'll be able to handle it. If you're on the fence about having cptsd, or are convinced the term applies to you but are scared to move forward: give the book a try. Good luck <3."
It's so hard to learn to relax and feel safe when doing that was literally the subject of punishment,877,ind3cg,60,"My parents saw me relax - I was too lazy and needed something to do

My parents saw me not doing the thing they just decided I should rather be doing right now - I got screamed at for being egoistic and inconsiderate

My parents saw me being productive - how dare I not do the thing they just decided was more important at the moment

My parents saw me spending my time with hobbies (e.g. making music) - too inconvenient, stop, do something else instead (also very egoistic of me to burden them with my presence while they're having a hard time)

Not being hypervigilant was a crime at my home. I was taught to be stressed always, at all cost. Being productive was rewarded with not being yelled at, sometimes. Relaxing, feeling safe, was dangerous. Today not being aware enough, being too relaxed for too long, is still one of my biggest triggers, as when I am relaxed once, a voice in my head tells me that I am in danger.

I am glad, that I finally found that trigger. Hope I can work on that in the future. Maybe some of you can relate, so I thought I'd share. Thank you for reading <3

Edit: Thank you all so much for relating and sharing your stories. It's sad to know how many of you experienced similar things. I hope you're all doing allright. I will try and answer as many of your comments as I can. I read all of them and I am very moved by the amount of compassion. Sending love to you all :)"
Realization: I am allowed to have different boundaries with different people,869,i29iya,129,"...and I am allowed to treat different people differently. *woah*

My therapist told me this and its been an eye opener. Im still like, ""what..really? But wouldn't that make my personality inconsistent then? If Im not treating everyone the exact same then theyre all going to have a different idea of me right?""

I have been *terrified* of this idea, that hypothetically if I were to treat people differently and they met and talked about me and came to the conclusion that Im different with all of them, that means I'm a liar, or deceitful, or manipulative, or creepy or weird. Or that Im a sociopath or something just playing different roles for a bad reason.

I have untreated family members with disgnosed Borderline personality disorder, undiagnosed sociopathy and alcoholism (this one is just obvious). I have watched my codependent (and possibly BPD mom) and other family placate and lie to people's faces and talk shit about them once theyre not around anymore.

Idk..at some point I got a belief in my mind that if Im inconsistent at all, with anyone, ever, then Im crazy or an evil liar like them. Which Im realizing now is pretty extreme and limiting.

I'd appreciate some ways to frame having different boundaries/relationships with ddifferent people because I know logically its healthy but it seems so exhausting and chaotic that a part of me doesnt want to try. Seems like a lot to manage."
Since I realized my uncontrollable crying spells are just a sign of being in a flashback it’s so much easier to understand what’s going on with me and get back to a calm state,873,l5betx,67,"Also, realizing how often I get triggered"

i just wanted to say that i love every single one of you,876,hrm6zv,76,"what we've been put through against our wills no person should go through and the fact that you're all here shows a way of progress in your healing. i love every single one of you and you should love yourself as well, you should take a couple of seconds and tell yourself the words ""i love you"" and aim it to yourself. 

i'm sure with time your trauma will drag you down less and less. you will make it so. you will not be ashamed of what happened to you that you didn't ask for. you will understand why your trauma is there and you will accept it. you didn't choose it to be there but you're ok that it's there only because you didn't ask it to, so the only thing to do is accept it and give it space and room to breathe. thus it will feel freer and less heavy.

"Broke up with my emotionally abusive boyfriend a week ago. I still live with him now, and he's completely turned his behavior around to try to keep me here. I wrote this to remind myself why I have to- and why I CAN- get out. I am actively looking for a new apartment.",873,gzqfo4,55,"&#x200B;

Knowing myself-

This relationship has taken such a toll on my ability to care about myself.  It took advantage of the already insignificant amount of regard I had for my actual well being. Or sense of being a person. It persists. I've been told I'm not worth caring about. I'm not worth anything beyond what I can achieve ""win"". I am not a person. I have never been.

&#x200B;

That is not true.

&#x200B;

I've attached myself to others who are real people. I've gathered my sense of existence through being sensed by others. Seeking validation though that lens and never quite filling my bucket. That validation is quite fleeting.

&#x200B;

I have found that worth. I can be a person without other people. I have found my right to exist not  through others' perceptions. I have my own. I can care for myself. I have a warmth inside of me. When before it was just a husk. a void. it was cold. and dark.

When I lost those who I felt ""saw"" me. When I felt abandoned by my only means of existing, through the perception and validation of others, I was nothing. I didn't exist. Who was I if I wasn't loved? I was no one. No one can exist that way. As just a shell. As not seen or heard or alive. I felt like I wasn't alive anymore.

&#x200B;

So I have life now. Given to me by the hum of the world. Held and loved and kept warm by me. I feel full. I feel whole.

&#x200B;

So recently I couldn't understand how anyone could care about me. I didn't know what I was or how I was perceived or if I even existed. Lately.. I don't care. Others' opinions cannot affect my right to exist. And I also know that I'm a wonderful and beautiful person by right."
Does anyone else just start crying when they are overwhelmed by some other emotion?,865,lfq66e,83,"Doesn't matter what I'm feeling. Intense anger? Cry. Happy surprise? Cry. Feeling anxious? Cry!

Recently, I had an eye opening revelation: if any adult ever treated another adult the way my parents treated me, it would be straight up assault. Period.

Imagining a stranger on the subway or a boss or a friend treating me the way my parents did leaves no room for doubt—it was wrong and it shouldn’t have happened

I’ve been turning this thought around in my head for a while now and it’s really been validating, so I wanted to share it here  <3

"I stood up for myself to CPS yesterday. I immediately checked out after, but I did it. I am proud.",864,k2oprb,42,"Edit: thanks everyone for your kind words and support!! 

Over the summer I had to call CPS on my abusive ex husband. After a few weeks of being constantly triggered, They dismissed my case and told me to take coparenting classes with my abuser. 

My trauma response has always been to freeze. So it took me several months, but I called yesterday to file a formal complaint and I told them that emotional abuse should be considered real and the long term implications are incredibly damaging. I told them I felt dismissed and disrespected and how dare they suggest I coparent with my abuser and force me to send my daughter back into his home. That just because she wasn’t getting the shit beaten out of her didn’t mean she was safe. 

There isn’t anything they can do now, not until another incident is filed but I felt very empowered. 

I immediately crumbled. I got incredibly fucked up because being powerful feels so terrifying. Standing up for myself has never been allowed, I’ve always been hurt by whoever was abusing me at the time.  I disassociated a little bit while I was doing drugs but I didn’t go away all the way and I am still me. I feel Shame about using but It feels like I’m really getting better. 

Im in recovery from alcoholism (trauma response) and I stayed sober from alcohol yesterday, despite the holiday, the family bullshit and this conflict.  I stood up for myself and my little girl even if it took me months to do so."

I also honestly dont feel like it's possible for me to ever get out of anything above a poverty level existence, never really be perfectly healthy, and just never set and reach goals and generally make progress in life. 

Like a changeling, failure to thrive and grow and become. I feel locked into this persona, into this life, into this mindset and everything about it. It's hard not to go to suicidal ideation because of it.

My pattern throughout my life doesn't support signs of long term growth and upward mobility. I feel like the best I'll ever do is just survive enough to be right at the edge of whatever disastrous hole I'm currently trying to crawl out of. I just feel like a fucking worthless waste of pathetic space and I'm just angrily sitting here hating that my mind literally wants to see me fail. That's all it ever spews at me is bullshit about how inadequate I am and at how useless any of the things I've tried to achieve are.

I'm just tired. Tired of making it out of one trap only to find out the paradise you thought you found is another trap, except its longer, even more frustrating and emotionally difficult and will just drain your finances, physical worth and time.

* They can say it's just a joke, it's still abuse.
* They can support you, it's still abuse.
* They can be victims themselves, it's still abuse.
* They can not know it better, it's still abuse.
* They can love you, it's still abuse.
* They can appear as a healthy family, it's still abuse.
* They can treat others well, it's still abuse.
* They can hide behind excuses, it's still abuse.

None of that justifies abuse or makes it less abusive or makes it less important. Abuse is abuse, period. No further discussion.

"Ever had a realisation about your upbringing that turned something seemingly harmless to something really consequential, that made you go oooohh f**k ?",865,hthcz7,211,"I'll go first. I'm Indian, multicultural, multilingual country. Although Hindi is our national language it's not spoken everywhere. Every state has it's own mother tongue. In fact in urban, semi-urban areas English is more common, depending on where you are. 

I'm from the north part of the country. Hindi is my mother tongue. And if I'd grown up there I'd probably have turned out fine. But we shifted base to another part of the country when I was in my teens, where Hindi was spoken but it wasn't dominant. 

The only kind of interaction with my parents was abusive. Like there was no neutral, everything involved being verbally assaulted. In fact they would laugh at us when we mispronounced Hindi words. Like it was the funniest joke ever.  So you learn early enough to keep your mouth shut. And speak only when you're spoken too. In time your forget how abnormal that is. 
My mother is the definition of anti-social and we didn't have family or friends in the city. So the only socialisation that we had was with people our age or with adults we met in our own life. And everyone spoke a mix of Hindi and English, that is Hinglish. 

So as a result our (sis and I) Hindi sucks. When we go back to the north, I struggle so hard, even with cousins much younger than me, it's embarrassing. And everyone back home thinks just cause we live in the big city our Hindi sucks. But no, it's cause these freaking parents never spoke to us. How else is a child supposed to learn conversational skills. 

Like I knew my Hindi sucked but I didn't realize why, untill I started recovering. Lol. It was like a light bulb moment, oh your parents are actually supposed to talk to you. That's what normal families do. 

It's so messed up. Cause my English isn't where I'd like it to be, cause trauma. My Hindi isn't great, cause parents. And then  the fun stuff that trauma does to your brain which makes higher cognitive skills a joyride. 

Language is my primary mode of self expression, I need words to make sense of my world. I've wanted to be a writer since I was a little child. But I find myself constantly grasping and failing to find the right words in either language. And bilinguals will get this, that you end up seeing the world with two shades of color. You translate your experiences in your daily life. It's supposed to enrich your experience. But I'm at a blank most of the time when it comes to finding, what I need, to express myself. I don't even have much of a social life but aaah even just to find the words to process this damn trauma is a struggle at times. Especially when you're self recovering and your journal is all you have. 

So yeah, it sucks. It's not like its undoable. But there are so many languages to learn and I don't even have a grasp over my foundations. Thanks mom and dad. 

Would love to know about your ah, fuck moments.

EDIT : It's my bed time. I'm gonna read and try to respond as much as I can tomorrow. Thankyou everyone. I love learning and sharing, it helps so damn much. ❤"
Just learned about Imaginary Audience,864,g3rmwi,120,"Someone posted to r/anxiety about the Imaginary Audience, and reading the [Wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_audience) about it, I realized that I'm still stuck in this mindset because my audience was never imaginary.


> The basic premise of the topic is that people who are experiencing it feel as though their behavior or actions are the main focus of other people's attention. 

>It is defined as how willing a child is to reveal alternative forms of themselves. 

>It refers to the belief that a person is under constant, close observation by peers, family, and strangers. 

>This imaginary audience is proposed to account for a variety of adolescent behaviors and experiences, such as heightened self-consciousness, distortions of others' views of the self, and a tendency toward conformity and faddisms.


Bouncing back and forth between neglect and a microscope means my adult self either feels like the life of the party or the wallflower playing with the dog alone on the back porch. Everyone is watching or no one is watching. Everyone is judging or no one is judging. Everyone cares or no one cares. 

This explains a lot."
"""Health comes first"" is such a lie",860,m1lwpl,142,"Don't get me wrong, it shouldn't be: Health, physical or mental, *should* come first. It's just my experience that it doesn't. Not in school. Not in college. Not at work. I am not even blaming individual people, who I'm sure don't lack empathy or goodwill - it's just how our society is structured.

As long as I get good grades I can count on the sympathy of my professors. I'll get a pat on the back and a ""I'm sorry to hear that"" while they guide me out of their office. But the moment my performance drops I can get kicked out of college just like any other malfunctioning person. Teachers will tell you your wellbeing is always the most important thing, but that will never translate to an extended deadline or the help you actually need.

Employers are the same. ""Your wellbeing is more important than anything we do here"". Well, instead of making me go to mindfulness seminars and sending me mental health questionnaires, why don't you stop piling more and more work on me? Why don't you stop fucking emailing over the weekend?

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, there are nice and empathetic people. This is not about an individual boss or teacher. It's just the institutions and the way our society works. I have (C)PTSD and what I really need is time to breathe. I need space.

I had a complete mental breakdown, collapsing in the staircase of my boyfriend's apartment building. I am losing hair because of stress (I am a 24 year old woman) and last week I suddenly lost sight in my right eye (it came back), also because of stress. People tell me ""how about you keep the evening free and stop doing homework"" when I am hopping from deadline to deadline and literally can't.

Health doesn't come first. Nor does mental health or general wellbeing. This is something we need to try and fix in our societies."
"Today I realized why being around friends is so so triggering. They’re happy, they’re in the moment, and it makes me feel invisible, alone, guilty, and ashamed.",860,jlbt63,54,"I had two friends over today. (They both had Covid about 2 months ago but since tested negative so I felt it was safe. Plz don’t covid@me, I do take it seriously.)

Every time anyone asks me to hang out, I usually just try to find excuses not to. I couldn’t figure out why, but I just don’t have the energy, the idea makes me anxious, sometimes angry. I thought it might be good for me to be social, for once this year lol. So I had them over.

I ended up sneaking away because I was feeling super triggered and wanted to calm myself. when my girlfriend found me, I was crying and saying “I can’t do this, I’m not like them anymore.” Behind that trigger, I feel guilt and shame because I feel like a let down, like I should be better for them. and then feel like everyone is going to abandon me, or that I’m just driving people away. I feel like Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh. Like I’m getting in the way of their happiness. At the same time, I get angry and just wish they’d have listened to me when I say I’m not in the right headspace. They, and I, kept catching me staring silently at nothing for much of the night. I get angry because I don’t see any effort on their part to even do a quick google search to see what I, and others, are going through. 

I don’t mean to come across like a jerk or a sob story. I want them to be happy and am so glad they are. I just feel so alienated when I can’t figure out how to be happy, or how to even pretend. They mean well, but they tend to make it so simple. “You should try being social. You should get outside. Maybe you’re overthinking it. Maybe you need more sleep. Are you drinking enough water?” Like I said, they mean well, but it’s frustrating when i am doing all of those things. I’ll respond, “yeah, sorry, I just feel really triggered.” I don’t think they understand what “triggered” means to someone with PTSD, and I get upset that they haven’t tried to understand. Like, if I saw a friend going through what I go through, I’d try to understand what they’re talking about before I push solutions at them. 

Anyway, it’s not just with friends. It’s in general. Living in a world that you don’t understand, with people that do not understand you. It’s exhausting to try to appear as human, and I feel so much better when I’m alone with my girlfriend or playing guitar or whatever. I hope this changes when I am ready. I used to be fun. Shoutout to my girlfriend for being the most patient, understanding, empathetic human."
DAE hide what they really enjoy because it doesn't feel safe to share your interests?,857,fm3qjw,98,"I'm sure this post has been made before. I have a huge problem sharing my interests, to the point where the things I enjoy the most are kept secret. These are harmless things like movies, books, games, etc, but somehow they all feel shameful if I like them too much. 

I'm not sure if I'm afraid of judgement or just feeling unsafe with sharing. Some things get filtered out if I enjoy them a moderate amount, and then I can share them with other people. But my favorite things are on lockdown inside. If someone asked me if I liked those things, I'd probably lie and say no, or try not to show any enthusiasm.

Sometimes it feels like I gaslit myself because the desire to keep my interests hidden is so strong. If someone asks me ""what kind of x do you like"" I can't think of anything sometimes. I've tried to start making lists of my favorite things to combat this, but they're still hard to remember, and sometimes I look at those lists and don't feel connected with any of those things.

I feel like I probably look like a really boring person on the outside who has no interests, but the truth is I can't be outwardly passionate about things I enjoy. Anyone else struggle with this? Has anyone worked on it successfully?"
i feel like a big pile of maladaptive coping mechanisms in a trench coat.,856,jnjr3r,102,forever wondering if i have any personality quirks or if they're all just a result of trauma.
I don't know if this is a CPTSD thing or not. D.A.E. avoid doing chores when you'll be seen/ if others are around?,855,hm7bob,169,"For example, I can't stand to wash dishes, to clean, to take showers, etc. if I could get ""caught"" doing it. If someone might see me do it, or (god forbid) compliment me about it, if almost rather die.

I don't like doing these chores but I pretty much can barely manage to do them if someone will see me.

I have not figured out why, either. I just know I associate it with being beaten. I'm assuming I was beaten for doing it wrong, but I don't remember that (and I remember many other incidents and their precursors).

It's a very intense aversion to doing any ""good"" chore if I'll get caught. Many people think it's laziness. It's fear. 

Is this just specific to my circumstances, or can anyone else understand what I'm talking about? This has plagued me for decades. I hate, hate, hate it!"
I don't know who I am. I wasn't raised as a person.,849,kxv9d3,52,"I wasn’t raised as a person, but as an emotional support for my father. My mother allowed it to happen, my father kept her busy protecting herself. I was there solely to be his counsellor, his parent, to ease his emotional pain, solve all of his problems. I was raised as an extension of himself, to not be my own person, to not have my own sense of self, to be literally and completely “self-less”. To not have my own personality, wants or needs. I was taught to be the perfect caretaker; kind, attentive, patient, not allowed to have boundaries. If I were those things then I would be found useful. When I wasn’t those things, I was punished.

When he died, the weight of *his* world was lifted from my shoulders and I was relieved. I thought I was finally free. It gave me the opportunity to finally step out of the fear, obligation, and guilt. The FOG. I realized that I wasn’t a person, that my personality was just a mix of trauma responses and coping mechanisms. That I had absolutely no idea who *I* was. I had to look through thirty years of FOG and try to find any pieces of a real me that might be there. To understand why I reacted to things the way I did, why I felt the way I felt. Why it was so hard to look after myself. I was too busy caring for my father and everyone else that I’d never learned boundaries. I was taught I couldn’t have them. I was taught that everything was my responsibility. I sifted through the wreckage of what I thought was me and had to decide which bits stayed and which bits got removed. Like a surgeon with a tumor. I learned that boundaries existed, I was allowed to have them. That there is a clear boundary in what is and is not actually my responsibility. And I learned, despite none of this being my fault, regardless of whether I deserved what happened (I did not), that my recovery and my journey to a sense of self was *my* responsibility.

That was probably the hardest lesson. Understanding that no one could do any of the recovery for me. Counsellors, therapists, psychiatrists, and friends could aid me, but ultimately it was up to me. Having learned boundaries, I couldn’t reasonably expect that of anyone. It would be completely unfair and be the exact same kind of life of expectations that I was recovering from myself.

That was the lesson my father never learned. No one can save you except yourself. When you put the expectation of a saviour on someone else, you’re not healing yourself, you are passing it on and harming someone else. A properly raised adult who was taught boundaries and encouraged to be an individual would not submit to fully giving up themselves and their life to fix someone. So my father molded his own. Me.

Edit: I want to reply to all of you but it's going to take a little bit of time! Thank you so much for the awards and all of your insights. <3"
"I wasn't lazy, I was traumatized.",860,dmed7j,96,"This makes me so angry and in the same time so desperate to understand how much potential of what I could have done had been thrown away, because I know today it wasn't laziness. It was simply dissociation and pain that took everything from me, in a way that wouldn't leave any capacity for intellectual exploration I am so naturally drawn towards."
CPTSD feels like constant burnout.,856,gwjyp5,98,"I really thought, I could do it. I thought I could just live a normal life like everybody else. I thought I could just forget the feeling of being helplessly overwhelmed, hopeless, depressed and anxious. Suck it up and move on. Go to therapy for a couple of months and things will get better. I thought I could forget the 100 times I've been at that point before and move on, like a good, functional member of society.

But - breaking news to myself - _I can't_ I fucking can't deal with this anymore. I AM DONE. For years I have scraped together all the energy I had left, all the attention and concentration I had left, everyday, because after the next big thing it will all get better. I just have to be strong, just push through. Ignore the pain, the headache, the tiredness, the stress, the pounding heart, the anxiety. Just push though one last thing then it's going to get better. Then you can rest. But it never gets better. I can never rest. I can't tell you the last time when I actually felt rested and relaxed. I find myself at exactly this place every time, with everything I do.

I always end up in an environment that sucks all the energy out of me. I always end up here. Where I am dissociating at work meetings, hiding and crying instead of working, completely overwhelmed, thinking this will never change.

I know I am probably flashbacking. But I am so fucking done with this. I am so fucking done being tired, fighting depression everyday. I am so fucking done constantly battling my anxiety. I am so done keeping myself from dissociating. I am DONE fighting with myself about whether my reaction is appropriate or just another maladaptive strategy that is a leftover from my childhood. I'm done pushing through. I thought, I could do this the healthy way but I can't.

And still, STILL I know that these are just words and I _will_ push through. I will put in the countless overtime needed to finish this that noone will appreciate in any way. And I will nod and smile at my probably narcissistic boss trying my hardest not to flashback because he is so horribly similar to my abusive father. I'll do all that. I'll do the good things because I am too much of a coward to finally stand up for myself and scream in everybody's fucking face: I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

Edit: I wished so much I could reply to all of you. You're amazing. I was hesitant about being so vulnerable to anyone, but your sweet replies encouraged me to be more open and honest. It means so much to me how you're listening, relating and giving me advice. Thank you so so much, you're amazing people. I feel a bit better now. Sending lots of love to you all. I'll need to go to sleep now, I'll try and reply in the morning."
"This has to be the most kind, welcoming place on the entire internet.",852,jfhll6,53,Thanks to everyone here who makes me feel like I can talk about absolutely anything I'm feeling regarding my mental health without getting shamed. This is the only place I have EVER been able to talk about certain things and I've only ever been met with understanding and positivity. Thank you all. Today is a tough one.
Never accept lectures on morality from child abusers.,854,jd9soy,60,"Do not confuse legitimate morality and ethics with the narcissistic justifications of abusers and a society that sweeps abuse under the rug to maintain a status quo.

""Honor thy Parents"" - what unconditionally?  Even if their unacceptable behaviour was devastatingly detrimental to your long-term mental health?

""You owe your parents for giving you the gift of life"" - Although it's long been considered a tired clichè, the fundamental message still rings true; no one asked to be born.  They foisted the role of parenthood upon themselves.  They did not fulfill that role and you are suffering the consequences of their mistakes.  Life does not feel like much of a gift when you cannot function due to trauma and poor development.

""I gave you a better life than I had"" - because you are a victim of abuse then it justifies you becoming a perpetrator of abuse to an innocent party?  If someone punches me in the face, can I punch someone completely innocent in the face and justify it by saying it happened to me?  No one is pullling your strings, you can consciously choose not to abuse.

""You holding me accountable for my abuse is hurtful to me and you should feel ashamed and guilty"" - Kindly fuck off with your shameless guilt-tripping you transparently manipulative sociopath.

Your mind has been wrongfully programmed to consider these things at the expense of your emotional well-being.  Do not fall for it - you were the victim."
Has anyone else spent so long being a depressed and anxious that important tasks such as school and everyday things seem irrelevant.,851,ik5hwq,39," I know how important these tasks are, but it feels like getting through the day alive is the only thing that has any meaning to me. It pains me that I cant bring myself to put in more effort; even to things I normally love doing. i want to be excited to be productive, but I just can't bring myself to enjoy anything. And when I do actually try, it's just SO mentally exhausting. it's this false sense of ""fun"" and ""productivity"" meant to avert unwanted sympathy until I just lose interest in anything I'm doing. I might just be a lazy ass and ranting for nothing but damn it's so hard to even get out of bed some days. 

when I try to explain to people why I'm like this, either they try to understand or flat out act like they do and tell me to be more productive, but it makes it worse somehow. I know they think I'm lazy or that I don't care, and they may not say it, but I know better. Maybe I'm overstepping by assuming that, but I can't help thinking that everyone is just silently judging me. 

Often times I'll push my friends away before they do it to me. I wouldn't say I'm delusional but I have this nagging thought that everyone around me is just pretending to like me so they can use me. I can be a social butterfly but i'm motivated by fear. The fear that one wrong word or social cue could mean the difference between someone tolerating and hating me. (Not that i want nor care if people like me, but social situations are soo tiring, I try to avoid them. Yet society expects me to be a certain way so its a double standard. Either way I get the short end of the stick.) Even if it is not true, I just can't shake the thought that the world is out to get me.

 I want to be happy, but I start to lose interest in even \*wanting\* to be happy. I've just accepted that I may be an eternal sad boi and all I can do is fake my way through it all. 

though the thing I hold onto through all this mental instability, is that life is a beautiful roller coaster. It can be such a shit show sometimes, but you cant have the downs without the ups, and the ups wouldn't mean anything without the downs. I know how happiness feels, it's a familiar feeling that always feels \*just\* out of reach. some day I know i may have a definitive sense of happiness again. But until then all I can do is keep surviving. Someday I hope I'll be myself again"
I'm really tired of fighting to heal,852,heuxog,159,"This isn't really a rant, more of a vent. I'm just really tired. It's never ending; the working on myself, the confronting my fears big and small, the vigilance to my vigilance. I just want to rest. I'm tired of questioning my own emotions. I just want to be alone, no other people in my life, just pets, and a secluded home in the middle of nowhere. 
 
That's all. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk."
"If anyone needs to hear it, vaginal lubrication doesn't mean you ""wanted it""",854,lijqjq,50,"NSFW; TW: sexual violence, sexism

I just found this article that explains vaginal lubrication doesn't mean one is aroused, and that it actually happens any time one is faced with the _possibility_ of penetration, including in the case of assault, as one's body's clever way of protecting one from possible injury. So yeah, if anyone needed to hear that, science says if you're wet it doesn't mean you want it. And if anyone tells you otherwise, they can eat shit.

Does anyone else feel like they need to prove they are a functioning human to be loved?,853,j004bu,51,"I don't usually post anything to reddit but I needed to get this off of my chest somehow. I am struggling a lot lately, but do seem to be a functional human from the outside looking in - I'm a nursing student and a freelance writer. I have been getting all A's even through the pandemic.

The problem is that I have a long history of struggle with mental illness as well as physical illness (endometriosis.) Years ago, I was in and out of mental hospitals and unable to hold a job, let alone attend school. 

I moved out of my abusive family's home, attended a vocational rehabilitation program and climbed my way up to where I am with great effort. But... I feel like an imposter. I struggle so much every day, even though I manage to finish what I need to most days. I feel like I want to die frequently when the smallest thing goes wrong as I am at my limit already. I feel like everything is going to fall apart and I'm going to end up alone. 
My physical health problems are not helping this either as I am in pain every day and I wonder how long I can manage both my emotional and physical pain. I feel like I am just waiting for everything to fall apart.

Sorry for the essay and thank you to anyone that bothered to read this far. Does anyone else relate? Or have any tips for coping with this?"
So my mom found a note I gave her as a child. And now I’m crying.,847,fvogeb,118,"It’s an apology letter from me to her. She sent a picture of it and captioned it “you were so cute as a kid”. The thing is it shows me how much I believed as a kid that I owed her an apology for my existence. I was always told that I was the cause of all her problems. I have no idea what I was apologizing for but it was probably something very trivial as I was a dream kid from a young age. I always followed the rules and acted perfectly so my parents would like me. But it was never enough. Any mistakes I made were personal affronts to her and I’d be punished harshly. Theres a damn good chance I was locked in my room while writing this note. I learned that I was a mistake and to always apologize for taking up space which was very traumatic. It’s ironic that she looks back at that and thinks I was cute for groveling for some acceptance and love. I should have had all of that without fighting for it. 
Anyway, now I’m choking crying realizing she will never understand how much she hurt me and how much it still hurts me.

Also I realized I don’t have anyone in my life that I can be vulnerable with and share this story. So I turned here.

Food for thought,850,bg0zf5,38,
Does anyone else think they’re a solid person with lots of potential which is being wasted/hindered by trauma ?,845,ga5k6f,100,"I look at myself and I know all the negative thoughts and negative self image I have is not true. It’s very hard, I admit my identity is built around this negativity and is very much a part of me but somewhere deep down I feel like it can be overcome and beat down, it’s not true. It is a result of life experiences and other people’s opinions/perceptions. 

Sometimes I feel angry at myself not in a bad way but only to the negative voice in my head like WTF are you doing. You know it’s not true why are you still believing these thoughts and images. 

I strongly feel like I can live much better and I am going to do it because it’s useless letting childhood or whatever life’s shitty experiences you had define your future path and entire life ahead of you. I feel like I’m understanding myself better and slowly moving on to forgive myself and let go. Unhappy and immature people are going to remain that way and die that way. And this includes parents as well. There’s simply nothing you can do to change them or improve life. It’s not our responsibility."
Being gaslit so much as a teenager has made me assume nobody believes me/ instantly thinks I'm bad,844,deiht8,56,"At 12 it was ""that's no way to talk about your mother"" when I would tell my dad (who didn't live with us) that mum was horrible to me. I didn't have the vocabulary to know I was being abused. 

At 15/16 it was ""teenage rebellion"". My mum would kick me out regularly, and my friends parents started to believe I was a bad kid, and that what I said about my mum were just stories. They viewed it from their own parenting style I guess... Like they would only kick their child out if they were out of control. Whereas, my mum kicked me out bc she loved having the power to do it. It made her happy that everyone saw me as a bad influence & her as the victim-a mother just trying her best.

17, during my A levels, I wanted to move out and tried to ask my teachers to help me. They told me there weren't many options bc I'm too old and that the housing will probably be worse than my current situation. ""is it really that bad?"". Idk I've been telling you lot for years but don't worry about it. So I spent my time working at a part time job far too much so I could stay out of the house, at the library, sofa surfing when I got kicked out inevitably every week. All my time was focused on surviving, less time studying and so my A levels were so shit I couldn't get into uni/ out of my mums house like the teachers assumed I would be able to do. 

At 18/19, I told my auntie. ""mothers and their daughters... All girls fight with their mums"". I explained that I don't fight with my mum, I run from her. Telling your daughter ""it's no wonder your dad killed himself"" bc I had a messy room is NOT just a case of ""mothers and their daughters"". 

In therapy now at 21. Something that comes up a lot is that I say ""theyll think I'm bad"" or thar nobody believes me when I'm telling the truth. I know that what happened was real. I still live in my mums house but I have outlets- martial arts, gym, library to go to. She now has a husband who she can manipulate and control instead of me. Moving out in 2020.

Also, when a child on the news dies at the hands of their abuser and everyone throws their hands up asking ""how did nobody notice? How could someone do that? Why did nobody stop it from happening?""... Its always those people who excuse the abusers in their life talking the loudest. It's not fucking surprising when nobody listens to children when they literally tell people what's happening."
Fuck the glorification of shitty parents on TV (spoilers for TV shows below),850,i2hy3o,144,"Most recent example that comes to my mind is Good Girls.

Annie is parentifying her son, big time. It's disgusting, and triggering, and it's supposed to be her character's redeeming quality, that she's a good mom who loves her kid and is close to him.

Sex Education is another celebration of shitty boundaries.

Gilmore Girls remains the biggest culprit.

Parents aren't supposed to be your cool best friend. It's disgusting. And it's all single mothers, as though having no relationship somehow exempts people from treating their children like children.

That is all."
I have to keep reminding myself that I was neglected.,850,gvwjw4,70,"I have a lot of handicaps, like social anxiety, learned helplessness, weird avoidance issues.

Even after more than a solid decade of working with myself, trying to figure out where the blind spots are. My worst habit is blaming myself for inadequacies that are there for no other reasons than neglect. I have conversations in my head that go like this:

Me: ""You didn't handle that last negotiation well. You were waffly and awkward. You should have been clearer about what you wanted.""

Then I have to remind myself; ""You were neglected. Your parents never negotiated anything with you. It was their terms, or else. All the way down the line. They never let you have a job. They just bossed you around all the time. You weren't even allowed to have your own feelings about anything.""

Or I'll think back to a disastrous friendship or relationship and I'll feel ashamed it went off the rails. Or that I didn't recognize I was being abused.

Then I have to remind myself; ""You were neglected. You were socially isolated. You were under perpetual house arrest. You weren't allowed to date. You weren't even allowed to talk on the phone. You were never allowed to join a team sport or a school activity. You were kept in your room for your entire childhood, pretty much. Of course you don't know how to manage friendships or relationships. You should have been taught these things, but you weren't.""

I have to do this because neglect and abuse always teach you to blame yourself first. You are taught to punish yourself for not being able to do things you were never taught how to do. Responsible parents coach their children through the hundreds to thousands of small details involved in learning how to be social, how to execute a plan, how to establish boundaries. Instead they indulged in their own bizarre power trips and left us to fend for ourselves while blaming us for everything. So I have to unlearn blame and quietly, patiently teach myself all the things I wasn't taught how to do.

It sucks. But there it is."
Oof...,852,a2gkce,32,
My father just validated a traumatic memory that recently surfaced for me and frankly it made my day.,850,emxpl6,58,"I was honest to him about the memory that had resurfaced when we talked about my mom (my abuser).

He told me he remembered it happening as well and he said it was bittersweet that I remembered it now too.

""I'm sorry your mother did that to you, son. *You didn't deserve it.* In that moment I looked at your mother screaming at you and I thought, 'I can't believe I married that woman, and I can't believe she would treat her child like that'. I was fucking furious. Please let me know if you need to talk to me about these memories or if I can take you to your therapist again.""

"“It’s not ‘putting up with you,’ it’s a joy.”",841,g7046g,54,"My girlfriend said this to me tonight after I thanked her for putting up with my quirks. It hit my right in the gut, and I started sobbing immediately.

Anyone else feel better the longer they are away from their parents?,846,f94mal,143,"Does anyone else feel better when you spend a long time away from your parents (or other family members)? I’m an adult, but I haven’t talked to either of my parents in maybe 3-4 weeks, and I’ve felt great. My stuttering got better, and I was more outgoing. I just talked to my mom on the phone and now I just feel really lousy to say the least, even though she was nice enough.

For those of you who are able to put space between you and your parents, how much space do you use? How do you put up boundaries when your childhood wasn’t “that bad” (but it was to you)?"
I hate the notion that my abuse should have made me a kinder person.,845,f4y900,116,"So often I read or hear stories, people saying how being abused has made them more sensitive for others needs, more protective of people, a better person. And it's good if that's what it's some for you, I guess... but it hasn't for me.

It has made me bitter, aged beyond my years, cold, untrusting and focused on myself and my survival. It has torpedoed relationships and friendships. It has often made me manipulative and an asshole.

I was a kind kid, I had a bleeding heart, it got beaten out of me and more, and it feels like there's only a lump of coal left in my chest. That's ok with me, I've made peace with it as good as one can I suppose. But everyone raving on about what a good person it has made them makes me feel like i couldn't even been abused right. As if it's my fault that I could not learn the lesson that was so obvious and apparent to other survivors. 

Good for you if you took something positive from it, I just hate the culture that bad things happening to you are seen as a fucking learning opportunity. Sometimes things just suck and they damage you. I'm not the shiny, gold mended pot. I'm the pot that's ugly, drips all over your floor and if you pick me up you'll probably cut yourself. Because that's how pots work.

She then got me some water and listened to me tell her how overwhelmed I was by all the noise. I apologised for acting like a “scared shelter puppy”.

I’m realizing my trauma was so damaging that my anxiety tics from the abuse were misdiagnosed as Tourette’s Syndrome,838,lzs32z,40,"I never had TS, but I didn’t realize until now. The neurologist I went to when I was 8 years old for (quote from the medical records) “screaming that I wanted to die” and “hitting and punching herself” and he ignored it and claimed they were tics. I don’t understand how a child screaming that they want to die can just be waved off without any suspicion. I was literally self harming in the only way I knew how. I was being severely abused, neglected, and traumatized by my adoptive abuser and child abuse from adoptive parents is actually not uncommon. Not even the therapist I saw afterwards cared that I was showing signs of trauma. The therapist even labeled me as a problem child for having anger issues when I was just angry about the injustice I faced. Thanks for letting me rant, I’m just angry at the world today."

"I broke up with the person I've been dating for over a year because he couldn't fully commit to me, and I'm proud of myself for having worked on it with him (and in therapy) and ultimately realizing this isn't something I wanted to keep doing anymore.",837,jz051w,60,"I met a man on reddit last year when I wasn't looking for anything romantic, but sparks flew between us and he pushed for me to meet him. I flew to his country to spend time with him in person. We're great together; he's kind, understanding, and communicates mostly, same with me. He kept holding back on me though, as in he had too many issues and wouldn't commit to me (be my boyfriend), and enough came to be enough and I told him that I'm tired of hiding how I want him to commit to me and he couldn't give me any answer or explanation. I was right to end this and I'm relieved, honestly. I'll no longer be constantly questioning why I'm not good enough for him to commit to. I'm proud of myself for giving this a shot though, and for not flexing my boundaries for him, and for sticking to them. In end the end, i learned a lot about what I am and am not willing to tolerate in a relationship, and how to communicate healthily. My therapist also said she was proud of me, and I gave it time and tried to work on it but it was clear that while he did have feelings for me, he wasn't going to commit to me. Lesson learned, and I will take these experiences with this ""relationship"" into consideration if I ever get into another relationship.

The concept of nostalgia makes me sad. I don’t have a happy childhood to pine for because mine was stolen from me.,839,mhhl06,83,"I’m in my late 20s and it seems like a lot of people my age love looking back on their childhood fondly, remembering all their happy memories of being a carefree kid. Playing with friends, having no worries. They talk about wishing they could go back to those days and feeling nostalgic for simpler times. 

And it just makes me sad because I can’t relate at all. I don’t recall ever being a carefree child. I have always been plagued by anxiety and trauma and loss and fear. Family stuff, then bullying which developed into social anxiety which developed into panic disorder.... I’ve had to carry the weight of the world since before I could even articulate what the world was. People who didn’t know what was going on would call me mature for my age but it was the constant anxiety, even since elementary school. 

I missed out on a happy childhood and never got a chance to be carefree. Now I’m missing out on getting to be nostalgic too. And it’s really hard to function as a responsible adult when you never got a chance to be carefree as a child."
My husband went in my inner child visualization with me. I found out afterwards.,837,kfiao7,50,"I opened my eyes from an intense inner child visualization. (It was totally unexpected, by the way. We were in couples therapy so I'm not even sure why this was taking place, or if that's even what it's called.) 

After it ended I said, ""gosh, that was so intense."" My husband said, ""I know, my heart was racing. I was so angry! I wanted to start punching people""  
I said, ""wait... you did it with me?"" 
""yeah, of course, I love you""  


This man really entered my traumatic memory and viewed it with me. He was there. I about died right there.  

(For reference the memory was basically child me hiding under a table from my mom who was being mean to say the least)  

In the exercise I was asked what adult me would do if I saw child me in that situation. I said I would take her for ice cream right then and there. My husband later said to me while we were talking about it that he would've ""fought"" for me or something, basically he was still the ""adult"" in his scenario. But I said, ""no. I don't want you to be my rescuer or my parent. I think I would've liked child you to come sit under the table with me, and say, 'hey, I know where my mom keeps her ice cream'""

Does anyone else feel like you are an orphan even though your parents are still alive?,837,kpynui,103,"Does anyone else feel like you are an orphan even though your parents are still alive? 
Like even when you lived under their roof you were still a child fending for yourself. 
Watching your back. 
Making sure you were provided for because no one else would see to it. 
Learning how to beat the system in a world where nobody explains the rules to you. Because you’re just a kid. And the system is set up for you to fail. 

And you are validated in feeling like an orphan. Everyone notices. 
“Oh, you’re so grown up for your age.”
“How did you know how to do that already?”
“I never would have guessed you’re so young.”
People know you are different. But still they won’t or they can’t help. 

Then you’re grown up. It’s such a relief to graduate into a world that’s scary, but so much less challenging in ways. 
People listen to you. Take what you do for work, where you live, for granted. 
There’s not so much desperate desire to be rescued from your situation. 
But then the holidays roll around. Or even just throughout the year, the dreaded “family” topic comes up. 
“Is your family from here?” (No.) “Do you go back and see them a lot?” (No.) “I bet you miss them.” (I don’t.)
I tried being honest. Flippantly declare that I don’t talk to my parents. I don’t know where my dad lives. I purposefully do not know his whereabouts since I turned 18. I never have my own plans for the holidays. Who would I go see?

Eventually the honesty becomes more of a burden than just dodging the family questions. I have yet to encounter a coworker or a professor or any “polite” acquaintance that is able to handle the “no family” issue with grace. When I tell the truth they probe more. When I state “I was abused” they suddenly look ashamed for asking so many questions and you can hear a pin drop in the silence. 

It truly feels like if I lied and told people my parents were dead, I would get a more appropriate response. I would get acceptance, with a bit of sympathy. And they wouldn’t keep asking questions once they knew what happened to my family. 

It’s not that I want to burden people with my sob story. Especially in a casual, work setting I wonder if it’s appropriate to say anything at all. I just wish people would understand they are asking questions that are not guaranteed to have a pretty answer. So maybe proceed with a bit more preparation?? 

I hope others can relate to this. I hope there is someone who will read this and know they’re not the only one feeling this way. 
I think these feelings have always existed but really been brought on by the corporate bullshit zoom calls where everyone assumes you are visiting your family for the holidays. It’s painful to navigate. Even when you have come out on the other side of abuse, there are still reminders that just don’t go away."
My trauma started so much earlier than I thought,839,kknmfn,121,"Back in spring I had a big confrontation with my mom and told her her that I had been traumatized by my childhood. She didn't handle it well, got very defensive, and as a result I went no-contact for several months afterwards. 

We recently reconnected and she told me that thinking she would never hear from me again made her reflect on all the mistakes she had made. She's still not taking full responsibility for her actions, but she's at least making attempts at apologizing and she's starting to actually tell me the truth about my childhood instead of the ""I did nothing wrong. You had a perfect childhood"" painting she's preferred to paint all these years. 

Yesterday I called her just to say Merry Christmas, and I ended up having a long phone call with her. The talk mostly centered around her telling me about *her* traumas and *her* hardships, but when she started talking about how difficult her pregnancy was and how sick she was during my first year of life, I was able to very gently ask some questions about what that looked like for me as a baby. 

My mom has always maintained that she was such a good mom when I was a baby because she breastfed and because we co-slept. But yesterday she admitted to me that she was so depressed that we co-slept because she was too exhausted to get out of bed and put me in my crib. She just kept me with her so she could just roll over and nurse me and then go back to sleep. She said she never talked to me, never played with me, and when I wasn't sleeping she just put me on the floor and left me alone to play with my toys. 

I don't blame her for her postpartum depression, but my heart aches knowing that I was being emotionally abandoned pretty much immediately. I've spent years in therapy being confused about how I could have such horrible attachment problems when my mom claimed to have been such a secure and loving mother in my infancy. Now I know."
To those who struggle to accept the emotional abuse because they were physically/financially taken care of: a golden cage is still a cage.,834,dzf5rd,126,
"anytime i showed anger, sadness, or disagreement i was attacked. viciously. i learned i must be silent early: my feelings, opinions, and boundaries do not matter. i, as a human being, do not matter. i was silenced again and again. now, they wonder why i cannot speak.",837,dgje5c,129,
Anyone else realize that they’ve conflated their “open-mindedness” with a total lack of boundaries?,837,cq0f61,110,"All my life I’ve gotten along really well with people on the social fringes—people with extremely stigmatized hobbies, and the generally socially awkward and mentally ill. I’ve always prided myself in seeing the best in others and providing a judgment-free zone. And though I still consider lack of superficiality an important aspect of who I am and what I value about my personality, it’s only been fairly recently that I’ve realized how much of my “open-mindedness” and “empathy” resulted in not slamming the door on people when I seriously needed to, and how much I make excuses for others when that’s not my job. 

I think that growing up with excoriating abuse gave me a seriously dulled danger response and warped standards of normalcy. On paper, I can identify unacceptable behavior and it’s easy to say that I wouldn’t put up with it, but in practice, when said garbage behavior is wrapped up in a bunch of other charming and sympathetic qualities, it’s far too instinctive for me to give the most optimistic and forgiving interpretations. I’m realizing that this is not really “kindness” or “open-mindedness”, this is just… letting people drag their dirty shoes through my life. The hardest lesson I’ve had to swallow is that the shitty way someone treats others is eventually going to be the way they’ll treat me, but my brain never wants to believe that."
Did anyone else’s trauma take away their ability to accomplish all of their life dreams?,839,hfnab2,125,"When I say my trauma ruined my life, I really mean it. And people say “it’s never too late to start!” but the thing is, my trauma has shaped everything about me. To the point where I am unable to do even basic things. I have to accept the reality of the fact that there are things I will never be able to accomplish again. 

When I was younger, there was so much I wanted to do. I was going to be a designer, I worked my ass off at college. I eventually decided it wasn’t for me. I went to a different school to work in the medical field. I would have become a doctor. 

But instead, I got sick. My brain can’t keep up like it used to. I can’t go into public places, I dissociate so severely that I have difficulty socializing. I can’t commit to anything, because I never know how good or bad the day will be. The sad reality is that I will never be able to accomplish those things that I dreamed of. On top of that, I have DID, so that adds a whole new level of difficult.

When I say my trauma took everything from me, I really mean it. When I was a teenager, I wanted to move to a big city. Get a nice job that I worked hard for. Experience the world, with all it’s difficulty and in spite of my fear of the unknown. 

I now have to settle for a life path that is manageable. Right now, I’d be happy if I could get on disability and work 10 hours a week in an office. I want to live in my home town, because I know it’s safe. I can’t even drive myself around much anymore. 

All I’m saying is, my trauma really did take everything from me. My life became everything my teenage self would have feared the most. 

Did this happen to anyone else?

When you finally connect the dots and it hits you what exactly is happening,835,lhjzg2,68,"I grew up in a home that was pretty mentally abusive and somewhat physically abusive. 

Being berated happened frequently and over the most random ridiculous things at times. I never knew what would set my dad off or how I’d get blamed/punished for something.

As an adult, meetings with any perceived authority figure can be tough. I avoid sending emails or asking questions as much as possible at times. I avoid opening responses to emails for hours sometimes because I’m scared to continue dealing with it. This has been going on for years.

This morning it hit me. I’m actually having panic attacks over these. That’s why I just can’t do it or it’s super tough. Sigh. No wonder it’s so. darn. hard. Sigh"
DAE have trauma from bullying but feel like the word ‘bullying’ completely minimizes your experience?,835,jkm2d1,118,"i don’t know what it is, but i fucking hate the word bullying. it sounds SO childish to me. call it what it is: ABUSE!!!! 

TW: bullying, abuse, assault, sexual harassment

maybe it’s just me. it has taken me almost 10 years to believe the severity of my trauma. when i was 13/14 i was preyed on by a classmate constantly. he sexually harassed me relentlessly by moaning my name or petting me. he manipulated me by targeting my already existing mental health problems, and told me to take my pills whenever i reacted negatively. he’s thrown me into walls and on the floor, hit me, grabbed me and held me until i bruised. my friends thought it was like an abusive relationship without the relationship. he literally has strangled/suffocated me with an unopened trash bag. i now have a hard time reducing it down to bullying. 

i feel like no one would take me seriously by only saying “i’m traumatized by middle school bullying.” i feel like i have to spill my guts with all the details to be believed. i have to defend that it wasn’t just petty adolescent bullying, it was abuse. “bullying” implies adversity, but almost like it’s supposed to be a simply conquerable type of adversity, and not relentless shame and pain in one of the most critical points of brain development. 

trust me, i believe all bullying is bad. but i feel like anyone, probably everyone, can say they were bullied, but not everyone can say they were abused. does anyone else feel this distinction is necessary?

EDIT: holy cow, i never expected so much response like this. i’m so happy this has opened up a large discussion and is comforting for some. i just wanted to reiterate that there’s ABSOLUTELY a flip side to this. if your “bullying” wasn’t what you consider severe enough, that doesn’t matter. you are valid and no one ever had a right to mistreat you how they did. even if they never lay a hand on you, that mistreatment and abuse is unacceptable. i’m sorry we’ve all had to endure the worst side of someone, whether school peers, teachers, or family at home. you are not alone!

at the time of my abuse people, including teachers, witnessed some of his behavior with me and nothing happened. some of my classmates even encouraged us to date bc it was cute how we “bickered like an old married couple” aka me screaming at him to leave me alone. i always felt so delusional for thinking what he did was excessive bc no one ever helped me. i suffer from a lot of trauma imposter syndrome, like what i’ve been through isn’t enough. seeing some of the responses here is eye opening and makes me emotional, i feel seen. i’m honestly gobsmacked that some of you see it as horrible considering that’s the most i’ve ever been able to summarize it. what i would’ve given for people like you to have been witnesses instead of who i got. from the bottom of my heart, thank you."
"When I was younger, I was misdiagnosed with Borderline, instead of a female with autism & trauma (classic story). I was taught that my suicidal ideation was manipulation/attention-seeking. I can’t feel suicidal without being pained by my past damaging mental healthcare experiences caused by my SI.",834,jgi0h6,126,"

Now I can’t even feel suicidal (for fair reasons) without re-traumatizing myself because the professional and family members’ “help” harmed me. And when the help doesn’t help, we’re often labeled as noncompliant or difficult instead of professionals admitting a lack of material resources or professional skills.

What can happen if CPTSD is not addressed.,830,m4q7wz,144,"Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help. It is work and initially very hard, but the alternatives can be horrible for you and your loved ones."

It's really upsetting that I can't explain to other people, why it's so hard for me to care about myself (going to the doctor for example) or go to the neighbors to ask for something. Explaining I never had anyone teach me to care makes me afraid that they'll think it's an excuse and they seem so frustrated that I can't just stop doing the things like I'm doing them.

CPTSD was well-designed for a different era of human life,830,mghpwa,99,"I am sure that some of you must have had the same thought process as me, as we have learned about CPTSD, attachment disorder, etc: ""Why the hell would I have learned these behaviors that are SO counterproductive to a happy life?? Surely there must be a smarter way to adapt that doesn't leave me afraid of other people, attracted to abusive folks, unable to do daily life tasks..."" My therapist tells me repeatedly that they protected me as a child from an unsafe environment. But something else clicked for me as I've been reading Pete Walker's Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving (great book btw).

**CPTSD was designed for an era of human life that was VERY different from the modern world.** Given we've only been living this way (single-generation families in a home, highly mobile, highly independent in adulthood) for a few dozen to a hundred years - less in many countries - the reality is that we are adapted for a totally different social configuration. And humans are EXTREMELY social creatures, we regulate each other emotionally, we fit into a greater social machine, because even in the modern era, you literally cannot survive without someone taking care of you into adulthood. And a hundred, thousand, 10,000 years ago that was infinitely more true: to be rejected from the tribe, family, or village was tantamount to death.

Today, you are raised by one or two parents, sometimes with no other familial or friendly adults around. Pete Walker talks about ""safe enough"" or ""good enough"" relationships: many children these days are raised with zero of these, a guaranteed path to CPTSD. Historically, you would be raised by a group: aunts, uncles, grandparents, parents, cousins, neighbors, older siblings, etc. You would have daily exposure to a wide range of adults who cared about you, so even if your parents weren't great, you had the opportunity to healthily connect elsewhere. Nowadays with our isolated nuclear families and hyper-mobile tendency to move away from extended family, you get ONE shot for solid upbringing - your parent(s), with some lucky enough to have engaged grandparents or extended family or teachers - which are sometimes enough to prevent CPTSD from occurring or reduce the severity. And for as much as we malign parents for leaning on schools to help raise kids, human children were *never* meant to be raised by only one or two individual people, especially not people working 40+hrs a weeks. This is a great recipe for neglect at the very minimum.

Okay, so that explains why CPTSD is more prevalent these days. But what makes it well-designed? When I think about 500, 1000, 10000 years ago, and ask what kind of situation would a child have to be in to be as severely neglected and/or abused as many are in these modern isolated, stressful ""families"", they were very different from what is apparently just normal in modern times. If you were born a slave, member of a low caste, or servant in a village or society that treated such people as sub-human citizens, being surrounded by fearful, emotionally distant adults and having a life punctuated by abuse would have been the appropriate context because as an adult that wouldn't change: you would need to be fearful, subservient, and self-critical in order to survive and thrive. To be confident, secure, and willing to speak your mind or protect yourself from abuse could have gotten you killed or severely punished. If you were born a female in a society that had (has...) very deferent, subservient roles for women, it's the same issue: CPTSD is actually the ""correct"" model of upbringing to prevent you from being disowned or ostracized, which would have been the most dangerous thing possible. To embrace abusers, to dissociate from your true self and the pain you experience, and to people-please would actually be the safest form of personality in these kinds of scenarios. Human evolution favors that which helps you survive to reproduce. These would be ""adaptations"" needed to survive the life you were born into, not ""maladaptations"" as they are in the modern world where you can just *move away* from your abusive family and never talk to them again, and start a new life without their influence. Such a thing was never so easy until the last few decades, and has completely changed the script of a typical human life.  These adaptations would have even helped you be more comfortable in your situation, as dissociation and leaning into your bad circumstances can be less painful than internally flailing against them your whole life.

The loss of the ""village"" to raise children has been critically damaging to modern society, leaving children adrift to gamble solely on the suitability of their direct parent(s) to model healthy attachment and behavior. CPTSD, while infinitely frustrating to those of us trying to work through it now as adults in *completely* different contexts than we were prepared for as children, made much more sense in the historical context that we evolved in, when childhood and adulthood would likely see a very similar treatment of the same person, unlikely to move away from their birthplace.

These are just my musings as I work through my own journey and try to make sense of my own conditioning. Thank you for coming to my TED Talk."
"HAE ""sacrificed"" their youth to comfort/spare their mother?",828,hsv7ym,133,"My mother is really emotional and fragile. I've always known this, felt sorry for her, and taken this into account when being with her. By this I mean not being harsh on her, contained myself when angry with her, not speak my mind and always been a good kid. It's like I became a moma's boy, against my will, just to please her. I've even talk to her with a childish voice to not seem confrontrial and called her the equivalent of ""mom"" instead of ""mother"", just to not upset her.

I realise that this hasn't allowed me to develop some sides of my personality. I've been like this since I was 4-5 years old. I'm an only child and my mom is divorced.

I've never shown any anger, slammed the door, called her name and regret it afterwards or stood up for myself. I've never let her down to do what I really wanted. I've let her treat me like a child and been by her side to comfort and help her. I've endured hours after hours looking at pictures she's showing me from a vacation people I don't even know had. If I said anything she just pretended that she didn't hear it and continue where I interrupted. She has poured out her soul, said things that a young kid never ought to hear. But I just sat there and tried to comfort her.There's so many times I've just slowly died inside while imploding, just to spare her. I've become the most patient and comforting guy ever, but can't ever show any anger, though I'm often boiling on the inside.

I'm in my thirties now and I feel like by doing this I've sacrificed my own development and self-respect. I've become this guy full-time. I often talk with a soft voice, feel like I'm constantly walking on egg-shells and are hypervigilant. I'm always ""okay"" and focus on making others happy, instead of getting what I really want. I just feel empty, numb and resentful.

**Edit:** Wow, I didn't expect this much feedback. Thanks a lot for all your replies, love and support!:) I've read all of it! I'll start by reading the Peter Walker book. 

The hardest part about this is that my mother, unlike some of yours', would do anything for me and has always been loving and supportive. She has done a lot of mistakes and has put me through a lot which I still suffer from, but at the same time her heart was always in the right place. I've tried to create some distance, like not answering the phone if she calls me to often and speak my mind and put her in place if needed. It would've been easier if she was a horrible women, because then I could've shut her out of my life. But I don't even want to, nor do I think she deserves it for what she's done. She's just... broken..   


What initially made me write this post (and several other) was that after going through a lot of year thinking I was okay, I realised I was not. And by trying to address what was wrong I opened up a can of worms and was hit by a ton of bricks. Here I am trying to make sense of it all.   


One thing I struggle with is relationships. Both romantically and with friends and family. I am currently in a relationship with my girlfriend of 7 years. With both my friends and my girlfriend I have the tendency to withdraw when someone likes me back. I've never been less attracted to my girlfriend than the moment she proposed to me, even thought I felt deeply in love with her the day before. It's like my life is a constant trying to get approval from people I care about, but once I get it it's like ""I wouldn't want to belong to a club that would have me as a member"". "
I almost ended my life tonight but I called a lifeline. I'm still here,823,mfj66v,70,"TW: self harm thoughts. I need emotional support.

It's been a hard night.. but im still here. I threw away all my razors in a dumpster while I was on the phone with the lifeline.. the urge was so strong to just slit my wrists and end everything.. a small part of me is urging me to die but I reallyyy dont want to die. I'm just hurting and in pain... help. honestly.

Edit: I'm dealing with after morning depression so theres so possible way I can respond to everyone, but I'm so surprised that so many people did reach out to me.. that's so nice of you!❤ I've been feeling so lonely on top of being suicidal. It's nice that people care... I didn't expect this reaction.. also, thank you to everyone for the awards and sending me hugs..

Edit: To everyone asking me what makes me want to stay alive when I talk to a lifeline, I'm going to copy and paste a response I replied to someone below.

""They ask me why I'm hurting. I explain and bawl my eyes out. They validate. They keep me safe by keeping me away from things that would hurt me. They just listen to me scream and cry. I've literally just cried on the other end while they listened. If I get someone that doesnt seem like they can help me, I say I'm fine and hang up. Then I call back and get a different person. It's worked for me.

I've also had them help ground me by talking about random things until I'm calmer. We talked about lion king one time and the symbolism behind the movie. It calmed me down enough to stop having as intense urges and bring me back to the present."""
The constant feeling that I am annoying people every time i talk or do something,820,g5dqma,52,"I ALWAYS feel like I am a weird/ annoying/loner/ freak. I feel like everyone knows I am a freak too. Like everyone can tell and see right through the fake image I put up. They all know that I’m a pathetic loner who tries to appear normal. They all see how fake and pathetic I am.


I try so hard. I always try to say the right things, I always try to be really friendly. I always try to be considerate and show people that I care. I try to be funny and positive. But somehow, I just know, they see right through me. My professors, my classmates, my team members, my insta followers, the people I consider my “friends.” I feel it in my bones, I know that I annoy them. I see it in their faces and responses. It feels so real. I see how they react to me, they all want to be as far away from me as possible.


They all see right through my fakeness. They know that I really have no friends or life and that I am actually really pathetic. My professors can see how lazy and dumb and fake I am. 
The person I consider my best friend prob doesn’t feel the same towards me, and I don’t blame them. Who would want to spend time with me. I would feel guilty if anyone called me their best friend since I don’t deserve that title."
DAE feel like they’re scared to do literally anything because they’ll inevitably end up messing it up?,819,f8sc5e,85,"So I’ve come to realize a certain thought pattern I’ve had for about ten years now more or less. My parents are both very narcissistic and I could never do anything right according to them growing up. Now, even if it’s the simplest thing, I feel like I’m going to inevitably mess it up and end up either embarrassing myself or my parents or like physically hurt someone/cause distress by accident. I know it has to do a lot with guilt tripping and over criticism, but damn I think this way a lot. Like for example, I used to work in a restaurant and I was TERRIFIED of doing something like spilling hot water or accidentally tripping someone that would result in an injury. It could be literally the smallest thing like walking down the street, and in the back of my mind I’m like “what if I accidentally start walking weird and trip someone and they fall off a bridge and they die and it’s my fault” lmao like that’s extreme and it’s not always that bad, but sometimes it is and it’s just exhausting to think that way all the time.

edit: holy shit thank you to everyone who commented/upvoted, i pretty much assumed i was like the only one who thought they were going to kill someone or blow up a country by existing"
YOU ARE ENOUGH!!!,819,ldegkr,65,Fuck anyone who has made you feel otherwise. You are enough. You are worthy of contentment and healing. You are valuable. Thanks for being you ❤️
emotional neglect f*ked me up more than all the other abuse combined,820,hmbznr,112,"as I continue in my recovery I’m able to figure out what causes my flashbacks or why I get triggered so easily. 

I’ve found my biggest trigger is feeling ignored, because as a child my father would give me the silent treatment for days. I’d be stuck trying to figure out what I did wrong, and ended up believing I’m such a worthless pos even my own father doesn’t want to acknowledge me and I’m better off just not existing. 

This seriously hinders my ability to form healthy & strong relationships because if I don’t talk to someone for 1 DAY I assume they want nothing to do with me and hate me all of a sudden, then that triggers the abandonment melange and I get suicidal because I feel I’m better off not existing. 

Idk man there’s just something so hurtful in emotional neglect and I feel it affected me way more than all the physical and emotional abuse"

"Is anyone else unable to cry when they’re sad/at present emotions, but bursts into tears at random situations?",820,imrqg2,72,"Don’t know what to flag this as, but every time I’ve drank/gotten high (which is not often) something somewhat traumatic would happen and I am now realizing that is why when I drink wine specifically or smoke weed my body remembers what I don’t and I have a bad or emotional trip. It’s good to process it so I let myself experience it again, so that’s what I’m trying to do. It’s hard, but I feel like it was important I realized it. Before realizing this I would get sad/angry/frustrated and feel so much pain without shedding a tear or only one while making crying faces for no reason(?). I would try to get it out some way; I can barely breathe sometimes and I feel like it’s because I keep so much to myself emotionally that I’ve forgotten how to identify my emotions. I don’t experience the relief of crying often so I feel like physically it’s causing symptoms of discomfort and anxiety. when I’ve hit my head, or cried to random situations, when someone gives me affection, when no one is looking at me and out of nowhere just cry, it’s just all part of how much I’ve pushed away those emotions in front of people, trying not to be vulnerable because each time it hurt me, and with drugs/alcohol making you even more vulnerable having people take advantage of me. It’s just made me a person I’m not, with a shield that I can’t consciously turn off. I just need therapy ahhh can’t wait to find the right therapist and possibly go back on my meds until I’m stable. That’s all sorry my head is all over and I might have not been coherent. Thank you for reading all the way if you did."
I just don’t understand how I’m supposed to live for 40 more years,818,i60xyt,193,"Edit: it’s fucked up that y’all made this my most upvoted post but also thank you for stopping by and donating all your kind words and advice! I read every comment. Good luck to us all. 

My nervous system is fuckeddd. Any stressor makes my brain short circuit. My ability to focus is gone. Because of the extreme anxiety my body and brain exhibit, no doctor will listen to me. I’m doing the psychiatric thing. I’m being the best patient. I take my meds every day as instructed. The meds don’t help with my body feeling like it’s on fire. The meds don’t bring back my regular emotions. The meds don’t bring back my cognition. They take out the floor I suppose so I’m not suicidal every day but I’m not me. I haven’t been me in 6 years. I’ve tried so many therapies. I’ve tried so many meds. I feel like I’m doomed. 

The physical symptoms really make it hard to reconcile. Visual snow, feeling like I’m going to explode even though I’m not thinking about anything. I can’t even express myself well.

And then the memory issues. Goddam the memory issues. I do the therapy and they ask me how I felt this week and I have no clue. It’s like I kinda have a vague idea but I have to reference my journal. Even then, it doesn’t really jog my memory. How can I get better if I can’t remember how I felt on a day to day basis? I feel like I’m being punished every day. Every day I’m in agonizing physical pain from the trauma. I don’t even need a trigger. It just happens. I know people got it bad but I sure feel like I really got it bad."

The worst part is: It so easily didn't have to be this way - but nothing was done to prevent it. Because no-one gave a damn about me. I just wasn't important enough to anyone. And now I have to drag myself through life while all of the above constantly bubbles to the surface."

One of the most disturbing and validating things just happened to me,816,l4lqt0,77,"I don’t have anyone to share this with besides my therapist so I’d thought I’d share it here in a safe community. 

My dad send me a huge file of family photos to go through last month and I was showing my friend some of our old camping photos etc.There were a couple of video files in there as well and I decided to watch them. My sisters and I were such cute little kids! 

I clicked on one of the last videos in the file and HOLY SHIT it was a video of me having a huge fit/anxiety attack at ~11 years old. I have no idea why my mom was filming it at the time, maybe to show a school counselor?

TW - I’m gonna describe the video here (there’s physical abuse in it)

In the video my dad is holding my ankle very tightly and won’t let me get off the bed. I can hear him say “you are not leaving until you calm down” I’m screaming and crying and flailing around trying to get out of his grasp. At one point I turn to my mom who is filming and desperately say “please mommy he won’t let go of my foot” which is met by complete silence behind the camera. Then I go on to scream “just do it just kill me already, get it over with” and keep struggling I start falling off the bed but my dad keeps holding my ankle and the video ends 

I’m shaking right now and crying. On one hand it is so disturbing seeing how my parents treated me. I was a cute little kid in emotional distress. On the other hand I have literal evidence that my abuse happened. That what I experienced as a kid wasn’t ok. This is raw evidence not obscured by any sort of memories. This feels like a very good thing. 

Man, I’m just feeling shaken right now and needed to write this out to someone. Hope all is well with you folks!"
My professor told me to go to therapy... as an insult,819,ii5c2e,102,"So, College classes began ONE week ago. We are set on a completely new format (which I payed a SHINY 600 EXTRA dollars for). I am taking 8 classes this semester, and one of them is an English course at the 2000 level. I wound up having internet issues (double hurricane and all that) and being so confused with the format I missed a quiz. It wasn’t worth much, but I didn’t realize how little it was worth (1/10th or 5% of my grade). 

However, I emailed my teacher explaining the issue. She told me that it wasn’t worth it to reopen, and that it wasn’t worth much so “move on”. I felt that was a flippant dismissal of the fact we had TWO hurricanes, a new format and an international pandemic going on to not reopen a stupid quiz on a play from 1670 she made us read in two days (along with 4 other 20 page readings). It was the first week. I spoke with other people in my class and they all said they were begging her to reopen it/dropping the course. 

I just felt so frustrated that I emailed the Dept. Chair. I explained how rude my prof had been and had inflexible during a fucking pandemic. 

I received an email from my professor with, I kid you not, “if you’re so upset by such a small grade I will reopen it” and “Im sorry you were offended”. 

But not ONLY did I get that email, she mass-emailed the entire class that if we had huge anxiety attacks over a small grade, we should go to therapy (and LINKED THE COUNSELING SERVICES). She said she was “close with the dept. chair” and the dept. chair had bigger issues to worry about. She said “If getting one snarky reply to your email truly traumatizes you...”

What in the absolute fuck? I’ve been up for hours crying. I feel like such a huge fucking baby.

EDIT: I spoke to other students. A black woman in the class felt incrediblyyyy uncomfortable around her. The phrases she used in video lectures (“ghettoized”) and other things made her want to report her. I encouraged her to do so. But I sent an email to her. I described who I was/how I felt. She emailed back that she never meant to use counseling as an insult, and that I could call her when I need to. However I feel like she’s really trying to gaslight me and I’m worried.

EDIT2: I finally got the balls to read the email. She apologized. She said that so many students weaponized their ""trauma"" from COVID to lie, cheat and plagarize assignments. I believe her. She really seemed genuine. She said that she really meant therapy could help, and that she was too curt with me. I emailed back that I hope to rebuild the trust between student and professor, and that I was happy to continue the class. I did something as an adult and resolved conflict!!"
Who wants to make jokes? You know you have CPTSD when....,815,cv7t9o,510,"....you feel guilty for having been abused, and also for not having been abused enough.
....you are triggered by minor things but actual disasters don't affect you.

I had majority of my traumas occur by the age of 15 and as a young girl I was quite mentally ill. I had no idea and I remember the realisation when I it occurred to me that I wasn’t like all of the other kids my age because I had to leave school early to see a psychologist and I was suicidal at age 7 before even having a real grasp on what life really was. As I got older I looked forward to becoming an adult as my peers’ mothers told me that it would get better and I took their word for it. My condition just worsened and I learnt to adapt in my toxic environment to become ‘high functioning’.

I used to get these really intense migraines when I was 13, so bad that I couldn’t see and I looked genuinely shocking. However, going to the doctors with my dad, he downplayed it by joking that it always happened on a day when I had sports. When I spoke up that I love sports and this is a serious debilitating medical issue I’m having, my dad exchanged a ‘look’ with the doctor and I was eventually sent away with nothing. 

My dad does not tolerate illness in any shape or form, especially mental illness and ESPECIALLY when it affects women. He’s the sort of person to go on angry rants about ‘attention seekers’ and the youth ‘being weak’. 

I grew up with my dad spewing his hateful shite about women not being as funny as men, jokes about the LGBTQ+ community, furious rants about liberals and foreign people, just so much hate and negativity.

Last month I told him about CPTSD (caused by my alcoholic mother, they divorced when I was 6) after I was literally sent home from my internship in France due to a mental breakdown. Apparently I’m just ‘overtired’ which is making me emotional. Like an infant. 

I’m so sick and tired of not being heard. I’m so angry I can hardly go to sleep without anger tears. But the worst bit is, I don’t even really know how I feel anymore because it’s been repressed for all of my life !!!"

The most succinct depiction of disorganized attachment ever.,818,9vgd5d,60,
I just survived a natural disaster and am baffled at people bouncing back and acting like it's nothing,817,lq843q,109,"TW: disaster trauma

So I live in Texas. Our power went out last Sunday night and didn't come back on until Friday afternoon. It also was below freezing every one of those nights and for most of the day during the day. It would snow and sleet and we had 8-10 inches of solid frozen snow/ice mix everywhere. 

I didn't know how long the power was going to be out. We had been told they were doing rolling blackouts and that outages would only be out in 10-40 minute spurts. After a few hours we still had hope, but after two nights absolutely freezing with not even a blip of power, I had lost all trust that anything was going to improve. 

I went into full survival mode. Maybe you know what that's like after having trauma. You shut down emotionally and just deal with the task at hand. I didn't care about anything except warmth, food, and water. 

But the entire time, I had to deal with my roommates who acted like every action I was taking was unnecessary. Even when I ended up making things a lot better for us by having extra blankets, food for everyone, and water for everyone. I prepared, I kept our food cold without power, and I made sure we were all going to make it. 

They just kept worrying about whether fast food places were going to reopen or when they could play their games or drink beer. And they weren't the only ones, it seemed like everyone was treating it like a temporary thing, like they hadn't lost complete trust in the system. 

Like they weren't used to being completely forgotten. They had no idea what to do when the worst happened and they needed to step it up to survive. 

And I realized how much crap in my past prepared me for this. All the crap of growing up poor, all the traumatic events that made me grow up too fast. 

Now that things have turned back around and the worst is over, my emergency switches have flipped off and now I've gone into processing. I couldn't do that before, I had to survive. 

And, I mean, holy fuck, we almost died. If we wouldn't have done what we did, if we would have stayed in our house that one more night without warmth, which happened to be the coldest night, we would have frozen to death. My cat's water dish was frozen solid, we could see our breath indoors, we had half a bag of firewood we would have needed to make last for 4 more days.

We only made it by moving to other places that had had power more recently so they were still warm, even though they lost power too.

By the end of it we were all visibly dehydrated from having to ration the drinking water, and totally exhausted. I wasn't able to bathe for a full week. We couldn't flush the toilets. We had to collect snow for water to flush or boil. We didn't have a warm meal for a full week.

That just gets me completely riled up inside. I can't be okay with it. I can't go ""oh well, glad we didn't die, glad the worst didn't happen, haha!"" Because that was too fucking close. 

We wouldn't put up with that with people. If someone beat you to a pulp but you didn't die, you wouldn't just forgive them and be like, ""oh well I didn't die, back to work!"" 

It seems like everyone is just going back to their lives. They have resilience. They aren't just standing there stunned. 

The shattered assumptions theory has three parts. Healthy people who haven't experienced trauma will believe:

- The world is benevolent
- The world is meaningful
- The self is worthy

With CPTSD style trauma, we might be shattered on 1 and 3, for example, after long term emotional abuse. And therapy can help us reconstruct these, but they're fragile. 

Am I, like, suffering from a re-shattering of my world views? 

How am I supposed to believe that the world is benevolent when this whole thing probably boils down to some assholes wanting to save money who were content with letting us freeze to death? 

How am I supposed to believe that I'm worthy when there was no support for us in the worst of it, when we were turned away from a grocery store because they wanted to close rather than let us get some firewood so we wouldn't freeze to death?

I can't just pick up and move on. 

And I can't stand what I'll call the victim blaming, the people acting like any one of us who just suffered through this is to blame for what happened. Like we should have had snow shovels and enough firewood for winter in Canada when we usually only see like one day a year below freezing here, let alone a week and a half. It's weird to get 1-2"" of snow a year here that doesn't even stick, let alone a buildup of 8-10 inches of ice and snow mixed together and frozen solid.

I can't stand trying to get support from family and friends and they tell me some story about how it snowed a lot one year, but they had power and water and food and the stores were open...

When I think about how fucking scared I was in the cold, walking through the ice and snow to some other new place with my bag of dirty blankets and boxes of food I didn't know how long I'd need to make last...I just can't fix it in my head. 

I realized some of my favorite songs have snow or ice in the music videos, and it just brings on this sense of dread now. Or I was watching a cute cartoon with a snow episode, and it didn't feel cheerful and cute like it should have, I just went numb and stared into space like I do with my other trauma. 

I didn't need this. 

I do have a therapist but she's local. A part of me feels guilty trying to get support from anyone who lived through this. I know she's probably well equipped to compartmentalize her own experience and still help me through. But.

I don't even want to order takeout because I want the people who work there to have less to do and more time to process this. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. 

It's just...I can't bounce back from this. I don't get how it seems like everyone else is.

Anyone else have the crippling fear that they aren't perceiving reality correct/accurately,814,ldmggi,87,"Like I worry that people don't perceive me the way I perceive myself (that they secretly hate me/find me cringy) or that my emotions aren't based on any kind of reality ( like I feel angry at someone but what if I'm just making it up) or that I want something but its just a fantasy and I don't know what it would ~really~ be like ( big choice like what to do with my career).

It all escalates in my mind to me feeling like I don't have any grasp on reality and the fear that I'm crazy and act crazy and people are just faking that everything's cool when they are around me

I think maybe its from being in a relationship with someone who was very gaslighty all the time and at the same time doing ALOT of drugs, especially a few acid trips that I had that were just horrible."
"Anyone else feel like theyre only loved when theyre ""useful"" or acting in servitude?",815,j8dd7a,49,"Growing up I was never praised or thanked just a case of I wasnt a terrible waste of space, POS who didnt deserve to exist when I was basically in servitude. I worked but i still cooked and cleaned. 

And if i didnt. Screaming, yelling, threats of violence, threats of suicide, threats of everything. I remember once, not sure how old i was she pretended to ring social services to come and take me away... this was after my mum and younger brother moved to the other side of the world and my grandmother died... so I now come with seperation anxiety built in. 

Now, i get that my partner works and would like me to do more chores around the house but I just dont have the spoons. I try to set up systems to make it easier for me but he just doesnt co-operate.

I keep my stuff tidy and his slowly takes over. Then he gets mad that there is stuff all over the place. I gave him my old phone, hes lost it just -somewhere- in the house. Hes not even bothering to look for it now. 

And tonight, after i have been up since 5:30 on 4 hours sleep. I go to sleep and not two/three hours later hes decided hes cleaning... so now im awake again. Because ""someone has to clean up"" and suddenly im back there. 

Im back at that house. 
Im back with my worth defined by how much I can do for others.


Edit: for clairification its really really uncommon for him to act this way. While yeah its shitty he just lacks communication skills. Its purely just him venting frustration and not knowing what to do with that rather than it actually being aimed AT me. But due to my previous situation I immediately take it to heart, but thats my problem, not his because he has told me several times that its not aimed at me. If anything its somewhat helped the PTSD is a way. Like exposure therapy, same situation but no actual threat. And its maybe 10 minutes of him being annoyed at himself rather than 3 days of someone being annoyed at me for shit out of my control.

Im not excusing his shitty behaviour. I recognise it as shitty but im not goong to tell him his feelings arent valid. I dont want him to walk around on eggshells around me. He feels like crap when he upsets me because he truly doesnt mean to."
It's wild to think people really love their family,817,ilvog3,116,"That probably sounds pretty silly, but sometimes I have epiphanies when seeing my friends and their family or just characters in media. I'm rewatching a show and the girl in her late teens is still having a hard time processing her dad's death a year later. The thought of my family members passing is more of a neutral thing to me. Also people really just love spending time with their families. I can't imagine choosing to do that for fun. I really do forget often that families don't have to be a burden.

When I have these realizations it makes me sad that my brain has been warped this much from how I grew up. Kind of feels like I was ruined"
I’m starting to realize that I shouldn’t feel guilty for not wanting to spend time with my parents as an adult after having such a traumatic childhood.,812,hjopso,40,"My (24F) parents have been married for 24 years, and they never should’ve gotten married in the first place. 

There’s a 19-year age gap between them (my dad is older) and they have never had a healthy marriage. They constantly fought in front of me as a child—yelling, swearing, name-calling. My mom tried to physically abuse my dad numerous times and I had to step in front of him to get her to stop. All I ever did was ask them to stop fighting in front of me and they never did. My mom was definitely the instigator (she has undiagnosed/untreated Narcissistic Personality Disorder) and my dad always tried to walk away from their arguments, but the fighting continued. As a kid, I spent so much time shut away in my bedroom trying to ignore their screaming.

My parents are still married and they may not fight quite as much now but there’s always tension between them, and between my mom’s alcoholism and NPD, their fights are bad when they do occur. 

I don’t spend much time with both of my parents together because of the tension and anxiety I feel around them. My mom always invites me and my fiancé to come over and have dinner with them, or stay at their beach house with them, but I usually decline her offers. 

I’ve been feeling guilty about this recently, but I was thinking about it today and I realized something: I should absolutely NOT feel guilty for not wanting to spend time with them after all of the trauma they caused. I’m dealing with an anxiety disorder and undiagnosed CPTSD as an adult because of them and their behaviors. I don’t want to spend time with them because of THEM, not because of me. I’m not being selfish."
"My sweet girl died last night, six days after I got her. She had parvo. I tried to treat her at home (with a vet's instructions) using IVs, force feeding and antibiotics.

Just a short 5 minute call to a stranger. I didn't panic, didn't fret over it for days, didn't rehearse what I was going to say over and over again ad nauseum.

I felt calm (enough) and present.

No hour long adrenaline rush afterwards, no emotional flashback, no dissociation. I can barely remember a single day in my life I have ever felt this way before, during or after a phone call before.

On Neglect: Children don't just need bad things NOT to happen; they need good things TO happen...,815,bly64n,120,"Many of us struggle with the thought that many people had it much worse, and that what we went through doesn't qualify as traumatic in comparison. This is especially the case for people whose childhood was characterized primarily by emotional neglect, as opposed to overt abuse, whether physical or emotional abuse. I had both physical and emotional abuse in my childhood, but I'm now realizing that the thing that has been most devastating to me in my adult life was the emotional neglect. 

To develop as a healthy human being, a child doesn't just need abuse *not* to happen. They need many good things *to* happen. Things that are necessary conditions for a child's growth and development include:

* Having their emotions paid attention to, treated as valid, and helped with. Your emotions are part of you. When your emotions aren't validated or paid attention to, you don't get a vital part of your humanity validated and just made ""real."" The result of this is that, up until the age of 30, when I started learning about CPTSD, I didn't feel like a real human being: I didn't feel like I was as *real* as other people. I felt empty, hollow, and like my existence wasn't as valid as everyone else's, all because my parents never acknowledged that I had emotions. 
* Being given the space and opportunity to talk about your emotional experiences: this includes the opportunity to share positive and negative experiences. With this, a child learns to embrace the whole of life, and to develop a healthy relationship with their own emotional life. No feeling becomes scary if you know there is space for it. Children grow emotionally literate and able to communicate their needs and concerns with friends, partners, coworkers, etc. in adult life as a result of being practice in the family of origin. 
* Having their emotional needs paid attention to and taken seriously, including the need for friendship/companionship, fun/play, grief when appropriate, individuation/expansion/exploration, etc. One of the oversights of my parents was that they were fixated on my academic achievement, and completely neglected my need for a healthy social life. It didn't seem to bother them that I was 12 and didn't have any friends and spent all of my time alone in my room, and they dismissed me when I told them I was being bullied in 7th grade. This is negligence. In order to develop healthy social skills, a child needs to have their social development taken seriously and prioritized, just as much as their material needs for food, shelter, exercise, and their academic success. 

Add to this, the fact that being left emotionally alone is an existentially threatening situation for a child: it is abandonment. To a child's brain, abandonment means death. Being exposed to a life-threatening situation like abandonment is traumatic.

Emotional neglect is ""silent but deadly."" For the longest time, I didn't even realize this was a thing I went through because it was like water to the fish: it was just my normal. Because it's the absence of things that should have happened, rather than things you can point to that happened, it's hard for a child to know and recognize that something is wrong. I only realized it after [reading this article](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/10/its-not-always-depression/) where a therapist calls childhood emotional neglect ""a form of trauma"", and admitting to myself how debilitated I am in comparison with other adults my age. It really hit home once I started seeing how loving parents treated their children and realizing I never got any of the love, understanding, and respect that those children were getting.  

The aloneness I existed in, the sense of abandonment, the loneliness and unfulfilled longing for *someone* to understand my sadness and fear and shame, etc. were just normal to me. And, what's worse, I blamed myself for them: I thought my aloneness was my fault -- that it was because there was ""something wrong with me"" or something unseemly/wrong/foolish about my emotions, that I *deserved* the aloneness I existed in. 

My parents weren't evil, but they were deeply misguided in how they raised me and my brother. This has always been hard for me to grapple with because I could never lean on the conviction that my parents were just plain bad people or even narcissists (although, sometimes I do suspect they have narcissistic tendencies.) I've just had to resolve myself to the fact that good people can make for bad parents sometimes. And, while physical and emotional abuse is devastating, emotional neglect can be just as devastating because it leaves you with deficits/gaps in development, where there should be growth and adulthood."
"DAE think it should be called like ""forced helplessness"" or ""trained helplessness"" instead of ""learned""?",813,k2cmgs,88,"Like goddamn, keep my name out of your mouth. Like aren't we missing a key player in this dynamic (i.e., the people/institutions/systems that did this to us).

The fact that my umbrage with the term itself could be considered a product of ""learned"" helplessness or a ""victim mentality"" does not elude me. 

I feel like being more careful with terms like this would HELP people with ""victim mentalities"" see that there is some space and they are not being blamed for problems they (we) did not create but must (MUST!!) take responsibility for if healing is to happen. 

IDK it makes me mad."
"DAE use to masturbate in order to self-soothe as a child in response to ongoing, inescapable trauma?",809,iqutbb,144,"I wonder if I was the only one that did this. 

Remembering this really makes me feel ashamed of myself, even though now I kinda understand that I was just trying to give myself relief from the pain and conflict that were going on both outside and inside of me and that I had no way of escaping. I was just a small child (3-4yo when it happened for the first time, I think), so there was nothing sexual about it for me. 

There were many times when my family walked in on me randomly and, of course, made me feel like what I was doing was super shameful, dirty, and sick. I think that was the part that scarred me the most; people not wanting to understand why I was doing it or what I was feeling, but shaming me (almost always in front of others in the house) instead.

You know, I could never actually physically escape what was happening around me. The drama, the violence, the danger, knowing that my mom could get killed any minute by her husband, knowing that I was not safe anywhere in the world. Not knowing where I was gonna sleep from one day to the next at times, whether everyone I'd meet would want to kill or abuse me, feeling responsible for the feelings of ADULTS from the moment I could sense reality. I had no way of running away, no way of taking care of myself, protecting myself, I could not even tell people about the abuse since I was not allowed talk, ever. I was completely alone, you know? I had nobody, literally no one to talk to or to trust. Do you know how much my heart aches for my child self? I WAS JUST A FUCKING CHILD.....

Now... I am going to do my best to give this part of me the compassion, understanding, and love that were meant to be there from the very beginning of my life. All in all, I think I did the best with what I knew at the time and I am going to do all I can now to not feel shame about the ways I coped with the horrific events and feelings that everyone failed to protect me from. 

Anyway, I am just wondering if there are any people here that used to (or still do) the same thing. 

Love to you all."
It's hard not to be bitter or angry about all the time I missed to be myself.,812,fgdfxk,55,"I'm unfreezing after 11 years and finally beginning to remember what it feels like to feel like myself, something I didn't even realise i'd forgotten, and it's such a quietly nice feeling that I can't help but get angry about all the time I spent lost and spinning in the void.

I know I'm allowed to be angry, I just don't want to be. I want to embrace today and finally get on with living my life, to enjoy how this feels rather than lament all the times I didn't feel this way.

It's almost like im in mourning for the person I was, the person I had to be to survive, and im angry that person ever had to exist.

Anyone else just feel a bit betrayed by life itself?"
"Today, I am three months sober, considering 2020 has been one long string of triggers, I’m pretty proud of myself.",811,k9nw4h,36,"A stumbled a few times but all together, I e spent eight months without a drop of alcohol this year. I’m exercising, eating right, meditating, therapy, connecting with social circle, and investing in my hobbies and passions.

I have really underestimated the power of yoga,814,jzpr58,103,"After finishing The Body Keeps the Score I decided to finally give yoga a try. I do one Yoga with Adriene video every night, or every other night. Holy cow, guys. What a difference it has made! I’ve only been doing it regularly for about two weeks now but the chronic tension in my neck and shoulders is so much lighter, my posture is improving, and I feel generally happier and more capable. I am not an active or flexible person so yoga has never appealed to me until now, but forcing myself to do it has been so helpful for my mind and body! I highly recommend it to anyone working through trauma. I feel like we hear “just do yoga!” so often that it sounds stupid and like it won’t really help, but just give it a try. Most days I roll out my mat with a big scowl on my face and can only think about how stupid I feel for the first few minutes and by the time practice is over I feel so much lighter. Yoga with Adriane’s videos are especially helpful for me because she is sooooo kind and encouraging and gives really clear instructions so you don’t get frustrated. Anyways I just wanted to share!"
Experiencing childhood trauma makes body and brain age faster: Findings could help explain why children who suffer trauma often face poor health later in life,804,i2yr9w,99,
To my childhood therapist who invalidated all of my trauma and said I was lying,809,g4shtt,93,"Trigger warning: mentions of sexual assualt, abuse, and suicide

I HATE YOU. I started being forced to see you as mandated by the courts after I went to my final facility. I was 16. I was so excited to finally speak to someone and open up. The first day we met you opened my file and judged me based off of everything you read. I remember being so scared to open up but wanting to so badly. I remember starting off with ""I think being in facilities most of my teen years has traumatized me to a degree"" AND YOU LAUGHED. You laughed in my face and said that wasnt a reason to be traumatized. You immediately shut me up every time i brought it up and i still struggle with validating these feelings. I remember getting flashbacks to sexual abuse as a little girl and crying to you about them hysterically and saying ""I am having a hard time believing this given your family history"". I remember the day after one of the boys in our facility r\*ped me on a trip you told me I was LYING and being DRAMATIC. Everytime I would bring up trauma from severe bullying you would laugh and say we were all teased, NO YOU IDIOT WE ARENT ALL TOLD TO KILL OURSELVES EVERYDAY AND BEATEN UP WEEKLY. I had to be removed from my middle school twice because the bullying got so bad the superintendent said it wasnt safe for me to keep going. All the times I brought up my parents toxic and abusive behaviors you said I should be more grateful. Yes, I should be more grateful, maybe then CPS wouldnt remove me from my house and force me into various facilities. Finally, the day I told you about the suicide of my best friend you said ""you never mentioned him before which leads me to believe you werent that close, maybe its time to move on and see what the real problem at hand is"". The day i met with a psychiatrist you were present, I stayed silent as you told him that you believe I am bipolar due to my impulsive behaviors and delusions. I was diagnosed with bipolar with psychotic features that day. I didnt even speak. It took me so long to be able to open up again and when I finally did I was diagnosed with CPTSD and told I wasnt bipolar at all. I still struggle immensely with validating my trauma, and have a deep fear that everything I am feeling is truly delusional. I HATE YOU LAURA."
I wonder when (if ever) there'll be such thing as hashtagMeToo for child abuse. Apparently it's still an even greater taboo than the sexual abuse of adults.,810,dr2e8m,133,"I wonder if I'll ever be able to speak freely about emotional neglect, verbal abuse and physical abuse in the form of ""harmless"" spanking without being gaslighted, laughed off and misunderstood by 99% of the society."
We all need love,810,ab2l0g,37,
"Did anyone else imagine whole lives while living in the abuse, and now that you're out you don't know how to actually live?",808,dm3903,123,"It's like I was living in a dream the whole time, imagining entire lives, and then suddenly I woke up and realized I hadn't actually lived any of it, and now I don't know what to do or how to live, because I already lived all my lives through my thoughts.

When I was in the abuse, I couldn't imagine a world outside of it. And now I find myself thrown into that outer world and don't know what to do. 

I imagine those movies about dystopian societies living an oppressed life inside a walled and heavily controlled city, and no one ever questions it or tries to go outside because they're all told that it's dangerous out there. And then one day someone goes outside and realizes they've been lied to and there's a whole world out there they never knew about. And then they struggle with this idea of ""The whole world/universe/reality that I knew was actually not the ""real"" world."" And it feels like reality is turned upside down.

And everyone you knew back in the walled city won't join you outside. They'd all rather live inside, and so ""escaping"" the walled city also feels like you have to leave behind not only your original beliefs about reality but also all the people you knew. So you keep venturing on forward outside the city, but can't stop looking back every so often at the people still choosing to live inside of it out of fear of leaving."
DAE feel alienated from the general population?,807,m8diod,130,"That feel when most people don’t relate to you. Most people can’t understand the pain you’re in. Your daily struggles. Your heavy burdens. Your lack is safe and sound childhood. The mountains you carry.

You feel like an alien."

DAE feel like an alien when watching affection between parents and their children?,808,mbamj8,69,"Whenever I see it I find myself first of all thinking how wonderful it looks, but then I find myself studying the behaviour as if I'm watching strange beings from another planet interact and trying to figure out how they do it. I just watched that video of clips of basketballers playing with and being all affectionate with their kids and found I was studying it intently.

I never experienced affection as a child so I can't figure out what it would feel like to give or receive it (in a parent/child) sense. I wonder a little if this part of me is now broken or if it's there but I just don't know how to use it because it's never been accessed before."
Deleted all my social media because it made me sad and frustrated that no one cared. Then got more sad and frustrated because no one cared lol,804,klu9lt,68,"I don’t think anyone even noticed. I find this both amusing and depressing at the same time. It’s been months and it’s just... yeah. I guess I could literally disappear and it wouldn’t make a difference in other people’s lives. 

I feel better not being so active on social media, so at least that’s something. Seems like the fake promise of connection apps like Instagram give really can make you feel more isolated.

It’s strange. I feel like I notice so much about other people and I’d for sure notice if someone suddenly disappeared. But nope. These same people (people I know and used to know) were watching every single story etc I ever posted, but never commented or messaged to me first. If I don’t make the effort to communicate first, there is no communication. If I post the same thing to the people I actually know vs. anonymously to strangers, the strangers online are 99% more likely to talk/react to me than the people I know in real life.  

This rant isn’t really about social media and likes and comments. All that just highlights the separation and “otherness” I feel. I’m trying to understand what I’m doing wrong. Why people don’t stick around and why I’m so easily left behind. 

If I don’t try to reach out, I’m alone. If I try, it’s often one sided and quickly feels forced as I’m left being the one keeping up the conversation. I don’t want to be annoying and push myself on people who don’t want to have me in their lives. But I’m tired of feeling so dismissed and wrong. I must be doing something wrong; being wrong in some way. I must be missing something that comes naturally to other people.

Others seem to like me just fine when I first meet them, we have a good time and everyone seems happy to interact. But when it comes to actually making friends, it goes nowhere. 

What is it that makes someone so uninteresting and insignificant that when they disappear, they just disappear? What is it that makes someone nice to chat with, but not nice enough to make actual friendships with? Not nice enough to care?

I _must_ be doing something wrong. It’s been like this my whole life and at this point I can’t pretend it’s not something to do with me. It has to be me. Do I subconsciously give bad vibes? Does something about me make people think “I can get something from this person but once I have it, I won’t bother anymore”? Do I make people uncomfortable somehow (Fuck if that thought doesn’t make me feel horrible... I just want to be nice and good to others)?

I don’t think I’m that dislikable. I’ve worked for years on liking myself and I’m pretty happy with myself now. I’ve always been good with people in work/school settings and I’ve been told as much. Interestingly, older people seem to like me more than people my own age. But either way, making connections never go further than having a good time with surface level acquaintances. Good with people but not good enough for people?

I just want to know what it is that makes people not want to stay. There must be something I can do or change. 

No one ends up as isolated and confused as me if they aren’t doing something that doesn’t fit the norm."
Am I the only one who LOVES the lockdown? Let me explain....,806,lpcwaa,125,"I love not communting to work; I love not HAVING to see people to show them that I am interested in keeping a relationship... didn’t realize I was doing this until the lockdown. I love not having to be “doing” all the time in order to feel like I am doing something worthwhile with my life. I love “being” and existing just as I am because,” well, we can’t do shit because of COVID.” This reason has helped me literally catch a breath... I know and fully understand that this not a luxury that has been afforded to many and for this I am grateful. Literally, observe I have been to become fully aware of what has happened to me and the reasons for my poor behavior. I have learned why I have insomnia and that it won’t go away, for good, because part of a traumatized psyche is having insomnia. I lean into it more nowadays than fight it. I understand the origin of my many mysterious medical conditions. I am finally learning some of my triggers; and the best part is that I am actually feeling some sort of compassion for myself and BS I grew up with.... that little lost girl has FINALLY gotten my attention...I am barely learning how to take care of her, but now I know that she is here to stay. I see now how poorly I was treated by people and the DESPERATE efforts I made my whole life hoping to get a morsel of love that I desperately wanted... I wanted love so badly that I did EVERYTHING I thought people would want from me so that I can “earn” love.... NEVER got it the way I thought it would be... because I had to stop and exist within my own shit, I FINALLY SAW MY OWN BEHAVIOR.... I don’t like it, my past choices, and the good news is I can make better choices.... slowly, as I get better, little by little, I will get better....

DAE get told they have so much potential?,807,lbl5ow,163,"At key points in my life I've been told by professors or teachers or friends, that I have so much potential and that I could be the greatest if only I could (dot dot dot) or tell me I am such an inspiration.  Meanwhile I am having really bad days, barely hanging on to sanity and breaking apart constantly. It is so distorting to have an image of yourself, that is just a child pretending to be an adult and people around see you as some wonder human, because your perfectionism and self hatred makes it seem like you have your life together.

DAE feel like they were forced to give up their freedom of choice to achieve safety?,808,kz60qh,75,"I spent my entire childhood trying to figure out how to get out of my parents house as quickly as I could, and stay out. I started a job at 15 and literally never quit, I still work for the same company today (better position, thankfully). I bought a car as soon as possible, didn't matter the car just mattered the price. I bought an apartment as soon as possible, didn't matter the quality or location, just that they were willing to let kids with no credit rent. My first relationship was so toxic, I was sexually and emotionally abused for years but I held on because he said he loved me, and showed me ways he did (toxic ways), but I was so desperate to feel wanted by someone. My parents never gave me love so I accepted what I thought was love, and I clung to it. 

I went to school for the quickest, cheapest degree I could find that allowed me to take classes online so I could work full time to support myself while attending. I cut off all my dreams and wants and became this shell of a person, just trying to catapult myself as far away from ""the bad"" as I could. 

Only thing is, now I have it. I have a home and job and a partner who I love and would never hurt me, two beautiful dogs. I can feel safe, and instead I feel empty. I look at people my age going to parties and moving away for school and suddenly I feel that I have already missed out on so many opportunities because I was just trying to keep myself safe. I have so many social issues, too. Like even if I wanted to go out and experience life a little more now, I feel trapped in a box by my fear. I feel that every older man is out to get me, I can't wear clothes that show my skin or prying eyes will find their way to it.  They might judge me, or God forbid something I say upsets a stranger and they might hate me or try to fight me. They're unpredictable. So I fear them, I fear everyone. 

When you grow up witnessing so many awful, traumatic things, being hurt over and over again, I feel like it trains your brain to look at the world like a video game level. How do I survive? The question is never, how do I thrive? Or what do I *want* to do?"
CBT is fucking stupid and is in no way helpful for what I struggle with.,804,l6jwm6,348,"I want to scream this in the face of every therapist I see, but as soon as I'm in therapy, I become incredibly passive and just nod saying ""yep"" as I'm being taught for the millionth time that all of my feelings are my own fucking fault.  I'm so tempted to just ghost this therapist I'm currently seeing. I thought she was going to be a good fit, but I left my second session feeling worse honestly.  I'm honestly feeling really fucking hopeless. It feels like there isn't a single therapist in the world that can help me.  fuck this. i feel so trapped and helpless whenever therapy sessions turn out this way, and it's not like I can say no this isn't helpful because it's proven to work for anxiety and depression right?

Edit: I can't believe how many people also feel this way, wow.  I'm always floored by how supportive and validating this sub is.  I wish I could read and respond to every comment right now, but I'm a little overwhelmed at the moment lol.

I don’t have anything to say, I don’t really think anything of substance, I can’t tell if I’m tired, I can’t tell if I want to nap, or watch TV, or play guitar, I don’t know if I’m hungry. I want to just sit there, but I know I’ll panic or obsess over thoughts or things. I just pace around the house, or at work, completely uninvolved in life. Not wanting anything or needing anything. Just, defeated.

It’s almost like dissociation but I’m more physically present and less emotionally present when I “shut off” vs when I’m dissociated.

Is there a name for this? Does anyone else go through something similar? I’d like any advice or similar experiences."
DAE find today's dating culture to be extremely triggering and toxic?,801,i7re6u,157,"I need to establish some level of trust with partners, especially around sex. I don't get why people lie about what they're looking for and disrespect people's time and boundaries. Guys especially are so reckless about setting expectations they're never going to meet or even straight-up lying. I really don't get it because I'm very communicative and have several conversations about not minding to keep things casual and just being honest. Like- I have polyamorous friends, I am not conservative, and so I just don't get why people can't be honest. Hearing someone is not interested anymore, needs a break, etc is really not a big deal. I think what's hurtful is the amount of ghosting and immature competitive behavior which is really wearing on me.

I've had guys do nasty things like sleep with my roommates, classmates, and friends, ghost me and post on their insta after sex, and a whole bunch of toxic behavior that is just unnecessary, especially at 30. I know it's just them being insecure, but dang. I am only human so it will hurt regardless of how much I am sure of my own worth. It makes me feel used and disposable as a human, which is making my trauma recovery quite difficult. Mostly, though, it's really about trust, and how my boundaries are continuously disrespected. I wish it were a one-off, but the amount of people has gotten to me and I don't want to be jaded. Also, the amount of time and energy I spend screening and filtering jerks out only to be disappointed once again is emotionally exhausting.

Currently taking a break from dating.

I just wish our society was able to simply be more empathetic and respectful of people's requests. Like, if people say they need communication, and make a point of making that clear, they have real reasons for that. Why is it so hard to give them that?

EDIT: Wow, thanks so much everyone for your support and advice. I love this community so much and you guys make me feel safe and supported. As I commented, I have always cut off people who hurt me, so no worries, was just getting jaded from the amount of people who still do messed up stuff. I can't control them, tho- I'll continue therapy to improve my filter, and continue taking a break from dating, and will now have a new standard for future partners: they need to have gone through therapy.

"Why does your family always act shocked when they find out that their emotional neglect, bullying, and instability has caused you to develop CPTSD?",801,fawi2r,152,
I setup a tent indoors last night and had a magical childhood adventure.,793,mhcqfd,72,"This whole month I've been feeding my inner child. I have been fingerpainting, drinking from silly straws, eating tacos in bed and more.

Last night I fulfilled a childhood fantasy I always had, which was to setup a tent in my house and pretend I was camping in some exotic location.

The tent barely fit in my room, but it worked! I setup the sleeping bag, air mattress and sheet. Outside I setup a speaker on a timer to play ""Forest music at night"" for 2 hours. 

I got inside the tent, the sounds started playing and instantly I was transported!! I could almost smell the forest and feel the space around me. It felt nice to be somewhere else, and the nature sounds were relaxing. I felt so free and light and young,  I was so at peace and calm :)

It's interesting because I then had a vivid nightmare about being attacked by Nazis and then killing them....a bit intense after the calmness of the tent. 

I feel this nightmare was me fighting off and killing another toxic part of my past. Each childhood thing I have done has released a part of something and I feel lighter. Not sure what comes next but I'm excited to keep releasing more and more.

Thanks for reading and being here. It's very embarassing and shameful for me to have to hide these things from co-workers and some people. Can't wait until I don't have to hide anymore."
"Just because I don’t have a family to miss me, doesn’t mean I should have to work every holiday and can cover everyone else.",794,hohgnx,102,"I don’t know where to go with this. I’m so lost. I started crying at work when it finally hit me that I’m still being punished for my childhood. 

I work in a small business, and we have less than 10 employees.  However, since we’re a small business, this is doable and normally not an issue. 

Lately however, I’ve noticed how I am defaulted to work on every single holiday that would normally be an excuse for a family gathering. Christmas? I was there. Thanksgiving? Yep. Fathers and Mother’s Day? What else do I have going on. 

I haven’t had a Friday or Saturday off even once since (I found out today) March 13. And before that, it was in October. Yet all of my coworkers get at least one weekend off a month. 

I try to say I want a weekend off once a month and I am always chosen last. If someone has a family event or a birthday party or something, they just make me work to accommodate for the person with a family. Even if I originally wasn’t supposed to work. Their families always come first. 

I get it, I do. Family is important and all that bullshit. I also get it, I don’t have one. No one cares if I don’t show up to holidays. No one misses me when I don’t send Mother’s Day cards, or acknowledge Father’s Day. No one calls to wish me a happy birthday, or a merry Christmas. 

But I’m so sick and tired of being reminded that I don’t have a family. I can’t handle it anymore. Just because no one misses me when I’m not there, doesn’t mean they can take advantage of me. 

I married a few years ago, and my husbands family has been amazing to me, but they aren’t my family. I know they would be sad to hear me say that, but all I really want is a family of my own. Not one that would vanish if my husband and I broke up. I just want a mom, a dad, maybe a brother. People who are proud of me. People who look forward to seeing me. People who tell me I’m beautiful and truly mean it, because they love me. Truly truly love me. People who actually call me when there’s family photos, and include me. (My bio mom did this to me recently). 

As if it wasn’t bad enough to spend 9 years of my childhood abused and beaten and starved, now my workplace is constantly reminding me that I have no family. I cut them out for my own sanity. And now I’ve become the go-to. Who cares if Alex works a holiday? Every weekend? Who misses her? Not like her mom wants to see her. Not like her siblings are around. 

I just hate it so much and I hate crying about it. I don’t know what to do. 

I’m moving states soon, to put more distance between myself and my bio family, so quitting my job is useless at this point. I only have a couple months left in Wisconsin and then we move to Colorado."
"DAE really appreciate days where you can ""do nothing"" because ""doing nothing"" is a hell of a step up from ""living in fear""?",791,crqvzr,68,"I'm having one of those days where I am probably going to spend the whole day lying on my couch looking out the window at the view and listening to the sounds of nature. 

I just ordered delivery and I'm not going to watch Netflix or read or anything, I literally just want to **be**.

Sometimes people ask me, ""Don't you get lonely?"" and I tell them ""No, because being alone is a lot better than being around people who constantly make you feel like shit."" 

Sometimes people ask me, ""Don't you get bored?"" and I tell them ""No, because being able to just *be me* is a lot better than being constantly pressured to do more, be more, and try harder.""

Doing ""nothing"" *is* doing something. It's *being* without feeling afraid, anxious, shameful, guilty, conflicted, or self-hating.

It's being able to freely feel what you want to feel, like a peaceful quiet contentment. It's not having to constantly run for your life, emotionally or mentally.

These days are peace when you've been through hell."
"People aren’t attracted to pure confidence, they’re attracted to well-managed insecurities.",794,ciy6va,62,"I often worry about not being able to tell the difference between confidence and arrogance. 

I realized today that “pure confidence” is hot for about 5 seconds and then is transparent in its falseness. 

Real confidence is not confidence at all, it’s just well-managed insecurities. It’s not invincibility, it’s open awareness of flaws and the courage not to be scared of or limited by them. 

And guess what? That’s what we’re all here working on! 

We’re gonna be so hot when we graduate from this sub, you guys. Let’s promise to stay friends after the summer is over.

The distorted perspective that abusive parents have towards their children's problems,794,hrs89z,108,"I found a remarkable quote on [this page](http://www.issendai.com/psychology/estrangement/lack-of-categorization.html), which itself quotes from a book called *The Narcissistic Family*.

>The author, Stephanie Donaldson-Pressman, uses ""narcissistic"" to refer not to narcissistic personality disorder, but to a family in which ""the needs of the parent system [take] precedence over the needs of the children."" The children's needs aren't only secondary to the parents, ""but are often seriously *problematic* for the latter.""

>In the narcissistic family, the child's behavior is evaluated not in terms of what it says about what he or she may be feeling or experiencing, but in terms of its impact on the parent system. For example, in a healthy family, a child's receiving an 'F' on a report card alerts the parents to the presence of a problem. this situation is then examined in terms of the child's needs and development: is the work too hard, is the child under stress, does he need help, tutoring, support, or the like? **In the narcissistic family, though, the same problem is evaluated on the basis of difficulty presented for the parent**: is the child disobedient, lazy, embarrassing, or just looking for excessive attention?

>In this example, the healthy family would react by expressing concern for the feelings of the child and presenting his 'F' not as a personal failure, but as a problem to be solved. In the narcissistic family, however, the reactions of the parent(s) indicate to the child that his feelings are of limited or no import. **The child does not *have* a problem, he *is* a problem.**[Emphasis added.]

(I would add that one way to resolve the report card problem is to recognize that conventional school is ridiculous in the first place and we ought to attend [Sudbury Schools](https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10155951019968804) or something similar)

I feel like this points to a foundational idea which supports all kinds of abuse. You could phrase it as ""The kids' needs don't matter"""
Anyone else feel their cPTSD recovery is like a full time job?,790,hlsu1s,75,"
Anyone else feel their cPTSD recovery is like a full time job?

Healing from PTSD has been the hardest but most important job I've ever had! I am so glad my real job is so low key that I am able to have more time to take care of myself.

There is a lot of crucial energy and time spent trying to heal from trauma such as processing the emotions from trauma during hard dreams/ triggers/flashbacks, educating myself about the abuse, the self care, mental health care, leaving toxic relationships, isolating, learning and setting boundaries, self parenting, etc ..

This hard work is paying off and I am so proud of myself and glad I love and care about myself enough to do it. I will never give up on myself, I am my number one advocate and supporter. Who else feels like recovery is like a full time job? Who else is proud of their inner strength to do this warrior work?"
"I just fell and broke things by accident, and for the first time in my life I was not yelled at, laughed at, or scrutinized during my panic attack",791,gnv0ug,46,"My husband and I live in a really cramped space, and I was climbing down a ladder while holding too many things, and wasn’t paying attention when I missed the last rung and fell, bouncing off of the nearby litter box and went tumbling to the ground. I wailed like a baby and then absolutely crumbled. I was having a huge rush of flashbacks (being called fat, lazy, careless, dramatic, etc) and emotions of guilt, humiliation, anger, frustration.

My husband rushed over and instead of yelling at me for the things I broke around me, he pulled me into his arms and just kept telling me it was okay and asking if I was hurt. I managed to say no and kept calling myself fat and that it wouldn’t had happened if I wasn’t so stupid and huge. Flashbacks kept rendering me hysterical for a few minutes so he just held me and repeated over and over that he does that all the time and it’s no big deal, he loves me, I’m beautiful and not fat, etc. He held me close and spoke gently. Then he quietly sang to me until he calmed me down. 

It’s so silly, but I have never felt so loved in my life. It’s difficult to believe someone truly loves me, but I really felt it right then. To some his actions may seem pretty normal, but to me it really threw me off and I kept trying to reject it, as if doing that would make him see me how others did, and then he would start abusing me as well. I don’t know if any of this makes sense and I (for once) don’t even care if anyone reads it. I just know how happy I am to be in a relationship that is absolutely nothing like my previous one or my childhood. I have an incredible, compassionate, sweetheart of a husband and I can’t believe I am so lucky to have him as my forever person."
I bit the bullet and told my professor that I'm in an abusive home and need help. It worked out better than I ever could have imagined.,792,g54h77,76,"I emailed my professor asking him for an extension. I told him that due to quarantine I am back in an abusive environment. This is what he emailed back:  


​Hi \[AbsurdPigment\]: Thanks for reaching out, and I am sorry you have to deal home issues. Is there more I can potentially do or help with? Perhaps make a call on your behalf? (Be mindful that I am a mandated reporter.)   


You can certainly have an extension on this and future assignments if you need it. Just keep me posted as much as possible (not in terms of disclosing information, if you do not feel comfortable; more about when you may need an extension). We can work together to make sure you can successfully finish the course. Email me things if Canvas closes submission portals.   


Is there more I can do in terms of course adjustments that would be helpful and/or make this class less stressful?   


Thanks,   


\[Professor\]  


I'm panicking because of the ""mandated reporter,"" but I'm 22, so? I dont know the intricacies around it, but I don't think anyone is going to show up at my home. But I told him I appreciated the offer, and that a younger-less supported me would have taken him up on it, but as an adult with a plan to move out and a very supportive frequently in-contact therapist, I am doing ok.  


I'm a bit overwhelmed. Just been smoking weed to bring down the anxiety and the overwhelming sense of guilt of describing my home as abusive. A very strong voice in my head is trying to tell me it isn't, but I think that voice is scared and wants this environment to be safe so badly it is trying to lie. It wants to keep the emotions that come with knowing that this is abusive environment away because we know emotions aren't welcomed here, and there is that fear that can be debilitating. I appreciate that voice, but I know that it only exists due to abuse, and that it itself is evidence that I'm living with abuse. And my extensive post-history doesn't lie. I AM living in an abusive environment.

  
I agreed to do college with the condition that I'd be living somewhere else. Now that I am home, I need to change my standards. That includes emailing professors to alert them of my situation, making ALL my classes Credit/No Credit, and accepting the accommodations handed to me. I can not be hard on myself right now.  


Fighting back tears and panic for the time being. Life is hard."
"Accepting that you are actually lovable is a surprisingly, frustratingly painful ordeal.",790,cmecwd,111,"I was talking about this with another person here the other day, that there are paradoxes of recovery. Joy is met with anger at having never felt joy before; the relief of no longer trying to fix other people comes with the despair of a battle lost; and particularly salient for me today, accepting that there's nothing inherently unlovable about you means accepting that humanity is capable of easily, passively damaging its members, which is very painful.

I asked my therapist about the source of emotional pain once, and he said that seeing the world and the people in it fail to reach their potential is an inherently painful, ever-present human experience. Seeing someone that could be kind instead choose to be cruel is painful. Seeing someone spend another day on the couch instead of following their dreams is painful. Seeing a parent neglect their lovable child is *very* painful, especially if that parent is yours, and that child was you.

Shaking off the internalized sense that I am inherently unlovable is proving to be very taxing, and it's because I am constantly having to stop and feel the deep pain of learning and accepting things like:

* My parents had every ability to learn to love, but chose not to.
* Their flawed parenting style was taught to them by professionals they should've been able to trust.
* Emotionally empty children who are being provided for materially have no way to receive help in Western society.
* I spent years unconsciously seeking motherly love from peers, which was fruitless. They responded with refusal and neglect, which was *proper.*
* There are millions and millions of people like my parents and like me on this planet, and there is no clear way to wake them up, so this will continue indefinitely.

All of these are *deeply* painful realizations. A lot of them started with severe anger, but behind anger there is often pain, and that's been the case here. I can sense that as I work through them, other parts of me are coming a little more alive, feeling a little more relieved, but it's making for a shit start to my week.

And I think a lot of us here can cut ourselves some major slack for taking a long time to accept these things. Most people will never have to know these painful truths, and in learning them I think I'm losing some optimism and innocence. It's better than blaming myself, for sure, and I'll be glad to have gone through this phase, but I don't know if I can fault anyone for being reluctant and slow to feel all of this. It's a little like asking someone to be their own dentist.

Anyway, I don't have a strong point to end on. This has just been my weekend and now my week. Thanks for reading."
Did anyone else used to try to make themselves appear worse so their parents wouldn’t invalidate them?,795,iovym1,75,"I still do this now. I wouldn’t fully fake an illness, but I would play up my symptoms so that I appeared worse on the outside. I did this because my parents would often think I was faking, give me chores to do, or get irritated with me for being sick. 

I even do this now with my mental health, because if I don’t “look” miserable, they don’t believe me. So I find myself averse to smiling, appearing happy, or doing anything that makes it seem like I have a lot of energy. 

Obviously even if you’re depressed you can still smile in a moment of distraction (like when someone makes a funny joke). But I feel this aversion to letting myself even do that, just because of the way my parents would perceive that. 

Does anyone else do this?"
I often hear about “breaking the cycle of abuse”. But I think abuse & trauma is overwhelmingly pervasive—maybe even the norm. How many abusers even know they’re being abusive? What if the world is just so materially f*cked up that most of us live in dysfunction & trauma?,790,j9vf55,69,"I see posts here talking about breaking the cycle of abuse. 

I think about how my mother thought she broke the cycle. She thought she was a better parent than her parents. She thought things were going to get better when she divorced my emotionally distant, immature (and abusive?) father. She believed my gaslighting and harmful childhood and young adult counselors and therapists who couldn’t understand I had autism and was struggling for reasons not related to my father. She thought getting help from her **narcissistic** & abusive marriage and family therapist brother—intertwining him into our lives in codependent sickness—was the right thing to do. She thought she found a good partner 7 years after divorcing my father. It turned out to be a dead-end 12 year relationship with a MSW drug & alcohol dependency counselor who was abusive and refused to move in with or marry her while she helped raise his children.

She thought she was justified in emotionally abusing me because I was perceived as a difficult child and a burden. She never saw her behavior as problematic. 

I look around me and I cannot see one functional relationship. And it’s not like I come from a background of poverty or addiction. My parents are college educated; my paternal grandparents were college educated. 

Almost all of the most harmful people in my life are mental health professionals or educators. I grew up being taught about abuse. There was awareness. There was education. 

**I feel like I am the first generation in my family to have grown up with a supposed framework and terminology for identifying and describing abuse and it definitely did not break the cycle.**"
"Part of the barrier preventing proper treatment for us is how normalized the abuse/neglect in our childhoods was. So the assessment question of ""What's your relationship like with your parents?"" can garner a positive response, when actually we're still just brainwashed into thinking it was.",790,htvogg,75,"I read through an old psychiatric assessment paper from when I was in my early twenties. It's so much different to now.

""She has a good relationship with her parents.""

It floored me.

I had no idea back then that I was neglected at all. Absolutely none.

That question was pretty much pointless. Counter-productive, even. As far as I was concerned, I was ""just stupid"", lazy, incompetant. My problems didn't have anything to do with my parents surely?

For me, this strongly exemplifies that if you don't have a healthy basis for what is ""normal"" / healthy, then you won't know a damn thing is wrong in the first place. "

My therapist told me she was going to have to think about whether she will keep me on as a patient.,789,ftfk5m,224,"She said she could find me someone else. She said I’m unmotivated, avoidant, and don’t do anything she tells me to do. I wasn’t even aware she had told me to do anything. I said okay, even though those are the issues I came to see you about since I have ptsd and depression and anxiety, but whatever. Could you refer me to another psych who treats ptsd?
 
Her: I treat ptsd, and no one does it better than me. I’m the best at it, I deal with the most complex patients. 

Me: ?????? 

Is it just me or is this weird? My brain is exploding I’m so disgusted. Im so repulsed by human beings I don’t even know what to say. You can think they can’t get any worse and they do. I had a bad feeling about her from the first session, when I drove all the way to her practice only for her to tell me she didn’t have any appointment scheduled for me, they had cancelled them that day and I should have known (without them calling or emailing me???). She also says mildly racist/culturally insensitive things, and I swear I know more about her psychological issues than she does mine (her post partum depression when she was young, her current health issues, her insecurities about her weight, her lack of self control when eating, etc etc). 
I feel so depressed right now, I wish I’d never bothered to go see this person. I really am beyond depressed by this, how there really is no hope for people in even getting help.


Edit: Thanks so much for all your comments. They really helped me see things clearer and bring myself up from feeling so down and re-traumatized. All the comments saying she's a narcissist scare me, as I've been reading so much on identifying and avoiding narc's, I don't know how I didn't spot her narcissistic traits - I guess because she was in a professional position and I was in a particularly bad state when I started seeing her, I was less guarded. I am looking into reporting her behaviour as well, although I'm nervous about it as I don't want any negative fallout. I have checked and I have 2 years to file a complaint. But I really appreciate the supportive words and guidance, it means a lot after so much negativity. I have sunk deeper into depression because of our last few sessions, and have not been sleeping and have had nightmares about her. It really is awful what a bad therapist is capable of. But I think I will start to get over it as I move on and consider new resources. I will look into all the Youtube channels and books recommended. Thank you!"
Last night the cashier loudly shamed me over and over for not having enough money to pay and I couldn't leave because he wouldn't give my cash back,790,fcuqpp,118,"At this point I feel like every man I encounter wants to hurt me and is just waiting for me to do the smallest thing they can hurt me for. I hate feeling so small.

I wanted to pay for a $24 item. I had $20 cash and was going to use $4 from my debit card for the remainder. He ran through the $20 and my card got declined for the $4.

There were people behind me and he said to them all loudly ""this woman can't pay, find another line"" and he kept repeating over and over that it would be a while, he can't void it because he already ran the cash through. Each time someone came in line behind me he told them I don't have enough money so they have to wait. The whole time he was waving the $20 bill around in the air. It's the only money I had. I couldn't leave. I obviously didn't have the funds for the food so I wasn't getting it so I don't understand why he couldn't give it back to me instead of making me wait until the transaction was cancelled to leave.

He told me I need to check my bank account and to go to my car and check the problem and I better fix it. I went to my car to check. A $25 payment came out and I don't know what it is and I still don't. It's not appearing in the transactions. I have 10km to empty in my car and I'm overdrafted. I went back in and told him a payment came out. He still wouldn't give me the money. He kept pressing buttons that didn't do anything and waving the money over my head and telling other people I'm holding him up because I don't have enough money. Until the manager came over. And he told him that too. Couldn't ask him to void it without telling him I came in without enough money.

I'm so humiliated. I felt so small. I felt so scared. It's so hard for me to not feel like everyone wants to hurt me and it seems like every time I make a mistake in public I have to get hurt for it. I didn't even know if I was over reacting and I still don't. Maybe that's normal and I'm sensitive. I went home and stayed up until 4am sobbing. Self harmed a little bit. I hate myself so much.

Edit: thank you for the replies. I have read a lot and I really want to take more steps and stand up for myself. I will answer, I just am having a really really hard day right now. I am pretty good at functioning in society The amount I need to at least but being made to feel small is probably the worst feeling for me."

This article has legitimately changed the way I see CPTSD,784,e28397,136,"[We Can't Keep Treating Anxiety From Complex Trauma the Same Way We Treat Generalized Anxiety](https://themighty.com/2018/06/anxiety-from-complex-trauma/?fbclid=IwAR2Th7bcntiJkmjHzzClkKT-XWWFl5Zy3imHfONtiZOWq21WTVaYrq0o-nA)

*“Anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but I suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. Most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. Unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on Cluster B personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. Many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (BPD) or bipolar disorder. Anyone who has sought treatment for generalized anxiety or depression owes themselves a deeper look at whether trauma plays a role.”*

Thoughts about this last paragraph. Many of us know that doing our own research is infinitely better than depending on anyone who doesn’t understand trauma. Those of us privileged enough to get therapy know all too well that there aren’t enough trauma-informed therapists out there. It felt reassuring to read this and understand that the hundreds of hours of research that I’ve put in would ultimately lead me in the right direction whether I found a trauma-informed therapist or not.

That last sentence really spoke to me. I was first diagnosed with depression at 12 and generalized anxiety disorder at 23 (I’m 34 now). I supposed I kind of lumped the trauma to that when I diagnosed myself with CPTSD a few months ago. It hadn’t occurred to me that I could have previously been misdiagnosed or that one was causing the other.

My anxiety and depression had always felt like the only yin and yang I’d ever have in my life, like there was no other reason and no other way because of some “chemical imbalance” that can’t be fixed. Every day I’m thankful that I took the time to look into CPTSD because it is curable and I cry every time I think there might be a day where the morning isn’t absolutely dreadful and full of nausea, the afternoon full of anxiety that doesn’t let me eat, and the nights aren’t just me lying in bed like I never learned how to sleep and wishing I could detach these horribly uncomfortable arms. 

I’m starting to learn to check in with myself and say, “What are we really doing and for who?” because now I understand the absurd levels of codependency I need to fight through just to know if I actually have a preference or if I’m just following my programming. Earlier in the shower, I caught myself washing my hair furiously and hurriedly. I used to think, “My anxiety always has me in such a rush” and just went with it. Now I can slow down and really think about whether or not this is actually beneficial for me, because taking time for your time when looking after your body is self-care. Once I slowed down enough, breathed, and went back to a mindful state, I heard the voice of my mother in head yelling, “You always take too long in the shower!” Ah, there it is. The real reason. Suddenly taking my time felt victorious instead of the “self-care” routine that I frequent (sometimes) without a lot of hope.

Anyway, thanks for reading this far. I hope that this moment of clarity could possibly help others. I know that any flicker at the end of the tunnel will eventually become a light. May our healing journeys be paved with victories!"
"""Push and Sabotage"" - A Covert Abuse Technique",787,cszubn,212,"Suppose there's a man named Mark with a teenage son named Paul. Mark is abusive. Paul is a talented painter. Mark wants Paul to stop painting, because he can't stand it when other people have more talent than he does, or because he just doesn't want Paul to be happy, or whatever. How does Mark go about this?

Many abusers would take the direct route: Just command Paul to stop painting. Tell him it's forbidden. Go on a tirade if he ever tries to defy you. Threaten him with punishment. Etc.

But from Mark's perspective, this approach has a downside. Namely, it makes it pretty dang obvious that Mark is abusive. Mark doesn't want people to realize he's abusive. He especially doesn't want *Paul* to realize that he's abusive, because then Paul will defy him.

So Mark comes up with an alternative: **Push and Sabotage**. He *encourages* Paul to paint. He plays the part of a supportive father. He tells all the neighbors about his talented son. That's the ""Push"" part. But then comes ""Sabotage""; he grinds Paul down with perfectionism. He insists that nothing Paul does is ever good enough. He cloaks this in the language of love: He just wants Paul to be the best painter he can be! Eventually, Paul gets discouraged by the criticism and gives up painting.

So Mark the Abuser gets his way, but nobody realizes what he's done. Everyone, even Paul, believes that Mark is a supportive father. Mark's abuse is all the more powerful because it's *covert*.

This isn't just interpersonal; it's *intrapersonal*. Abuse victims may unconsciously pick up on this technique and use it against *themselves* without realizing it. Maybe you have some goal that you want to achieve, and you push yourself to achieve it, but you subtly sabotage yourself along the way. And when you notice that sabotage, oftentimes that just leads to *another* round of Push-and-Sabotage! You think ""Arg! I need to stop sabotaging myself!"" and then you find a way to sabotage the process of learning not to sabotage yourself.

You get trapped in a false dichotomy: ""Give up"" vs. ""Push and Sabotage"". Every time you give up on a goal that matters to you, you suffer, because you really care about that goal. (Note: It is possible to choose a goal that doesn't actually speak to your True Self. Try not to fall into that trap.) Conversely, every time you really work on achieving the goal, you instantly fall into the sabotage trap, and *that* causes you pain. So you're in pain either way! And you can spend a lifetime bouncing between these two options without getting anything done.

The only way to win is to stop playing by the abuser's rules. Self-love is key. A supportive community is also key.

----

EDIT: Several people have asked me to point out that the abuser might not fully realize what they're doing, and they might honestly believe (on some level) that they're actually helping you succeed. Personally I'm rather cautious about this line of thinking, because it's so easy for abuse victims to give their abusers too much credit. And also, even unintentional abuse still hurts you and you still need to get away from it somehow. But yes, it's true that people aren't always fully aware of what they're doing."

Having abusive parents has got to be one of the most unfair things in life. You are punished because you were punished.,787,em8bej,96,"Eg. They may force you onto the streets by withdrawing financial support when you are a child, their reasoning being that you are not filling their needs, *because* you are so damaged by their abuse.

EDIT: Just wanted to add...my post title is me venting. I'm just really frustrated today thinking about how sucky this whole situation is. It's not my usual mood, nor is it something I go around saying every day. It's not meant to be a quantifiable statement, just a feelings vent. Today I just felt extra pissed about how sucky things are, and knowing that they are sucky in no part because of anything I did, but simply because my parents are abusive. And it's like the more you try and save yourself by getting out or doing what's best for yourself, the more they get angry and try to make things worse for you. Who knew that trying to be healthy and safe was something that warranted more punishment?"

Scalded myself and I was told me to treat the burn first,787,eksc0t,86,"I was cooking some soup and I heard the door unlock. For some ridiculous reason I get jumpy whenever someone returns home. It was just his mom but I jumped, knocked over the boiling soup on my feet and legs. Immediately I ignored the burns and started cleaning the spill, afraid of being yelled at for being a clumsy mess, while ignoring the stinging on my scalded skin.

My boyfriend's mother looked shocked and urgently told me to treat the burn immediately and to forget about the spill. I ran cold water on the scalded area. 

I realise from her shocked expression that its normal to want to treat burns/injuries first.

This is really normal but I learnt that your health and well being comes first before other people's inconveniences.

Anyone else wished they were never born when they were a child?,787,jrjf0t,102,"I'm just wondering if anyone else experienced this. 

I don't think I really felt suicidal during this time, but I can exactly remember how I just went to toilet and my thoughts went like ""I wish I was dead. No, I'd miss my family. I wish I died. Nope, my family would miss me. But they wouldn't miss me if I just was never born. And I wouldn't miss anyone. Yes. Everything would be better if I was just never born. It's so exhausting to live."" 


So, like, nothing upsetting happened before, my thoughts just randomly wandered off in a dark direction, but I didn't even realize that those were bad thoughts. Guess I was used to not liking my life? I only recently realized that this might not be as normal as it felt. What do you think about this?"
Anyone else get social anxiety due to childhood trauma?,785,il7e18,85,I have anxiety during social situations and I hate it. I cant make friends or form relationships and it just  kills me seeing other people are close with each other and I'm just that silent kid in the corner
DAE have parents who know they were affected by their abusive upbringings but still think abusing you is fine because it’s “better” than how they were raised?,781,hhv2ol,106,"My dad simultaneously knows exactly how his abusive alcoholic mother caused his frequent depressive episodes and can’t for the life of him figure out why I was diagnosed with a laundry list of disorders. His father left him at a very young age and never paid child support. When my dad and his mom eventually tracked his father down, his father pointed a gun at both of them and told them never to contact him again. But his mother didn’t seem to care much about him either and abused and neglected him. 

In my case, my dad and mom are still married although they have a strained relationship. My dad thinks because he’s still in my life that that excuses anything he does, even though he’s still an abusive, neglectful alcoholic. It doesn’t help that any time anyone in my family dares to bring up his behavior, he gets defensive and says that it’s far better than how he was raised and that we’re lucky to have a father that cares enough to “discipline” us."
DAE get sudden strong urges to get away from people?,779,i3l6c6,92,"This is hard to describe because I have a lot of trouble understanding it myself, but it happens after hanging out with people (or even just one person) for a while. The most recent example I have is a family dinner. It's kind of like a breaking point where I can't cope with the socializing anymore and need to get away to a room alone, and it feels pretty intense and weirdly similar to anger/strong frustration. When these happen I just shut down and stop interacting completely, and even tend to lash out at people who ask me direct questions and force me to participate. 

It also happens when one of my parents enters my room and starts to clean stuff up, which is something they both like to do. I just get so angry that they can't somehow read my mind and get a clue that I want to be by myself, so I do my best to direct the anger ""inwards"" so I don't end up snapping at them when they've obviously done nothing wrong.

I'm an introvert and have bad diagnosed social anxiety, so that probably explains wanting to be alone and needing to recharge, it's just a very intense urge/feeling that I have trouble dealing with at times, especially because realistically you can't choose to just dip in the middle of a social situation anytime you feel overwhelmed. (let me know if this post has absolutely nothing to do with C-PTSD and I should take it to the social anxiety sub instead)"
DAE Ignore Their Sicknesses Growing Up Because They Were Taught that They Mattered Less Than Accomplishing Things,787,gvm1lf,106,"Today I was dumb and worked out and walked in the heat without eating lunch, I was dizzy.  However, I waited for my Mother to finish making dinner and played the piano while attempting to ignore my dizziness.  I realize now that that is how I grew up.  I would ignore my sickness and sadness to accomplish things because I felt like how I felt mattered less than what I was supposed to accomplish.    It was especially bad when I was really young and would be asked to babysit when I was running fever.   
 Did anyone else grow up like that?"
I didn't understand or believe that I had PTSD because it wasn't like in the movies and on Tumblr. Now I understand it's because it's difficult to accurately portray abstract feelings in pictures but it took me years to realize that. It's not pretty.,787,drz441,84,"I didn't think I had flashbacks because I didn't lose my vision and see something playing like a movie. I didn't break down. It's not obvious on my face. No one comes along and catches me before I faint which I don't do.

All I see is a quick snapshot of him sitting on the couch with his head in his hands before he did it. Or I see the painting in the hallway in the house. My grip feels weak. My knees feel weak. I never fall. I never let go of the steering wheel. My heart feels asthough it's lost its will to beat and there's a little too much time between thumps. Maybe it's a very bad day and I scream in the car. After I scream? It's nothing. I'm already defeated.

Sometimes I have so many flashbacks I don't even realize they're happening. It's normal imagery in my head. I don't think hey, I'm having a flashback, I'll go home and drink and cry now. No. I have so many. I pay for parking at the school. I wait until 30 mins after class starts before realizing I'm too weak to go in. I spend a little money I don't have on some food to feel better and get more depressed about that. I feel the feelings of worthlesless he showed me in his eyes. Then I go home and put a nice show on and drink.

I thought I would hear a loud noise and freak out. Yell. Get angry. I didn't know that freezing up and being unable to process anything as if I don't understand English or like I'm on tv and others are watching me, I'm not really there.

I thought anxiety was telling everyone you have anxiety, posting pictures of panic attacks online. I thought a panic attack was crying and screaming and unable to stop it. A very pretty, romanticized event that makes everyone around you want to coddle you. I didn't know it could be anger. I didn't know it could be feelings of extreme anger and helplessness over a person being so quiet just like 'he' was before he hurt me. I didn't know it could be a woman banging her head into a metal door until she falls over. That's not lady like. That's not cute. That doesn't make others feel bad for me. It's not romanticized. It's reality. I thought nothing was wrong with me."
I grocery shopped today!,781,jcxyg6,79,"I grocery shopped today, and it went really well! 😊 I’m super-proud of myself, and just wanted to share with people who can maybe understand.

For context, my parents are abusive shits who stopped me learning life skills as a kid, and I’ve only now gotten a place of my own at the age of 25 where I can teach stuff to myself without having someone scream at me for doing it wrong/taking too long/etc. I’m pretty much certain I have undiagnosed ADHD/Asperger’s, which on top of the zero-life skills thing has always made grocery shopping by myself so overwhelming it gives me panic attacks.

But today I actually managed it! 😊 I procrastinated on going, but I did manage to stick to my list, bought reasonably healthy food, didn’t buy too much/too little of anything, didn’t forget to buy anything, managed to bag it all up, carry it home, and store it, all without being overwhelmed and panicking/buying a load of junk and rushing out of the store like usual! 😊😊

It’s probably the most pathetic thing in the universe, but this is such a huge thing for me. Even just the fact that I was able to keep calm and go about things in a logical, non-chaotic way is such a huge achievement; I honestly never thought I’d get to this point.

Also the girl on the checkout was so nice! I had to focus super-hard to get everything out the trolley and organised without panicking, and I explained how my ADHD makes shopping difficult b/c I didn’t want her to think I was being rude not speaking to her. She was INSANELY nice about it, and since it was just me there she scanned things slowly a bit at a time so I could pack without getting overwhelmed. Almost made me cry, since I was raised with the idea that the world is harsh and people won’t help you if you’re struggling. I could’ve hugged her, and I wish I got her name. So yeah! Thanks for reading if you got this far lol. 😊

Edit: Aagh, my first gold! Thank you so much!! 😊💜💜 I can‘t believe how much this post has blown up - thank you so much everyone for your support and kindness! I’m tearing up here.

Edited edit: Good grief! I went to bed last night and woke up to 44 new comments and like 5 awards on this post! 🙀😊😊💜💜💜 Will do my best to reply to everyone, but it might take me some time sorry! Thank you so much everyone! 😊 I never expected this to blow up like it has, and I’m really glad it‘s relatable/could help people feel less alone, too. We will all get there eventually, I’m sure of it! 😊"
DAE only ever run from life instead of facing/living it?,781,ipc621,111,"1.I never make decisions for myself, I wait until my life falls apart and I'm forced to make one/one is made for me. I've done this more times than I can count. 

2.I don't go into any sort of conflict, I can't face it, and so I will avoid it until like above, it becomes unbearable and explodes in my face. 

Escapism is all I've ever done. Video games, junk food, drugs, just give me anything to take me out of this hell hole for one second

And I am COMPLETELY AWARE of me doing the above at the time, but it changes nothing, I'm still not able to act differently. It's like watching a terrible movie screaming at the character ""how dumb is he?"" but the character is me, I'm watching myself ruin my life while completely aware of it

"I've just discovered the superpower of admitting to myself that other people have problems, rather than subconsciously considering others to be perfect no matter what.",780,h7j1mh,52,"Long story short: I was reading posts on JustNOFriend and a LOT of anger got triggered. Immediately I knew what it was about: It was my best friend just a few weeks ago casually accusing me of something he did TO ME a long time ago that I would never do to anyone. I didn't confront him at the time because, honestly, I was totally unprepared for it and the subject was changed right after.

I was mulling it over just now. I don't really want to pick up the phone and talk through it; but when I thought more about it I realised something: ""This is something he's always done. He will literally blame his best friend for something he did before he will admit that he actually did it.""

In some respects, he is simply not a good person. He will lie. He will accuse others to cover his own back, probably to make himself feel better. There isn't much of a need to confront him about this incident (although I should certainly defend myself next time), because he'll eventually do it again regardless of whether I confront him.

But now that I've admitted that to myself and seriously made a note of it, I can now be prepared for the next time he does this. It has also shattered the illusion that he is some great friend - he is still a friend, but he's by no means a great one. For all the good he does: He will lie, and he will falsely accuse myself and others if he feels the need. Whether or not the friendship will exist in the future is a matter for further consideration."
"""You've never let yourself experience the feeling of anger. You learned to manifest your anger inwardly and it came out as self blame.""",784,gaux3l,72,"Something my therapist told me - I can't afford to do therapy as often as I wish but I had a session a few days ago and I learned that I'm actually angry at my childhood.

I always wondered why I feel so tense - I used to worry I would have an ""episode"" in public and just start screaming for no reason and I never understood why. My therapist told me I'm angry. But because I saw my father's rage so much I always made sure I don't show anger as an emotion in that way.

I've never been angry for things that happened to me. Ever. And realising that finally made me angry. I guesss my next step is to learn how to manage & express this anger in a healthy way. "
@ghosted1996 on ig,780,bxshyo,33,
I hate the romanticization and misrepresentation,779,lg5drm,124,"EDIT: I want to clarify some things

1. Honestly no matter what symptoms you have you’re still valid. Quiet and mature? You’re valid. Screaming and angry? Still valid. My only problem is when the media decides to ignore some parts of what mental illness can really be like. This can create an expectation for how traumatized people are supposed to act. This can be dangerous because nobody has to act a certain way to be valid. Nobody has to be a certain way to be valid. There is no such thing as “correct” symptoms or a “correct” way of having mental illness. I wish there was more visibility on all the symptoms of mental illness and not just where somebody matures
2. I am not gatekeeping. As I said before, no matter what your symptoms are you are valid. My problem is when people start to think people who suffer mental illnesses are all supposed to act and behave in the same/a similar manner to how people with mental illnesses are portrayed in the media. For example, it’s dangerous to expect somebody suffering from mental illness to be mature even if that person is not. It sets an expectation and basically tells the person “you’re supposed to be a certain way” when there is no certain way. You don’t owe anybody a certain way of acting

People reading this: please do not gatekeep in the comments. This post is not about gatekeeping and that was never my intention. I was pointing out how the media can set a expectation/assumption of how people with mental illnesses are supposed to behave and how that could be harmful. Are all and any symptoms, traumas, and mental illnesses valid? Yes. They are. And everybody deserves to have representation and validation. There is no such thing as a correct way to act. You do not owe anyone a certain way of how you behave. I cannot stress that enough.

I hope this cleared some things up

EDIT NUMBER TWO: and yes there is a problem that goes the other way too where people use their trauma as an excuse to hurt others/as an excuse for bad behavior. We should all strive to be good people. And we will make mistakes. We all make mistakes. Every single one of us are human. We should all try to learn from our mistakes and do better next time. Trauma nor mental illness is not an excuse to hurt other people. It is not an excuse to have bad behaviors. It can be an explanation yes, but not an excuse. We should all try to focus on our healing and through that become better people. I have hurt people because of how I acted due to mental illness and trauma. I have been hurt because of how people acted due to their mental illness and trauma. Most people took accountability for their actions though and I have worked on improving myself as well. It’s okay to make a mistake; there is always time to improve and do your best to fix it

Here’s the actual post:

I hate the narrative that people who have went through trauma are mature, kind, quiet, etc. It is true that people who have suffered trauma have those traits but not everybody has them. The media almost always portrays people who suffer trauma, especially teens, as these super mature and grown up people

What about the angry outbursts? Isolating yourself from people? Crying every day and wanting to scream? Being frustrated about not knowing how to communicate to others? Never feeling safe, not even with friends or family? Always being paranoid? It’s so frustrating that only the “convenient” or “ideal” symptoms are portrayed

This also feeds into the problem of people romanticizing mental illness. Nowadays it’s cool to have depression and trauma because of (and I quote) “✨character development✨” and it’s so frustrating to see people who want to experience mental illness just to appear “cool” or “quirky”. Mental illness isn’t always being mature, being “mysterious”, having “character development”, having people care about and worry about you all the time, having a cute bf/gf/etc. holding you in their arms, etc.

I wish there was more accurate portrayal of mental illness in the media. I want people to see the truth behind what mental illness can be like. People seriously need to stop glorifying mental illness."
Being bullied without a safe home to turn to is traumatizing,778,gv2v5k,60,"I recently figured that while the dysfunctional family I grew up in groomed me for the negative experiences I had outside my family, they left their very own scars.

For years I couldn't even grasp that a lot of the  problems I have today stem from being bullied and caught up in toxic friendships in my childhood. I asked myself so many times - why? Why me? What have I done wrong? Why does noone like me? Why do they keep hurting me? Am I just too weak for this world? Everyone gets bullied at some point in their lives. Why can't I just get over it like everyone else does?

I am in my early twenties now and the bullying from more that ten years ago still bothers me. They still come back to haunt me after so many years. Before I understood the abuse I experienced, I felt guilty for being so weak to still think about it. Today I can finally see that it wasn't my fault. I am not strange. People who should have cared for me failed to prepare me to deal with the unfortunately ""normal"" cruelties children put onto each other sometimes.

Sure, I had one parent to turn to. But they got so worked up that I felt guilty for even showing that I was upset. If I couldn't hold it back and they found out I was yelled at for not protecting myself. But how could I? I never learned how to protect myself. All that I learned at home was to endure and dissociate. ""He'll stop eventually, we'll just have to wait. He wouldn't hurt us. Let's go and do something else until he's done raging"". No wonder I was the victim. It's all I ever learned.

I recently read that bullying in itself can be traumatizing especially if you have noone to turn to. And I realized how true that is for myself. I was bullied at home and taught to let it happen. I was bullied, sometimes by one parent, sometimes by both, and never protected. That is true until I decided I was done with this family and moved out hastily. 

So this fuck you is for you, parents, to raise me thinking I just had to endure the pain people put on me. And a big fuck you to the bullies of course, especially the older ones. Kids are stupid, I know that. But when you're over 18 you're aware of what you're doing, so whomever you're hurting, you're doing it with intent. And that hurts so much more. Fuck all of them. It still hurts and that's okay. I will heal. But I am not weak."
Karma is BS. The abused get abused more,781,lhzjpd,122,"Evan Rachel Wood said what we all know: a victim is more likely to get abused again. .

Has anyone gotten CPTSD mainly from emotional abuse?,782,gtae7b,316,"So my therapist isn’t really into diagnosing, and I just wanted to ask whether this is possible.

Like yeah, there was a few times where my hair was pulled, I was hit, pinched, slapped or whatever but it wasn’t necessarily “traumatizing”. Most of my stress now comes from home where I’ve been name called, embarrassed in public etc. Sometimes I wonder whether or not I’m just crazy and I’m overreacting. Other times I feel guilty because I feel like if someone were in my shoes they would be able to handle it no biggie. And maybe someone who has the same symptoms as me may have gone through something worse. 

I hate the fact that I’m struggling in school now because of it. I keep dissociating and then I cant pay attention, or I’m so stressed I can’t focus. Sometimes I dissociate when I’m with friends and even when I tell myself “I’m dissociating” I simply cannot snap out of it. I’m always tired yet for some reason I don’t want to sleep (I don’t get nightmares though). My memories are all jumbled up, and when I try to think more about the course of events that happened throughout my life I swear I’m just overreacting, or maybe I just forgot a lot of them because I truly did."

It's a constant struggle to stay motivated.",779,hv7oxe,53,"Pretty self-explanatory, but it feels like a cruel joke from the universe in some ways that dealing with the aftermath of an alienating, unseen trauma can be just as isolating than the trauma itself. Does anyone have systems they use to keep themselves fighting? I have a solid support system but there are aspects of what happened to me that no one I know can relate to, and things I don't feel comfortable sharing with people in my life just yet. It just stings that so many people see disorganization/laziness when every moment is a battle with my emotions and the people who have hurt me- like, no one cares that over the weekend I managed to speak kindly to myself about a trigger, but they care a lot that I replied to an email a day late. I'm grateful for the support that is out there but goddamn this is hard!"
"I wish someone could watch a video of my entire childhood and tell me if it was really ""that bad""",780,eo1zsr,190,"I worry that I'm being melodramatic or overreacting. There's nothing that's clearly actually super horrific abuse or anything. Nothing that explains why I'm like this. 

I feel like I mislead people into thinking it was worse than it was. That it must have been bad for me to end up like this. My therapist admitted that he'd figured it was bad before I really told him much about it. He went into it assuming it would be bad. He says ""people whose childhoods weren't that bad don't have thousands of scars [from self harm]."" It seems like circular reasoning to me, the no true Scotsman fallacy. 

What if my childhood really wasn't that bad? What if I really am making it out to be worse than it was? What if I just want to feel sorry for myself and pretend to be a victim even though nothing that happened to me was that bad?

When I tell people about something from my childhood and they remark that it's horrible or ""no child deserves that"" or whatever, they're going into it already biased by knowing that I'm screwed up. I'm giving them one piece of data, not an accurate picture of my childhood. Anyone could make their childhood sound fucked up by only focusing on the worst parts. I had a lot of good moments too, a lot of things going for me that other children didn't get. Everyone's parents screw some stuff up. 

What if someone really could just watch my entire childhood? I honestly have no clue what they'd think. Probably that it wasn't nearly as bad as they expected. If someone could watch 100 people's childhoods, I don't think mine would stand out as particularly bad."
How I'm Reparenting Myself,774,dzksx3,109,"I wrote this list on my commute this morning. It's personal to me so you probably won't resonate with all of the items, but each one addresses a way that I was not properly parented as a child. A bit about where this list is coming from: 

* My time growing up was split 60-40 between my dad's home and my mom's, and their parenting styles could not have been more different. 
* My dad was very strict and rigid and his voice became my inner critic, by telling me I need to be more productive, get up early, make more money, have no feelings, etc. 
* My mom was mentally ill, alcoholic, and extremely permissive... she brought home unsafe men, had no rules, had no money, discouraged me from having friends or being physically active, neglected our animals, and was extremely enmeshed with me. 
* So in some ways they were complete opposites and I tried to please them both. But both parents also taught me to judge other people, not like anything that was popular, that I needed to be responsible for everything and everyone, and that I was never good enough. 
* I just finally wriggled free from a relationship that--like every relationship I've had--I was not accepted in. It was incredibly codependent and full of anxiety. I knew he didn't understand me and everything I did was an attempt to be seen, validated, and accepted. But it was never going to happen. I abandon myself every time I change for someone else.

####How I Reparent Myself

* I make myself three healthy meals a day and don’t force myself to eat things I don’t like, and I don’t starve myself
* I make sure I have clean clothes that fit me and are comfortable 
* I keep my space relatively clean and tidy 
* I make my home a safe place that I want to spend time in
* I give myself lots of time so I’m not rushing
* I set boundaries with people who make me feel uncomfortable or unsafe for any reason
* I don’t procrastinate on my work so I don’t feel stressed and anxious
* I take breaks from work when I need them
* I watch and listen to things I like or am interested in without judgement
* I have a flexible daily routine that ensures I get my needs met
* I reach out for support when I need it
* I notice and accept my feelings
* I don’t let people tell me how I should feel, act, look, or think
* I don’t change who I am to try to prove myself to people who don’t accept me for who I am
* I do physical therapy exercises so my body hurts less
* I ask myself “what do _I_ want?” when I think I might be people-pleasing
* I make time for creativity
* I make time for fun
* I make time for rest
* I help others (service)
* I act according to my values
* I forgive my own mistakes
* I notice when I am thinking in black and white and consider there might be a middle ground
* I am allowed to change my mind about anything at any time
* I am responsible with money but spend a reasonable amount on things I need and want
* I notice when I’m judging or criticizing others and remind myself to practice empathy and tolerance 
* I take care of my appearance in ways that feel good to me
* I am not ashamed of my interests and don’t pretend to hate things that I like
* I am curious and know there are no stupid questions
* I respond instead of reacting to situations that trigger me
* I don’t take responsibility for everyone else’s emotions
* I am responsible for my pets and I do my best to keep them happy and healthy
* I tell myself that I’m doing a good job and making progress every day, even when it feels like I’m going backwards or stuck. It’s part of the process. 

Thank you for letting me share. I love this community.

edit: Thank you all for the comments and I'm so happy to hear this list is helping people! I just wanted to clarify that these are all in the present tense but that doesn't mean I've perfected them! It's like affirmations--if you say them in the present tense, you start to really feel them and they come true. 

Feel free to share things you would add to your list in the comments!"
Anyone else forever making lists to get things done and still getting bare minimum done?,776,j1x685,104,
Oooooh THATS why I like cats so much!,772,f6tkuy,125,"Holy fuck.

So, I became aware of my trauma around 2-3 years ago and everything really fell into place about the entire universe, my entire self - fucking everything. 

I’ve had many many breakthroughs and naively thought there probably wouldn’t be many more. But I’ve just had a pretty intense one.

I absolutely love cats. I get rushes of happy hormones even from photos of cats I don’t know. Videos even more so. Pet a neighbourhood cat? I’m high for the day. Love love love them. I’m desperate for my own, which we’ll get as soon as we move out of rented housing. 

So it’s because I grew up with cats right ? I mean we always had 6-8 around the house. And they’re cute. Yes, and also no. 

Argh. Ok . The REASON I love cats so much is because the 6-8 household cats were my only source of love, touch and affection my entire pre-adult life. They also kept me physically warm in a bed so cold the sheets felt wet and there was ice inside the windows. 

I love cats because I had no other source of positive affection or warmth. 

Fucksake.

Edit: a lot of you seem to relate - I think we need a new sub, ‘raisedbypets’ haha."
A child cannot rise above the emotional level of their parent,769,lrnhz1,60,"My therapist told me this at our last visit and it really stuck with me. I’m taking away my self blame for my struggling. I had no way to fix myself and figure out how to emotionally regulate when I was raised by a single mom with poorly managed depression. There was just no way. It wasn’t my fault at all and currently it isn’t my fault that I’m struggling. 

For those of you out there raised by parents that were struggling with their mental health in any way - of course you did too, you were just a kid and needed help you never got. It’s ok."
"My former psychiatrist asked my husband if he lives alone, and I feel unheard and invisible",778,g8ily1,112,"I stopped seeing the psychiatrist I'd been seeing for the past 4 or 5 years about 3 months ago. Month after month, I'd go to him and when he asked me to rate my depression, I'd tell him I was suffering either 7/10 or 8/10 depression. He'd do nothing. He kept telling me we'd tried all the medications that are available, and the one I was on was the best we can do.

Also, every month for 10 months straight, I complained about the adverse side effects of the medication. And every single time, it was like it was news to him. Like we hadn't already discussed this exact side effect 2 or 5 or 7 or 10 times.

My husband is also a patient of this psychiatrist. His symptoms are well-managed, and all he ever needs from the psychiatrist is a prescription refill.

But I got sick of being told that 7/10 depression is as good as can ever expect to feel, and I sought out a second opinion. My new psychiatrist was able to rattle off the names of about 10 drugs hadn't tried - despite my old psychiatrist saying we had literally tried every medication. I'm on a new med, and my depression is down to maybe a 5/10.

Well, my husband had to get his refills the other day, and in asking how my husband was holding up in the lockdown, the psychiatrist asked him, ""Do you live alone?""

I frequently paid both our bills together, directly to the psychiatrist, since he doesn't have a receptionist or assistant, so it's not possible that he never realized that my husband and I are married to each other. 

So I'm super angry. This man was my doctor for years, and he doesn't even know I exist.

I'm also vindicated in my decision to see a different doctor.

But like, I'm angry. I'm angry that I was ignored and invisible and forgotten. I'm angry on my husband's behalf that the doctor he's been seeing for 6 years doesn't even know he's married. Ignoring the fact that his wife is/was also his patient, that's a very basic thing you should know about a patient. And I'm angry that someone with so little compassion and so little knowledge is practicing psychiatry.

I don't know what I want from this other than to feel heard and acknowledged.

**TL;DR I'm feeling emotional about my former psychiatrist not knowing that I exist.**"
Dr. Mariel Buquè : Perfectionism is a trauma response,771,k5nh7o,62,"🙌🏾Facts 🙌🏾

I’ve never thought about it till now ( thanks to Psychologist/therapist, Mariel Buquè) because I used to wonder why I am such an perfectionist 🤔

Growing up with a narcissistic family and being bullied almost throughout my youth. The emotional abuse  I experienced worn down my self esteem where I began to believe  if I was flawless, then I would be more accepted by others. 

If I was perfect, people would love me. Perfectionism to me seemed like the key to everything in my life. Probably explains why I’m so hard on myself at times and hate letting others down. The same thing with people pleasing, which is also a trauma response.

I’m so glad I realized how toxic being perfectionist can be . Life starts imperfectly so embrace it"
DAE always have arguments in their head with people who did you wrong?,773,hhbasc,113,"A parent, roommate, friends, therapists.. you name it. It doesnt really do anything except for draining my energy but I always feel like I have to fight and defend myself with these toxic people (who I do cut out as much as I can). 

Some days I cant really switch it off."
Do you unconsciously use hypervigilance in this way?,771,frixlm,119,"I have always had a knack for being really observant and accurate in assessing other people and their emotional states. People have always been impressed with how closely I keep track of how they feel and their thinking patterns. I'm used to people coming to me for advice on how to deal with their emotions and relationship problems and for validation and stuff like that. People have called me really empathetic for it but as I've been learning about CPTSD, I really think it's because I had to develop hypervigilance as a child and be attuned with others' emotions to be safe... And ngl, I feel also guilty for it because I don't know a lot of times if I do this because I actually 'care' about people so much but because a subconscious part of me just wants to feel safe and in control and being able to feel like I can 'figure' people out and thus be able to predict how they act. 

But I also have really bad social anxiety and trauma-related issues which can really warp my perception at times which is definitely the shadow aspect of this.

Edit: Wow, this post seems to have resonated a lot with more people than I expected. Thank you to everyone for your feedback and kindness."
Being an adult when you're traumatized...,768,ez3b7h,128,"Had this realization a few days ago in the bathroom at my work but I'm an adult now! 

I looked in the mirror to see myself, a grown female, office attire, and a mature looking face. I felt so uncomfortable to see an adult in the mirror, to be honest I often have trouble identifying with my reflection.

Speaking of being an adult, I feel like living is just 100x harder when you're traumatized. You gotta do everything everyone else does but you gotta do it all by yourself with no strong base. Maybe I am speaking for myself but I live alone, have very few friends and am no contact with my entire family. I also dissociate heavily and that gets in the way of my ""self care"".

Btw this idea of self care is almost impossible when I spent all day at work trying to hide my anxiety and weird Trauma Kid™ mannerisms so I don't come off as a weirdo. By the time I get home I can barely move.

How am I supposed to eat well, sleep well, work on my self esteem, take care of my inner child, keep the house clean etc. When all my energy is totally drained from just trying to appear relatively normal. I swear the hyper vigilance has me flinging my head in all directions wonder where that little sound is coming from. ITS EXHAUSTING!!

The worst part of all of this is doing it alone AND even worse is having attachment issues. I can't even make friends because having relationships in itself just adds to the anxiety.

Everything about being alive has to feel so taxing and redundant.

I don't even know what I'm ranting about, I'm just TIRED and to be honest BORED of being traumatized."

THE HOUSE IS FULL OF BEES,766,c1n8pd,8,"“Oh man, it really does feel that ridiculous when you look back on it. You watch one of those horror movies, and the sinister voice says, “LEAVE NOW” and the characters are like “What was that? I’m sure it was the cat. Everything’s cool,” and you’re like HOW CAN YOU BE SO STUPID the house actually told you IN WORDS that it didn’t like you and you’re all me and this house, BFF.  

And then you remember your ex-husband who was like, “You’re fat and ugly and I hate you” and you were like “Even though he hates me and told me so, that is just how he shows love. I should live here forever, we are so happy,” and now you can’t make fun of bad movies without thinking about serious social issues  

Of course in this particular horror movie, the cabinets open and shut and the sinister voice says “LEAVE NOW MORTAL” and you’re like, sure, okay, I’m out of here, and then blood comes out of the windows and the house says “WAIT I WAS HAVING A BAD DAY” and you walk back in the house and it says “BECAUSE YOU’RE UGLY” and bees come out of the ceiling, and you leave again and the house is like “NOOOOOO WAS IT THE BEES? I FILLED THE BATHTUB WITH FLOWERS” and you get in the bathtub and the house is like “FLOWERS MADE OF DESPAIR HA HA HA.” Abusive relationships: they are this dumb (in retrospect).  

I don’t think there is a language that expresses “I don’t like you” more clearly than the one abusers all seem to share, and yet, when it hits our ears, that “I don’t like you” somehow turns into “I can’t leave or they would be sad.” Even though they can’t seem to stand you, and have told you so, repeatedly. Because maybe we did something to make them not like us? And that somehow means we’re obligated to hang out with somebody who doesn’t like us? Until they like us again? Even though they seem to hate every fundamental part of our personality? And yet they don’t want us to leave, even though they hate us fundamentally? Because that makes sense, right, all the time I am hanging out with people that I hate, and feeling sad if they are not around to annoy me. No. The house wants you to leave. It is full of bees. If it didn’t want you to leave, it wouldn’t be full of bees. It would be full of you.”

"DAE find it kind of addictive to be on this subreddit because it's the first time in their life to be a part of something, to be heard and to have an identity?",770,givgqr,50,"I purposely used the word addictive, not because I want to say that this community is bad for me oe anyone being here. Hell no. This community is amazing, I love this subreddit, the culture here, the compassion that internet strangers share with each other, it's honestly amazing and helped me a lot.

I just realized for me, that I kind of.. Depend on it too much? It's like..I feel so understood here, I don't talk to my friends and family anymore. I don't talk to my therapist about this. I am trying to be more open with them again but it's hard to put into words all the realizations I have had here. Kind of strange, isn't it? Again I am not saying this subreddit is bad in any way. I just feel like I developed an unhealthy relationship to being in this community. I am using it as a coping mechanism, using it too much, just as I use to do everything helpful too much until it becomes unhealthy. I do the same thing with my friends and family, which is why usually I isolate myself from them because I don't want to hurt or lose them. DAE feel similar?"
I just bought my inner child my most painfully lost toy,770,evzona,130,"Cleaning and tidying have always been shameful for me.  Cleaning only happened all at once at our house because company was coming, so it was always rushed and stressful, and my parents were always angry while it happened.   It was something you did so that people didn't think badly of you, and always, always terrifying.  Sometimes, I would hide rather than face it all.  I still can't clean when anyone else is around for fear they will yell at me for not moving fast enough or not doing it right.  

Bedroims was almost never included in that rush to make everything appear perfect, because company never really went to those rooms.  So, if my parents told me to clean my room, it felt random and like there was no good reason to do it.  But, if I didn't do it quickly enough for their tastes, they would throw everything on the floor in garbage bags to donate to the thrift store so ""some kid who would actually appreciate them could have them""--i.e., all the things I used and played with the most.  Sometimes, they would let me pull one item back out, but not always.  I must have been in kindergarten or first grade when the things they threw out included my huge, super squishy, beloved stuffed Feivel from the movie ""An American Tail."" I was devestated.  I'd had him as long as I could remember (the toy was released when I was a toddler), and I'd always been very careful to take good care of him and make sure his velvety hat stayed attached so it didn't get lost, and his belt was always tightly knotted so it stayed in place.  He'd even been where he belonged, but got swept up with everything else.  Thirty-ish years later, I still regularly think about him and how much it hurt to have him tossed out and how I begged to have him back.  I don't remember ever making that kind of fuss about anything before or after, because big emotions either embarrassed my parents or irritated them, but Feivel was worth getting in even more trouble for.

As an adult who works with children that age, I can see how inappropriate my parents' behavior was.  Where they could have developed/taught me good habits for taking care of my things and environment, they taught fear and deep shame, and where they could have gently but firmly corrected my less-than-perfect behavior, they took away something really important with the intent to hurt me and told me it was my own fault and that I deserved it.

Today, it popped into my head that eBay is a thing.  And Feivel is coming back to me, hat still carefully attached, belt knotted snugly.  That little girl in me is sobbing with relief, even after so long, and even as a grown-up, my hands are shaking and my chest aches.  I think it's mostly a good feeling, even even I do feel a bit sick that I'm dating to defy my parents like this.  (Yes, I know that's a bit ridiculous, being in my mid-thirties.)

This isn't any big thing, I know.  It's just a tiny part of how my family taught me I am (was?  I'm getting toward was) fundamentally useless; it wasn't really an important incident in the grand scheme of things.  But it's the first concrete thing I've ever done for my inner child, and that I think is good.

This is Feivel: https://imgur.com/a/MT5qhTD"
Today one of my nine year old students was being very insecure in my zoom chat and it was so incredibly painful,771,lysky6,89,"She was expressing that she thought she was talking too much about a thing she likes- it was during a “hangout” zoom I hold every Friday for the virtual students- assuming her friends were ignoring/avoiding her, when really there was just a lot going on. 

I became so worried so fast. I had the other kids popcorn read some Seuss and moved her into a separate breakout room the second I had the chance. The second I had her in there I started with “Student, you are a beautiful, wonderful person. You’re a very good friend and a lot of fun, and your friends really like you. It’s ok to be a little annoying sometimes, but a good friend will tell you nicely if they want to talk about something else, and it doesn’t mean they’re mad at you. They’ll still love you, because you’re really great, ok?”

She only responded with a few “Ok”s and “Yeah”s as I asked her a few times if she was ok before returning us both to the main session. 

This poor girl, I think I gave her a bit of a shock. She was kind of quiet... I worried she thought she was in trouble because she had this sort of faraway look on her face, almost like she was struggling not to cry, but now I’m thinking it’s more likely because she didn’t believe me, either actively ie “old lady doesn’t know what she’s talking about” or inactively ie “she’s right but i feel like she’s wrong”. 

So now I’m over here panicking that I’ve done more damage. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"

"As a gift to my inner child, I am going to read Harry Potter for the first time tomorrow",769,dbr050,102,"Harry Potter was one of the books I was deeply interested in reading in the 3rd grade, but my mom wouldn’t allow it because of the “witchcraft content.” I have come to realize that my mom’s demands stemmed from an authoritarian mindset rather than a caring one. I am honestly done feeling upset every time I am reminded that I missed out on the Harry Potter universe whenever I see references made in pop culture that I do not understand. 

If my mom truly had her child’s best interests at heart and wanted to raise me with true Christian morality and grace, she wouldn’t have allowed my stepdad to touch me inappropriately in front of her. She would have taught me to love Jesus, rather than just listing and naming random things out of the Bible as sins in order to shame whatever action I had done to annoy her that day. 

Honestly, a children’s book about wizards should have been at the bottom of that woman’s list. 

I will be starting Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone tomorrow as a self-care gift to myself. I honestly can’t wait.

My parents threatened to sue me for libel because I spoke up about their abuse on my private account.,769,l5ph29,83,"On my old Facebook account I was connected with a friend of my family's who lived a few blocks down from my childhood home. I started retelling stories and instances of abuse I experienced while growing up (all on private, friend's only view that my parents didn't have access to see). 

This family friend saw me post about my abusive family and was shocked because she didn't know about that side of my parents (of course not, my parents always put on a facade when around others). She discussed it with them (without telling me) and I immediately got a ranting, raving, scathing phone call from my parents telling me to stop posting ""libel"". They even threatened me with legal action because of the ""libel"". 

Of course I was shocked and frightened. I thought this was something they could actually act upon so I deleted my account, even though I was a legal adult living away from them at this point. I talked to my counselor about this and she said my parents were intimidating me and they would never be able to win any kind of legal battle in regards to their child detailing past abuse carried out by them. She told me they did this to themselves and if they didn't like their kid talking about abuse then maybe they shouldn't have abused me."

Healing is tougher. But I’ve noticed that as I continue with therapy, and I continue to process my trauma, the way I behave and react in my nightmares has completely changed. 

Before, when a nightmare involved my father, I’d scream, freeze, or try to run away. In my nightmares, I allowed my father to abuse me and I’d take the abuse without fighting back. 

Last night, I had another nightmare with my father. And this time, I FOUGHT BACK. He came at me, screaming, threatening to “tear me to pieces” and I pepper sprayed him. I punched him. I kicked him down to the ground. 

I woke up and I wasn’t shaking. I wasn’t scared. I wasn’t screaming. I felt angry, a really intense anger, but I also felt proud of myself for standing up to him and fighting back.

Medical professionals treating suicidal teens...pls don't say this kind of thing any more.,761,f3ftwn,126,"This memory has just been on my mind a lot recently and to air it out, to release some anger, I thought coming here may work.

&#x200B;

When I was a young teen I'd tried suicide several times already, had suicidal feelings earlier, before ten....yikes, though not always aware it was suicidal behavior until my teens. Many times I tried in secret, no result, playing it off as being sick. But one time that I did land in the hospital, the doctor came around to my room to explain to me. I was alone, my parental figures liked to punish me by not hanging out longer than was absolutely necessary, i.e. because you were suicidal again we're not going to visit you or hang in the hospital with you, you're on your own in there so deal. We have better things to do that don't involve supporting you.

&#x200B;

This doctor looked me right in the face and said: ""Stop being such a drama queen. You need to knock this stuff off, stop looking for attention. Your father cares about you so much, he talks about you all the time. You don't need to do this for his attention.""

&#x200B;

What he knew? What my father, who knew him, told him about me and our relationship.

&#x200B;

What he didn't know...The reason I was trying so hard to die. A lifetime of sexual, physical, emotional, confinement, isolation, bullying, verbal abuse. Multiple involved, but my father...the main perpetrator. Committed most to all of these, repeatedly.

&#x200B;

So when I was asked by social workers, are you being abused...obviously no. I'd let my father listen in, listening for me to tell anyone too much then leave me alone again, when I shouldn't, when I needed to be alone and divulge. Not that I could, as amnesia blocked most of the worst memories. I developed a toxic enmeshment to him and the way we lived that would last until my mid 20's. A toxic attachment. A desperation for his approval and validation, no matter how he'd treat me. I kept feeling an urge to leave but would go back like a toxic relationship. Sometimes I felt in love with him, incest. Feeling alone without him ruling over me. Serve as a sort of household servant figure. Let the toxic romantic or sexual vibes continue.

&#x200B;

I didn't move out until mid 20s. I didn't remember the worst child sexual abuse, most by him, through the amnesia and dissociation when it'd pop up...until this year. 20 fucking 20. It had a lot to do with moving out, cutting contact with my family. Wondering if I was the one being cruel, if I was being called a terrible daughter and that would be correct. Wondering if I would survive on my own or should go crawling back again. A suicide attempt late 2019, that seemed to open the gate to some memories.

&#x200B;

Anyway, medical staff. Please don't be assholes to suicidal teens no matter how many times they've showed up in your er. Even if it is ""attention-seeking"" self harm or suicide attempt, probably a reason they need the attention. Just...don't do that. Thanks."
Does anyone else have childish-like urges?,766,e1fbrh,106,"EDIT: I didn’t expect so many upvotes and responses! I feel so understood. I wish we could all run around on a huge field, jump in puddles, make pillow forts and tell each other ghost stories! 


Not as creepy as it perhaps sounds, but I was wondering if anyone here has childish-like urges? It may be more common with those who were traumatised at a young age. 

Sometimes I just want to run through a field of flowers. I want to curl up on somebody’s lap and be held. I want to be in somebody’s arms. I want to be silly without fearing that I’m annoying the other person. I want to draw and scribble. I want to fall asleep on someone’s lap and be carried to bed. I just want that feeling of safety and security that I didn’t have when I was a child.


Another question: do you think that maybe incorporating child-like past-times like colouring, fun exercise etc, and just being able to express freely what we think and feel, into therapy would be beneficial? It may already have been done, I’m unsure."
"""You aren't your usual cheery self""",764,d98a4b,74,"Yes because I'm no longer a people pleasing doormat bitch. I actually listen to my emotions and do things that are good for me. If I don't like something, I walk away. If someone is toxic, I walk away. Yes, I'm no longer cheery to you because I know longer am settling for your bullshit, now I'm doing what is best for me first and only giving my attention to people that deserve it."
i did it.,760,gu67zo,55,i just fucking did it. i stood up for myself. i didn’t stoop to their level and harass and berate them. i was respectful. i was mature. and i am fucking proud of myself. i’m literally shaking and this is the most stressful thing i have ever done but i don’t fucking care lol. i did it.
Just broke up with someone and so proud of myself,760,ltybi4,83,"I just turned 38 last week and have dated this guy, who I met online for 4 weeks now. In this timeframe I´ve seen a few things, that made me think but since I  have a fixer-personality, I thought I could help. Well today he really showed me that side of himself, which I only saw glimpses of before and I ended it. I did not excuse it, although he apologized. I did not try to help with his negative feelings - I even started the conversation about his behaviour, because he would not. And it ended because I ended it.

&#x200B;

I am a little sad but not heartbroken or anything. And I am damn proud of myself. So many of my past relationships started in a similar manner and I just excused red flags or tried to help the guy. Not anymore. I´m rather alone than having to deal with an adult temper tantrum. No, no thank you very much. I am so happy, that I have made it to this point. That I know my selfworth and I am not willing to compromise my wellbeing for someone elses. It took me roughly 20 years but I did it. Yay me :D"

Is anyone else simultaneously terrified of other people while also desperately seeking meaningful interpersonal connections?,758,dngcv3,88,"This tension is tearing me up inside. I live in a big city and as I see hundreds of strangers every day, whether it's commuting, downtown, running errands, whatever. I constantly feel like I'm in this bubble unto myself, just floating around the city, completely disconnected from everyone around me. I think this causes me to feel incredibly lonely and isolated, which I have difficulty coping with at times. Some days, I want to strike up a conversation with a stranger, maybe on the train, or at sitting on the stool next to me at lunch - just to have a pleasant interaction with another person, even for 15 minutes. But I don't want to come off like a weirdo :(

In contrast, other people also scare the shit out of me. My view of mankind has plummeted since I started experiencing CPTSD symptoms, and I have truly come to believe that people are evil and ill-willed towards others by default, and only some of us actually overcome that, while the rest are just (somewhat) held in check by laws and social norms. If a stranger does approach me in public, I am IMMEDIATELY in defense mode.

This constant contradiction has probably been one of the most taxing experiences of CPTSD for me, so far."

Reasons to keep going,757,c37r8p,107,
I just realized I've never felt protected and I don't think I ever will,754,l97sg6,62,"I'm not sure what made me have this epiphany but I never felt protected. Is that something children are supposed to grow up with? This idea that if they feel scared they have someone they can go to. Someone to protect them and keep them safe, make everything better. I never had that, I was usually scared of my parents. No matter what was happening in my childhood there was always this sense of fear and apprehension. It never went away. I always had a reason to be afraid. Even as an adult it persists. And I do my best to try to turn off the hyper vigilence or remind myself I'm muscle armoring without realizing it. And I've done a good job of making my body strong. I'm not that weak little boy anymore that can get held down against his will. That can only stiffen.

Now as an adult I'm the strong one. And I'm proud that I don't abuse it. I don't raise my voice and yell. I don't scare or intimidate people, instead I'm gentle and kind. These things make me happy. But I realized I'll never get to feel protected by someone else. Deep down I still feel like a little boy inside but now I'm too big to be protected. I guess I'm just sad that I missed that. I want someone to protect me too."
"I know that I was abused, but I still can't bring up any good examples of it happening?",753,f745th,172,"Hey folks,

My boyfriend recently introduced me to Bojack Horseman, and we were watching the episode where Diane tries to write about her trauma.

The part that hit home was when her abusive father asks ""What's ONE good example of me abusing you?"" and her having no real answers, even though she _knows_ it happened. I feel the same way. Trauma has a feeling and it's very apparent when I'm triggered. 

When I start to question myself, I think of all the emotional flashbacks I get-- surely those are the _result_ of something, right?

I dunno, I'm kinda spitballing at this point. DAE?"

"DAE: Having a good time and feeling pretty confident in the moment when meeting new people; afterwards shame, embarrassment, and anxiety creep in?",755,f5ztam,58,"It’s really frustrating... The second guessing and the shame tend to ruin how I feel about the whole experience, even if I was enjoying myself in the moment.

I’m not sure how or where to start working on this. I don’t really have issues with confidence and I like myself just fine. I don’t usually worry or even think about these things in the moment, I just focus on the people and the convos etc. 

Yet these feelings that come after are kind of signalling the opposite of “I like myself and I’m confident”? They’re saying: I was being embarrassing and weird, what was I thinking, they must’ve felt so awkward with this thing that I said... All the good stuff lol.

Is it a “delayed” confidence issue, or some kind of other emotional reaction/flashback? 

Anyone else dealing with something like this? Would love to hear your experiences, maybe this will start making more sense.

EDIT: Thanks everyone for the replies. It’s really helping to hear your experiences and, once again, to know that there’s a place where I don’t feel so alone with these messy reactions and feelings. Thank you for the support and sharing your thoughts on this."

Feels like I'm always anticipating fights with strangers,747,hwuf8k,67,"Once I leave the house I no longer feel safe. I've noticed that I expect people to be hostile. I'm always scanning to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong or anything that anyone could yell at me or start a fight with me over. 

Sometimes when people approach me or start speaking to me my fight or flight is instantly set off. And occasionally I will hear a normal tone or see a look from someone and I instantly interpret it as hostile and I feel panicked and get very angry. Luckily I dont usually let it show and I quickly rationalize the situation.. 

When driving I feel that almost everyone else is either annoyed with me, or trying to bully me. I know it's not rational but it doesn't change the feeling of anxiety for some reason. 

I've also noticed that if I'm not alone in my room, I'm fantasizing about being there. I have my little space and it's the only place I feel safe. I used to beat myself up for not being social enough. But I'm fine with it and accept that I'm a homebody and really only like to be by my self or with my boyfriend and dog. 

I don't mean to ramble. I just wanted to speak on some of my thoughts, and hope someone else can relate. Any insights or advice are greatly appreciated. I'm grateful for y'all ✌"
Simultaneously neglectful + controlling parents = CPTSD,753,apvb88,158,"That's one of the formulas y'all. I don't know how many can relate but I woke up this morning and I felt like Einstein having figured out that E = mc^(2).

Although I've been knowing this intellectually, I truly feel it today.

In a nutshell, CPTSD makes me an inverted individual, if that makes sense: my yin is my yang, and my yang is my yin. My parents neglected me on things they should've taken more part in, and controlled me on things they should've been more neglectful of.

This means my internal/cognitive arrangement is opposite of what it should be.

It's fucked up. Please tell me I'm not the only one.

Today is my 44th birthday,750,hyfy03,59,"When I was 20, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

When I was 31, I moved back to my childhood home after failing at college *again*. 

When I was 38, a series of events forced me to question who I was, and why everything in my life always turned to chaos. 

When I was 39, I began to challenge my nearly two-decade-old bipolar diagnosis.

When I was 40, I switched therapists and found one that helped me be more honest with myself. I also joined a book club, the first healthy social interaction I'd had since moving back. 

When I was 41, I began researching codependency. I joined CODA and found a group of people I could finally relate to. I helped found a community band.

When I was 42, I came across a reddit post that referenced CPTSD. r/cptsd then changed my life. I began seeing a trauma-informed therapist. I joined a nationally competitive all-volunteer concert band. 

When I was 43, I bought my own home. 

I have no idea what 44 holds in store. I was doing great before (gestures broadly) all of *this*. Now I've slipped back into survival mode and I fear the consequences of my isolation but don't feel safe interacting with my community. It's like high school all over again, but with a higher chance of death. 

What a weird time to be alive and recovering. Here's to us all, may we make it through another year.

Edited to add: Thank you all for the birthday wishes and messages of strength and hope.  <3"
Normal parenting compared to your childhood. What a gut punch.,753,eg9jtr,167,"DAE sort of get yourself into a state of thinking that maybe the stuff you went through with your parent(s) wasn’t really that bad or you’re just focusing on the negative because you also have positive memories, because it wasn’t *complete* hell, and then run into an example of healthy parenting and realize that it’s just utterly foreign? And that realization clenches your heart and punches you in the gut. 

There’s a post a few friends shared on Facebook from a parenting page called Play At Home Mom that talks about how to have a positive teaching moment when a child accidentally breaks something. How to instill trust in the child so they feel safe. It was so patient, so calm, and so KIND that it was unreal compared to my childhood experiences. 

And the comments on the post are all in the same vein - so many parents being nurturing and just... being PARENTS. And it’s that feeling of “is this what’s normal? Are parents really like this? Holy shit mine really wasn’t normal”."
Since when do I heed my own advice though?,749,bgz1f8,20,
Stupid sh*t I had to deal with growing up...,748,hj9oje,107,"Once my family was eating pizza in the living room. I had just come back from running errands, and went into the kitchen to grab a plate. A fu*king plate. 

I opened up the dish washer, grabbed a clean plate, when suddenly my dad was standing next to me (drunk). 

Dad: “Why are you grabbing a plate from the dish washer? There are plenty of plates in the cabinets,” he said with fire, beer in his breath. 

Me: “I just washed the dishes. I didn’t know it would matter.” 

Dad: “THAT DOESNT MAKE ANY SENSE!!” 

Me: Sorry...

I couldn’t do anything right in his eyes. I was always walking on eggshells. I couldn’t even grab a plate without it being a chance for me to be attacked. 

I’m doing the tough, brave inner work to un-do so much damage caused by my parents. It’s been the hardest work of my life. But the most rewarding. 

To all of the scape goats, black sheep, neglected children out there.... stop abusing yourselves. You’ve been abused enough already. A new life is there for you. It takes a f**k ton of work and time, but it’s out there for you. 

Sending you love ❤️

EDIT: ** Wow, I’m blown away at all the stories you’ve shared. I’m sorry you’ve suffered, too. Living with Cptsd feels like the most isolating experience, and I hope all these stories illustrates you’re DEFINITELY not alone. There’s nothing wrong with you. You all are deserving of so much love and compassion. Xoxo xoxo"

Noticing bad parents is ruining some of my favorite movies,744,mj9lxb,155,"I’m wondering if other people have the same issues when they start getting help for CPSTD or emotional neglect.

Yesterday I had The Secret Garden (1993 version) playing while I was doing housework, which had been one of my favorite books/movies growing up.

But as I was watching it, I started to become so irrationally angry and felt real hatred towards the father in the movie.

Your wife died, so you were so “hurt” and “afraid to love your son because you had suffered to much already” so you didn’t interact with him at all for ten years? You let him stay in bed and so he never learned to walk? He never went outside once? He never had a friend his own age, or any other companion? You were just going to let him live his life in his bed without ever looking into it?

Then you got custody of your niece who lost both her parents, saw her once, and took off?

He is presented as a tragic figure and forgiven at the end, but all I could thing was wow, you are a shit person and shit parent, and so self centered and selfish.

As I work through these things I hope that this mellows out somewhat... I don’t know. It feels like wasted energy to be angry at a movie but I feel like I’m noticing this stuff everywhere lately.

Edit: wow, such interesting responses and discussions, thanks you guys! So thankful there is a forum like this to talk about and think through/feel these thoughts and emotions with people that understand and have such insightful perspectives too"
"I endure life rather than live it. It makes me feel so strange, like I am a cardboard cutout instead of an actual person.",746,makcgv,53,"I just want to write this down, to get it out of my head. I have many friends, I am considered a super bubbly outgoing - somewhat awkward and weird, but 'hey thats just Uilie!' - kind of person. Always down to join in whatever fun people are having. However, inside I feel like absolute hell. Sometimes even wishing to go suddenly blind or stabbing my eyes out, as I experience an intense amount of stress by just being looked at. And since I have a pretty intense social life - I am being looked at a lot. Their gaze means I have to perform, I have to be the court jester, their gaze means it is up to me to figure out what kind of performance they want and act accordingly. Are they up for comedy, drama or should I act out a surrealistic plot? 

When I am on a social outing, I always endure it rather than have fun. My inner critic is always (negatively) assessing my behavior. There is so much going on in my head, I feel like I am going mad. ""That was a weird look you just gave."", ""You're not acting happy enough."", ""Why are you always playing with your hair? They're gonna know you're trying to hide your face."", ""They know you're just pretending to casually rest your arm on the table, don't think you can fool anyone!""

Since I am just a side character in the lives of my friends, I try to avoid talking about myself. When I am being asked a personal question I completely freak out internally. I also don't trust these questions, I always think they're not genuinely interested in me, but they're out to get me. To make me trip up. To reveal some of this inner mess and shame I am feeling. Which in turn make me feel extremely guilty, since that is not how you're supposed to treat friends.

I don't really know what I want with this post. Just wanted to get it out of my head. I guess I need to start saying no more often. But how can I know if I really don't want to be social? How do I know when I really want to do things? I don't even know what I want? How do you figure this out? How can you feel your true wants, wishes and desires?  


I did read Peter Walker and it gave me tremendous insight in my own thought processes. Currently reading The Drama of the Gifted Child."
I HATE being called out for my shyness/quietness,743,l6hy1n,58,"It's very hard for me to get up enough emotional energy to spend time with others. I pass on a lot of social events (especially ones where there is a lot of people). When I do go see people in a group setting, I typically listen to others and don't talk a lot (but i also don't just remain silent, I just don't typically start conversations). 

I absolutely hate it when someone calls me out and says ""why are you so quiet, don't you like us?"" Or something similar, almost always worded in a way that makes me seem like I'm doing something wrong/mean. I hate being put on the spot, especially if it is in a negative way. I am talking as much as I can with my limited social energy. 

My close friends know how much of a struggle it is for me to just see people in general so they don't do this. But when this kind of thing happens it just makes me not want to go be social at all. I can't be criticized if I stay home. I know socializing is good for me but my mood can turn on a dime from comments made by others. 

My last 2 social gatherings (besides 1 on 1 gatherings) have ended with me feeling negatively, based on things that were said towards me... But most people don't understand why those triggering things effect me so much. You guys will, I hope."

Why is it uncomfortable for some trauma survivors to receive help or attention?,746,lsg6vf,156,"I've read this somewhere on the internet and cant find it anymore. 

Why is it so alarmingly uncomfortable to receive help for trauma and abuse survivors?

I had a friend point blank ask me, ""how can we make sure this space is all about you? What do you need from us?""

And i was surprised to witness the sequence that it sparked of really uncomfortable physiological responses in my body, i almost became mute and found it very difficult to formulate thoughts or words. 

I almost wanted to yell at her, get angry at her, tell her to go away. All i could muster was, ""i dont know..."" and then distracted my way out of it with distraction, change the subject, get back into intellectualizing the whole thing. 

It made me really sad though because I wished I knew the answer. It made me really bad because I didn't know the answer. I felt dumb and stupid for not being able to communicate it and hated my self for the strange reaction I had."

Ironically, I can't even imagine how unbelievably terrified I must've been. I'm quite amazed that I didn't literally die from abandonment and fear. No, I suppose life's not exactly merciful-enough for that, given the fact that I still had another 14 years of that exact repeated scenario to look forward to.

In a way I just can't believe it even happened; it's so ridiculously-evil that you'd expect some intervening miracle to have rescued me. And in a way, I can totally believe it happened, because nobody gave a damn about me anyway. I'd say ""I must've slipped through the cracks"" but it seemed that even my entire school were content with watching me be bullied out of my sanity, and to rub salt in the wound they'd all crack down on me whenever I acted out."
"Someone hurtful can care all the way to the ends of the earth, but if they don't care enough to acknowledge mistakes, apologize, and commit to changing, then it's not caring.",742,e3puhw,88,"For example: I, too, care about dogs, but I am not willing to change my lifestyle for a dog, so I wouldn't get a dog. And I wouldn't say that I would be good at taking care of a dog. Don't get me wrong, I love them soooooo much. But I wouldn't take good care of one.

Yes, it is possible to care a ton about something but not be caring enough to make any changes to myself or my life for that thing.

Am I sad I can't have a dog? Yeah, I am. I really want one. But am I going to change myself or my lifestyle for a dog? No. And it would irresponsible of me to get a dog.

I was thinking about this as I was thinking of my abusive mother, who I am 100% sure will be extremely upset when it finally sinks in that I am not coming back. She will cry. She will breakdown. But will she do *ANYTHING* to even acknowledge the hurt she has caused? No. Will she apologise? No. Will she commit to stopping the hurtful actions and changing for the better? No.

So no, I am not coming back. She has made her bed, now she has to lie in it."

Not directly, but I was obviously an easy target. Maybe they were trying to help me.. idk. I’d get very defensive over tiny comments too because I was so insecure so it was both parities at fault here because of lovely cptsd!! Anyway lol this year I’m so much more aware and have been actively looking after my mental health and healing and they’re treating me better. I don’t hear attacks anymore, just normal banter / conversation. I’ve asserted boundaries, I know what’s good for me.. basically I just know myself so much more. But it got me thinking, there’s one friend in particular who used to take advantage of this a bit. He’d ask for favours he wouldn’t return, and do little things like that here and there. Me and this guy are super close he’s like a bother to me but I guess it just sucks realising how mistreated you were due to your mental health. How do I not hold resentment because of this?"
"As I'm healing, I understand the phrase ""healthy people attract other healthy people"" more and more.",734,hz34ia,67,"I met up with an old high school friend two weeks ago and I've been ruminating on the experience for some time.

Her and I were friends because we were both shy, quiet people pleasers. We were ""non-threatening"" to each other when our outgoing, ambitious, or self-confident peers were threatening and scary. Two weeks ago, we decided to catch up for old times' sake and got takeout that we brought to a local park. Before we went to the restaurant, I had to go to the bank to settle an issue with my account and she said she'd come along. 

We get to the bank and as I'm standing in front of the teller area, my elbow accidentally hits a stand holding business cards and knocks it over. I didn't think much of it and cracked a joke about my clumsiness to the teller as I cleaned up the mess and put everything back the way it was. The teller laughs as she tells me it happens all the time and how she should put the business cards somewhere less dangerous. It was all fine. Then I turn to my friend and notice she's extremely tense. My friend starts saying how it was bad for me to knock it over and to be more careful because virus, with no ounce of lightheartedness. The teller responds in good spirits albeit slightly uncomfortable to say it was no problem at all, just an accident. I brushed the whole thing off in the moment and continued the day. 

I know it's not a big deal but I've been reflecting on the incident. Looking back, I have a few thoughts:

* **My best guess is she was fawning and freezing in the presence of ""strangers"".** She fawns and freezes around me too, but as soon as someone posing a larger threat is there like strangers, she'll fawn and freeze to them at my expense. I don't have excess shame around others anymore and moved past most of my own shame, so I don't identify with feeling ashamed over knocking over business cards by accident in front of others whatsoever. So, in the moment, I was confused as to why this was an issue to her. This drove the point home that not many negative things others say about you is personal, it's more about their own experiences in one way or another. 

* She continued to be in a state of excessive self-consciousness. After the picnic was over, I couldn't remember a single opinion or thought she shared that stood out. Everything was a minor response to things I brought up that she just went with. She also went quiet when others passed by. **She was afraid to leave any mark for fear of danger. She was afraid to be seen.** 

* **When I used to fawn or freeze as my primary responses, I thought it would make people like me more. Now, I see with full clarity how flawed that logic is.** If you have shame and negative emotions directed towards yourself, it *will* project itself onto others. When my friend fawned to the teller because she believed the teller was disapproving of my actions, she didn't make the teller think she was on the teller's side or empathetic as she intended. She instead became another source of negativity and threat of attack to both me and the teller in fixing a situation that wasn't broken. She wasn't able to joke or laugh or read the mood. Had she called me out (because yes it wasn't ideal for me to touch all the business cards with my fingers when corona's going around) but instead had a direct and open tone, that would've not made an issue. But she made everyone feel awkward and negative just by way of her tone and shame infecting everyone. That must've been how the healthy, confident kids in high school saw us and felt when they were around us back then.

Anyone else always feel like they're in trouble,739,j5dy9o,65,"I feel when I am relaxing, or sitting in my apartment my dads going to come in and kick my bed, or bang on my door saying no more naps.  or my mom wondering what I am doing, and criticizing me for not being overly, unnecessarily busy like her, and that I need to always be on the fucking on the ball 247.

 I talked to my friends, and I can stay here for as long as I need. I also called my job, and I will be able to take a week off for my mental health, and it will not impact my future employment. Once again, thank you all so much for the support, it means a lot."
“you can’t love someone til you love yourself” makes me wanna be sick,732,iju4iw,166,"I believe we can fall in love when we’re most vulnerable, not when we’re most happy.

It turns out I'm a person.,733,dc4ywp,32,"I wasn't raised to be a person. Or a member of society. Or to be anyone substantial. 

I was raised to be an object. An archaic, wrong idea of what a woman should be. I was raised to be used and abused. I was raised to suffer.

I am 27 years old and life is excruciating. I am not a fucking object. I am *tired* of fighting myself every goddamn day to remember to engage coping skills or just basic fucking kindness.

Today, I am accepting that my parents were wrong. I'm not an object. I didn't deserve the childhood I had nor do I deserve the results from it. I am accepting that I have to deal with the results of my abuse regardless of justice. I am choosing to accept the responsibility of recovery because I am a person who deserves to heal, not an object to be mistreated.

I'm not an object to be mistreated - how amazing is that?

What trying to recover from trauma feels like,726,brys0z,41,
"Sorry, that is private.",731,gx4v6q,73,"I willingly share my trauma with people. It gives context to why I am such a neurotic mess. But ask me about my passions? What I feel strongly about? Little things I like?

Sorry, that's private.

I don't want anyone mocking what makes my heart beat. It doesn't feel safe. Every time I liked something as a minor, it was taken from me, or I was mocked or beaten for it. It scalded my soft spirit, made me callous.

My coping mechanism for this went wonky. People *want* to know what makes me happy, what makes me smile. They aren't going to yell at me for singing, they aren't going to snicker about my passion for language and expression. They won't look down on me for liking ""nerdy"" things.

Just like I can't lose my cats, I can't lose my interests. I won't be berated and beaten for liking things.

I wish I could have my dam tried for the war crimes she perpetrated on me. But that won't happen. All I can do is move forward.

And keep singing, of course."
Someone mentioned meditation and I realised I can't imagine a safe place and that's why I don't like it,732,gjsqmu,227,"I used to do yoga a few years ago, but felt like I just faked the relax/meditation part because I couldn't imagine that nice lovely place the instructor asked us to think about.

I'm never going to put other people above my own value ever again.,729,himky0,60,Literally never again. I have value. I am worthy. I deserve. I am not going to bow to someone else's claim to superiority again. I've learned about these people. They know how to talk the talk but damn are they completely empty and bankrupt inside.

Nothing.
"I just realized I have almost no childhood memories. And the memories I do have either took place at school, or are negative.",730,gosh8u,66,"I’ve (23F) been reading a lot of posts on this subreddit about people that can’t remember anything from their childhood. I found that interesting and wondered if the same thing applied to me, so I started thinking about my childhood.

And guess what? I can’t remember 99% of it. I have a couple of random memories here and there, but they mostly took place at school. 

I have more family memories from high school, but they’re basically all negative. Memories of my parents fighting, my mom screaming at me. Driving to random parking lots and sitting in the car just to get away. 

It’s almost like I didn’t even exist until high school. I just can’t remember anything, and I’m sure it’s for the best, but it still makes me sad—especially when I hear other people talk about their childhood memories or fun home videos.

I guess I just don’t have anything very positive to remember about my childhood."
The truth abusers don't want to hear,726,cgqlrs,45,
"Listen to the negative thoughts in your head, just like you would listen to someone venting to you.",733,iaddd3,56,"I had this amazing breakthrough in dealing with irrational and useless negative thoughts, feelings and emotions.

If someone else is venting to you about feeling horrible, you wouldn't agree with them and say they deserve to feel that way. Nor would you interrogate them and ask why they are feeling that way. Nor would you try to fix their problem by offering solutions. Nor would you say anything to reinforce what they're thinking. You would simply give them a gentle ear - listen to what they are saying and say 'That sucks'.

Now replace that someone else with your own brain.

This has been very useful for me, for example, when I'm stressed out about something at college or worried about getting the coronavirus. Now, instead of procrastinating/dissociating/trying to investigate why I'm feeling weird stuff like that, I just sit with it for a while, let myself feel the emotion completely and then I just let it go.

I know this is just a fancy way to explain mindfulness, but I've never considered respecting my own emotions the same way I would validate someone else's. I have this tendency to always get to the root of every bad thing I feel because I feel like I shouldn't feel that way, and I realized how self-invalidating that is and how I wouldn't do that to someone else. Now I think I feel like I can validate my own emotions.

I exercised my boundaries with a friend successfully!,733,m4a89a,36,"I have a friend that has recently left her abusive husband and came to stay with me temporarily. She's more of a work friend, we've only hung out once before in the 3 years I've worked with her, but we talk a lot and get along for the most part. The most divisive ""opinions"" we hold from each other are racism (she holds prejudices but says they're ""facts"", I don't... And she believes the pandemic is being so overblown in order to control and scare us, and that it's not worse than the flu, and I take science and health seriously.)  



I've known she doesn't wear a mask around the office like ever, but i told her I'd need to her do coronavirus precautions if she's coming to stay here. She agreed, so all was well. She had been staying with me for 3 days when she told me that she was going the following weekend to see her long distance high-school sweetheart who she's rekindled a romance with. Now... that doesn't sound like she'll be wearing a mask or keeping 6 ft of distance between them, and ultimately worries me for my safety since I'm high risk. I spoke with her the day after she told me about this trip and told her I wasn't comfortable with the trip while she's staying here, so I asked her to make sure she wears a mask around others and physically distance, and if she's unable to do those precautions, then to quarantine herself elsewhere until she can test negative for the virus. She agreed right away, didn't have an issue with it, but did say ""this is your home, and I don't have anywhere else to stay so I have no choice."" and it ended well!  
 
I was so nervous to exercise my boundaries because all throughout my life my boundaries had been tested and pushed by people in my life. I was having major anxiety about this but it ended well! 
 
 
In the end, two days later, she ended up finding another place to stay. She guised it as being concerned for my safety since she has some activities coming up that would put me at risk, but I know it's really because she doesn't want to wear a mask or physically distance because she doesn't believe the virus is an actual issue. Either way, I'm safe because I exercised my boundaries and didn't waver just because having the conversation is uncomfortable. I also get my home back and can walk around in whatever clothing I want, lol.  
  

  
 
This is great practice for staying firm on my boundaries in the future, and I'm really proud of myself for being able to do this. I had my two best friends helping me work thru what I wanted to say to her and I'm so grateful for them."
big fuck u to the school councillor who told me it’s natural to feel afraid of your parents when they’re angry,731,gml1ws,63,"I was like 13 and it made me feel silly and invalid and for years afterwards I’d remember that and feel certain that I was overreacting, that this was normal, natural. anyway it wasn’t natural I just had shitty parents and that school counsellor wasn’t at my school very long. long enough to invalidate me tho hehe"
I need to be distracted all the time,726,glmqkj,93,"For the longest time I couldnt understand why Im spending so many hours on my phone. Now its quite obvious. 

I need to be distracted. I need to have songs playing constantly at high volume. I need something to trace with my eyes. I can never stop my mind from thinking. If I ever stop distracting myself, my mind gets dark. Really dark. Its overwhelming. 

I stopped playing the piano some time ago. I loved it (still do), but its not enough to distract me. I easily get lost in the music and my mind drifts to the dark place again. 

I feel like I need to face those emotions. Sure, its tough, but Im tired of living like this. I want to take back control of my own life. Im sick of letting my past intervene with my present and future. Starting tomorrow, Im limiting any possible distractions I can think of. Im going to play that piano, I dont care how many times I see their faces or hear their voices. I dont care how much its going to hurt me. Its high time I took action instead of simply talking about my problems.

Basically making me a too old / too young man-child. It’s really hard living like this and really confusing. Feeling that you are a loner but also being dépendant on your parents since you feel unsafe as a child, and being so dependent on them.

For example I had to rely on myself for most of my needs, but wasn’t allowed anything like the other child, making me afraid and really infantilized. Also never being asked for responsabilities or taught anything. I hate this manchild education."
Finally put my biggest abuser in prison yesterday,731,cw6rwr,145,"Additional trigger warnings: child sexual abuse, physical abuse, manipulation, murder attempt, gun and knife mention, drug mention

First so you can understand why this is the biggest most proud moment in my life I have to explain the abuse a little bit. My sister was not my first abuser but she inflicted the most trauma on me. It started when she used to cause me to have panic attacks by scaring me especially by telling me ghost stories and then hiding behind doors or under things and popping out to scare me knowing how anxious of a child I was. Then she started hitting me. She would hit me with sticks or her hands and once she hit me in the face with a broom. She also began manipulating me and gaslighting me convincing me I couldn’t trust myself or anyone else. She began telling me everyone hated me and that I should just die. Then when I was 10 the sexual abuse started. She would molest me as often as she could. I won’t go into much detail about this but it was the worst part of my life. She also convinced her now ex boyfriend to rape me from when I was 16 to when I was 18 and they broke up. I moved out shortly after.

That’s not where the story of her abuse ends tho. When I was staying at my parents house one night she attempted to molest me again this time while she had a knife (this was not the first time she threatened me with a knife) and my boyfriend encouraged me to call the cops which I did. She was arrested but when she got out on bail she found out where I lived and told me she was going to come get me. My boyfriend once again called the cops and she was found with a gun and enough heroin to kill me (I was at tge time a heroin addict, now I’m almost a year clean now!) she was arrested and this time she was put in jail with no bail. 

Now to my proudest moment: yesterday we finally went to court. I dissociated for most of it but I heard from my boyfriend that it went very quickly, much quicker than we all expected as the defense asked very few questions, and she got 90 years in prison without the possibility of parole! I couldn’t have done it without the endless support of my boyfriend and I am so proud of myself, my lawyer, and all those that supported me. I’m still processing it but I’m so happy and relieved. Thank you all for your endless support, you’re a great community and I appreciate it"

"Has anyone transferred their anger from their parents to capitalism, seeing it as the system that victimized your parents causing them to victimize you?",721,dkzgr3,189,"There's been a few articles I've seen about how capitalism and mental health relate, and I know everyone's trauma story is different - but just to share as data about me, I've personally been completely furious with capitalism. In my understanding of it, I've seen how it's screwed over my family for more than one generation. It just feels like the best place for my feelings to be used to make a difference. I can do recovery work, but I also would love to change the horrible system that's screwed up people's values. To me it's at least possible to change the system, while my parents and the relationship I had with them during my childhood is already what it is and will be. Sorry if too political for this sub. 


I don't like to say it, but I sometimes feel like I can't blame my parents entirely when the system is stacked against them as well. They could've made better choices as parents, but the government is my real oppressive parent making me siblings with my parents, metaphorically speaking. I feel like we are all victims together."

When my sister is stressed she is hyper critical and puts everyone around her down, but mostly me.

When my partner is stressed he grumps and scowls and carries on and yells.

It seems like no matter who I’m with, if I am remotely impolite, I get shut down if not attacked. Every time it happens I find it harder to actually express shit rather than direct it at hating myself. When anyone I love has a meltdown they’re rude and mean but I am supportive and don’t react. But if I’m at the end of my rope, making plans to hurt myself, I better be politely and without blame asking for help!"

I did it!!,718,i0me6l,50,"I developed a nasty heroin addiction at 16 largely due to trauma, got clean at 19, and later got a miracle job working in mental health. I stayed at that job for 2 years, enough time with health insurance to get on an antidepressant, pay all my debt, buy a car, raise my credit score from 400s to 700s, and save some money. The pandemic gave me some time to really focus on healing (emotionally and from endometriosis removal). My being the scapegoat and blowing everything up 5 years ago then getting myself better has helped to heal my familial interactions quite a bit as well. I could only heal so much near them, though, so I just moved out. I finally have my own apartment in a new city with my cat, everything I’ve ever wanted, after 24 years of hurt. I don’t really have anyone to appreciate this with me so I thought I’d share it here since I’ve been a longtime lurker. There is so much possibility for life to get better.

Being gaslit by a narcissistic leader that your country's response to a pandemic is normal is the mother of all triggers,721,fip8hm,88,"TW: coronavirus

I live in the UK. The government's policy at the moment seems to be to let the pandemic run through the population, more or less, to build ""herd immunity"". Where that leaves the old and vulnerable is not clear. Meanwhile, our neighbouring countries Ireland and France have taken serious action. Ireland has shut schools and it sounds like France are going to go into serious shutdown. Here, people are going about their daily lives. Only people in hospitals will be tested.

I've gone through a few days of convincing myself (gaslighting myself) that the government has the population's best interests at heart. As a teenager I was very deferential to authority and even voted for our current Prime Minister when he was mayor of London (I deeply regret that and was very lost and misguided / trying to win my father's approval by being like him). So I temporarily regressed to this compliant state because the reality is too painful.

But it's just hit me. The plausible-sounding rationale for the government's strategy, backed up by ""the science"", that just happens to be different from every other country's science? It's typically narcissistic gaslighting, blind to emotion. It's the family rules that no healthy family has. I'm really freaking out just now and I've realised it's because I'm flashing back to being a child, and having my parents tell me they love me, have my best interests at heart, and knowing that the opposite is true.

And Ireland and France are the healthy, supportive neighouring households on my street, where, when things go wrong, they activate their loving moma bear protective action, and take care of their children. The WHO questioning the UK's strategy = the concerned loving aunt or uncle, who tries to intervene when they see you're getting abused but gets shut out / ignored by your parents.

This situation is NOT OK. I am not ""making it up"" or ""overreacting"". If you're experiencing something similar, you are not making it up. Trust your instincts. Take care of yourselves and those around you (if it's safe to do so and you have the capacity).

I'm going through this basically alone, because I live alone and don't know people round here. I don't think our nervous systems are designed to take this kind of huge scary experience alone. Anyone else dealing with this alone, or just really scared right now. I see you. I hear you. You are loved and worthy of love and care and support.

Bonus memory: one time I got pneumonia and was coughing up blood. My dad's response was to offer me a lozenge (sore throat sweet), lol. I told him to f\*\*\* off."
"I hate this wave of compassion that only concerns ""normal"" people",718,g00eq3,115,"I get legit upset when I see people trying to show support and compassion because of the social distancing shit like it's the worst thing in the world. My teachers go like ""I hope y'all doing fine and good, it's a difficult time for all, please take care of your mental health yada, yada""....or I'd hear ""WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER! LET'S BE STRONG!"" No Fuck You.....I've been alone all of my life and then they want me to join them suddenly and pretend like I haven't been left to die by the same people?   

I was tired to go outside with anxiety. I was tired to work with dread. I was tired to interact with people only to end up either angry or anxious. I was tired to constantly sacrifice myself just to ""function normally"" like fucking everyone. I was tired to think about my future when all I see is doom. I was tired to feel constantly triggered by anything I've confronted daily. This quarantine is actually giving me a BREAK (almost..I still have my bad mood) from all of this. I can now be my lazy ass and stop caring about my life. And those motherfuckers...really want me to believe it's the ""difficult"" part? That they're ""with me""? Before all of that social isolation, I tried to kill myself. And when the quarantine will come to an end, I would want to kill myself again because it would mean going back to ""oh damn, I have no choice but to endure shit until something kills me"" Mode. 

*And let's not mention people who are stuck in abusive household during this time and they already had it hard, but the world didn't give a shit.*

BRIEFLY, I don't want sympathy for the wrong reasons. I'd rather not have any sympathy from the world at all in that case. Why would they give a shit? I've grew up with the deeply rooted conviction that I must only count on myself to survive. **This sudden wave of compassion concerns only ""normal"" people who did not suffer from their daily life due to mental illnesses/abuse in the first place.** They don't really care about us. And that's why I'm angry."

It’s okay if trauma changed you.,718,a5c3o0,76,
DAE lose the ability to speak when triggered,717,kl3og1,75,"I’ve had to go back to my childhood home with my parents for christmas, so obviously I knew this week was going to be hell. What I wasn’t expecting was a few days in for me to just completely be unable to speak? Even if I want to, I feel like I can’t make the right sounds - almost like I’ve forgotten how to actually physically speak, and I can’t stop clenching my jaw. When I do manage to speak it comes out different, much quieter and more childlike almost, and I can’t seem to manage more than a few words. 

I’m dissociated but having trouble identifying just how dissociated I am, and haven’t been able to fall asleep unless I smoke enough weed to knock myself out (not very healthy, I know, but it’s better than no sleep at all) and even that’s not until about 4am. 

I’m sure it’ll pass once I go back to my flat, but has anyone else experienced this issue with speaking or have any more insight into what exactly it’s part of (dissociation, fight or flight response)?"
"When I was a child, my mom shamed me for showing anger. I feel disgusting and ugly when I show any emotion now.",714,horffy,97,"She told me I needed to look in the mirror to see how ugly I am when I'm angry. As the title says, I feel horrible when I show any emotion now. For example, I look at pictures of me smiling and I get so disgusted. How can anyone stand to look at me?


It's obviously at its worst when I'm irritated or angry. Her words run through my mind and I immediately feel so ashamed that I feel strong urges to hurt myself."
I don’t like being asked questions because I feel like my answers will be used against me.,714,f8i16q,47,"I was at a doctor’s appointment this week and with this doctor of mine, we will talk about my mental health and my relationship with my dad (physically/emotional abusive). I mentioned to my doctor how my dad keeps asking me questions about my job or hobbies (I’ve been taking a lot of writing classes) and I keep getting furious when he does, or even shut down and ask him to not ask me questions. I definitely feel a huge sense of guilt, but I almost can’t help it. The second he asks me questions, I get defensive. 

The same thing happens with friends: who if they text me “how are you?”, I feel like immediately defensive and uncomfortable responding to them so I just say “I’m good! and you?” as if that’s a great way to keep a conversation going. I honestly hate talking about myself and if I do, I always feel like I talk too much. I like to talk and am a great conversationalist but I heavily dislike going into my feelings with anyone but my therapist because I hate pity and I hate being vulnerable like that. 

So my doctor started saying (paraphrasing) “Well, you don’t like being asked questions because you’re expecting your answers to be used against you. Growing up with a narcissistic parent like you have, you have to watch what you say for fear or it being the wrong thing. If you say one thing, he’ll bring that up and throw it in your face.” And I knew that on some level, but hearing her say that really resonated with me. My dad is king of saying “Well you said this” or “You promised this” or basically making me feel shitty about my existence with undercutting comments all the time. 

What sucks is that this ruins my relationships because I can’t get intimate with anyone. Intimacy scares me. Even though I know my friends won’t use my words against me, I can’t take that chance. I have to look out for myself and myself only. 

I’m trying to be more open here and there but man, it’s so exhausting. I almost don’t want to change this part of me, but some friendships have suffered because of it so I know I have to try harder."
Fatigue is not a character flaw,712,dlrvor,74,"I'm so tired. So tired. All the time. I bet you are, too. I come home from work and it's a miracle if I can do more than eat dinner. On the weekend, I can't get my to-do list done. I have so many things I could do, should do. But I'm so tired.

I imagine everybody else is ""living their best life"" and getting shit done and their stove tops are clean. I hear my family's voices in my head about how lazy I am. ""Seriously? You can't just take the trash out? Seriously? You're just going to let your mail sit there?""

I have started to tell myself out loud, ""Fatigue is not a character flaw."" It's not. My fatigue is real. It comes from a genuine overload of... everything. It's testament to how lazy I'm NOT that I get as much done as I do, considering the constant racing heart. The lack of restful sleep. The job that requires me to be ""on"", non-stop, for my whole shift everyday, all day. The unrelenting pressure to handle everything on my own. The ever-present awareness that I have no financial safety net.

I stopped at Target after work and got Kleenex and toothbrushes. I had dinner. I took my makeup off. AND I put my dirty dishes in the dishwasher.

Fatigue is not a character flaw."
"DAE realise that it could’ve all been avoided if our parents simply, well, took an interest in our wellbeing and an interest in becoming better parents when it mattered?",712,desu4a,58,"It’s like, the panic attacks I had from thinking about my exes made me see how toxic they were. Tonight, seeing my acne scars and my teeth made me realise how truly neglected I was. My scars are, okay? They aren’t hideous, they blend in somewhat. My teeth are okay too but still. Basically, it would’ve been nice to have a healthier looking ‘me’. Idk, I couldn’t sleep because of how ugly and shameful I felt. 

We moved to another country when I was 11. Constantly moving didn’t help me practise maintaining long term friends. The flat we lived in wasn’t great either. I wasn’t taught the ‘basics’. It’s no wonder my second ex cruelly said “you’re dumb and boring” and “stop blaming others”. When really, it was truly others that robbed me of who I could’ve been. My first ex was the first person to give me attention, but she quickly labelled me as an attention whore. When really, I was dying for simple attention. It’s no wonder I learned so much from her. However, she broke me down hard because she built me up. 

When I don’t wear the mask of the joker, I am still that scared little boy. I genuinely didn’t feel handsome and cried in front of the mirror. I’m no goblin but, dare I say, I wish I was an object of desire for women. I’m average at best. 

Really, what bothered me the most is that I could’ve avoided being bullied had my parents listened to me and genuinely tried to help. Given me the basics outside of shelter and food. Now? Gosh, they are just tired but it’s no wonder I feel weird about them. It’s like “it’s 14 years too late for you assholes to now be acting like what you should’ve”. 

Idk, I’ve been called good looking by both men and women. Whether they are just being nice, I will never know. It’s like, my whole life was spent inside the cage of my mind. Now, a bit better, I feel so betrayed that my outer layer was not looked after. 

I’ve had to learn things the hard way, usually. I have never been nor plan to be in jail. I try to do things ‘right’ but at the same time, I never feel like I have a chance to live as a result. 

The feeling I had was akin to a flashback. Maybe I want to fix my skin and teeth out as a way of shedding my old self, ironically. I probably can do this one day because I don’t plan to ever have a family. Sigh. Funnily enough, I feel that my parents stole a lot from me: the ability to be ‘positive’ and the idea to even have a family. On the flip side, I then think I would have came to the same conclusions if everything were perfect, just that I’d crash even harder. 

It’s just not nice to be a ‘lone wolf’ when you don’t want to be a lone wolf. However, I’m so used to being alone, that that is my default. 

Note to self: don’t look at family photos ever again because it triggered me. 

It’s no wonder I ironically say to people “that’s it. I’m done. I’m finished.” To imply that I’ve given up. 

Lol the amount of political philosophy I had to consume just to understand where the political mindset comes into the social arena. It’s one reason why I’m careful (not anxious) about saying to a girl that I like her. Chances are, she will feel something negative, tell her group of friends unbeknownst to me and then I’ll be made to look like an idiot. So, if I do go ahead and tell a girl I like her, I best be prepared to defend my case against the counsel. 

Random: a flatmate asked me if I ever wanted to get rich. I said, “yeah, to have a decent retirement one would require money. If I wanted to retire in some villa in Italy, for sure I’ll need the money”. To me money is like slightly reversing the sands of time. 

On topic, yeah, it really could’ve all been avoided. But no, step father and mother just couldn’t. Fair enough that they too didn’t have a model but did you really have to be like that towards me and my sister? Then say you love us because really, you see that your life is coming close to an end. It could’ve all been avoided if my mother made slightly better choices. Hell, even as a child I knew this could’ve all been avoided had I not been born. This is where I factor in philosophy, in particular, nihilism. 

Idk what else to say aside from that it fucking sucks /: it also sucks because no one ever says a thing. They won’t be like ‘oh let me help you get this’ unless you are dying or some shit where it’s already passed ‘too late’. Maybe the narcissistic toxic environment fucked up my perception of people? It’s not like I was told or my parents took me to a dermatologist or took me to a dentist to straighten my teeth. Again, nothing major but it’s like getting a scratch on an expensive car. I wish I was an innovative 7 year old boy. 

It’s not so much that I can’t accept the past. It’s just that it’s not much of a conversation starter. But then making jokes gets less fun over time. I know it can be worse, but why should it ever be worse, right? 

I hate the aloneness but without it, I would have not known what I really want out of life. When I think of that boy (me). I think that I’m doing alright. 

Anyways, any feedback is much appreciated =)"

"What gives, generations before ours?",711,lbb1jd,120,"I've been able to come out the other side of all the anger I had bottled up, and this isn't so much anger as righteous indignation and astonished outrage.

I'm riled up about just how much secrecy older generations have cloaked things like sex, relationships, puberty and family dynamics in... And all for what?! Some ridiculous notion about 'respectability', or 'polite behaviour'? What did you achieve by it? 

You've repressed yourselves beyond belief, and then heaped shame on anyone who chose to not conform to your frankly stupid and useless ideas. Aren't you supposed to want better for the children you have, and to try and create that better? Hiding shit away because you're embarrassed of your bodily functions or of emotions is the opposite of 'better'. What a sorry ass legacy to bequeath. 

I'm glad and grateful that younger people today are out there being way more open and honest about all sorts of life experiences, and creating a space for others to just be and live better lives that way without the burden of unnecessary secrecy or shame.

My therapist said my rape wasn’t a big deal,720,go3na9,159,"Hi all,
This is my first time posting here so I hope I do it right. My husband and I have intimacy issues. Mainly I just don’t desire sex and if we have sex I feel super vulnerable and scared. We started seeing a couple’s counselor who specializes in sex therapy. 

To give her the benefit of the doubt, she is Ukrainian and has a thick accent still cause she hasn’t been in the US long. I’m not sure how long she has been in the US, but long enough to get her PhD here. (However, if you’re going to do therapy in the US, I would think she’d learn about how the US views trauma or rape.) but I say that because her worldview is probably mostly shaped by growing up in Ukraine. She had stellar reviews, so sometimes I tell myself she was right. But I feel so horrible still after therapy with her. 

In our first session, she asked if I had any sex related trauma. I explained I was raped by my friend in high school. Because my parents knew his family and he went to our church, I told my family what happened, they think I blew it out of proportion, and they encouraged me to keep dating him. And it kept happening obviously. 

So I told her this story and she responded, “but that was in high school? That’s so long ago that shouldn’t affect you any more. Rape happens to many women and they still have fulfilling sex lives.” 

Over the next few sessions, she basically blamed all the sex problems in my marriage on me cause I wasn’t interested or excited for sex. She told me I was too young to have these problems (27) and I should realize how beautiful I am. She said I needed to try harder. 

Basically my husband was super uncomfortable with seeing this woman and thought she treated me horribly and he wanted to stop going. I felt like since she was a medical professional, she probably was right and I needed to get over my trauma issues. I have since understood more that her approach was bad...but I still wonder how much a thing that happened in high school should affect me. Anyway, thanks for reading.

Edit: thank you all for the kind words! You all really have made me feel better (especially as far as me thinking I was crazy for not being “over” this event). And thank you to the kind stranger for the award. No worries, I am not seeing that therapist anymore. You all are the best."
Don’t lose yourself,718,c6ch83,47,
I'm sick of being given strategies to cope with stress instead of asking why we're all chronically stressed in the first place,712,lqydoe,85,"It's stupid.

It's mandatory to read a university success handbook at my school. There's an entire chapter on managing stress which acknowledges that university students are chronically stressed and basically want to die all the time. And yet, nobody questions whether we even need to be so stressed in the first place? So we can maybe take a different approach to life? Nah. They give us deep breathing techniques.

I'm not saying practicing meditation and yoga and progressive muscle relaxation or whatever is bad. But for those of us living in wealthy, developed nations... There is literally no reason any of us need to be working ourselves to the point of suicidal ideation. We have everything we need. When unemployment is more of a problem than shortage of supply or labour, what does that say about our society? It says WE'RE SET! It says, UNEMPLOYMENT SHOULDN'T EVEN BE A PROBLEM, BECAUSE WE HAVE EVERYTHING WE NEED. 

Sorry this is a bit of a tangent from anything CPTSD related but-- capitalism is just so disgusting man. I feel like the entire world is triggering because it bases our worth on economic contribution and doesn't value human life if it doesn't meet that standard."
"I keep hearing this little voice in my head that says, ""Something else happened to you - you just don't remember it."" Has anyone else heard this voice? Has something ever come from it? Is it just my desire for there to be something tangible and undeniable to explain my cPTSD? Help",713,jzzk3i,165,"As the title says, every once in awhile I'll hear a little voice saying that I have some trauma I don't remember. It'll be every other month or so, even longer, and then it'll just say something. I've been dealing with it for a year.

If I don't respond, I'll ruminate on the idea. When I do respond, usually I'll say something like, ""That's ok. I'm not quite ready to deal with it. I trust you to bring it up when we're ready"" and then it goes, ""Ok."" It feels like a young voice, but not crazy young? Like, before 7 but not an infant.

Sometimes it comes up randomly, sometimes when I get somatic flashbacks that I can't pin down.

I have some ideas of what it *could* be. But ultimately I have no clue. That's what stresses me out. I've ""uncovered"" repressed memories, but when I remembered it wasn't totally new. I knew I knew it - I just never thought of it. I have **no idea** what this memory could be. It feels like something bad. And it freaks me out.

It also freaks me out because it could be totally untrue. It could be just me hoping that there it some tangible catastrophe that even I would be shocked into validation over. My anxiety could be making it all up.

When I wrote down the age it could be, I really started dissociating, and I see something in my minds eye, but I don't know what it is. I've dissociated pretty badly. I know I used to get panic attacks when I would worry too much about getting panic attacks, and holy heck I'm dissociated, but I am worried that that is what this is. I'm worrying so much about having a flashback that I'm making up a flashback. My head feels hot, but kinda cozy hot? I'm gone gone dang. I haven't dissociated like this in ages.

I don't know if I am making any sense. Does anyone else have experience with this?"

Thank you Covid-19 for helping me find the clarity to leave my abusive manipulative boyfriend.,707,fjduho,19,"As I have been super fight or flight this last week, I realized that even in this kind of scenario where I’m not in danger, I don’t want to be stuck with him for any amount of time anymore. I can’t stand him. He picked an argument with me tonight and I think he was upset because he was hungover and felt shitty, and I wasn’t home all day because I didn’t want to be around him, so he had to make me feel bad for something. Sorry if this isn’t the clearest, I’m kind of high and have a bit of adrenaline going.  But I did have many moments of clarity this week about how I’d like to live my life. And his way isn’t it.

Edit: oh my gosh thank you so much for the support. I’ve tried to leave at least five or six times, I’ve fully moved out once before. This has been incredibly difficult for me as I want more than anything to just make other people (him) happy rather than do what makes me happy."
TFW you tell your partner about your own abuse and end up having to comfort them.,711,dy2qkp,198,"Has anyone experienced this? 

I understand that it can be a difficult topic for neurotypical people to hear about, but sometimes it feels so tiring and lonely. Like, I didnt ask for this to happen to me? 

It just feels like....YOU need some time alone to process what happened to ME? 

How do you think I feel? I dont get to step away from it and come back. 

But at the same time, I lnow people need time to process things that they arent used to, and it can be upsetting if you arent used to it, but god, does it make me feel so alone. I thought this was the person I could finally open up to, after 4 years."
Yet another reason to integrate and process trauma.,708,ara5i2,17,
UPDATE --- daycare told my kid crying was no longer allowed,713,eivjt3,102,"So a while ago I vented about my 3 year old being in a panic because she was about to cry while mad and she was not allowing herself to cry. When I asked her why she thought it's wrong to cry she told me that's what a teacher at daycare had told her. Babies cry, but big kids weren't allowed to anymore, because they're big kids now.

TL;DR: somebody told my kid it's not okay to cry once you're not a baby anymore. It was probably my dad, not daycare.

I contacted daycare and they took things very seriously. Called colleagues at home to ask them about the situation, kept in contact with me to keep me updated, made sure to watch their words whenever my kid would get a tantrum. 

Teachers at daycare told me they told my kid that it's easier to understand words, so it's important to also use your words whenever you're mad or sad and that it's okay to feel sad or angry. The same thing we always tell her. So, all in all, I'm pretty confident daycare didn't do anything wrong and it's a good thing I let my anger and frustrations die down before contacting them. 

A couple of days ago however... We were visiting my parents (who babysat her for a day the week my daughter was in such a panic about crying) and my daughter was very tired after a long day of Christmas celebrations. We were about to get ready to go home, but she didn't want to stop playing with her new toys and started to cry. My father got very annoyed about it and... Emphasized how big of a kid she usually is, that this was unnecessary and how much this kind of behavior annoys other people.

So I guess it's not hard to guess where she got the no-crying-allowed thing from, even though my mother adamantly claims they never said such things. 

I could've known. My parents have always had a hard time dealing with negative feelings and preferred telling me to stop feeling sad, go to my room or to just sleep it off when I was a kid. Or that I had no reason to feel sad, because a distant friend was dying of cancer and I was doing fine in comparison.

I'm getting a babysitter for my daughter, as I don't want my parents to babysit her as regularly anymore. It's not the first time they've told her things that go against everything I stand for and I don't want her to feel as I felt back when I was a kid walking on eggs around my parents. I mean, they are great grandparents - as long as no negative feelings are involved. And with a three year old having a hard time coping with activity transitions there's negative feelings and a need for empathy involved every day.

Fortunately my daughter is doing fine again. She was in a panic the next few times she got emotional, but with some tlc, help from daycare and a couple of stories about emotions she's ""back on track"". Phew."
"I think it isn't talked about, but my professor brought up 'I am your trauma' and I think it's very important.",714,e73d4b,236,"As a non-white Female, I've been abused by the opposite gender as well as white people (not to single ya'll out but white supremacy is a huge problem, at least in the US).

My professor, who is white, would say in our class 'I understand if you do not feel safe in my class, because even though i did not directly cause your trauma, I *am* your trauma' in discussion of their race. And I loved that they acknowledged that.

For me personally, specifically white males are my trauma. I see a white man and I immediately tense up, waiting for the worst. While I do not believe that all white people, white males, or males are inherently bad, you *are my trauma*. If that makes sense.

I think it needs to be talked about more, and acknowledged. That people who cause PTSD/trauma in others, their 'category/label' becomes the person's trauma. (This isn't the case for everyone, but it's more common then you think)

Anyways, thanks for coming to my ted talk. I am also unsure whether the flair is appropriate, but I hope it is.

EDIT : please before you post (no matter the viewpoints) please read through all of the comments, as they help explain this concept further

EDIT 2 :  ‘You are my trauma’ does not give you power OVER something, rather power to yourself. Enough power so that you can stand in front of it, talk to it, and to not flinch or do whatever your body tells you to do, due to that trigger. 

This phrase is also focused on the trauma part rather then you. It is not placing blame, nor making assumptions. ‘You wear the face of my trauma’ is another way you can say it. 

Also to everyone else. If you use ‘You are my trauma’ as a power move over someone, or as to put someone down. Shame on you. This phrase is to give power to those who have the trauma to be able to walk the earth like someone who does not have their trauma. This phrase should NOT be brought up in everyday conversations without the context of this thread"

"After an entire lifetime of abuse, I have finally severed all connections and ties to those that have hurt and used me.",702,miitaq,59,"I for a very long time figured that the abuse I had suffered only extended to my family, but this whole time I've also been a part of an extremely abusive friend group. After months of feeling ashamed, feeling guilty, seeing myself as worthless and wondering constantly why I'm just not enough, I realized I will never be enough for any of my friends, and they would all sooner see me die than give a shit. I attempted suicide 5 months ago, and afterwards got told by my friends that they ridiculed belittled and shit talked me behind my back, and that's what they had to do to cope with my wanting to die, like it was my fault for ever making them feel like that. Another one of them called me while I was in the facility, and told me point blank that they won't be there for me. Another directly made promises and plans with me to keep me safe, kept missing and bailing on those promises, and in response to my getting upset at him told me ""You're to fucking much. I can't deal with you right now."" and abandoned me at my weakest and most vulnerable, and fed me silence until I was compliant to the silent abusive ""truth"" that I was wrong and that I deserved to be treated that way.

I genuinely cannot believe how much I've let myself put up with against garbage evil people. They are horrible, and I am so glad that I see it fully now. It wasn't my fault they didn't care enough to be there for me, they really couldn't have given a shit whether I lived or died. But they made sure that I constantly felt bad if I ever dared speak up for myself.

This has to be one of the biggest milestones and victories for me over the past bit! I have finally realized that all of my friends were abusive assholes too and it almost killed me this year. But I'm actually smiling because I feel a sense of freedom and liberation I've never known before in my life"

It's such a mindfuck when you realize something you experienced growing up isn't normal,702,hby3z0,92,"I'm 24 and still scared of the dark. Up until around 3rd or 4th grade, the girl my mother was dating would lock my younger sister (three years younger) and me in our rooms. She'd constantly scare us with stories about bogeymen and then if she seemed us bad, we would be shut in our room with the light off. 

We'd be absolutely terrified to the point we were sobbing at the top of our lungs. The girlfriend would just laugh. They were both alcoholics so my mother was always either too drunk to give a shit or too drunk to be woken up by the sound of us. 

I didn't realize until last year this isn't a normal thing to experience. I just... Working through things in therapy keeps resurfacing things I didn't realize aren't okay and it's mind-blowing.

That time when my Psychology Professor was concerned and asked to see me after class because of one of my answers in group participation.,708,gki9pj,136,"So I was dually enrolled in highschool and at the local community college when I was 17. I took psychology at the community college twice a week. During the classes, we would have a prompt that everyone had to answer before the lesson began.

The prompt that day was something like:

""You wake up in your room, but it's painted all white, and there are no windows or doors. You see all of the things that are normally in your room, but it has been painted and you can't find an exit. Give me a one word answer describing how you feel.""

My answer? Safe. I felt safe at the thought of that. I was one of the first to be called on so I didn't notice it wasn't a normal reaction to that question until nobody else had the same answer."
"Instead of dissolving into a puddle of shame, I got mad and I’m so proud of myself.",702,k2dz4n,53,"Today, I went to the store and asked an employee where something was. I did nothing wrong. I was polite. She was extremely rude, like I’ve never been treated like that by someone working at a store. I know that today is Black Friday and working in retail is HARD. I know that she’s probably exhausted and that she’s probably been dealing with dicks all day. I don’t know what trauma she might have experienced or what stresses she’s currently dealing with. 

In the past, I would have shrunk into a tiny puddle of shame- how dare I inconvenience someone for a second? Especially someone who was probably having a terrible day. How dare I ask for help? 

Today, my first reaction was anger. 

I didn’t act on my anger at all, but I felt it. 

I stood up taller, said “thank you”, and walked away from the interaction with my head up. Not down. I didn’t collapse into a sad self-hugging shuffle like I would have last year. 

I am so proud of myself. 

My anger is a sign that I’m on my side, that I care about myself and I know I didn’t deserve the way she treated me. I didn’t deserve the decades of abuse either. I didn’t deserve to hate myself because of what my parents did. 

I can be strong. I can stand tall. I can conduct myself with dignity and graciousness. Especially when dealing with unearned and unwarranted shit from people. 

I finally care about myself enough to see my value as equal to others and to see myself as someone who deserves to be treated with respect. 

Thank you so much to anyone who read all this. I wish you well on your healing journey and I hope that you are a friend to yourself during this process.

I still completely shut down when people yell,709,h0wua9,109,"Even if they're not yelling at me or if they're yelling because they feel emotional, I just can't stay focused. I leave my body and stay tense for way too long afterwards.

I've been listening to a lot of social media accounts talking about BLM to try to learn more and be supportive. But as soon as a video pops up with someone yelling with passion, I panic and take it so intensely. I want to listen but I'm still working on fixing my sensitivities. Like the most recent one was just a powerful woman raising her voice because innocent people don't deserve death. I completely agree but oof I'm a weak person and I was tense and panicked for the rest of the day.

It's seriously going to take a while to find the strength to stay in the moment and keep a clear head to listen to any degree of someone raising their voice.

I'm blessed to live on my own. But on the rare occasions I visit my parents, I cannot emphasize enough how unhelpful yelling is. My dad has begun to understand, but it doesn't stop the yelling. Then they wonder why I never want to visit. Bleh.

You can be physically comfortable but still feel 100% emotionally homeless.,702,he8um1,45,"I sometimes feel this strange disconnect because I have a roof over my head and food on the table (that I pay for myself).

But it's like my physical surroundings don't match up with how I feel emotionally. I feel alone in the world, like I'm floating in space, or lost in a vast endless desert with no anchors or markers.

Of course shelter and food are important but once I have those, I feel like the rest almost has no impact on helping this feeling of ""emotional homelessness"".

And I realized it's because although I am physically okay, I never cultivated relationships (because, you know).

I just wanted to let you know it's okay to feel ""homeless"" even if you have a physical home. You may be living life as an adult in a physically good position, but if you feel a deep and terrifying feeling of homelessness still, it may be emotional homelessness. And it's okay to feel like you're starting from nothing on the emotional side, even if you have the physical side of things nailed down."

"DAE oscillate between ""everyone else feels like this you're being dramatic"" and ""no one understands me i feel so alone""?",700,jllsyb,22,"I feel like I shift between both of these states constantly.

On one hand I feel so isolated and misunderstood like no one can relate to how painful it is to exist like this but on the other hand, I start to feel like I'm just being dramatic and everyone else feels this way too and I need to stop whining about it.

I have to wonder if any of it is a result of, besides my parents constantly invalidating my feelings growing up, but if I ever share stuff on social media about general trauma stuff people reply in unhelpful ways.

People always do that about ADHD, depression, etc. not realizing that everyone experiences a spectrum of emotions but it's only disordered when it's to the extreme. Like of course you can all relate to the 4 Fs (fight, flight, freeze, fawn) because someone who grew up with good parenting should be able to move among all 4 in a way that's healthy and that's why I share this information, but ffs if you describe yourself as ""a very happy person"" it sounds like you might be mostly alright and you don't need to coopt this information as your problem when it's the reason I can barely exist day to day."
This is just for me to say how pissed I am that careless adults half assed raised me and now I’ll be recovering till I die.,701,dpwouk,142,"I’m 31 and just this year I learned how to properly use a can opener thanks to being shown by someone for once. I’m so tired of feeling so behind and not knowing what I don’t know yet. I’m having a hard day and am just really tired of having to be me, yknow?"
"Recommendation: ""Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement"" by Rich Karlgaard (2019)",698,m3kba2,60,"I originally posted this over on r/CPTSDNextSteps and people found it helpful. I thought this might be helpful for people here as well. 

Many of us with C-PTSD struggle with feeling ""left behind"" in life, feeling like our trauma has made meeting our potential in life an impossibility. This can create a self-fulfilling prophecy in which we rob ourselves of our full potential with avoidance, negativity, learned helplessness, and harsh self-judgment. I discovered [this book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524759759/) last year at my library, and it really helped me to feel less anxious or demoralized about not meeting traditional ""milestones"" of success on the traditional timeline. 

In the book, Karlgaard outlines how society has grown increasingly obsessed with early achievement: we valorize child prodigies, wunderkinds, entrepreneurs who start businesses while still in college or before they are 30. Karlgaard reminds us that such success is the very minute exception rather than the rule, and that most of these people demonstrated early advantages, precocious talent and intelligence, and a rare confluence of resources, support, and connections that most people can never dream of having. He also makes the point that early achievement can have negative consequences on the mental health, creativity and freedom to innovate, and ethical development of the young people at the center of all this attention.

In addition, social media has put our human tendency toward social comparison on steroids, making it easier than ever to access knowledge of the most successful, beautiful, smartest, accomplished, etc. people in our social network and in the world. This has exacerbated rates of anxiety and depression among young people. A large part of the book is also dedicated to standardized testing and the increasingly stressful pressure that young people are placed under to succeed in school and get into a good college and then compete for internships and job placements. The emphasis has caused stress levels among school children as young as elementary age to skyrocket. Children are put on the ""fast-track"", are pidgeonholed at a young age based on standardized test scores or other external validation measures, and miss out on crucial opportunities to explore, create, and make mistakes. 

Karlgaard defines a late-bloomer as: ""a person who fulfills their potential later than expected; they often have talents that aren't visible to others initially... And they fulfill their potential frequently in novel and unexpected ways, surprising even those closest to them. They are not attempting to satisfy, with gritted teeth, the expectations of their parents or society, a false path that leads to burnout and brittleness, or even to depression and illness... Late bloomers are those who find their supreme destiny on their own schedule, in their own way."" 

I think this book could be very helpful for anyone struggling with feeling behind in life, or like they have been robbed of their dreams by trauma.

Some points I found particularly hopeful (some of these I'm pasting from [this review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2571442444?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1) which is not my own, but which offers a helpful summary of points):

* Executive function of the brain doesn't fully mature until our mid- to late-20s to early 30s (and trauma can delay this maturation by several years). Many of us are beating ourselves up for bad decisions we made when we were younger and didn't have our full mental resources at the ready. Try not to dwell on ""mistakes"" you made in your youth. 
* Creativity and innovation peaks in our late 40s, and the average age of patent applications is 47: ""We get smarter and more creative as we age, research shows. Our brain's anatomy, neural networks, and cognitive abilities can actually improve with age and increased life experiences. Contrary to the mythology of Silicon Valley, older employees may be even more productive, innovative, and collaborative than younger ones... Most people, in fact, have multiple cognitive peaks throughout their lives.""
* The ability to evaluate complex patterns, including other people’s emotional states, doesn’t full blossom until we are in our 40s or 50s. Crystallized intelligence—accumulated facts and knowledge—doesn’t peak until we are in our late 60s or early 70s.
* The average age of discovery leading to a Nobel Prize is 39.
* The average age of entrepreneurship is 47, and there are twice as many entrepreneurs over 50 as there are under 25.
* ""It's just as important to know when to drop something and shift direction as it is to know when to stick with something. When we quit the things that aren't working for us, we free up our willpower and perseverance for the things that really do matter.""
* ""Early bloomers enjoy many advantages in affluent societies. But one huge disadvantage they face is that by dint of their youth and accomplishments, they give themselves credit for their success, more than the rest of us do. That's understandable: adolescents and young adults tend to be self-centered... The problem arises when early bloomers have a setback: either they put all the blame on themselves and fall into self-condemnation and paralysis, or they blame everyone else. Late bloomers tend to be more circumspect: they are able to see their own role in the adversity they face, without succumbing to self-condemnation or blame shifting.""

If I have one major criticism, it's that the book fixates on the standard, late-capitalist yardsticks of ""success"" that society measures human beings based on, particularly ascending the echelons of the academic and career worlds. It doesn't focus as much on building close relationships and life satisfaction outside of those things. However, career and academics are probably the major sources of anxiety and insecurity most people in this society struggle with, with romantic relationships coming after. It helped me think about my particular moment in life in a more positive way, and made me more hopeful. I hope it helps others as much as it helped me."
YSK cPTSD is something you can develop from adult experiences as well. You can have a 'before'.,698,jzq100,74,"The childhood side is shockingly the most common. It is terrible and absolutely valid. But, there is also an adult side to cPTSD. 

It's old name was 'Enduring Personality Change After Catastrophic Experience'. It got wrapped up into cPTSD in the ICD-11. It's rarer for sure. Please remember that we exist on here too. We live to same day-to-day experience as you, with the exact same symptoms. The only difference is what happened to us.

For example; I'm being treated for complex trauma now. I was raped by a sexual sadist for 11 hours when I was 21. I'm only just coming to terms with the fact that it didn't just 'feel' torturous. It was torture. I had a before; and she definitely died that day. And mine is the mildest form of 'adult' of cPTSD. 

Being trafficked. Being in a cult. Domestic abuse. Being tortured. Forced prostitution. Being held hostage. Being kidnapped. Surviving a genocide. Surviving torture. Child abuse. Child sexual abuse. Child neglect. Victims of crime where there is no help coming and you are totally on your own to survive. The thread that binds us is that these are dehumanising acts that destroy the recipient long term. We run the same risks of retraumatisation/revictimisation as well.

I know most of you on here are the recipients of CSA/child abuse or child neglect. I was shocked to learn that so many children have only ever known the life I do now. I would slap the shit out of any one of your abusers if I was given the chance. Fucking around with children and their sense of safety/belonging is inexcusable. 

I know we are rarer, but please, please let the adult survivors feel included and welcome on here too. You are the only ones who relate to how we feel. Upvote us when we make our first posts. Say hi. When we do post on here there's hardly any interaction. I know our trauma can seem intimidating or that it doesn't apply to you. But the neurotypicals don't interact with us either. We don't bite, and we don't think your trauma is any less valid than ours. We are so isolated by our experiences. The loss and the loneliness are unbearable.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the kindness and support guys. I've had these symptoms for 13 years, and felt so lonely."
Mum didn't steal my childhood; she actually stole my adulthood from me.,698,emj29k,65,"
So this is actually a breakthrough, but I can't phrase it right at the moment so I'll go with venting.

I just counted the years since I have started to somewhat get out of my Mum's brainwashing and also started to talk to other people, learn, discuss, analyse things.

Talking to other people was a thing she had heavily discouraged me from doing. She did everything, from punishing me for trying to make contact to making me believe everyone was against myself and her, whilst she was the one abusing me every day in so many ways.

I just counted the years since I started actually learning useful stuff from *this* reality and not hers. I realize that she stopped, hindered or even reversed my emotional (and even intellectual ) growth through her brainwashing, neglect, abuse and all. 

It's hard to explain, but imagine that the type of things you learnt at 12/13/14 etc were something like ""you have to modify your facial expression so that the demons won't be able to read your thoughts"" or endless justifications for your mother's mistakes that she relayed to you herself, just so she can justify them. No physics, chemistry, no history geography or mathematics. All your free time was filled with this type of nonsense. Whatever school could salvage during the day was destroyed the same exact evening with endless and pointless talks continued late into the night. Our ""friendship"", when things were ""good"" between us, made me sleep deprived and honestly, idiotic. 

I would've preferred just the beatings, or more intense ones even than the ones I got (and those were pretty intense too). Anything but her fucking up my brain every single day for so many years, way into young adulthood even. I forgive everything else, even. Not that, because it still affects me. And to that part of my brain that tells me that I was complicit to it by not running away or something I say : False.  You can only be complicit if you have an alternative, if you know there's an alternative. She made sure I never knew there was one. She did it singlehandedly.


So that makes my emotional age about 11. My intellectual age probably 15, despite having gone to uni and stuff, I have spent many years with no critical thinking and completely brainwashed. Recovering from that was and is a slow and painful process.

So I'm 11 emotionally, 15 intelectualy and in my mid 30s as a body.

How the hell do I even function? How do I go to work, take care of people in my life, do anything really?

Poorly is the answer, I guess. 

I need to learn my limits first so I can outgrow them later."
I just dropped out of law school for mental health reasons. I don't have to push myself to the brink to be worthy of a happy life.,698,e7ze0i,67,"It was the hardest decision of my life, but nothing is worth this many flashbacks and suicidal thoughts. Fuck the prestige, I couldn't stand watching the mental health of all my peers fall apart. I know my boyfriend's family will be disappointed, but I feel as light as a feather right now and can't wait to find a ""normal"", less emotionally demanding job."
Using Stardew Valley and other life sim type videogames as a safe space to process the ways I'm comfortable interacting with the world around me,694,lofk06,59,"Hear me out. I know everyone has their own approach to this kind of thing, but as a freeze type who has a lot of trouble feeling physically connected to the spaces I happen to occupy, I've recently figured out that I've actually been doing quite a bit of emotional processing when I play certain types of video games.

Stardew Valley is mainly what I've been playing these last few months, but in the past I've played plenty of other similar games. I started out on Harvest Moon and the Sims as a kid and I've kind of always been stuck on the genre since then. Now that I'm in recovery, I realize that the draw for me has always been the ability to unrestrictedly create a safe space when I felt unsafe so very often.

Maladaptive daydreaming has always been one of my coping mechanisms, so I try my best to keep a close eye on how I'm interacting with any given game and whether or not I'm maintaining a healthy relationship with the time I spend on it. Now that I'm actually aware of what I'm feeling in general, it's gotten easier to have a healthy relationship with these types of games, and I've begun to realize how much they've done for me in terms of whether or not I feel ""allowed"" to make the space around me into something that works better for me personally. I come from a background of emotional abuse and my ""selfishness"" was much maligned in my household, so life sim games gave me a way to start create safe spaces for myself without my inner critic attacking me.

I'll use Stardew Valley as an example. I've noticed I'm allowed (both in-game and in my real, physical space) to:

\- move something if it's in my way without feeling bad about it

\- make my space prettier to me even if other people say my personal aesthetic is wierd or tasteless

\- change something if it's not working for me, even if i spent time making it look the way it did

\- be stressed out about clutter and know that I need to clean but that the clutter doesn't make me a bad person

\- do small things to mark space as ""mine"" (boundaries were forbidden when I was growing up)

And much more!

My relationship to my space is definitely a work in progress and even if I \*know\* these things are true in general, I still have some trouble believing they also apply to me at times, but I do think it's helped me be kinder to myself. It's also helped me figure out a little bit about what I like and don't like, which I'm learning late. I'm realizing I'm allowed to think things are inconvenient because they're in my way, and to make it so that they're not in my way. I honestly feel a little silly posting this, but it really has done... something for me. And I know games like this don't work for everyone-- I've had a lot of issues with video game addiction in the past and I've had to effectively ban myself from playing certain titles. I'm just pleased that I'm still able to interact with some of them still and get something positive out of it."
"When my sister died, I was always told to be strong for my parents. Nobody told them to be strong for me.",702,hw7vr9,75,"It was like their loss was more important than mine. When someone dies, especially if they were relatively young, people focus on the parents' loss and usually forget about the siblings.   
  
I was suffering from losing my big sister to a war she didn't believe in. I lost the person who protected me from my parents and made me feel better. I was always told to be strong for them, and nobody ever told them to be strong for me. Her death was well known in my town. I was constantly asked how my parents were doing. But they didn't ask me. I went through life shoving the loss down into a place I couldn't reach. My parents would abuse me when I acted out. I was angry, in pain, and wishing my sister would come back. I couldn't understand why this happened. I spent so many years wishing I was dead in her place. But every symptom of mourning I displayed just upset my parents and they took their own pain out on me. It took me almost a decade after her death to even try to really mourn and I still really struggle with this. 
 
 
This may be an unfamiliar topic for this sub, but I just wanted to get this out. It stays stuck in my head and I have continually felt so unheard because I'm the sibling and we are unfortunately forgotten.

This subreddit is starting to feel less safe,695,fu8icq,102,"Maybe it's just me. But even as I'm healing, it seems like people here are becoming quicker to judge, invalidate, insult, and so on. 

I understand that it can be hard for us to play nice sometimes. Our inner critic can cause us to lash out at people even over mild disagreements. 

Part of CPTSD can actually be behaving just like our abusers. We've learned very poor emotional intelligence and coping mechanisms from our families and partners, so again, I know that sometimes people being mean here is just them flashing back. 

But what I want to avoid is creating a nexus where abuse can be perpetuated. 

So here's my question: should we do something about this? Could we implement rules about calling people when they are flashing back or being aggressive or invalidating other people?

When I first came here, it was far more supportive and understanding. But lately I'm afraid to post because my last few posts, which I deleted, were mobbed by a few people saying ""I don't want to invalidate your experience but..."" and then launched into long posts invalidating my experience. 

Remember that invalidation is one of the key weapons of abusive parents and partners.

dae get insanely triggered when someone tells them to do something that’s completely obvious?,698,fe2at2,112,"this mostly happens with my parents who were very overbearing when i was growing up, while simultaneously making me completely dependent on them, and also continue to treat me like a child in my adult life, though it’s getting A BIT better. my mom is infamous for doing this, and will even stand over me as i wash dishes sometimes, telling me that i should be doing things like using hot water and scrubbing them so the food gets off of them (no shit, also i’m 23 so i think i got it by now). even though some things i think are meant to be helpful? maybe? it still feels like i’m gonna lose it when she tells me something obvious. what triggered this post was i was recently applying for a job online, and after telling me verbatim how to answer the questions and me asking her to stop, she left and then advised me that i should make sure there were no typos. it sounds dumb but i stg i almost had to leave the room to avoid losing it. idk if anyone else feels the same, but man does it trigger me badly."
My Teacher Was Suprised,692,fa3xb8,33,"It was something simple, I had asked a question about History and mentioned afterwards about the fact that he uses a pen I enjoy using because of how well it writes. He ended up joining in on the conversation even though we were in a lesson. 

He stopped after a bit and turned around wondering how the hell had I managed to drag him into a conversation about pens. 

After telling him I've had conversations about pencil lead someone else mentioned it wasn't a conversation, more of a rant about how different pencil leads feel different to me, he actually came into the conversation again and started saying that it is true though, that H pencils to B pencils to HB pencils have different lead hardness and softer lead is nicer to draw with while harder lead is better to write with. 

He then turned around and asked me, how I once again managed, with such a cheery disposition, to yet again draw him into a pointless topic like pencil lead. He said the worst bit is, is that he knew he shouldn't join in and yet couldn't stop himself from it. 

He said it was the mark of a naturally good teacher (which I want to be) to be able to elicit conversation from even the stupidest things and that would make me great at what I want to be in the future. 

I've never had praise like that, I have always had people put me down about stupid conversations or telling me to stop nattering away about nothing.

HURTING IS NOT AN EXCUSE TO HURT OTHERS.,693,eqk0pb,67,That's it. That's the big takeaway. It's really that simple. 💜
Is there anyone else who is completely alone with literally zero family or friends?,696,isjxjz,110,"A few hours ago, I binged a bag of chopped mangoes, feeling overwhelmed about being completely alone. 

I went to see a dermatologist today. The doctor and nurse were okay. But I don't completely trust my doc because I kinda had a negative experience with her once (I haven't yet processed this memory well, so I don't go into any detail).

I came home to sit on my bed alone. I didn't know what to do to let off some steam (Going to a dermatologist was an okay experience, but still seeing somebody I don't know well is stressing for a C-PTSD patient). 

Then, suddenly I remembered I was sexually attacked by an elderly male doc in Montreal General Hospital. I couldn't file a report, because I was too sick and had no one to support me.

Anyway, this negative memory triggered my sense of solitude; negative emotion flooded: being stressed out, overwhelmed and disconnected from the world. 

I have no one who can accompany me to the police station. I have no one who can stay home with me when some rude constructors come to fix my apartment.

Being alone is very dangerous in this world. I love solitude (I'm an introvert), but I hate the fact that I have no one who can help me practically (books and internet resources can help me philosophically, but often people need someone who can physically attend). 

I'm really scared that I'm totally alone in this world."
My anxiety attacks are a sign of progress,694,dtgboo,85,"I've been reading *The Body Keeps the Score* and it made me realize I've been looking at my anxiety attacks in the wrong light.

My first attack occurred in 2015. At this point, I was already 29 years old. Since then, attacks have only become more frequent, and this has worried me deeply as a sign that I'm getting worse over time instead of better.

The other night in my reading, I came across information about anxiety attacks/hypervigilance, as well as parasympathetic response (which I get very intensely after stressful events), and the chapter also touched on freezing and depersonalization. 

As I read the description of depersonalization, I began to realize that this was very familiar to me. Slowly, it sank in that my state of mind has not changed from ""normal"" pre-2015 to ""worse"" now, but that I was depersonalized and shut down prior to 2015. You know what else happened in 2015, before my first attack? I got my first therapist. I also entered into my first-ever *healthy* romantic relationship.

My anxiety attacks aren't a sign I'm getting worse. They're a sign I've become more in touch with my emotions. For the first time in my life, I'm recognizing when I'm stressed or upset instead of shutting down or walling out any feeling, positive or negative.

This doesn't make an anxiety attack a pleasant thing to have, but I can now recognize that they are actually a step in the right direction."
"Invalidation isn't only putting down your feelings or accomplishments, it's also treating you like you can't even form your own thoughts, always turning the attention back on themselves, etc. I’ve grouped some invalidating statements to help identify them, and stated why they make me feel bad.",694,eyfr9i,79,"With invalidation I find it hard to pinpoint exactly *why* a statement makes me feel like shit, because the statements aren’t outwardly or obviously “hurtful” (like saying “You suck”), so I find it harder to identify why I feel so down or “unseen” afterwards.

Not only that, I feel like there are different ways someone can be invalidating, so I’ve listed several and grouped them, to make it easier for myself to identify why the statement is invalidating:

-----

**Putting down your accomplishments or saying your success came from something else:**

-	""Yeah but it was easy.""

-	""They did it better.""

-	""It was just luck.""

-	“Even I could have done that.”

*Makes you feel like your own skills are never good enough, and that you have no right to be happy about your success.*

-----

**Denial of events that factually happened:**

-	""That didn't happen.""

-	""I didn't say that.”

-	“I would never do that.”

*Makes you feel like you are not remembering things correctly, or that you don’t even matter enough for them to acknowledge that a hurt-able person (yourself) even exists.*

-----

**Constantly questioning your capabilities or likes:**

-	""Really? You could do it?""

-	“I didn’t know you could work hard.”

-	“Why do you even *like* this?”

-	“You can’t handle that, can you?”

-	“This one’s easy, even *you* should be able to do it.”

*Makes you second-guess yourself and believe that others think you’re bad at things.*

-----

**Blaming your interpretation rather than their expression:**

-	""That’s just the way *you* feel.""

-	""You just *think* we did.""

-	""You're taking it the wrong way. Those weren't my intentions.""

-	""You're remembering it wrong.""

-	“You didn’t understand the context.”

-	""You're being too sensitive."" 

-	“Why are you getting so worked up over this?”

-	“I’m sorry *you* feel that I hurt you.”

-	“You’re just making yourself feel bad by taking it that way.”

*Makes you feel like you’re at fault for being hurt and that someone else’s hurtful actions are not their responsibility but yours to “not be hurt” even though they did the hurtful things.*

-----

**Blaming some other reason for your thoughts or feelings, treating you like you can’t make your own independent thoughts:** 

-	“You just believe that because you grew up in this country/culture.”

-	""Your generation all act like this.""

*Makes you feel like you’re stupid and some “other” thing is why you’re acting a certain way, and that you should dislike something about yourself you had no control over (were born into).*

-----

**Countering your valid complaint by turning it around to put the attention back on them before even acknowledging what you said:** 

-	“*You* step all over *me*.”

-	“You’ve hurt me too.”

-	“*You* keep using *me*.”

-	“You keep criticizing me.”

-	“I did *everything* for you.”

*Makes you feel guilty and (erroneously) selfish, while ignoring your own valid complaints.*

-----

**Deciding *for you* how you are or what you’ll like, before you’ve even put in your opinion:** 

-	“Nah you won’t like this.”

-	“You know you’re not like that.”

-	“You’ve never been able to finish these sorts of things.”

*Makes you feel like you can’t do it and others know you can’t do it before you’ve even tried.*

-----

**Declining action to make up for their previous hurtfulness, citing that you are asking for too much:**

-	“You can’t expect other people to change just because you want them to.”

-	“You’re asking for too much.”

-	“You can’t force your views on other people.”

*Makes you feel like you are demanding too much of others and being controlling, when you are asking to be treated with normal decency.*

-----

**Telling you how much they love you based on the fact that they “put up with you”:**

-	“You’ve had so many issues that I helped you with.”

-	“You take more care than most but I still love you.”

-	“See you *can* be nice when you want to be.”

-	“Look who decided to join us.”

*Makes you feel like it takes a praiseworthy amount of effort and selflessness to even put up with you because you are so hard to deal with (and that most people wouldn’t), and that they are justified in showing annoyance at you because of how difficult you are.*

-----

**Extending an “olive branch” without acknowledging or apologizing for their hurtfulness, so they can take the role of the “bigger person” and instead blame you for not accepting it:**

-	“If you ever feel like you want to reconcile, I’ll be here.”

-	“Even though you think I did all those bad things to you, I will always love you and want the best for you.”

-	“Let’s talk this out over dinner.”

-	“I’m willing to move past this, but are you?”

*Makes you feel like they are ignoring your previous anger, and you are an unforgiving or harsh person for not accepting the olive branch (even though it is an “empty” olive branch), and that they are then justified in disliking you for not accepting it.*

-----

**Being patronizing by treating you like a child or by “teaching” you lessons on how to react in a way that essentially accepts their hurtful actions:**

-	“You can be angry alllll you like.”

-	“You need to learn how to not let your emotions get the better of you.”

-	“See, what I do when I feel this way is I just step away.”

-	“You know when I was your age I also thought that, but…”

-	“I’m sure we’ve allllll said some things we regret in this conversation.”

*Makes you feel like they know you better than you know yourself, and that they are being kind by “helping” you handle yourself because you are an uneducated immature person (when you are not).*

-----

**Claiming you did something that you didn’t do, and then treating you like you’re lying when you say you didn’t do it:**

-	“Don’t kid yourself, you knew exactly what you were doing.”

-	“Ooookay then (sarcastically), if you say so.”

-	“Suuure you didn’t do it (sarcastically).”

*Makes you feel like you can and will be blamed at any time for any thing and there is nothing you can do to prove your innocence to others, and makes you believe you are being dishonest or concealing something when you are not.*

-----

**Comparing your situation to someone else’s (or an imaginary one) to minimize the hurtfulness of your situation:**

-	""I wasn't as bad as ___.""

-	“There are much worse parents out there than I was.”

-	“If I died tomorrow, then you’d see.”

*Makes you feel ungrateful for “not appreciating what you have”, and makes you feel like you can’t voice dislike about legitimately hurtful things.*

-----

**Ignoring or barely acknowledging you when you talk to them, shushing you so they can get back to what they were doing, and only wanting to talk about what they want to talk about:**

-	“Shhh I’m watching this.”

-	“Uh huh. ……Hey you know what I saw today?”

-	“Mm. Look look, the news says _____.”

*Makes you feel like you are worth less than the thing they are doing, which is usually an everyday activity (which makes you feel even worse that you are less important than it), eg. watching tv, sorting junk mail, scrolling on their phone.*

-----

**Telling you to no longer bring up something hurtful they did, even if they haven’t acknowledged it or apologized for it:**

My abusers have said almost everything in this list to me (and at least one thing in each category), and they said them *relentlessly*, without ever saying anything supportive or positive. It's not okay. 

These statements make you feel small, worthless, non-existent, and self-hating. And if they were said to you when you were a child who *trusted* your abusers and had nowhere else to go, you were forced to accept all of it, including responsibility and self-punishment for their hurtful actions.

No wonder we felt ""unseen"". We were treated like we weren't worth seeing.

EDIT: I also just want to add, some of these statements are similar to things we might say to our abusers, which can make it confusing for us because then we think ""Well maybe I'm being the abusive one then?"". The difference is, they are the ones who are hurting others, or who hurt us initially."

I mentally “checked out” and went into zombie mode to survive my trauma. I got through it; I’m safe now. My life is great. But I can’t get out of that mode. I’m still walking around in that haze.,688,ji607z,86,"I’ve come so far in my healing. I’m don’t get acute PTS symptoms like I used to. Every month and year that goes by I’m less and less reactive to my triggers. My life is good. I’m safe. I should be happy. But I can’t seem to get out of zombie survival mode. Occasionally I have a moment where life really engages me (usually when my son is being adorable and demands my attention), and I feel a glimmer of what life used to feel like before I checked out. But it’s always fleeting. I quickly fall straight back into my comfort zone — active disengagement. My husband says he misses me; he says he can’t reach me. Cognitively I want to let him and everyone else back in; but there’s this deeper and stronger part of me that won’t let that happen. It’s like once I decided to “check out,” there was no going back. I don’t know how to check back in. 

Has anyone else gone through this? How did you get over it?"

Feel like I have to be this cold angry person constantly ready in fight mode to be able to set boundries and hold them. It's exhausting and difficult :(,688,hl2qwr,72,"So I was brought up in a family with little to no boundries and never taught about boundries.

Got my Aha moment couple years ago and just had enough! I just can't anymore, so basically been in this closed off state with walls around me trying to practice boundries, which is the most difficult thing I've done, especially living with 3 people who find it difficult to accept boundries.

I am constantly irritated, scared and in flight, fight or shut down mode...I'm exhausted but it seems like every cell in my body would rather have it that way than going back to the codependent people pleaser mode.

anyone else feel like they’re always being watched/judged?,689,f9vmy1,62,"this is a feeling that i’ve slowly been trying to figure out, and it does seem to get better the more i heal from some traumas. i think it’s because my parents largely lacked boundaries both emotionally and physically, and i was judged/criticized a lot. for example, if a strand of hair was out of place, my mom wouldn’t let it go until i fixed it, my dad would constantly say i looked unhappy/bored when i was just sitting there or listening to something, and there would always be these seemingly random lectures out of nowhere that like pseudo guilt tripped me for something that i wasn’t doing? the lecture things were confusing, bc my dad would just say something like “you know, it’s always best to try your hardest and work hard, because no ones going to hold your hand and you can’t expect them to”. then i would say something like “i mean i don’t expect people to hold me hand”, and the response would be like “i didn’t say you do”, okay but then why did you go on a lecture about it for no reason? it’s hard to explain, but i think because of that i CONSTANTLY feel like i’m being watched or judged. even when i’m thinking about something, it almost feels like someone’s going to find out my thoughts and disapprove of them. i know none of this is actually happening, but it just makes me paranoid none the less."

Tattoo to mark a ‘clean’ body after 7 years,686,kwr0n9,379,"For most of my childhood and teen years I was sexually abused. It’s now 6 years since then, and a body is completely ‘new’ after 7 years. 

Now this may seem silly, but in a year my body will be ‘clean’, ‘free’, I will have a body that he never touched, you know? All my cells will have died and grown new ones instead. 

Please don’t come at me with hate if you feel differently about this, but I want to memorate that moment. I want to have a tattoo to signify that moment, to show that I am my own now and I have a body now that he’s never touched. 

However, I know what I want, but I don’t know how I want it, if that makes sense. I want it to be obvious for what it is, but also *not* what it is? 

I am wondering if anybody has any post-trauma tattoos to show they’ve survived, to show they’re still alive, to show they’ve grown etc. I would love to hear your stories/see your tattoos. I am dying for inspiration. I am thinking maybe something with flowers or so, but I have no idea. I was thinking about a teddy bear or something as well, idk 

Any inspiration?

Also, thank you so much for getting this far. I appreciate it very much, thank you!

*Edit: wow, I didn’t expect it to blow up this much! Thank you for all your kind replies and your generous awards. I appreciate all and every one of you and I will get back to everyone, just sorry if it takes abit longer, it’s nust so much!*

__Edit 2: I love all of your reactions, and sorry, I still haven’t been able to go theough all of them, but I will, I promise!
As for the tattoo, I am thinking about a snake surrounded by flowers. The snake because it sheds it’s skin and leaves behind all the bad things, the wounds, the scars, and makes a new skin after. 
I also really want the quote ‘Til it happens to you’ from Lady Gaga’s song. Of course, I won’t be able to get it for a while so I still have a lot of time to think, but that is what I want. I’ve also wanted the survivor tattoo (by Jackie Lin and Lady Gaga) for a long time so I think I will be getting that one too.__

"Did anyone else do relatively well in their teens, then just crash in their 20's? Why does the abuse seem to take a while to manifest?",690,ivkodj,155,"Question in title. \^  


For as long as I can remember, i've always had really bad anxiety. Beyond that, there weren't any other mental health concerns for me. I think I started to feel depressed around ages 19-21, then had full blown anxiety, agoraphobia, and dissociative episodes (thought I didn't know what they were, at the time.) I was 26 when it got really really bad and I ended up in inpatient three times before I was diagnosed with CPTSD. I'm 28 now, and i'm okay. Mostly just numb and confused. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, I was just wondering if this is common. Sometimes I feel like i'm making this all up in my head because I had thought I remember being 18 and telling myself/others that I was over it, that it wasn't that bad, that I understood why it happened, etc. But it just came crawling back. Or maybe I just wanted an excuse to feel miserable. IDK

I didn't assert myself because I didn't have to, I didn't fawn because *I didn't have to*, I just acknowledged it and moved on. If he's okay with it, great. If he's not okay with it, I can move on to the next guy.

"Mentally going back to the past as an adult to protect your younger self is very different than bringing your younger self to the present to try and ""re-do"" scenarios where you protect them.",693,igtj5f,57,"This could just be me, but I found this distinction very important. In my mind, the goal for both was to ""protect my younger self now that I could, essentially showing myself that I was safe now because I could stand up to my abusers"". But they gave very different results.

**Adult me mentally time-traveling to my past** allowed me to use my new-found resources to say ""No, you hurt me when I was little but I am not little *anymore* and I no longer accept this treatment."" 

It was an acknowledgement that there was in fact a time I could not stand up for myself, *and* that things were different *now*. Adult me was in charge now.

But **younger me coming to the present** (with the same goal, mind you) ended up like adult-me parading younger-me around in everyone's faces, wanting to ""stand up to"" my abusers, and ""be unafraid of telling everyone else about it"". 

It was *not* an acknowledgement that there was an unchange-able time that I was in fact helpless, but rather a denial to accept what happened in the past, and a want to use my present-self to use my ""adult powers"" now to do the ""bidding"" of my younger-self. 

It was like instead of fighting back against present and future mistreatment, I was trying to retroactively get the ""stand up to my abusers"" moments that my younger-self didn't get back then. The emotions of younger-me were still in control.

This manifested itself as anger at my abusers, wanting to not only place blame on them for *all past events*, but have *them* know I was placing blame on them (whether they agreed with me or not, and of course they did not), and have *everyone else I could tell* that my parents were abusers and the blame is on them.

And for a while I thought, ""But anger is good right? That's what Pete Walker's books said. Anger is necessary in order to place blame on the correct people."" So why did I feel like this was unhealthy somehow? Like it was almost...dangerous? I mean, I would be kicking up quite a storm. But maybe this is what they deserved since I was telling the truth? Maybe I need to just not be so afraid of exposing them?

I felt weak for not being able to tell everyone about them for fear of retaliation by them. 

And then someone who also had parental abusers said, ""I don't bother taking things out on them to their face because it won't change anything. I tell people if I want to, and it makes me feel closer with them, but otherwise it doesn't really bother me.""

And I realized they were right. **It won't change anything.** I re-read parts of Pete Walker's book and realized he says that it is usually not necessary to actually anger against your abusers when they are physically there. 

And this is when I realized that bringing my adult self mentally back to the past to protect my younger self was healthy grieving but the opposite was not. Bringing the adult me back in time was good because I was angering and blaming in a safe environment, not needing to do it in-person, not needing anyone else to react a certain way or have a certain understanding, and not needing everyone to ""see how my younger self is now protected"". 

It was an understanding that the point was not to use my adult self's capabilities now to do the bidding of my younger self as if to ""undo"" the pain and helplessness I went through, but to know that the past happened but that I am not helpless *anymore*."

DAE not really learn much about hygiene stuff from their parents?,691,mji4xn,160,"I've been learning that I don't really know much about hygiene and such because my parents hygiene is... Questionable, to say the least. I'm pretty sure the last year I lived with my parents I could count the number of times my mother bathed on one hand...

Like, I struggle to shower more than once every week or so, partly because I'm exhausted all the time and finding the motivation and such to do it is difficult, but when I do I find that there's shit I don't really know how to deal with. For example, I don't really know how to deal with having a bunch of dead skin, especially on my face and neck. 

And I don't really feel comfortable talking about things like this with people I know, since I often feel like I'm really disgusting to everyone else, and it's just embarrassing being around people a lot of the time even if they're totally unaware and I'm simply being paranoid over everything. (So I usually stay in my room most of the time...)"
Was anyone else raised to be a people pleaser?,690,ko3hi0,74,"And if so, how did you stop hurting your own feelings by having this expectation that, out in the real world, people would be just as considerate of you as you are of them? (The whole ""treat others how you want to be treated,"" dillemma.)

When I care about someone, I consider how they'd appreciate or disapprove of almost everything I do for them, and my actions go from there. I hurt my own feelings way too often by overdoing doing nice things for people, things they probably have no clue so much thought could even go into. And then I  take it personally when they do things that make it obvious they didn't consider me or how I'd be affected by it at all. 

It's really wearing me thin, and I just don't know how to really let it go; the expectation, the perceived slite against me, the toxic over-thoughtfulness towards others. Any of it. I've been trying, and I'm really good at tricking myself into believing I'm not bothered by these things and have truly let it go, but it all comes to a head eventually and I find myself ... resentful.

That leads to my second concern; what criteria is there for deciding what's an overreaction on my part, or an obvious lack of consideration action that another person has done? When is the anger justified? Because there's *always* ""reasons,"" and it's almost always that I'm too sensitive and expect too much. 

It seems like the dumbest thing to be upset about-being kind, but it's really ruining my life. My connections with friends, family and even my partner. My own concept of self worth. My ability to form and stand by boundaries. This is one major insecurity wrapped up in a pleasing-to-others package."
"“Grief is really just love. It’s all the love you want to give, but cannot.

DAE feel ashamed doing household tasks in front of others,685,g79971,76,"This is an odd one, but I think other people must be feeling it too. I feel embarrassed cooking or cleaning in front of other people because I had to learn how to do these things myself, and it seems people who grew up in a stable household always know the ""right"" way of doing these things.

As one example, loading a dishwasher. My mom and older brother would let dishes pile up, and I had to figure out how to use the dishwasher so it would not stink like dirty dishes and to avoid getting screamed at for it being messy (this started when I was around 5 or 6). Because no one taught me, I didn't know that certain things are supposed to go on the top rack and bottom rack. A friend's parent kindly told me I was doing it wrong once when I tried to put my dish in the dishwasher at her house, and it made me feel self conscious about the way I load the dishwasher, even though she had the kindest intentions.

Now, whenever I am at someone else's house, I am absolutely terrified to put my dishes in the dishwasher because I am worried I'll do it wrong. But at the same time, I'm terrified of leaving the dish in the sink because that leaves a mess and it feels so rude.

So I guess the point here is, how do you deal with not knowing how to do things properly, but also feeling ashamed of doing things wrong?

i was sexually abused at 9 and kept the same perspective as her until very recently. i was so ashamed and caught up in that narrative that little girl believed: she was different, something was wrong with her, she’s worthless. i’m 20 and logically i have always known it wasn’t my fault but i really held on to little me’s beliefs about what happened. now i’m looking back and it’s so sad. she was completely innocent... and a man decided to target her for his own sick gain. 

i used to love webkinz, club penguin, etc. i LOVED bratz and barbies too! me and my similar aged cousins would play and have fun, but that changed as soon as it happened. it’s sad that he ruined her childhood innocence and joy. my family also helped squash it but he definitely left the biggest mark.

I have realised that there was never anything fundamentally wrong with me,687,ghksrc,80,"F(21) CPTSD.

&#x200B;

I have done a lot of work on myself to overcome my past. Sort through every memory, thought, behavior and emotion. I have done CBT, MDMA therapy, personal development strategies, somatic therapy and ketamine drug therapy, you name it I've done it. I am in the best state I have ever been in predominantly because I have went through my memories and accepted how I felt during them and recognized that it did happen.

The most beneficial thing you can do for yourself is recognize what has happened and fully understand it, step into your memories. Take the time to go through your memories, because this is a part of your sense of self, and to regain a more holistic and human perception of yourself, you must understand how you felt in all those memories and how others were, and create a realistic narrative that empowers you. You must be able to see what is consistent about yourself. I know this may be what therapy is, but you do it yourself everyday too. The most important conversation you have is with yourself, because its there everyday.

Its the only way to move forward because your brain is working to avoid pain, you have to look at the memories that caused pain to prevent them from happening again. To learn from it.

Recovering from CPTSD is not just about getting back to a neutral state, it is about understanding what happened, feeling it and forming the tools to identify and deal with the same and similar situations.

I'm saying this because last night I realized that there was this one thought that had been going around in my head for 8+ years, that had been tormenting me and had constructed the way I do things. which was

""There's something wrong with me""

I picked myself apart for years trying to figure it out, at one point i drove myself into a hole, where I stopped doing anything that was associated with myself, I wouldn't say 'I', the pronoun, because I thought I was so insignificant to other people that I should never talk about myself otherwise I'm selfish, or acknowledge my own feels or thoughts. This drove me to the edge of nearly stepping off a bridge because I thought that I was unable to function as a human, I believed that I was unable to be like everyone else and that there was something fundamentally wrong with me.

But last night I realized, while going through my memories, that that thought originated from my mum telling me or shouting at me that there is something wrong with me over and over again. She would tell me that I wasn't her daughter, that i was a illness.

There was never anything fundamentally wrong with me. If I hadn't have went through my memories I would not have been able to identify that that thought did not originate from my own mind and came from an external unjust source. I am human with human faults that I can work on and grow from there. And to me that is beautiful. I finally believe that I am capable of living a rich life.

If you have negative thoughts- criticisms- about yourself think about where they originated from, or who they originated from and is that person qualified to give you that judgement? Probably not."
Is anyone else getting triggered by all the national gaslighting happening right now??,684,etczj1,208,"Ok, I have no idea if this is going to be against the rules or anything because this is going to be somewhat political, but, here goes.

A very simple observation at the root of my issues,683,e5cx7s,105,"I've known for a while that my trauma from early childhood neglect was ""pre verbal"" - meaning the assumption was formed before i had words to describe it. 

I think this is why I've struggled to name the root ""belief"" that I'm trying to solve. 

Is it ""im not good enough"" 

Or ""there's something wrong with me""

Or maybe ""I shouldn't exist"" ?

Well, its all of these. And yet none of them really encapsulates the core toxic shame. 

Because it's simply this: ME BAD. 

Yep, ""me bad"" -- that feeling, that belief -- is the extent of the sophistication of my core wound. It's basic. 

It's so easy to over-analyze it because we have more words now than we did when it was internalized. And all those extra words don't really help me dissect it further. 

So-- I guess im gonna try working with its opposite -- at the feeling level, rather than the intellectual level. I'll do this by telling myself ME GOOD! Like a caveman. 

I tried this tonight and it actually made me feel better. 

Just my latest theory, mostly writing it down here so i dont forget later. Hopefully it's useful to someone else.

* It's not a competition who's got it worse, all bad experiences affecting us as adults are valid and they count.
* How you feel ""normal"" here, and realise you do have symptoms but almost everyone else here also has it or relates to it to some extent, you're not as much of a freak as you thought.
* There's a weird air of hope and positivity despite this being literally a sub for prolonged trauma
* Most of us don't dwell on how bad we've got it, we seek validation and solutions and there's a lot of progress posts here too
* A lot of people here don't actually have CPTSD, but they're doing it for a partner, which tells me there is hope for love for all of us
* We're such tough cookies :) I love you all
* As much as I want to add all the great points that people have mentioned here that were not in my post, I'd rather keep it short but general. But there is one point I HAVE to add and that is our mods are the absolute best! This sub wouldn't be what it is if it weren't for them, I wouldn't be here writing this post if it wasn't true for this sub. It's **extremely** easy for mental illness subs to turn negative and dramatic very fast (which is understandable, ngl) but thanks to our mods, this hasn't happened here!

"The anguish of spending time with a ""good"" family",681,e5s3xj,117,"My spouse's family is a ""good"" family. The ""secure attachment, solid marriages, raise-their-kids-the-right-way family."" They bicker and they're all too smart to ever back down from a debate, but it's a family the way one is supposed to be. Now that my sister-in-law has kids (our 5 y/o niece and 2 y/o nephew) the house is loud and full and chaotic, but in that way they always portray houses during big holidays in movies. 

I have spent years trying to learn I don't have to always be ""on"" and pleasant around them, graciously helping with every little task or chore, never resting, always looking for something to do, lest they discover what I already feel in the bottom of my lungs: that I am, in fact, not actually good enough for their son. I have achieved one of the greatest cons of my life; I ""married up."" When will they notice? 

His family loves me and I don't understand. I haven't *done* anything. 

On Friday, as I watched these loud, boisterous, confident children work through their good emotional regulation skills with their good parents, I just started sobbing. My therapist has tried so hard to get me to understand ""inner child"" work and I couldn't get there. I couldn't see myself as a child. I've been parentified my whole life. But I watch these little ones, crying for no apparent reason, being soothed, having mom or dad ask them, ""why are you sad, honey?"" and then reassured, ""I know it's hard when you have to share your toys...,"" and I finally get it. And I'm in such grief for a childhood that never existed."
Does anyone else have really high standards for people and relationships now that they’ve learned about abuse and toxic behaviours?,682,i4hh4b,86,"I feel like I don’t give any second thoughts for people displaying toxic behaviours anymore. Or just have higher standards in general for what kind of people I want in my life because I can finally see how every relationship affects me. Like if you don’t genuinely like me for who I am or make me feel slightly uncomfortable (even if it was an accident), goodbye 👋 your shitty energy is not staying in my life"
"Anyone else generally a nice person but the moment someone mistreats you, you turn into an asshole?",682,fmj3dr,119,Most people would say I am a kind person but the moment someone is an asshole to me my first instinct is to be an even bigger asshole than them. It's like I have to one up them somehow and show them I am crazier than they are. It could be a survival mechanism or perhaps pent up rage.
Projecting my trauma brain onto other people and then calling them abusive: a story,683,enpuwb,92,"Cognitive distortions. I knew I experienced them but I had no idea how deep they went. I'm feeling really scared and overwhelmed and hopeless right now, because I can't trust my own reality. Here's what happened.

About eight months ago I started dating this guy. One time when I was at his house, he left the room for a few minutes so while I was waiting I went on reddit on my phone. 

When he came back he said, ""What are you doing?"" 

I felt defensive and reacted: ""Just looking at my phone, why?"" 

He replied: ""Oh, I was just wondering. When we're together I don't really look at my phone; it's just foreign to me.""

That was it. And I jumped to the following conclusions: He doesn't like me going on my phone. He's suspicious and controlling. I need to stop using my phone when we're together or he will get mad at me.

Fast forward eight months, all of which I've walked on eggshells and braced myself for interrogation or shaming every time I look at my phone when we're together. I started announcing ""I'm just responding to my mom!"" every time I sent a text.

I was at his house and something strange happened. He was texting someone, for a pretty long time! I said, ""who are you texting?"" and he said ""oh, someone from my class had a question and I'm answering it.""

I felt the righteous indignation rise up in me. I was trying to figure out how to confront him about this double standard, and he noticed I was acting weird and asked me what's wrong.

""*What's wrong?* All these months, you gave me SO MUCH SHIT about going on my phone!""

He was confused and asked what I was talking about. I told him ""You always would ask me what I'm doing on my phone and you said it's foreign to you! And now you're doing it!""

He said, ""Yeah, it's foreign to me, but it didn't bother me. I would only have a problem if we were actively trying to do something together and you were glued to your phone.""

And it hit me: he didn't give me ""so much shit"" about it. He asked me a question and told me the way he is. And I *never asked for clarification*. Because I was raised to believe that if people are different from you, they're wrong and should change. I was raised to believe that if someone questions you, it means they are judging and criticizing you. 

I didn't know there was another way to live. I didn't know that someone could just... ask a question without being motivated to change or shame the other person. I wasted eight months projecting this nasty energy onto our relationship: he doesn't like me and I need to change.

Of course, now I'm thinking ""is he gaslighting me? There's *no way* he wasn't trying to control me all this time...""

My head hurts and my heart hurts and I feel so defeated. How many other events in my life have I distorted by projecting my trauma onto them? How many people have I written off as ""toxic"" or ""abusive"" when I never was curious about their intentions and instead jumped to conclusions? I think that makes me the toxic one...

I've been working on recovery for over a year now... and it keeps getting harder. This is a really sobering realization for me. I know my life will improve as I integrate this, but it feels like the biggest hurdle yet."
"My mum constantly would tell me I was a drama queen, 'a lot for anyone to love', etc. I just realised that everyone since I left home (friends, co-workers, boyfriends) would tell me I'm low maintenance, super chilled out, and really easy going?",683,datqmt,89,"Like I feel I've just had a massive revelation. Growing up my mum would constantly complain about me. She would tell me I was a drama queen for being upset or frustrated, told me 'it will take a very special man to be able to put up with you', get angry with me for anything and everything. 

I'm not sure if my personality changed because of this pressure from my mum or if it's never changed, but I've changed the people around me. I left home to go to university and would constantly be told I was easygoing and laid back. I've had boyfriends remark on how low-maintenance I am (to the point it's a negative, lol). 

But now I can't decide why this is. Have I boxed up and hidden some aspect of my personality from everyone I've met since I left home (10 years ago)? Or was I always relaxed and low maintenance and my parents are just insane."

I realized how much of my life has been spent feeling unsafe and I can’t imagine a reality in which I could feel any other way.,682,ld2g9f,43,I feel like I’m only half alive.
Just found out childhood emotional neglect is a thing,682,fnvitf,117,"It's really weird to find out that what I've been going through my whole life has a name and it's not ""normal."" My parents are nice. They cook food, take us places, normal parent stuff right? But I think my mom, brother, and I are kinda afraid to talk to our dad. He's not bad, he just doesn't talk or spend time with us much. The most we spend time together is on vacation, but he can be an asshole and get impatient when we take too long somewhere and even then, he still doesn't spend much time with us on vacation because he gets bored and does his own thing. I only talk to him when I need something and even then it can be a little scary approaching him. He never asks about my life, only if he needs to know something like ""What time do I pick you up from school?"" I remember he'd take my brother and I to eat lunch when my mom worked but he doesn't anymore. 

My mom is alright. My brother and I spend more time with her, but I still don't feel much of a connection to her. She asks me ""how are you doing"" sometimes but I just say ""uhuh."" I don't feel like I can talk about my emotions with my parents and that fact that you're supposed to feels weird and abnormal. I also don't feel like I can talk about what I like to do or what I did when my mom asks me ""What did you do today?"" but I don't know why.  Maybe it feels too personal. Now that I think about it, I don't really want to know how my parents are doing. It feels gross to ask them ""How are you?""

I barely remember any instances where they comforted me and or shown physical affection. Just the thought of it is repulsive. The concept of love is weird. The only times I hear ""love you"" is when my mom ends a call or leaves for work. I'm sure my parents love me but I feel distant from them but also bound only because we're familiar with each other and biologically related I guess. Do I love them? I'm not sure. I'm not even sure what that means. I know I do care about them. 

I feel distant from people and don't feel like I belong anywhere. I feel like it's hard to make deeper connections with people and I think I'd like to have that but it feels weird. I've never really had anyone to talk about my feelings with and I keep it inside. I remember being in different friends groups but never close with anyone. I barely participated and people would say I don't talk much. I don't feel like I've ever really expressed myself. I'm too hesitant and indecisive sometimes. I don't think there was ever anyone who I could completely be myself around and not be afraid of judgement. I feel like I have to hide everything I do around people. I don't want them to know I'm drawing or writing or exercising or stuff like that.

I might have gotten off track there haha but I just wanted to put it out there. It feels wrong to put all this here though. Maybe I shouldn't. My parents aren't bad people. They didn't intend to do this and maybe this is the wrong thing and nothing wrong has happened and how they have parented me is normal and I'm overreacting and incorrectly self-diagnosing...

It all just feels very weird. I'm only in high school and still live with my parents. This will definitely change how I think about them but there's nothing much to do and I can keep living normally. If you read through this, thank you!"

Just realized how much rage I feel towards the people who knew something was wrong and decided to look the other way.,671,dmz3bo,102,"I just wrote a poem that was supposed to be geared towards my abuser.

After my abuser was arrested, so many adults told me ""I just knew something was wrong, but I didn't want to assume."" 

I'm glad they got to remain comfortable in their ignorance. I was a little girl and I was horribly abused, but at least they got to sleep soundly having decided to look the other way. 

Seriously did not know this anger was here until today and my god is it powerful. 

Here's to hoping there's something left of me on the other side of this rage.

"How abusers make you feel like you deserve nothing: they create an ""owing"" system where there isn't one.",674,e68xtu,114,"No one *objectively* owes anyone else. Everyone makes decisions based on the information they have, the relationship with the person, etc.

In the name of justice and fairness, we do feel sometimes that we owe things to others but that feeling of ""owing"" is within you and the other person. It doesn't actually exist as a tangible thing outside of that.

What abusers do to make you feel like you deserve nothing that they give you, is create an owing system where there shouldn't be one. And because we are kind people who trusted our abusers, we thought they were right when in fact they were fabricating something that shouldn't have existed.

For example, if I ask a coworker to pass me the pencil sitting on their table, they would do it gladly or neutrally. That's all. The end. They're not ""being kind"", and I'm not ""being selfish"". There's literally nothing there.

If I asked my abuser to do it, they may do it and then say, ""Aren't you going to give me something in return?"" or ""I passed you that pencil earlier, the least you could do is this favor for me."" And they might top it off with ""You just *use* people for your own wants! You step all over me!""

And now you feel bad because someone is saying they are hurt and that you *use* people. And because you are a kind and insightful person, you think ""Oh gosh I really don't want to hurt people and I *really* don't want to use people because that's horrible"". 

And then it happens over and over no matter what you do, and now you can never ask for anything because (sarcasm warning) you *must* be a terrible person for *asking* for things, and you don't deserve anything because you weren't *kind enough* to give them a favor after they so kindly gave you the pencil.

And you *believe* them because you believe everyone's feelings are valid so you respect them enough to trust that they really have been hurt by you.

**Nope. Stop there.** 

They have *created* a system of owing where none should have existed. They literally created a negative situation which places all the blame on you, out of nothing.

*This* is what a toxic person is. *This* is what an abusive person does. They are so far into their beliefs and delusions and they have made you live in their house of mirrors. 

**Many things in the world have no owing system. Abusers have just made it so that literally every interaction with them is part of some owing system.**

Disclaimer: I'm sure you all know this already but for the sake of completeness I'm just going to say ""Obviously don't be terrible and steal from others"", but the point is that in the world there is actually no ""owing system"" for a lot of things until you get into serious territory."
“It's Like Being in an Abusive Relationship with Society”: How a Black Therapist Is Treating Protest Trauma,673,h8vzjb,40,
i 25 year old male just found this subreddit a few days ago and have never felt so understood before,677,gpqc2d,67,"I felt alone, empty, without any will and with a only few days left to study for exams to get to college i started searching for why was i like this and why can't i just do this damn one simple thing. i broke down crying after reading about CPTSD and reading some stories here which led me deep in my mind. I did some thinking before but not like this and i never posted anything like this before but i need to let this out     **(very long post and trigger warnings)**

&#x200B;

I always knew i didn't have a normal family and life but i never realy understood it as i do now and i am shaking as i am writing this for the first time in my life. When my mom was young her parents sepparated and her sister went to live with the mother but my mom went to live with her father, who then sent her to live with her grandmother in another country. She told me she was crying for a whole year because she was very young, didn't understand why it happened and to make it worse she didn't speak the language and felt so alone as she couldn't even talk to her grandmother. She then somehow made it through and finished school there and came back to the city she lived in before being sent away. Later she met a man, they married and had my half sister but that man was no good. He didn't allow her to have a driver's licence and to this day in her 60s she still doesn't have it. Whey they divorced he abandoned them.

Not long after my mom and my half sister were visiting someone in Bosnia before the war started and they caught the last bus out when the driver took pity on them and allowed them to go on board. After some time she met my father who was even worse, this tall dark and dangerous man who was a drug dealer and smuggled people and god knows what else over the border. She was selling his drugs at her job and later before i was born he abandoned us. My parents weren't married and since he didn't sign papers stating he was my father he didn't pay any allimony but sometimes he sent a box of candy and a toy so my mother had to do everything on her own. I only have two memories of my father in with the first being at 5 years old when i asked him what he was doing and he twisted my arm and my mothers and at 10 when he bought me a gameboy. My half sister had to get a job for us to survive. My mothers sister is an alcoholic and her husband used to beat her, my cousin is a junkie who doesn't take care of his child and my mother tried to help but when my grandmother was dying my aunt and her husband forged the will and stole all the money and items in the house before notifying my mother of the fact her own mother was dying. After her death my mom went to a lawyer who was corrupt and threatened to hurt her so she cut all contact with that side of the family.

This is where my life starts, We moved about 7 times so i changed a few kindergardens and schools in the same city and always had to make new friends. I was always full of energy when i was young and the fastest runner in class, i loved to run and even have a few gold and silver medals. My mother never said she loved me, never hugged me and just beat me with a steel item so much that it bent. I was crying so much and yelling and at the time some children from around my block listened to our door when it was happening and were laughing at me and teasing me about it outside. I think she hates me because of my father and because i wasn't a good boy. To this day she says i am cruel and heartless, few days ago she was watching something about nazis she said i am like them and for years when i was very depressed and needed her she was saying i look like a homeless man for years and to just get a job since i didn't finish school. Whenever someone else is helping her she always praises that person even now and just says i should watch so i know how to do it next time. Even when my ex girlfriend was at my place she was putting me down in front of her. When i was about 4 i was sexualy assaulted by a older boy in the next room to my mother and her friend when we went for a visit. He put his hand on my mouth so i couldn't scream and another boy was there just looking. He put down my pants and did things to me. Once they came to visit us and when he came to my room i put my pants down myself, i don't know why and he said something about telling but i don't remember all. From 5 do about 8 i hung out with the local homeless people who were all allcholics but they were nice to me and i told one of them that i wanted a toy and he said he would buy it for me. I never did get it and i don't think they were inappropriate but it was the most kindness i got for a long time.

We were poor and usually didn't have much food mostly just bread and sometimes nothing so my mother had to bring her food from work so i had something to eat but sometimes it was not enough since mostly all we had was about 5 to 10€ for a whole month. One time i had to ask my half sister for a few euros for food because my mother was embarrassed to do it. These days it's a little better but my mother still goes to a food bank and i can't get used to the fridge not being empty, it's strange. I always loved to draw and because there was no money for toys i just made my own from paper and i played with those. I called them my paper uncles but was embarrassed to show them or even tell it to anyone. When i was about 9 i went with my mother for food shoping and i saw a small lego car that i really wanted and when we went to the cash register my mother didn't have enough money for food and the toy so i she had to return some food and even now i still feel guilty for wanting that damn toy. After this i started stealing toys from shops and legos from other children. At about 10 i started stealing some other items along with toys and selling them so i had some money. This is also when i started skipping class to go to children shops to consult and try to make some money or get some toys.

At that time in school there was a mandatory swimming class but i didn't know how to swim and was only at the beach once and my mother didn't teach me she was just swimming alone. The teacher didn't do anything to help me so i tried on my own and was doing okay but still today i can't swim. Then we had to do a bike licence test and since i had no bike and nobody taught me ride one i had to learn on my own. I borrowed a bike from a classmate and tried riding...strangely i was riding a bike for the second time in my life and this time i was actually biking. I came to my block and yelled to my mom to look i can drive a bike and all she said was that i stopped yelling. I had a few weeks to practice and my mom bought me a bike. I had to learn fast how to ride good. At the test we had to drive around obstscles carefuly and slowly with a cup of water in one hand to put on the table which somehow i did on my first try.

At about 13 we moved to a flat in a house that had only the one room so i had to live with my mother for years in that one room and all we had separating us was a closet and a curtain. When one of us wanted to go to the bathroom we had to go through a group hallways where the owner and his family were always walking to do laundry so we had no privacy not even when one of us was alone. One day my mother woke me up screaming that there is a flood i woke up and immediatily jumped in the water to unplug everything as the water was almost at the sockets. A few minutes later and i would be dead. At this time i was also depressed and my mother bought me a laptop and it went downhill from there. i started sweating all the time and not going to school. I was just playing video games to escape this reality. One day for a stupid reason some kids i knew came to where i lived and i went with them to a seclued place nearby and one put a gun to my head, probably his brothers since he was in prison for illegal firearms.

I started to go to a social worker who was terrible. I was also assigned some psychiatrists, none who understood me they just started to put me on pills. My school was one of the worst in the country as teacher were hurting kids and verbaly abusing them, and if you had discounted school lunch they would mock you. At 13 even the social worker in school asked if i was retarded and double checking if they mistakingly put me one class grade up. She then gave me a book in english to read which i had no problem reading and she was shocked since english isn't the primary language in my country and i never opened a schoolbok on the subject in my life. she then said she would help me finish the year by talking to the teachers and when the time came for it she went on holiday. a Few days later she came to my flat and said i failed the class. After all this i was so mad and depressed as i felt everyone failed me so i just stayed home all the time and i wasn't kind to my mother i was angry at her and everyone so one day in rage i grabbed a knife so she called the police and they called an ambulance to take me to a psychiatric ward for children. The first day i spent the whole day just sitting and being in my head. I was locked there for a month behind bars and wasn't allowed to go outside unlike the other kids. This was also the first time in my life i was not hungry and even got a bit chubby since there were anorectic girls who didn't eat much and i was taught to never leave food and even force myself to eat it if necessary which i still do today. I told the people there that i can't fall asleep since about 9 but they just said i was hyperactive and put me on sleeping and antipsychotic pills in the morning and night so i felt like a zombie for years. After that month they put me in an institute for troubled youth  where i stayed for 2 years. The first day two workers took me to my room and said they were like my new mom and dad. I cried and escaped the second they went away. I ran out hiding in the corn field and the female worker somehow saw me and came by with her car saying i should go back with her and i did. I was living there and going to school there while on all sorts of pills without any control. I was allways tired and sleeping in class, in english class i said to the teacher if i do the test with no errors right now i can sleep at her class and she agreed. I finished the test in a few minutes with no errors which she could't believe but she let me sleep in class and since there were only about 4 of us in class it wasn't a problem. If one of the teachers didn't say i wass sleeping in class all the time i don't know where i would be today. After he said that they just gave me pills at night but if i didn't take them i wasn't allowed to eat and had to go upstairs in my room which i shared with another boy. I had to show them that i swallowed the pill but thankfully sometimes they forgot to give it to me. Here is also where i learned how terrible my eyesight is as i didn't see the tv unless i was really close. I knew i didn't see good and walking around town not seeing faces wasn't  the best but i didn't tell anyone and when i got glasses at 15 i could see the leaves on trees.

I finished primary school in that way and went to live back home with my mother and i started going to high school, which was horrible and i stopped after one month. Years of doing nothing went by and i was so depressed i stopped taking care of myself. I didn't shower much. didn't brush my teeth i wanted to die but on pills i had no will to kill myself so i just waited to die and didn't expect to live to 20. We moved again but this time it was 10km from the city and i had no bike no drivers licence and for the weekends no buses so i just walked 10km to the city and 10km back every weekend for years. At about 19 i was out drinking and doing drugs while on pills and one night i woke up near the train tracks with my head busted. I went in and out of consciousness until i managed to pull myself up. I started walking and the next thing i know i heard a sound behind and felt a strong wind. The train went by as i was going past its tracks and if i went 5 seconds later i would be dead. I twisted my ankle and called a friend if i can stay at his place instead of walking 10km to my place. The next day i decided to stop taking pills and go back to school and i did.

I was 20 alive and back in school with 15year olds. It was hard, i didn't study, the kids where shitty to me and my friends were laughing at me but in the last two weeks i studied 4 subjects a day every day and i finished my first year of high school with all grades and even had an average grade. The next year i met a girl and we were together for a small amount of time and she did have her problems with cutting herself, being depressed etc but i started drinking and coming to her place drunk all the time so she had to take of my shoes and even made some food. I am sorry i was so shitty to her i have no excuses. Even with her i couldn't sleep as i was allways tense and expecting some danger. To this day i can't sleep with someone else and don't like to be touched as it feels dangerous and always expect something to happen. Not long ago i started hugging with some people since they initiated it and even if it felt akward i still wanted to try it.

I then failed second year of highschool as i just couldn't do it anymore as my heart was beating strange i was sweating even more i started to lose my hair and just locked myself up. My half sister had a mental breakdown a was in a mental institution for some time. My friends were mostly junkies now and i didn't hang out with anyone so i googled how to meet new people and how to spend time and one answer stuck with me: start volunteering. So i did at a intergenerational center where i started to work with children and older people. Here i met women in their 40s and 50s that were kind, fit and wished were my mothers or even my future girlfriends but for that to happen i had to change. I also started teaching older people about computers an phones...me a nobody with no school who did nothing in life. Here i got an apportunity to be on camera for something about my city and i didn't want to do it but...i needed that, i was so stuck in my life that i just had to do something drastic. The day came when i was on camera and then i was the comments and they were all about me sucking which hurt me as i did my best.

This is when i also joined a support group for troubled youth which wasn't really for me...i know they tried to help but i wasn't a kid anymore and it reminded me too much like when i was locked up when they said i have to be there every day or they will toss me out and such. At the time i was a student who paid for school with students status and i applied for work and they called me the next day to work in sales. This wasn't the first time i worked but it was the first legal job. There they called me radio voice as a joke since i have a deeper voice and i said fuck it i will join a radio and someone there said they had a contact they can give me if i want. I took it and the next day i met with that person and decided to give it a try. Since then i had a few guests like a rapper, someone who works with addicts, someone who works in a school for adults and a fitness trainer. Almost all of those were live and i was scared and my voice was trembling and sweating fuck it was hard but it shouldn't be it's just talking to someone. At the support group they didn't throw me out as they saw i was broken and one of the workers sat me down and said i was worth it...i didn't know what to say to that i never heard something like it before and last year they said i should go for a youth exchange in another country for two months.

I went and it's hard to explain... i was living in a small bungalow with 4 other people from other countries in the woods and no locked doors yet nobody tried to steal anything and have never felt this safe and calm before in my life. I didn't sweat one day where before i was sweating everyday for i don't know how many years. There i saw a glimpse of true happines that i wanted to have. Our mentor was also a psychology major with experiences helping people. She helped me with somatic theraphy once a week and it changed me. When i called my mother one day she said some people were trying to steal our sort of pavilion back home and i realized i was living in fear of constant danger and that is why my body was always tense and sweating since our city is called the drug city of our country and i was looking for an escape in video games and such.

when i came back i decided i will try dating again but i didn't know how as all my experiences were with troubled girls and now that i met some normal ones i don't know how to approach it. Heck i don't even know how to go for a kiss since i only ever did it high or drunk. When they ask why don't i have at least a highschool and no money and no car or even drivers licence...what do i even say...where to start. I went on a few dates but it went nowhere as i think i come of as if i don't care or something. I know i am not the best at emotions as some people have told me i am cold.

So i decided to just pay some money and focus on school and do the final exams to get to college. It didn't workout as planned as i had to work alot so we also have money for food since my mother is retired for a few years and has a small pension. I just went back to being depressed and sweating all the time so much that at work my coworkers have to vipe the sweat from the keyboard and i fucking hate it and don't know what to do about it. In february i started going to the gym with a friend but now with this pandemic, my half sister being pregnant and not working and having no money while taking the bigest exam of my life it was too much and i broke down...then i found this subreddit and started writing a journal. I am also angry alot so i started shadowboxing and it helps somewhat. I have also stopped using the computer that much and the music i listen to. One day i was actually so calm i didn't sweat at all and can feel things i can't explain. I also remember some normal things or even happy when calm. It feels strange to be happy but it's a nice feeling i haven't felt in so many years. My hair is starting to grow back and maybe i will also have less grey hair. Now i have only a few days to learn enough of 4 years worth of 5 subjects and read and remember 4 books for essay to pass the exams to get to college. I still feel like a failure everyday, i know i can do more but i don't and it bothers me.

Was anyone else suicidal in childhood?,675,j0qq5o,171,"TW - talk about suicidal ideation 

Edit: I wish I could respond to everyone, but I had no idea how many people experienced this. Please know that I’ve read your comment and you’ve been heard. Sending warmth and love to everyone who has felt this way. If you’re still struggling with these thoughts and feelings please know you’re not alone - I hope you are able to reach out for help. 

Was anyone else suicidal in childhood? 

When I was 9, I remember casually responding to a 4th grade journal prompt by writing about wanting to die. 

Due to the trauma I was experiencing, I did know what I was writing about and what it meant to die. I knew how it could be accomplished. But I didn’t realize that it was a concerning anomaly to feel that way or express it. 

I also was not able to disclose any of the abuse, and was terrified when I was sent to the guidance counselor to talk about what I wrote and they started asking a lot of questions.  

I was asked directly if anyone was hurting me and the only answer I was able to give was an automatic and emphatic no. I had a chance to tell, listening ears for the first time, and I chose to stay silent. 

My parents were called. My mom and picked me up from school. She was livid. She said the right but dismissive things to the school and took me home. She told me I was going to end up in foster care and dead if I kept being so dramatic, stop acting that way and stop embarrassing her. 

School insisted I see a therapist. There was a nice lady who came to meet with me at school. She was small and pale and had beautiful dark long curly hair. I couldn’t talk about anything though, despite wishing I could, and I sat in silence staring at the floor until I waited her out and she stopped coming to take me out of class. 

I became pretty chronically suicidal, as a desire to escape abuse and later as a wish to escape the resulting CPTSD symptoms. I spoke up more as an adolescent and received some mental health treatment but still couldn’t disclose any trauma, so the treatment providers missed what was going on and how to help. 

Did anyone else experience these wishes and desires when they were that young? Did you ever say anything? Did anyone help?"

I told my grandparents about my diagnosis.,668,ex980z,58,"They asked how I would have been traumatized, so I explained the origins of the disease, and how it happens to children in abusive situations.

They questioned whether or not it was this serious, and I told them “I wish I was making this up”

They asked if I had ever tried to sit down and have a discussion with my parents, and I told them I had been trying that since I was eight years old. 

They asked why I still talk to my mom (their daughter) if she is so toxic, and I told them because she still has financial control over me, and I can’t have a job if I want to finish college as soon as possible, so it’s better to put up with my parents for another 1.5yrs than to be $50k in debt (hopefully many of you would agree with me that it’s worth it to at least milk your abusers dry).

Then, they asked how serious my diagnosis is. I explained that I’ve never known conditional love. That I have no idea how to conduct myself in normal life. I told them about the negative self talk in my mind. About how it’s going to take years to rewire. That I allow outsiders to abuse me now since it’s easier than fighting back. And that I’m afraid to date or marry someone or have children, because I don’t want to continue the cycle.


And they were positively PISSED at my parents. 

They said my parents were “never fit to be around children” because they had too many problems. They apologized for not getting involved sooner (my parents hid it and gaslit me very well into never speaking up). They told me they love me and I can always talk to them if I have a problem. My grandmother kept giving me the “think positive!” excuse, she’s a little out of it now that she’s older, but my grandfather explained to her that it’s not the time for such sentiments.

Someone in my family TOOK ME SERIOUSLY!

I’m pretty LC with my parents so I have no idea how they’re going to respond but this happened a week ago so I think we are in the clear.

Glad to have a small victory when things have been so rough lately."
Is anyone else TERRIFIED of aging because you feel like you just got a chance to begin your life with your diagnosis and feel like time’s running out to do what you want to do?,672,de9pie,99,"I have this near-constant fear of getting older.

Nope. All I worry about is how I’ll die early, never meet someone who’ll love me, never have children, never buy a house or find my passions, and never have a life. I am crippled when I see other people achieving things at my age because I feel like I’ve run out of time and it’s a reminder every time how little I’ve achieved by self-isolating and recovering from my condition."

The fact that I had no one during my worst moments/years really makes me profoundly sad,669,i3vmd3,69,"When things were shitty (they still are), I didn’t have anyone. No one to talk to, no one to get help from, just 0 support. No family and no friends. What I did have was people who were bored so they used me for entertainment for the time being, I had people who used me for emotional support and attention because I was a doormat back then, I had guys who wanted to use me for sex, and then even worse, older guys who are abusive pedophiles that groomed me. 

It really sucks. Makes me feel even more suicidal. Why couldn’t I experience the light once? Just having someone and knowing they weren’t awful or that this was stable enough to last. Sure I had therapists, I’ve had a lot of therapists, and some of them were nice cool people, but that type of relationship between client and therapist isn’t the same and isn’t as personal. Am I going to spend the rest of my life alone? 

I may get better one day (as in able to function again & not feel like dying 24/7 and actually have a life) but even that’s not guaranteed. I’m sure if it does happen then I will meet healthy people who want to be in my life. But it would feel kind of fake. Why do I have to be healthy to have people in my life? I’m unhealthy now but it’s not like I’m an awful person or abusive. Would those same people want me now when I’m broken? No they wouldn’t and it’s a shit thing to realize. Idk stuff like this makes me think and makes me feel like none of this is worth it or really matters."

"I (25F) always thought that I felt most comfortable around men and found it easier to make friends with men than women, but as I have healed I’ve realized that I actually DON’t feel more comfortable around men than women, quite the opposite!",670,kzzs36,65,"Letting women into my life has been healing. As a freeze/fawn type I tend to isolate myself and I have been isolated from other women for so many years.

I want to let more female energy into my life but I feel afraid that I’m not good enough as a woman.

I have missed out on female friendship as a teen and adult because of this. 

As a young adult I always had an easier time making friends with men, practically ignoring the possibility of female friendship. These men however always wanted to be with me sexually sooner or later. 

Turns out what I was doing is I was just supressing my discomfort the whole time in order to gain validation from men who actually just wanted to get me into bed."
I learned how to ride a bike!!!!,670,gj73ab,50,"I turn 27 today. Yesterday, my wonderful SO finally taught me how to ride a bike.

CPTSD, awful parents, I won’t go into detail but you know the drill. It just never really happened — everyone was more focused on survival than things like riding a bike. The fact that I can’t ride one has always been kind of a fun, albeit sad quirk. 

Plenty of people have promised to teach me, but my SO actually got his dad (who is a mechanic) to fix up an old French bike he found just for me. We popped by there yesterday, and it was done!!!!! I was nervous but my SO put me on it and ran around with it holding the handles until I could go by myself. Taught me to brake, get started, all that. I was riding independently in less than an hour; afterward, he took me on a full bike tour of his hometown. 

Can’t express in words how happy this makes me. I finally belong somewhere. I’m finally loved. And I can FINALLY RIDE A BIKE!!!!! Best birthday gift ever."

I told my bf of 1.5 yr to read The Body Keeps The Score and see a therapist. He did. And then broke up with me.,664,hk6bih,108,"I am having a very hard sad time right now. I don't date a lot. I thought this person (m, 30) I was with for nearly 2 years was going to be the last person I would ever date as in I did think we would get married. I had been struggling with intimacy issues in our relationship and he was dissatisfied so we went to couples therapy for 4 months to try and communicate through that issue more. He acted like it was long term talking about our future, we even went to look at a house to buy together. That was all initiated by him. Every week he acted like everything was fine on his end and then I felt like I had to fill the silence by talking about my trauma even if I have my own therapist because he had nothing else to say. He acted like he was in this for the long term.

I had been asking him to see a therapist on his own for a while because I thought it's important for him to have the same kind of outlets that I do and learn to have that kind of vocabulary. I encouraged him to read The Body Keeps The Score so he could understand me better. Finally he did both, but after the first therapy appointment, the next day, he broke up with me.

He insists that he had just internalized too many small things and didn't talk about them and then this was the solution he came up with to deal with it. He insists that it wasn't easy to do but the fact of the matter is that it was easier for him to do that than to have any of the hard discussions. This is not how a serious relationship should be and I know that. I consistently tried to make the space for him to process things but he would never take the bait and now in the end, it ended up hurting me. It was easier for him to try and ""be positive"" and test our relationship by suggesting marriage and moving in together. The therapist and he and I all agree that I didn't do any thing wrong and no one is blaming me at least.

We just had our last couples therapy session and the therapist could see how hurt and frustrated I was because she was under the same impression about our relationship since he never complained about being so unhappy before.

I'm just feeling so defeated and sad and gross right now and I can't fully speak to my friends about this because of the cptsd complexities. I don't think he is a bad person but I'm sad that something I worked so hard on wasn't what I thought it was. And I feel just bad about myself and my sexuality and my mental health problems like I'll never be able to open up to another person about that sort of thing and find the support and happiness that I deserve. 

This happened last week and so the other night I tried to spend the night with a guy I've had a casual relationship with over the past maybe 4 years (of course not while I was with my now ex) and I couldn't be intimate with him either. It hurt so badly because I was so tense and even if I felt attracted to him, I just cried the whole time.

I felt like I had been making progress and I know that I have because I have handled this extremely maturely and with a lot of grace. I did basically everything right but I feel like I'm set up for a whole lifetime of loneliness and even if I did a lot of growth during this relationship, I feel like it's definitely just set me back in a lot of new ways. I'm ok with being single but I'm a lonely and isolated feeling person and I have so many doubts about being able to connect with a guy again just knowing how emotionally stunted every single one I try to date is. I don't think I'll ever be able to find what I need from a partner and it's just really, really sad."
"I've been blaming my lack of social life on being an introvert, turns out the better i healed from the abuse, the better my social life got",661,earkf3,47,"And it has nothing to do with being an introvert, i will just need time to be alone at the end of the day and that's all.
I am finally starting to enjoy socialising, it is so fun when you can talk to people without being scared and having your anxiety through the roof.

"So, apparently CPTSD is a thing. Just wanted to say hello to my new community!",666,m930vl,117,"Hi y'all. I learned about CPTSD just a few months ago. Now, I feel the strong need to share my thoughts.

I have suffered from mental problems pretty much my whole life. I've gone through 3 years of psychotherapy, some psychophysical physiotherapy, several hospital periods, medication... A few months ago, I finally found an understanding clinician who was able to give me a bit of insight into who I am and what I have gone through in life. She introduced me to the concept of CPTSD.

Some of you might relate to the experience of utter shock when finding exact descriptions of your symtoms from actual scientific literature. CPTSD is something I had never heard of - but it... it is me?!

I had always though of myself as a ""lost cause"". Apparently there was something initially wrong with me as everything in my life was fine but I still was chronically unhappy. Yes, I was bullied as a child, and I always felt my mother was distant, but no one ever mistreated me or anything. I thought I was wrongly programmed or something. Exaggerating, being a drama queen, or overly sensitive, or just ungrateful.

Well, apparently not.

Now, I need to accept that the experiences of loneliness in childhood have affected me more than I ever thought. I hope that some day, I'll be in control of my mini flashbacks, derealisation, emotional numbness, self-harm and other weird symtoms that never made any sense to me before...

So yeah, nice to meet you all. Let the healing process begin.

"DAE gets very angry, resentful and obsessive about injustice?",663,kezaz9,78,"I recently bought online food for my dog, when deliverd it was spoiled and it could have made my dog very sick. I called the seller, and he tried to convince me that it was still alright and not harmful for my dog at all. He also said that a lot of people are getting it in this condition, and that I am the only one making a probem out of it. I then called the 'food safety autority' (how it is called in my country) and they said this was very dangerous and if the seller did not correct this, I could report the companie. I read that there are more ""victims' than just me, and nobody is getting there money back. 

I am now getting really really angry about this, and also the patronizong way he spoke to me made me want to bite his head of! I have to wait before I can take further steps, but that is not what this post is about. It is about the anger that is getting triggerd in me, and that I also punisch myself for getting so angry about stuf like this. 

I am getting really obsessive about this, arguing to the salesman in my head, worrying about it at night and complaining on al the dogforums there are in my country, and the lattre not only to warn people, but also that he gets a bad reputation and for taking revenge, and I don't like that I am doing that, but it feels like some very angry part is taking over right now..

It is like all the injustice that is done to me, reflected back at me that it does not matter how much it hurts me, that it does not matter if I did not want it, that it does not matter how it felt. I am just this peace of shit that people can treat the way they want to, because my feelings don't matter, I am just that worthless.

I am trying to fix the external circumstances so it does not mirror back at me that I don't matter. And I cant, because people do what they do for there own reasons, that does not say anything about me. I just don't know how to stop fighting right now, how to stop feeling so angry about such a stupid situation like this. I want to feel peaceful and calm.

I know I should give myself compassion now, but I don't want to be like this, I don't want to fight, I don't want to be obsessive, this is so exhausting.  

Anyone else struggling with this?

I’m 28 years old and just had my first Pap smear,662,e9uken,91,"TW: talk of sexual assault 

After finding out I was molested as a young girl, I have decided to take power over my vagina. I was forced to have sex with a boyfriend when I was 13. And since then I slept with a lot of men, mostly unprotected. I never had a Pap smear done. Never cared. 

Three weeks ago I booked an appointment. Today was the day and I sat in the office shaking and crying. The the nurse came in and measured my height and weight and BP, which was all also very overwhelming. Then the time came where I had to get naked from the waist down and hop on the table and wait for the doctor to come in. The whole time I sat there, I cried. Continuously telling myself that this is okay! No one wanted to take care of me when I was younger, so I’m taking care of me NOW! My doctor was very very patient with me and made sure I felt comfortable. During the whole process I made sure to take deep deep breaths and remind myself that I was safe. Once she finished the procedure and left the room, I jumped off the table and fell to the floor in tears. I am so fucking proud of myself for getting through the terrifying and uncomfortable moments. For taking effort to better my life and take care of my body and soul. 

I am so fucking proud of myself. I’m going to go reward myself with a milkshake now.

ETA: I FEEL SEEN!!! I FEEL HELD!!! Waking up to all this support, love, kindness, and a silver medal has me in tears. Thank you thank you thank you! You have all given me the courage to be more open and vulnerable about healing!! This has been an incredible experience, and I feel so damn POWERFUL!"
"How the real world reacts to abuse: no sympathy, no support. Not one wants to hear about it.",661,d3ljaq,126,"I think this society makes it hard for people in abuse situations to get help. People like to close their eyes to things. No one notices. In our culture it's bad manners to be unhappy. So people are expected to smile and pretend everything is fine.

Abuse victims are expected not to complain about abuse and disturb the happy people. To do so is to invite ostracism.

Well this is just the general sense I have of living in America. Maybe I'm just imagining these things.

I just know I found it too hard to pretend to be happy, I was in too much pain over various things. And people found me distressing, ill mannered, inconvenient. Actually discussing unhappiness was 'being a complainer' or 'attention seeking'.

That's what it seems like to me.

I'm not complaining about these dynamics, but it is very confusing to navigate for someone who isn't adept at understanding social rules. Suffering in silence and wearing a happy mask is the pro-social way to behave, what social etiquette demands.

Anyone else feel like they couldn't tell anyone what they were going through?

edit: 

Real world example that just happened with my cousin: 
> You sound like you are waking up from a long, long slumber. The fact that you are reaching out is huge. 

> to be honest, in turn, with you, I can't be your counselor. I think that parts of your story would not be good for me to hear.

All I wanted is someone to say I'm right, I was being abused. Get help. My family is messed up. But she doesn't want to know about me or what I've been through. 

I dunno, maybe I'm just expecting too much from people."

Anxiety and fear has always fueled me. As a kid, I used to be proud of how I was always working. I never put something off because I ""didn't feel like doing it"". Turns out I always worked because I was afraid of failure.

Once i stopped being the first place at school I always felt like a failure. Like I was being lazy.

Now, if my inner critic was as present as it used to be I would call myself lazy. But I know better. 

I'm honestly, more often than not dissociative. I've always been. Ever since childhood. I always daydreamed, from class to home. And I can't help it. 

Making myself ""snap out of it"" like my parents like to say, doesn't help. Being patient and eliminating toxic expectations or toxic people help.

Toxic Positivity vs. Actually being supportive,659,be6gy1,65,
I hate when people blame girls/women with daddy issues.,657,je6jrz,74,"Black, F, 25. Obviously my dads an asshole. He made fun of my weight, my disability(I’m on the spectrum, he wants to exploit it to his own means), my hair, clothes, was controlling ,how I’m not like my sister, made homework and school a nightmare. I actually contemplated quitting school when I officially graduated, picking up a trade to get out early because I lacked confidence in my studies. He’s a huge homophobe(I’m bisexual, and has a issue towards black LGBT folk), transphobic, racist and even anti Semetic. I always try to be open minded as possible because of how he viewed others, he criticizes me that I simply don’t care or encourages anything different from the norm. Obviously as a teen, I did like guys and wanted attention from them, even if it was from my own detriment. Someone told me I had daddy issues and tried to do the “armchair psychology” approach, which I didn’t get back then(and haphazardly believed in) but now looking back it was problematic. 

Somehow people blamed me for my issues with my dad, or even some essence sympathize with him. Things like “He’s still your dad”, “He took care of you, fed you, gave you money.” He May gave me that security but he’s a monster, he’s an ass, he bullied me as a kid to an adult, and never changed. It was his CHOICE to be an asshole, to be a dick, if he truly wanted to be better he would .Despite how educated he comes across, he never looked for a job, or wanted his life better, and wasn’t encouraging to me when it came to my interests, or my major. (I’m studying electrical engineering, and almost finished with my units to transfer). What’s insulting, and highly ironic is the fact he’s a math person, and was cynical of me doing anything STEM related(in my defense, in high school there wasn’t any intro to STEM, or engineering classes). Plus I wanted to have a career that I’ll never have to see my father again, financially and psychologically break from him. I even want to change my last name, to break the family cycle forever. 

When I see people who get along with their dad, I feel envious, bitter, that depressed child self coming out because I’ll never have that. Even if I get married or have children, I’ll have that envy toward them that they will have that dad that hopefully dotes on them, supports them and loves them. I despise the term “Daddy issues” not because of the issues at hand you have with your father, but mostly blaming girls/women for their fucked up fathers for their sexual kinks/attitudes towards men(ie “She has daddy issues”). Oh yeah blame the fucking girl/woman that couldn’t help who her dad was, who are with these male figures who are suppose to love, care, protect, and cherish, but fucked them over. No father and daughter relationship is perfect, but it’s never abusive, narcissistic, or selfish. The reason at times I hate when people say I look like my father, because of the asshole he is. 

How has the relationship with your dad shape your trauma? For me I became cynical towards getting married, having children ,black men, hating loud noises(he would yell a lot), being insecure about my weight/body image(he always was very fit, hated getting fat, all around fitness freak), panic when I failed a test(more so in public school, because he wanted to berate and tutor me), pressure to be perfect, even fear of trying something new. I never had any real hobbies growing up because he criticizes me so much what was the point of doing anything if I’m going to be bad at it. (Which now I’m into archery, reading, wanting to play electric guitar, and learn how to design cars/motorcycles and clothes).  

And to the women(and men) who have issues with their dads, step dads or any male figures in their lives first I’m sorry, your worthy of love, care, and respect. Which sadly I don’t have with my dad at all."

"I think trauma creates a split personality. One is presentable to the world and one, the trauma personality, is in the background screaming to be heard. Breaking the wall between the two is painful and should be done with care.",658,e2sqei,93,"I lived my entire life with a split personality. There's the traumatized inner child (shame, guilt, anger, fear), the real me. Then there's the functioning personality that puts my trauma on hold, pushing it to the background so I can be presentable and get day-to-day things done. I realize it's imposed desensitization and a wall or fake facade I show the world to protect myself from getting emotionally murdered by everything. It lets me ignore and deny all the triggers and forcefully focus on just getting through the day. 

Despite clinging to the functional me, the traumatized me inside still constantly runs in the background. The split personality strategy is simply unsustainable.

I decided I was ready to break that wall because I could no longer tolerate living in denial. I want to live genuinely. I'm in touch with that damaged inner child somewhat now and I naively thought with enough self-love and self-acceptance, I could bypass the negative consequences of finally opening up years of abuse, self-hate and life-threatening fear. 

On the contrary, I'm extremely sluggish and triggered 24/7. Waves of unbearable shame and terror come every second. If I have stuff to do, my brain will anticipate all the stuff to come and get overwhelmed triggered merely at the thought of everything I have to overcome. Everything is one big mountain to suffer and ""conquer"" with a whole lot of setbacks along the way. It can't see the good in anything. When I actually do things, I'm hypersensitive to every small thing that happens and the wall of triggers close in. I end up sleeping all day. Even when nothing happens, I feel hurt. I feel kind of left out of the world, trying to not drown and let the storm pass, the recipient of everything terrible in the world.

YOU GUYS I'M GOING TO GRADUATE COLLEGE!!!,659,faze73,41,"This sub has become a lil family to me so I thought I would include y'all as I make my rounds sharing the news.

I just got an email that my last requirements are being approved to graduate college with a double major. TWO DEGREES!! I got diagnosed with CPTSD at 19, during my freshman year of college. I'm 22 now. Last year, the year before that, and the year before that at this time I genuinely thought I was going to die. I was so suicidal and alone and terrified. The last few weeks I've spent reflecting on my last 4 years as an undergraduate student, and now everything I've been able to do while feeling like I was dying is becoming clear to me.

I got a full ride to college, first gen independent student, I've studied abroad twice, learned two languages (Spanish and Italian, ciao bella! qué hermosa puede ser la vida!), participated in art shows, performed my music, kept a decent GPA (3.4 baby!), kept the same job for 3 years, formed strong friendships, learned (and am and will always still be learning) how to have and respect the boundaries of others, how to sit and be present with my emotions, how to take care of myself (I took myself to the dentist last week! ON PURPOSE!!), how to forgive myself (working on it), and I have clawed and fought and kicked my way out of the darkness over and over and over again to see some semblance of light and I still show up to my life even though nothing in the world is more terrifying.

I read this list of positives and think ""was it really all so bad? Maybe I was faking the whole thing."" But I wasn't faking. It's been hell. It still is sometimes. I wouldn't wish the shit we've been through on my worst enemy. No, it was really that bad. It was really so lonely and awful and unspeakable and unliveable. But I fucking did it anyway.

I'm going on 5 months self harm free, stopped doing drugs, and dramatically cut back on drinking. I look in the mirror and I think happy thoughts. I think ""she is lovely, she is good enough."" I'm crying so much as I write this, tears of joy and pride and relief and overwhelm and so many things. I am overflowing. Thank you all so so so so much."
Does anyone else “silent cry” even if there is nobody there to yell at them for being upset anymore?,653,gl6l7v,151,"Not sure if this goes here but I think I suffer from CPTSD and DPDR due to family pressure and circumstances which became unbearable towards the age of 17-18. 

I am now 27 and have been living by myself for a while but I find this to be the case. I don’t cry in front of people but when I am sad I have this amazing ability to cry without making any noise. You may be next to me and you wont hear a thing. Hell, it may be completely silent and you wont notice that I am sobbing unless you take a look.

This is the outcome of many years of trying to not be yelled at for being upset and essentially drowning it out in the night while making sure nobody hears. I guess another skill to add to the list...

Edit: I fell asleep and this blew up a little bit. Thanks everyone for taking the time to talk about your experience. I am trying to answer all the messages atm. First of all, I am really sorry to hear so many people can relate. Nobody should have to feel that they have to hide their feelings... At the same time I am quite happy to see people on the track to recovery. I really hope all of us will eventually find a trusting, safe environment where we can be vulnerable without feeling guilty, judged or inadequate. Hugs to all of you, wherever you are."
"For many of us, calm environment = inner chaos and chaotic environment = inner calmness. You have a day off, you have free-time, you have silence and safety, everything is...okay? and it’s just. too. much. Here’s why, and what to do about it.",655,d8if5g,104,"TL;DR on bottom.

I call it living backwards. 
My therapist calls it trauma. 

My brother lives in this world that he always had to be going, doing something, fixing something, making something, go go go. He said he hates days off of work, he hates free-time. It makes him anxious.

I’m the same way. I’ll pick up a shift just to avoid a mental breakdown. A day off? Free-time? Silence? Safety? I think you mean mental breakdown, anxiety, existential crisis. Meditation? You mean panic attack. 
So instead, we just go go go.

BUT, we tend to burn out much more often than your average happy healthy childhood laaadeedaaa human.

I mean, I was so go go go for so long that my burn out sent me to inpatient for a couple of weeks. I couldn’t even function, eat, shower, talk. I was empty. 

When I shared this with my therapist, said something that was too real. She said that I grew up in chaos, I’m used to it, it’s comfortable, I thrive in it, even. Chaos is my safety. She said something like, 

“I think you walk into a safe environment, and you perceive it the same way a healthy person would perceive trauma. On the other hand, you see chaos, and you gravitate towards it. The way a healthy person would gravitate towards a sunset, or a beach, you gravitate towards a burning building. You find yourself in unhealthy relationships, or you bury yourself in work, and keep going until you’re burnt out. And when you find yourself with your tank on empty, you obsess over what is ‘wrong with you.’ The fact is, that you’re human, and all of those things would run anyone’s tank empty. It’s just that healthy people, with a healthy childhood, would’ve identified those situations as stressful at first glance. At first glance, you identify them as home, so you go there.”

Side note: I think this is why we find ourselves with narcissistic partners, and (my theory) why some of us end up BEING narcissists. We need chaos, we needed to be in control, we need the things that make the *human* in us burn. the. F. out.

So obviously, we need a change. We have learned to love, and possibly *need* chaos, in order to keep ourselves from panicking, breaking down, questioning everything, the way a healthy person would when subjected to extreme chaos.

I think for a lot of us
Chaos = Peace
Peace = Chaos

We are living backwards, and it is burning us out. So, how do we fix this? How do we learn to live with the calmness, peace, silence, how do we learn to live in an environment that is GOOD FOR US, that won’t cause us to burn out?

According to my therapist, just sit there. Just sit there, in the peace and quiet. It was something like:

“It’ll be uncomfortable. Your body will perceive it as trauma at first. But the more you sit there and realize that bad things aren’t happening to you, the more comfortable you will get. AND when you and your body finally learn how to calm down in that safe space, that safe space will teach you so much. I think you will find so many answers in that safe space, because it’s a space you’ve never been given, it’s a basic human necessity you’ve never had.”

This is my version: 

It’s like, adopting an abused dog. The dog is still going to be terrified once it’s in a safe space. The dog doesn’t identify this space as a safe one until it sits there, trembling, long enough to realize that bad things aren’t happening. Give the dog some time!

Yes, I am the dog in this metaphor, and you are too. 

Give yourself some time.

What I’ve learned from sitting in safety:

First of all, it sucks. 

Secondly: make SURE it’s a safe space. I tried this in a not safe space, because at the time, I thought it was safe and healthy, but there was actually a lot of trauma tied to it.

Secondly, sitting there doesn’t always work. Actually, it was horrible to just actually sit there. I needed to find something to do, but had to make sure it was cathartic to me. For me, it’s writing. That’s why I’m writing this, that’s why I’m on this subreddit. My brother paints. I think it’s really important to find some self-expression and ease into it in your safe space. 

My therapist suggested sudoku, puzzles, crosswords, and grounding techniques.

Third, but MOST IMPORTANT and a huge lesson I’ve had to learn 837436 times over and over:

You cannot heal anywhere near the trauma, or the abusers. You can meditate, take meds, do therapy, you can put in all the work in the world, but you won’t ever find peace there. That *actual* sliver of real human in the back of your head that does truly know what is good for you, is gonna keep saying nope. hell to the no, not healin’ here.

I had to move to a different city. I had to make this space peaceful (clean, cozy, candles lit, etc) and then I had to sit, and find my catharsis. It wasn’t too hard for me because I’ve always loved writing. I also think it’s important to avoid electronics (aside from music) and social media. Another safe and cathartic space for me, is in my car with the music on. So those are just some ideas.

But this was me, ADHD on fleek, ranting basically, but I hope you get the gist. 







TL;DR 

Safety and silence suck for a lot of us. We crave chaos, because we grew up there, and as messed up as home might’ve been, it’s human nature to identify home as a safe place. Because of this, many people with trauma live with this feeling that
 
calmness = inner chaos
chaos = inner calm

To fix this, we must find our safe space, and allow ourselves to let it feel *safe* to us. You cannot and will not heal in the chaos. So we need to find a safe space (harder than it seems because safety = chaos) and find a way to let it feels safe, calm, and okay. My advice was to practice self-expression. Write, paint, draw, punch a punching bag, just express yourself. If you can’t do that, it’s okay to distract yourself, but still try to find small moments or just you *being* in a safe space, feeling safe.

Eventually, being in the safe spaces long enough will allow our brains to go wow, ok, so this is safe, and it’s ok. Calm=calm and chaos=chaos

After that, you’re supposed to heal or some sh*t. 😂

After being able to feel *safe,* in true safety, 
I’ve heard that when the real work, and the real healing begin.

I’m just in the process of letting environmental safety feel safe. So far, I find a lot of feelings here. They’re confusing and weird but the more I “feel,” the less detached and dissociated I am. Feeling is healing. Healing is feeling. I just appreciate the small but increasing moments of time where I actually feel *alive*


Edit: Many of us love chaos, that’s been noted, and you don’t need to stop loving it! At least for me, I still need it, but have found healthy chaos. For me, I found it in work. I’m a chef. I can still be go go go in that environment. It’s fast-paced and full of pressure. When it gets crazy busy, I work my best, and get a kick out of everyone else panicking. But, I do need to come home to calm, and reap the benefits of that environment, too."
"I had a co-worker say ""how old are you guys? And you still have daddy issues…"" in response to her finishing The Umbrella Academy",651,i9zq6l,110,"Not that this is a new realization, but it pisses me off so much how people brush others off when they have family/childhood issues. I can't help but be triggered and angry and shameful when I hear what people really think about people like me. The broken, unstable, regressed husk of a person.

I guess I pass as normal enough, so people don't give it a second thought when they start making fun of emotionally vulnerable/confused/hurt people. It tears me apart knowing that assholes are everywhere and good luck trying to find someone who is actually empathetic and understanding. 

I can't help but feel so hopeless that I will never be able to fit into society no matter where it is.

Edit: should clarify in the umbrella academy, the kids had a super fucked up childhood and are all pretty much different responses to trauma. There's a lot of stuff that hits pretty close to my CPTSD.

I cried in a store today.,654,cjdgf6,61,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a shirt for me when he insisted I look at the jeans. I need jeans, but I was unable to communicate to him that pants shopping is a trigger for me. All I could say is ""none of them will fit"", to which he responded ""you don't know that, we might find something"" and he may have been right, but after a minue or two, I just broke down in tears.

He didn't get mad, or frustrated, or tell me I was overreacting, or being a drama queen, or anything. He gently asked if I could tell him what was wrong, offered a hug, and kissed my head. When someone came by to stare, he blocked their view with his body and made sure I felt safe and protected. He apologized for contributing to a triggering moment even if he didn't know initially, and did whatever he could to help.

His reaction is so healthy and normal that i'm still reeling a little. My whole life has just been so fucked up. But you know what? I'm here now, away from my abusers, and moving up in the world. And I have this incredible person to be alive with. And i'm just so happy about it. I'm glad my suicide attempts were failures and I'm glad I've lived long enough to live in this moment.

And even if one small part seems irrelevant, it is a necessary component to the safe and effective function of the whole system.            

I still don't believe that my self matters or is worth taking care of (or really worth anything but punishment and destruction), but I can accept that I am a necessary part of systems that are important (my department at work, my worksite, my family)  and it's pretty obvious that when I fall apart it has strong negative repercussions for the whole system. I don't believe that I deserve nice things but I do acknowledge that systems require maintenance. I can't yet make myself do it for my own sake, but I can for others' sake do preventative maintenance tasks like getting adequate sleep, proper nutrition, monitoring alcohol intake, et cetera.

I sang and danced around my kitchen while doing some cleaning and I did this for about 30-45 minutes until I was in an amazing mood. I called my friend back and continued watching a show with them, and I haven't heard another firework since the initial ones this morning. 
 
The headphones, the music, the cleaning, singing, and dancing, helped me not go into a panic attack and instead I was doing something I felt in control with (cleaning) and being silly and expressing myself to some awesome music.

How can I trust people when all they do is fail to understand and act so shitily, setting off my red flags because I don't know any better, yet no one will fucking tell me how I'm supposed to know better until I've made a mistake, which only makes me feel more hurt, confused and lost.

There's no winning with trauma it feels like, we have a mountain to climb with no knowledge of how to, and everyone we go to for help shuns us because we didn't automatically know just like them. It makes it far worse if you're autistic and got fucked even harder out of knowing how to socialise properly without making a mistake and ruining it all.

Also, how are we even supposed to handle our emotions if the way we learnt how to deal with them was to hide or block them, focus them towards ourselves and hate ourselves because otherwise we'd get punished for it. But now it's nothing but a hindrance because there's nothing to survive from anymore but all the pain and issues from those coping mechanism are still there."
Moving out apperently cured me...,654,hllxd1,69,"I'm both relieved and angry right now.

 I'm sitting here in my new apartment living room watching youtube and have been enjoying a symptom free life away from my parents, while living with them I suffered from chronic stomach pain, chronic shoulder and scapula pain, Jaw clenching 24/7,  constant anxiety, hypervigilance, chronic constipation, feelings of despair. 

My father's gaslighting became unbearable this year, but I finally met his criteria to move out and now I finally feel stable. My dad never physically hurt me but the emotional neglect, gaslighting, silent treatment, mocking among other things destroyed my self worth and self esteem. Hell, I never even saw the red flags in my year long romantic relationship because that's how I grew up. 

Now? All my symptoms are seemingly gone. I can go to the bathroom normally, I feel hopeful, I feel safe and secure, I'm more confident, and my shoulders feeling 10 times better. 

I'm so god damn happy, but like I said I'm angry at how my dad treated me and how my mom never once stood up to him and protected me. I suffered for years and they never cared. Fuck that.

Edit: the best part? I moved in a whopping 2 days ago."
I started brushing my teeth,652,h9tfcq,77,"My abuse was a secret for several years, and the discovery sent waves through my family. My mom ended up super depressed and struggled to handle all the responsibilities that come with being a mom. As a result, she didn't take me or my siblings to the dentist for years. I know this is a form of abuse, but my mom was depressed and also has PTSD, so I'm not here to discuss that.

I ended up terrified of the dentist. I didn't brush my teeth as a little kid, so I had to get lots of fillings and baby teeth pulled. It always hurt really badly, and one time it was so bad I ended up screaming in pain and fear. I was not upset at all when we stopped going.

About a year ago, my mom convinced me to see a dentist again. I wasn't happy, and I was still not taking care of my teeth, so I had to get more fillings. It didn't hurt as bad that time, and the cavity had been hurting me, so I decided this dentist wasn't so bad.

I went in for a cleaning a couple weeks ago and realized that for the first time in my life, I felt relaxed in the dentist chair. It felt nice to have clean teeth, and now the feeling of plaque on my teeth is starting to bother me. I still don't brush as much as I should, but I've been brushing about once a day, which is miles better than I've been for most of my life.

I know this is such a small thing in the grand scheme of things, but it feels like a mountain I've finally, *finally* reached the top of."

25 years old and I finally got a job,653,ivj683,37,"I’ve struggled with panic attacks, depression, and nightmares for 15 years now. I never felt like I could be a whole person. I finally found the right pill and therapist combination for my issues and I’m feeling more balanced than I ever have. I just started working as an EMT and I have never been more proud of myself. This is something I’ve wanted since I was a little girl. I feel like I’m finally becoming the partner and mother my family deserves. It’s still hard some days, but I’m actually living now."
I’ve stopped calling it “spanking” and now call it “hitting”,649,i3ajod,75,"The word “spanking” serves to mark one area of the body as a more acceptable place to hit a child than other areas of the body. 

Fuck that. 

It recently struck me, that not only is a child’s butt NOT a more acceptable place to hit them, but:

1) it’s one of the few spots that a teacher/relative/other adult will never see, and therefor will never see the marks left behind from a slap. Oof that feels evil. 

2) If it’s done in public and in a particular manner (or other twisted ways that I dare not try to imagine), it can also be considered sexual abuse and we ain’t here to give it a silly name to detract from THAT. And even in private, the experience of being pinned down, having my pants ripped down, or being told to take them off, and lay in a vulnerable position, just to have my mom hit me repeatedly.... like, that is just so degrading and violating. 

3) giving it a name other than “hitting” and other than the average perception of abuse, normalizes it which not only makes the parent feel justified, but makes the child feel as if hitting is normal and that they actually deserve to be hit for some petty ass reason. It makes it an acceptable conversation topic. And talking about it can serve as another form of shaming and manipulation. 

FUCK THAT. 

my mom tried to leave marks on my butt and was proud when she did. She brags (to. this. day. And I’m 25 now) about times when she spanked me so hard it left a mark. Which may set off alarms to other adults, but in my case, it didn’t. Imagine a mom bragging about slapping a kid on the arm/face/leg whatever, so hard it left a mark; no one would stand for it. 

If you’re questioning if spanking is physical abuse, it is and your feelings are valid. If it felt wrong, it was wrong.

Do you ever struggle with feeling you need to justify every aspect of you life to people/ owe people details of your life?,651,fk2ixj,73,"How can I recognize when I'm being closed off verses ""I'm not ready to talk about this/I need people to believe me."""

""Sometimes it's the only way.""

""I know there is evidence that it can affect a child’s development into adolescence and adulthood, but who can claim that it’s the same for all kids?"" 

""There is a difference between uncontrolled violence or physically scarring “discipline” and controlled, well intended physical discipline."" 


I truly believe these people, child abuse apologists, are one of the lowest of the low. It's so frustrating how they invalidate people's trauma and promote something so dangerous. So many children die every year in the name of ""physical discipline,"" and many more grow up with life long issues because of these shitty people."

I was also allowed to remove my face mask to help me breathe. In the end we all got through it. I still have moments crying today but I don’t feel as bad. I feel exhausted but like a little weight has been lifted off my shoulders. Just felt like sharing Bc even though in the moment I was crying my eyes out and panicking. After it was done I feel better. Like I needed to face that Bc it’s not anything bad at all. It’s a normal thing that all women must do in their life and I’ve done it.

It was mostly that I didn't understand much about the world around me, in particular people's emotional landscape, and I don't know, I kind of feel ashamed for how oblivious I was.

Healthy brains vs traumatised brains,649,e53v5b,43,"a healthy brain *acts* on the world because it has the executive function to know what it wants, and to visualise the steps to goals, aspirations, and desires.

a traumatised brain *reacts* to the world because it has been conditioned to respond in self defence; anything else is simply ""asking for trouble."" decisions are automatically routed to the primal brain because the primal brain is programmed to survive.

a lot of post traumatic behaviours, emotions, and reactions are instinctive and survival based. they can seem irrational and chaotic, but only because they come from a completely different pattern of information processing and decision making.

give yourself the time and space to recover, because it's more than just going to counselling, it's reprogramming your brain. brains are highly flexible and adaptable, but require time and work to heal."

"DAE get hypersensitive about people ""sighing"" around you?",644,fs4dvf,92,"TL;DR: In isolation with my husband who tends to sigh a lot when he's thinking or concentrating. Due to past trauma, this makes me tense and hypersensitive to every movement around me (like I'm in a war zone).

My abusive mother used to signal her distress/anger (i.e. impending abuse) by sitting in silence, breathing heavily and sighing. If I didn't respond in just the right way... well... 

Fast forward to today: I can't help but tense up or cringe every time I hear my husband breathe in or breathe out too loudly.

"Have you spent your whole life trying just to escape toxic and abusive people, and then thinking you're out, but then realizing you somehow have some of those traits in yourself as well?",640,foixwm,59,"Realizing that despite lifelong efforts to the contrary, I myself have toxic traits. It's so disappointing.

I realized this when I met someone I really liked, who was very humble and polite, and found myself subtlety disparaging him or trying to make me feel superior to him in little ways, so that he would not find me inferior to him - my brain at the time was telling me I needed to do this to get him to like me or think I'm important/worth it. Needless to say, it did not work out and he did not maintain contact after that. I felt sick about it for a longtime because I didn't realize what I'd done wrong, but it took a long time of dissecting my behaviour to understand what I'd been doing, and it was shocking and unpleasant to discover.

Especially since not long after someone who was interested in me, and his sister, both treated me this way - subtly disparaging me to come off as superior. I noticed this behaviour quite quickly as toxic in them and distanced myself, but it took so long to recognize the same toxic behaviour in myself. How do I go about stopping and correcting this behaviour? It scares me that the next time I meet someone I like and consider worthy, this toxic side of me will come out again and sabotage everything. :( I feel quite ashamed of myself."

One good that came from trauma, abuse, and neglect, is that I’m still a child in awe of the world, in awe of all of the things that were made to keep me safe. I saw all of the bad in the world when I was a child. Maybe this is my turn to learn some of the good."

A type of abuse I just now wrapped my head around.,636,ktr0ku,68,"It's very screwed up now that I think about it. Some abusers will manufacture pressure in situations where there is none, then will act like your friends to relieve that same pressure they created. They'll create emotional distress and will give the promise of relieving it by being on your side, offering protection, making it seem like you're getting what you want. In reality though it's all about what they want and they can't see past that, though they'll try to frame the situation as necessary to occur.

Anyway I'm under that kind of pressure right now and don't know if there is a way out in sight. I feel hopeless a lot of the time, like I can't get out of my situation, but I won't stop until I make it out."

Is anyone else struggling to relearn how to breathe properly?,636,la5zy0,114,"Hi. I (non-voluntarily) hold my breath for long periods of time, don’t breathe at all or take very short, shallow breaths. It leaves me constantly exhausted, headachey and contributes to my anxiety, physical tension and other CPTSD symptoms. Yoga and/or meditation helps but the effect only lasts temporarily. As soon as I start work or go about my normal day I’m back to not breathing. I want to be able to breathe fully without forcing it but I’m struggling to help my body relearn a normal breathing pattern. I understand it will take time. Does anyone else experience this, or have any tips? Much love and TIA!

EDIT: Thank you so much for all the thoughtful replies! There are some great tips and insight in the comments which I hope are helpful :) A little more detail about how this affects me:
- I often run out of breath mid-sentence and sometimes speak more quickly to get the words out before I need more air.
- I occasionally squeak or make weird noises because of a lack of air.
- I sometimes feel nauseous or weak during exercise when I’m not breathing enough. But yoga has really helped because the instructor literally tells me to breathe! I try to practise it every day now because it can be so effective and I feel so refreshed afterwards. Oxygen! 
- I sometimes panic when I consciously breathe in and out without a break (holding my breath) because I feel trapped. No idea about this one. 
- It’s at its worst when I’m in deep focus or feeling anxious. 
- When I was younger/in my former abusive environment, I tried to be as silent as possible/not let out any sound at all and sometimes imagined I didn’t exist."

Grin and bear it. Just play pretend because what we need to get better doesn't actually exist. There is no love for the damaged here so the game is pretending we're not. Don't complain.

Does this sort of hopelessness ever go away or do we always have to be fake by acting in ways that don't honestly reflect how we truly feel so we can fit in."
"I realized that problems seem so overwhelming because when I was small, problems were intentionally MADE to be overwhelming for me",637,etvns6,47,"So when a child grows up normally, they encounter problems with the world of course. They fall on their face and it hurts. Others don't want to share their toy. It rains when they wanted sunshine. But none of these problems exist because someone else is intentionally being malicious to them. It's just how the world is: it's not perfectly suited to anyone in particular's needs and wishes. So the child learns to look at the situation and figure out (maybe with help from adults) how to solve the problem. There's no reason for the child to assume that the problem is impossible to solve and with every problem solved, the child learns what they can and cannot do.

But when a child gets abused at home or bullied by other children (or teachers, etc.) the situation is fundamentally different. Here, the problems are intentionally made to be impossible to solve. Your abuser or bully doesn't want you to figure out what makes them tick, they want you to keep guessing, failing and feeling helpless. So the child's natural drive to solve the problems that life presents gets frustrated again and again until learned helplessness takes over and they are convinced (rightly, for the moment) that they can't change their situation.

And eventually (and that's what I only just realized) this helplessness extends to other parts of life too, including ones where problems really *are* just effects of how the world is. I realized this especially strongly yesterday. The sink in the kitchen was backed up and I disassembled it with a screwdriver, removed the dirt, washed out the parts in the bathroom and put them back together. And I noticed for the first time that 1) this problem wasn't hard to solve but somehow I had always preferred not to look too closely at the part of the sink that was the problem, which had slowly become more blocked for years and 2) one of the reasons why the stench of the disassembled pipes bothered me so much (it was pretty bad but not THAT bad) was that it somehow felt like a personal attack or punishment, even though I rationally know that it's just the effect of chemical processes and that my brain interprets the smell as bad to protect me from playing with stuff that could make me sick.

It explains so much about my reaction to problems, especially those posed by human beings whom I don't know. Like when my bank card got blocked because I had entered the wrong pin too often. Or when I wasn't able to change health insurance covers. Or any time I have to apply for anything. My first, instinctual reaction is to be overwhelmed, desperate and hopeless because part of me is convinced that the person I have to talk to will be fundamentally hostile and committed to making my problem worse. With problems posed by inanimate objects, it's similar, if not quite as bad.

I think I've semi-consciously circled around this thought before and that's the reason why I could finally put this into words. I noticed that lately I've begun to very consciously notice problems and ask myself: What can I do right now to solve this problem? The answer is often fairly obvious but wouldn't have occurred to me in my normal thinking patterns because the question I'm used to asking myself when a problem presents itself is: How can I escape the worst of the effects of this problem? And the answer to that is usually some form of avoidance. Consciously substituting the other question makes a lot of problems seem way more manageable, and now I know where the unhealthy dynamic it shakes loose comes from. I mean, the sink drain had something in the middle that practically screamed: ""I'm a screw head, you can just unscrew me!"" but somehow I had never looked at it from a ""what can I do about this?"" perspective. I had just assumed the sink had been built in such a way that certain parts couldn't be cleaned and you just had to put up with it being backed up."

"I think I found the very root of my C-PTSD, and it's left me with one question. At what point does ignorance become unforgivable?",631,kd1wyc,147,"The stars sort of aligned for me this weekend, and I think I figured out where it all started for me. It was set off by a series of events in my personal life, and culminated in reading Part 3 of The Body Keeps the Score (""The Minds of Children"").

I learned about attachment theory, and realized that my attachment to my mother (main caregiver) was disorganized - I viewed her as an unfortunate necessity, both the source of vital care and of great fear. That on top of the fact that my father had a tendency to withdraw and reverse our roles, and that my older brother was extremely abusive, made for more or less the worst possible formative relationships for me. That is why I have literally no memories of *not* being an anxious, fearful, self-destructive child.

The question that this breakthrough hit me with was this: how much should a parent be forgiven for unknowingly sabotaging their children? My mother doesn't talk about it much, but I know her father was an alcoholic, and that she had very little contact with him after her mother left him. She clearly has her own trauma she never worked through, which has turned her into a person with two settings: cold and withdrawn, or explosively angry. It's not her fault she was traumatized, but her children have literally begged her through tears to control her temper, yet she refused to ever take any responsibility for herself. The result was an abusive, sociopathic son, and two daughters who have spent their lives in and out of psych wards.

At what point is someone's ignorance unforgivable? I was just starting to rebuild my relationship with my parents, but now I don't know how to move forward. My parents didn't *mean* to destroy us, but they did. All three of us have walked a path to an early grave, and my brother is taking his wife with him. At what point do you stop making excuses for their awful parenting? There's nothing I can do to change what happened, so it feels sort of pointless to be angry... But I just don't know how much forgiveness my mother deserves, even if she is completely oblivious of her crimes. Does she deserve the right to be in my life? Should I even want her to be?"
An unpopular opinion maybe?,627,fjap0v,136,"I know there’s been lots of posts about the corona virus. I just want to say my piece, seeing as if I said it in real life, people will probably jump down my throat. 

A lot of posts I’ve seen lately resemble almost a gleeful joy about already being a pro at isolation. Or, how they’re happy the world is burning down around them. How they’re calm and now it’s the worlds turn to burn and their time to shine. Whilst I get it, I really do get that we all suffer daily, I just don’t get the complete lack of care for others. The lack of empathy and the “well now you can feel my pain mentality”. People are *dying*. Doesn’t get any worse than that. 

And not to mention, whether it’s work, family, or the UK government... no one seems to care about the fact people are dying. In their heads, it’s *only old vulnerable people* - as so many people keep saying to me. I don’t quite get what that means? Since when did being old mean you aren’t entitled to live anymore. I genuinely cannot fathom the fear, the social rejection, the abandonment etc that elderly and vulnerable people are going through right now. The world does not give a single crap. All they care about is toilet paper and pasta. Why? This triggers me so badly, it just reminds me of all the times I’ve had my back turned on. When push comes to shove, people only show up if you’re of value to them. I think it’s disgusting. 

I am absolutely sick to death of going to work to hear people complain that places are going into lockdown. I was sent home from my job today, no it’s not ideal, no I’m not financially stable, but no I do not want to risk others lives. No, you might not catch it or if you do, you might not die from it - but you may pass it to someone of high risk and KILL them. It is so unbelievably ignorant of people to be swanning around like it doesn’t matter if they get it because they’re young and it won’t affect them (which btw you can catch permanent lung problems from - vulnerable or not). It’s awful behaviour, to not care about those around you. The narcissism is in full peak. The masks are off and people actually seem to be revelling in this lack of empathy and dog eat dog mentality. I’m completely shocked. 

I’m embarrassed that people have actually cleared shelves without thinking about others. If everyone just took what they needed for themselves, there’d be enough and more to still go round. But no, people are cleaning out shelves in stores and those who are on little pay or have big families, can’t afford the £8 toilet roll left. It’s absurd, greedy behaviour. People needing pain killers because they’re in pain, but can’t get any because others are hoarding them *just incase*. 

People trying to sell hand sanitiser, toilet roll and whatever else for ridiculous prices to those who are desperate for it... what happened to community? What happened to helping each other out? Where is the humanity? 

I was laughed at the other day whilst at work. Two women laughed pretty much in my face whilst I stood taking their bill. All because I had hand sanitiser clipped to my uniform. I work in a restaurant clearing and empty dirty saliva ridden plates. Food gets on my hands and arms sometimes. I’m taking precautions because I value my health and *others*. But apparently that makes me a joke? Honestly, I wanted to cry when they sat there and humiliated me. God forbid someone they know falls ill. 

The peer pressure coming from all angles to follow the herd and not care about your health - or go over the top and selfishly hoard all there is - is outright stupidity and selfishness. We have shown ourselves to be the ultimate virus there is.

"""Maybe you should be more understanding of your parents because your parents were abused too""",628,i8eakd,105,"No STFU, my parents being abused by their own parents DOES NOT JUSTIFY them abusing me throughout my childhood. Sure abuse can be a cycle but they, themselves made the conscious decision to continue it. 

I'm sick of people trying to invalidate my anger/emotions. No child deserves to be abused, especially by those who are supposed to protect and take care of them."
Do you guys realize that we are at the cutting edge of trauma knowledge here? I mean the average psychologist doesn't have the collective wisdom we have,630,a6olvk,80,"I know some of you guys are worried about us not having a moderator here. And l know there is a bit of repetition on here. And people get triggered by others at times.And we are growing ever bigger because of the huge global need for childhood trauma help. But we have to look at the overall trajectory of r/cptsd, and it's really really impressive. The kindness and empathy for each other on here moves me to tears. And the rawness and vulnerability and honesty of people's posts moves me to tears. There are some incredibly brave people here. And the collective knowledge of childhood trauma information is world class. How our brains are broken, how to fix them...
 I mean it. I think we are doing something really important here. For each other. For ourselves. We are trying to save lives here, to make our lives worth living, To give each other the gift of hope. 
This is sacred healing work right here.
 Because you are worth it, even if you can't yet see it for yourself.
 Never give up.

Put him in prison,629,gxogsa,28,We did it. We put my daughter's abuser in prison.  I was so afraid to have a panic attack at the sentencing hearing and then while I was giving my victim impact statement. Just wanted to share the victory.
"When people say ""you're the only one holding yourself back"", it has a whole different meaning to us.",631,lliwa4,58,"Sure, letting go/working through a few obstacles in life is normal for most if not everybody. 

When someone tells me that I'm ""the only one holding myself back"" in life, it reminds me of how truly unaware others who haven't experienced horrible, life-altering abuse, are. It reminds me how intangible my experience has been for so many blissfully-ignorant people that think the world is 100% fantastic, and how I don't envy them anymore. 

I always wished that I had a better childhood with loving parents, and wished that everything was ""different"". 

What those people will never understand is how good they've always had it, and I now know that I have the opportinity to appreciate life on a *deeper* level. 

It's a gift and a curse, knowing what's actually holding me back."
I don't want my parents to be proud of me nor tell them about my achievements.,627,jqxtnd,87,"This one is hard to explain. But them being proud of be I get the same internal reaction of dread, questioning myself and reaction if I did something disapproving in their perspective."

I bought a weighted blanket after years of wanting one and it’s amazing,628,hp39pp,53,"I have money related trauma. My family lost their house to the bank and I was blamed for significant parts of it. When I moved out of home I couldn’t bring myself to buy anything over $20 for the first two years.

I knew I wanted a weighted blanket for ages but I couldn’t bring myself to spend 200$+ on a blanket of all things. Even when I had the money to spend and started being able to buy myself clothes and things, it just seemed impossible.

Well I finally did it. My therapist encouraged me to after my last SH incident and I ordered one a few weeks ago and it arrived. I had the best sleep of my life last night and used it when I got stressed and it helped me not feel like hurting myself."

I finally got a PTSD diagnosis!! I feel so validated!!,627,gs7bw0,49,"I know a diagnosis is not good news for everyone. But for me it feels great. I don't even like the DSM very much, nor the field of psychiatry used to enforce it (e.g. the psychiatrist I spoke to didn't acknowledge my use of ""C-PTSD"" and kept asking if I had flashbacks). 

But still, this makes it official that I have *something*. It helps quiet the part of my brain (in my mother's & father's & abusive ex's voice) that says ""You're making this up"" or ""You're blowing this out of proportion"" or ""I don't see what the big deal is.."" 

They put me on some anti-depressants (I've never taken pharmaceuticals before) for my other diagnosis: Generalized Anxiety Disorder. I don't really have faith in the drugs, but I don't care. I'm just happy that someone, some institution, is like: ""Someone fucked you up, *bad*.""

Yeah, they sure did."

I’m beginning to realize that I can listen and trust my own body,625,i1jt8e,43,"I was always told I was “faking” being sick or being tired. I was never allowed to nap when I was tired, was never believed that I was in pain, and was always told I wasn’t actually feeling the way I felt. 

I’m beginning to realize, though, that I CAN trust my body. If I have a headache, its real. Im not making it up, the pain isn’t fake, I’m not imagining things. And i can fix it too, I can take pain reliever. I don’t HAVE to ignore my pain and pretend it’s not there, I dont have to suffer through it, and most importantly, I know my pain is REAL. 

If I’m tired and not doing something important or urgent, I can sleep. I dont have to push through my fatigue. I don’t have to punish myself. 

I can’t believe it took me so long to realize all of this. I was convinced for YEARS that my body was lying to me and that if I was in pain, i was just imagining it. But I’m not. We deserve to take care of ourselves.

I know its a little victory for myself, but I hope someone else here can read it and realize that what they feel is real and that they can take care of themselves."
"DAE refer to themselves as ""us"" or ""we"" internally and have to censor it to ""I"" when speaking outloud?",623,hvwybb,157,"(24F, I figured out a few years ago I spent a lot of time dissociating and was missing most of my memories.)
 
I always feel such deep shame when I say something like ""We are going to go outside."" instead of ""I am going to go outside.""

It's like I constantly have 2 me's arguing in my head and I never realized it was unusual. They dont seem to have different identities. 

It doesn't happen all the time, right now I am focused on this task so I am the one performing it. When I get lost in thought or am trying to make any kind of decision, the inner conversations start. For example, the other day I was laying on the couch and I thought to myself:

- 1: Why dont we draw?
- 2: *sideways glance at notebook* meh
- 1: So you're just going to stare of into space all day instead?
- 2: yup.

There's a disconnect between my body and mind, but also within my mind. A lot of times, I will think to myself ""you should go do this."" when trying to urge my body to do something."
Puppy Mills,621,ec8u9i,74,"My therapist said this thing the other day...

When people bring puppies home from puppy mills and release them in nice big houses, the puppies still pace back and forth in a 2x2 foot area, as if they’re still inside those tiny cages. It takes time to adjust to anything. Even freedom. 

I’ve seen so many people on here talk about how self sabotaging they are after escaping abuse, or how it’s hard to even get the basics done. It gives me this image of a puppy in a giant living room, pacing in a circle so small it can’t straighten its body all the way."
Something I noticed about my adopted cat that inspires me in my recovery.,618,d5bg8i,80,"When I first adopted Ollie two years ago he was completely silent. He never meowed at all. I pay a lot of attention to him and he has things like cuddles and treats and toys for the first time ever because of me. A year ago he started making a funny howl. It was kind of rare, but it was his version of a meow for things he really really wanted. If it was something he was allowed to have, I'd be sure to try to get it for him. 

I've been going through a lot of tough growth too and recently just started feeling like I could try being vulnerable.  I have been trying some new more affectionate things with Ollie and started letting my feelings really grow for him finally. And last week he started making all these new noises! He's making little meows all the time now. And they are a whole new noise like a cat meow now. 

I think he is growing and expressing himself more because life with me is good. It gives me a little good feeling every time he tells me something new because it kind of feels like he found his voice just like I am for the same reasons."

Does yelling make anyone else nervous even when not directed at you?,624,ama6g7,65,"I went to the doctors today and the man in line ahead of me... when he got to the reception desk (he was silent until this moment) went OFF! He was pissed about being put on hold for over 30minutes and his prescription not being at the pharmacy etc etc. 

He has reason to be mad and annoyed but... none of that was the reception guys fault who handled it so calmly.

I really couldn’t do that... I would have just disassociated and called for someone else to deal with it.

Yelling makes me uncomfortable and I wasn’t even a part of this situation other than an observer."

Fuck everyone who hasn’t apologized to me."
"The catchphrase ""Love means never having to say sorry"" is a bunch of bullshit",618,ksr2iv,76,"It encourages abuse. ""Oh, well the fact that I love you means regardless of what I do or say to you, it's okay, *because I love you.*"" 
 
 
I don't feel like abusers really know how to love. I think that they *think* they know, but their form of ""love"" isn't love at all. They're mostly only concerned with their own happiness or how they can benefit from another person. They feel better when controlling and putting others down. Now, I understand that they are the way they are because of going through the same abuse they perpetuate, but that doesn't make it okay, and doesn't mean those of us who want to be happy and good people have to deal with it. It also doesn't mean I can't express my absolute horror at their behavior. 
  
 
I grew up thinking all families hurt each other physically, verbally, and emotionally. I thought it was okay to put each other down, to take information that was confidential and use it against them, to hit them, to say awful and horrible things, hold things over their head, tell them they're worthless and that you wished they were dead, purposely instigate them so you can then twist anything they say or do to make them look bad, etc etc. I grew up thinking if you loved someone, then you also hurt them and they probably deserved it and it's okay to treat them like that.    

  
It took me a long time to get out of those habits I'd been around. As an adult almost 30, I would now never even think about doing or saying any of those things to someone I love. It's just not cohesive with the kind of person I've chosen to be.  
   
  

What are some other catchphrases that really mean something negative?"
"Y'all ever just step back, look at yourself and your life, and think, ""Well...how the FUCK am I going to fix this?""",617,glu78i,76,"Like, man, I feel like there's just *so much wrong* and I don't even know where to start...

I'm determined to fix myself, to help myself, but *man,* it's just *so much.*

"Uhm so who else thinks....that a grown man/woman is absolutley, demonicaly, pathetic for abusing their offspring, who is most likely half their size, just to get some personal dominance sh**?",621,eq4t95,116,They know their kid is smaller then them and cant fight back.

Question for freezing types.,625,dqzq1r,136,"Has any of you also been so deeply immersed in avoidance behaviours that you have lost track of what you truly are and what you want? Like you've been in a haze most of your life. And at times you emerge and freak out but then when things get overwhelming you go back to dissociating.
In fact I've lived most of my life in a daze and only doing what I'm supposed to. Not because I wanted to. Most of my interests or hobbies were born from me distracting myself as a child from the chaotic environment, so I cannot for sure say I even enjoy them at all. I don't know what I like or what my personality is truly like. I have just followed the flow. In times of clarity I feel absolute dread over how some people seem so alive while I am more like a carcass, an empty vessel. 
I don't know who I am, how I feel, how I'm like, what I like. So confusing."

DAE get mad when you are told to forgive your abusers?,620,fney3e,137,I mean yeah I would like to be able to forgive them and move on but I can't stand when I am told to practice compassion with them especially when it comes to pedophiles. I don't care if I am evil for saying this but I could care less if all the pedos in the world get struck by lightning or get coronavirus and die. I recently joined a group focused on spirituality and I got suggested to be compassionate to pedophiles. Clearly they drank too much of the forgiveness kool-aid.
Extreme case. Abuser LITERALLY killed me,620,f9dvuj,90,"My family is really dysfunctional. My oldest brother is schizo and my closest brother is dead. This has caused my dad to start drinking more than usual. He has been really abusive the past year, especially when drunk. He has pulled his gun on the family more than once, and threatened to shoot me before.

On the morning of Nov 19th last year, he started drinking earlier than usual. Somebody (who he assumed was the neighbors) called animal control on our dog for being tied to a tree, and my dad got really heated. He went in the back and started screaming curse words towards their house. They came outside cursing back at him. Somehow he felt he needed to go get the gun.

He kept telling me to be a man and that I didn't have balls. He kept insulting me and made me watch him handle the gun. While handling it he accidentally fired and shot me in my hip. I bled out right there in my own house. The force of the bullet spinned me a quarter circle. I just remember seeing blood gushing out of me like a geyser when I looked down. I didn't really understand what happened, and not a single thought went through my mind. I acted purely on instinct to survive. I tried to walk to a chair to sit down, but my leg was paralyzed as he severed my femoral nerve. This is when I fell down, still very confused, with the most eerie feeling of death creeping up on me. I felt myself getting colder and the screaming and crying of my father getting quieter. It all felt so unreal. He said he saw me fix my eyes on the roof and I didn't blink again. The neighbors heard the shot and called police. My dad frantically tried to stop the bleeding, to no avail. Seeing the picture of my own pool of blood puddled over my death bed was perhaps the most bone chilling experiences I've ever felt. I am truly blessed to look back on this alive. Anyway, when the police showed up he was arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. This was later dropped when I testified for him while in the hospital.

By the time I made it to the hospital I flat-lined and was not breathing. My pulse came back very weak after a first round of CPR until I flat-lined again. God made miracles and I survived after spending 2 months in the hospital, receiving over 20 units of blood and undergoing 13 surgeries. I spent Thanksgiving, my 21st birthday, Christmas, and new years all in pain and on a hospital bed. I still have about a hole about 3 inches wide in diamater that goes as deep as my femur bone. I lost many nerves so now I can't use my quadricep muscles. I'm very blessed to not have suffered very major brain damage from the lack of blood and oxygen to my brain. It destroyed the second largest artery in my body, along with another artery and major vein. Also part of my scrotum was hit and I'm lucky to keep my genitals.

He didn't pull the trigger purposefully, but his actions required the use for a gun, AND put me in the position to be hit by it. Now he's definitely improved. He's stopped drinking, but he still has abusive tendencies. My current doctor AND physical therapist say I won't run again. I have chronic lymphedema since my lymph node was also destroyed. This means my leg is always very swollen, like stage 2 of [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/Lower_Limb_Lymphedema.png/588px-Lower_Limb_Lymphedema.png). I also have huge scars and large patches of skin that were taken from my thigh to graft the wound. I don't have feeling and sensation throughout a majority of my left leg. He tells me this all doesn't matter because people won't know and all that matters is I'm alive and walking (with a walker right now). This is really hurtful and I can't explain the pain I feel. I get really nervous and scared even riding in a car. People have become really really scary and I feel silly explaining this to family.

I hate feeling vulnerable and defenseless which is exactly what I am now. I already have a life-long history of abuse with my older brother, but now I feel  like I've been completely broken down and don't know how I'll ever continue living again, with a new disability at that. The family seems not to care and my injury doesn't get very much attention. I constantly get told I'm not appreciative enough and there's nothing wrong with me because there are people who have it worse. When I take my clothes off to clean my wound my brothers shout at me and tell me to turn around and face away from them or move somewhere else. 

Dancing was one of my passions. When I tried to explain how much I miss it, my brother made fun of me for ""complaining."" A lot of things that Dr. ordered me to do has been neglected. Hell, it's been 3 months and they still have to ask which leg is hurt when they help me put on pants. I wish I could do things myself but I physically can't and no one is willing to help, and honestly I've grown reaaaaaalllly tired of having to beg for their help and still not getting any. My mom or brothers can't even pick up a prescription for me, it is still sitting at the pharmacy after a month now.

For anyone still living with abusers, please do your best to keep yourself safe, however that may be. It may save your life. I was always anxious and never felt safe. I knew it was a matter of time, and my own lack of action resulted in this."
I finally got over myself and ordered grocery delivery online and wow.,617,hiv6w4,86,"I HATE going to the grocery store, as so many of us cptsd-ers do, and just like that, the weight is lifted.

I’ve been stuck in this hellish cycle where every weekend I stress out about it and procrastinate, I spend so much time just making a game plan so I can get in and out as quick as possible. I put off other things I need to do because I tell myself grocery shopping is more important, and then I keep saying I’ll go soon I just need to get ready by relaxing aka scrolling through reddit. And then, because I want to get out of there so bad I only get enough food for one week so I force myself to repeat this process every single weekend.

And why have I been choosing to live in this purgatory of my own creation? Because the idea of putting someone else through the hell of grocery shopping makes me feel so guilty. Because I feel like getting things delivered to my door is just taking the easy way out, like grocery shopping is a necessary evil. And because I feel like the people who delivery groceries must hate it (no proof, my brain just decided that it’s a fact) and I assume that they think that I’m so privileged and pompous that I can’t even get my own groceries. 

Why do we make our lives harder than they have to be because we feel guilty about things we didn’t do and can’t control? If you’re doing this to yourself, whether it is grocery shopping or something else, stop it! We need to work on making our lives easier and breaking repetitive patterns that make us miserable."
Feeling great during pandemic,613,ft3hd9,76,"Sorry if this comes off as insensitive to anyone who is currently struggling because of Covid-19.  I just want to share my experience and I’m curious if anyone else is feeling similarly.

I feel fan-fucking-tastic.

I haven’t left my home since March 2nd and I have never felt such low anxiety and depression.  All my negative mental health symptoms cleared up because of this break.

I am working from home and during my breaks I’ve been making healthy meals and cleaning my home and doing yoga.

all the shit I never had time to do.

Turns out I really am not a lazy asshole
I just never actually have time to take care of myself and do self care.

I’m not getting screamed at by a coworker or touched or bumped into on the street or on the train.

I’m saving money and eating healthier than ever.

I’m watching cooking videos and yoga videos and going to bed early because I don’t have a 2 hour fucking commute 

I feel so great and I’m going to grieve when this is over."
Anyone else always assume that no one is attracted you?,622,f3thil,159,"I was body shamed and bullied growing up. My height, weight and boob size. My mom would pick out and criticize everything. She would humiliate me. I stuffed my bra at age 9 because she always made fun of my “mosquito bites” for boobs. When she found out I was doing this, she waited until we were in front of like 10 family members and started pulling the tissue out of my shirt. 

All of It has had such an impact. I ***never*** assume someone is attracted to me. Ever. Even when it’s obvious. When I find out someone is, I start asking myself why. Why would they like me? In the back of my mind, I don’t get why anyone would. I always feel shame and like I’m not enough for anyone."
"28 F, TW; Walked out of a work meeting!",618,ddb11p,44,"Yesterday, we had a team meeting with free sandwiches from Jimmy John’s. The meeting was quite relaxed, as we all ate and talked about fall. Toward the end though, my lead asked an ice breaker question that caught me off guard. 

“When did you feel like an adult?” 

My coworker went into some personal details about her family history that triggered me. As the seconds stabbed by and the walls closed in, I realized I was in the early stages of a panic attack. 

And I left! I excused myself and walked out. I went to the bathroom and sat in the stall. Did some deep breathing exercises while holding myself and my hands (they go completely numb and it’s horrific).

My manager came to check on me, and I told her what happened. She’s aware of my disability, so we went on a walk together to a nearby park, discussed the possibility of anxiety meds, and the feeling in my hands came back.

I was able to finish the work day off phones—even though I was given the option to go home early—and work calming in my headphones.

I feel really empowered for taking care of myself at work and having support from my manager. I know not to expect myself to finish a workday after a panic attack, but I’m pretty damn proud that I could yesterday.

Love you all and TGIF.

EDIT: I brought up that I was triggered, and I was looking into medication. My manager was merely there as a support while we waited for my panic attack to subside. 💜

EDIT #2: Wow! I’m so humbled and appreciative of everyone’s kind words, concern, and encouragement. Thank you so much for listening to me! The reason why I love this community so much is because we’re here healing together. I hope my story can brighten someone’s day, help them feel less lonely, inspire them to advocate for themselves, give them their own hope, and feel proud for their victories. 

Know that I love you, and I wish the very best for you."
DAE play dumb when they’re actually quite intelligent?,611,loulca,90," I can’t tell if I doubt my intelligence since I was raised believing that I’m stupid, or that I really am smart, but play dumb by default. Maybe it’s both, but I’m scared of showing my true intelligence around people because I fear that someone will use me for their own advantage. For example, I act like I don’t have anything meaningful to say during discussions or I’ll goof around a lot. So I give off a ditzy, carefree, talkative, and childish impression to others, when really, I’m quite observant, can predict patterns and trends, can read people, and can multiply large numbers in my head.

 Does anyone else do this?"
"The phrase ""Respect is Earned"" is literal emotional abuse",616,gc8p51,92,"""Respect is Earned"" implies that it is your job to prove, to justify even, your very worth as an individual to others. And that is then their right to pass final judgement on what qualifies as worth.

I mean, my goodness, and they wonder why millions of people are running around with a massive sense of worthlessness and self-esteem issues? Some of the most basic advice and expectations in our culture say worth is earned. Worth is not a right.

Fuck. That.

Also, every time I bring something like this up, people jump to the extreme, strawman couter-argument. ""Oh, so you're saying you want a world of ""Total Respect At All Times, No Matter What"". 

And no, I never said that.

The ideal is to live in the middle. Some respect should be an intrinsic right. In fact, I'd say, assume respect until proven otherwise. But, also, if someone behaves like an ass, it's okay to lose your respect for them. In other words..

It's not trust, but verify.

It's actually this:

Respect, but verify."
I told my Dad I didn't feel safe around him and left.,620,efopxc,48,"I was crying and I know he thought it looked weak. But fuck it. I stood up for myself and made him aware of exactly what was wrong. Now I'm drowning my face in ice cream but it's okay I deserve it.

I had a moment with my mom the other day that really showed me how damaging emotional incest is. She made one simple statement that rocked me to my core,616,lboah8,57,"I was crying because I was feeling lonely. I live at home as of right now. I'm not stable enough to get a good job or to focus on paying rent. Anyway, I was really depressed & suicidal. It got to the point where I couldn't hide it, and it was obvious to everyone in the household. I was also very lonely, and started to get angry at myself for always failing to successfully form relationships with people. I started to cry uncontrollably, and hit myself on the head. I lost it at that point. My mom runs over & says ""why are you hitting yourself? Why do I go through so much in life? Why me??"". I immediately stopped crying, walked into my room, closed my door, and went to sleep. Her statement shocked the hell out of me because it made me realise that all this time I was sharing all of her burdens & vice versa. A little seven year old was sharing the burdens of a depressed, insecure, and anxious mother who was being cheated on, and emotionally abused by her husband. At that moment I realized that I should not blame myself for being ""messed up"" or ""not emotionally functional"" as an adult. I'm never hitting myself again. It's not my fault."
Quarantine hasn’t been much of a change for me at all... and I just figured out what that might mean.,615,ga2oo8,72,"I’ve told people that the quarantine hasn’t changed my life much at all. I just realized what it means that it has been a change for most others. It means that aside from their job, they were going and doing things. And they dislike having to stop doing things. 

It’s been as long time since I did things. Many years. So sitting around the apartment looking at screens all day is just my normal. And for others it’s torture. Maybe it’s harming me too?"

Can I just get the permission to be useless and ruin my life?,613,icobnc,116,"I hate expectations from anyone and everyone.

I'm barely able to keep myself fed and showered I can't do much else unless I'm guilt tripped into it, which doesn't help mentally...

I really can't deal with life, and the older you get the worse it is. 

""You will be 30,what are going to do about X? Why haven't you done Y yet? You know, Z will be soon, you should XYZ..""

The guilt and pressure is just UNBEARABLE.

I'm totally fine fucking my own life up.

What I'm not fine with is affecting others, which I inevitably am doing by.. Well, just by being how I am.


I want to play games, do drugs, and listen to music, OK? I can't do and don't want to do anything else I'm not capable of it. I also want to be abandoned by everyone so that I don't have to feel the burden of hurting them by letting myself go. 

Can you get off my fucking back?

"Inner child work is great, but don't forget about your inner teenager!",609,f7outa,111,"I had a breakthrough realization recently that while the work I do to nurture my inner child is beneficial to my younger parts, it doesn't do a lot for the wounded adolescent in me. I experienced really different kinds of trauma in early life than I did during my teens and struggled in different ways, and the teenager in me is still really hurting from feeling so emotionally abandoned and alone for so long. She also can't be soothed the same ways the inner child can, with stuffies and blanket forts and hugs. She needs to be talked to with a different vocabulary, supported in different ways, given different rewards for her progress.

Since I had this realization I've been able to bust through some emotional blocks that were holding me back, and I feel like I'm making progress healing parts of myself that weren't responding to my earlier efforts. If you feel like inner child work isn't helping, or if it's addressing some issues more successfully than others, try talking to your younger self the way you would an older kid and see what happens!"
DAE feel shame when feeling any needs?,615,elf273,109,"We're working through this in therapy right now and it's just so hard. I really don't feel most of my needs, only the basic ones. Whenever we talk about it I feel so much shame and fear that I somehow get exposed or something, I don't even really know what that means. It's very confusing and I feel like it's something I can't ever change. It feels like I'm kind of stuck.

Does anyone else have a hard time feeling their needs and how did you get over this?"
I’ve been rationalising trauma my whole life,612,eektbu,41,"When you’re young, it’s the only reality you know.

I’m the eldest - I had nothing to look up in life to except my parents.

Now I see them for what they are - a pair of gaslighting narcissists. They would rather pave over their mistakes with concrete than address them.

We lived in a succession of nice houses, all well preserved and maintained. Just don’t talk about what happens inside.

And that’s how I coped -  by becoming invisible. By pretending I didn’t have needs. By rationalising it away. And when I would lash out, naturally it was my fault. And it made me feel unlovable. 

An abusive holding pattern.

They held me hostage. I’m done being their hostage. I can’t take it anymore. Not for those two. I have to let myself out of the cage I put myself in.

I need to heal. I need it all to go away. So I stop rationalising trauma. So I stop idealising people who I think will save me. I just need it all to go."

I'm not a failure. I was failed. There's such a big difference.,611,d6q1c1,56,"I'm going to therapy again now that I'm back in university, and my therapist has been doing a lot of information gathering. Yesterday we had a whole session basically talking about whether I had support or help outside of my immediate family.

As I told her the aspects of it, I slowly realized how I was failed completely and totally by the government, my community, my family, and even the *police.* Nobody ever did anything, even with ample opportunity to do so. 

My extended family did nothing. CPS was never, ever involved, even when I told my second grade teacher I was being beaten and tortured by my older brother and I was scared of my father's drugs. The police never did anything, even when called out, save for when a parent went to a psychiatric unit after a failed suicide, and even then, nobody ever came and talked to me. Nobody ever did anything to help me. Ever.

I'd never thought about that before. I'm not a failure. I didn't deserve those things, but of course I feel like I did, because the entire world convinced me by lack of interference that it was normal. By failing to do a single thing to help me, I was convinced it was normal and that I must have deserved it. Because of course if I didn't deserve it, someone would have done something, right? Someone, at any point in time. But nobody did. 

Obviously I feel like a monster, because the world convinced me that I deserved all those horrible things that happened to me, and in order to deserve such atrocities, I must have been really horrible, right?

Truth is, *I* was failed. The world was the horrible one. Someone should have helped me. Someone should have done *something.* But nobody did. Not because *I'm* bad, but because *they* are."

Nothing pisses me off more than people lecturing me about the importance of family.,612,e6myoj,98,"Don't get me started.... I was at the rec center in a pool exercise class and this lady wouldn't f*cking shut up. Between her and the shitty music I almost lost it.  But alas, here I am, complaining about it.

"""It could be worse""",614,hp9ylx,113,"I hate this so much. Really. Nobody seems to know the line where you're magically allowed to be traumatized or in pain, but everybody seems certain there is one and whomever they are talking to is *obviously* nowhere near it. 

""I cut my hand and had to get stitches.""

""At least you didn't cut a finger off!""

""I cut my finger off in an accident."" 

""At least you have your hand!""

""I lost my hand in an accident.""

Wish I could auto-hide anything to do with mother's day,616,gdavl2,89,"So many posts online, so many ads, so many random ""bake this for your mom"" recipes I'm seeing.

I have no reason to feel guilty, but man every single time I see mother's day stuff I get this shitty feeling.  I have not spoken to my mom since Dec.  And the messages I've got from her since then made me see how much of a right decision I made.  Yet I know she is just waiting to see if she hears from me on Mother's day and I don't like how I'm feeling about it.  I don't want to talk to her or message her but something about Mother's day coming up makes me feel all obligated.  Even though I'm not.  Ugh.  I'm not going to be messaging her or talking to her but I just hate the feeling I get when I see ""Mother's Day"" stuff right now. 

I wish I could enter into my phone and computer to not show me anything related to Mother's day."
Anyone had their diary/journal read as a kid and hasn't written down personal thoughts since?,607,eoxj3n,170,"I used to keep a diary in highschool. I wrote poetry and short stories that won me scholarships. I also wrote down a draft of my suicide note. Detailed my low self esteem and broken identity and it was all used against me. Held in front of me like a dog being dragged over to its accident on the rug to be traumatized. Congrats parents. You did it. I realized today I never really wrote down my thoughts like that again. To this day as a married adult that is NC with her abusers I still dont know if I could. Part of my life I've blocked out comes back to me in bits a pieces and sometimes I wish it just would stay a blur. Then I dont have to be reminded of all the things they took from me.

Edit. Theres a lot of replies way more than I thought I'd get. I just want to say I'm so glad people were able to share their experience in the comments whether it differed or not from mine. Sending positive vibes your way hopefully we can all become aware of these similarities and not feel so isolated in our trauma. I find the most ""no one else feels like this or had this happen"" situations are ones that I see people also post about and the validation is real. Lets continue to speak up and build that web of support and understanding :)"

Managed to keep my focus during an argument!,607,mc6rwi,44,"Two days ago my partner and his father got into a bad argument. And not only did I manage to stay focused without dissociating or ""freezing"", but I even mediated between them! Did all standing behind the backrest of the living room couch because I felt I needed some kind of shield I guess (it helped, can recommend). Also my stomach just clenched up and I couldn't eat lunch afterwards but still I feel it was a big victory! Hurray for me and some encouragement for you all! Improvement is possible!"
10 minutes till I tell my mom about my abuse as a kid.,603,hkj4f1,29,"I'm in my therapist's office. Nervous as shit. I hope it goes well.

Does anyone struggle with reverting to fantasy worlds due to past abuse?,603,iwg88z,109,"So I went thru lots of abuse, such as being left with unofficial babysitters even at 19 and never being allowed to grow up to the point even now, at 24, I find it hard to do adult things and keep reverting to a teenage mindset, but my main issue is that due to neglect by parents I resorted to fantasy worlds, such as gaming, anime or fiction to cope, and even today I revert to a fantasy world where I'm still young, the abuse by others never happened and my family is loving and I can hide from reality forever. In this state I tend to avoid responsibilities and read fiction a lot and I guess I was wondering if anyone else had experience with this and knew how to cope with reality and adult responsibilities. My apologies if this is the wrong place."
Why should a beaten dog let his owners pet him?,606,gafxz4,50,"In this quarantine my mother said multiple times I could visit her to not be so lonely.

But she destroyed me. This little girl that just wanted a mother, that gifted her these ""best mother of the world"" mugs and books. She neglected me, bullied me, made me feel worthless and lonely.
And now she thinks that her presence would help me?
No. 
You're a different person now, I get it. But that doesn't change what you did. It never will. Cause I have a sh*t ton of therapy and problems to go through because of you. You had over 20 years. 
No.

You never were."
