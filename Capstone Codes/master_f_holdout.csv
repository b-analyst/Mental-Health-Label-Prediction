0,"I feel this way most days and I'm getting sick of it. Sometimes it happens because I feel overwhelmed with all the stress university puts on me. Other times it's because I feel like I don't matter to anyone and I feel guilty for being here when my life doesn't even seem to have a real purpose. But even when nothing bad is going on in my life, it just feels like everything is pointless and there's nothing that can help. I try to do fun things when I feel this way but everything feels boring. 
There are times when I feel better and motivated to do things but the bad feelings come much more often than the positive ones. I cannot stand feeling empty, I wish I could feel good about myself and life all the time. Is that where I go wrong? Am I just looking for a quick fix that won't happen because depression isn't something that I can cure? I have the feeling that maybe I should just take a break from everything when I feel like this and sleep it off until I feel better. That always makes me feel guilty, as I feel bad when I'm not doing something productive and I realize that I've wasted time doing nothing and I still have so much left to do at the end of the day.."

0,"I can understand if my situation was a permanent one. Sure. Make the best with what you have. But if I can change my life for the better, why shouldn't I aim for that? I feel like people are telling me to just settle and never try. Does that apply for others as well or is it just me? I never hear anyone tell anyone else not to find a job, or a hobby, or not to go back to school when the person is willing and able. So why do I have to be stuck where I am?"
0,"So suicidal thoughts are really common to me but something that has been happening more and more is they are appearing no matter what mood I am in. 
Is this normal?
I was walking back from once from doing work and I had done a good amount of work and felt good about it. But as I walked back, I saw a fence that led to an open area with a huge drop and wanted to hang myself from it with my bag. I wasn't ""feeling"" suicidal, I just... wanted to kill myself.

The slightest bit of stress still trips me up and sends me into a downward spiral but I'm not sure what these suicidal thoughts are all about when I'm like, fine. I have an appointment with a psychiatrist that I think might help but...sometimes suicide really seems the better option. Even when I'm thinking ""rationally"" I'm just like ""But then I don't have to deal with it all. The expense of living, the trouble of having emotions, not being able to apply for a job without getting depressed halfway through the application and just not doing it, and just the day-to-day struggle of failing in so many different aspects of my such simple things.

It just seems easier that way. I very much doubt I'll ever do it."

0,"Hello,

This is me Sarah I have 23 years old, born in small village at Ayat, Giza, Egypt. I knew a person from the work, he is an italian- Argentine, muslim. We fell in love and we decided to get married. As I wanted to do the right thing even though, my relationship with my family are so bad, with such a arrogant and traditional father who sees himself a God, no one could ask or talk about something that could be different than what he says. I did the right thing and told him that there's a person in my job that he wanted to ask for marrying me. He got so angry, cursed me and told me that I'm bich and he threaten my brothers if I go back to work again he will kill me because he thinks that I have ruined his honor, then he's now locking me out from 3 months and didn't want me to go back to work again. Now I'm living in the same house where they live but in a different apartment, i live with my brothers now, because they're afraid of him that he could do something bad to me. I'm very afraid and tired of being here, everyday is like a nightmare for me. I don't want to lose my life, myself nor the person that I fell in love with and I don't know what to do, please help me to find a solution to this situation.
My boyfriend and me we're already planning, so I could escape from here and get married, but I'm very afraid that they could found or for calling the police. Especially here in Egypt, the whole issue of honor so they can kill me, I'm horrified. Can you tell me please what to do"
0,"My dear friend had to admit her suicidal teen this week. He is really struggling with the experience and wants to come home, and she feels like he needs to stay in longer to get new medication sorted and some treatment under his belt before he should come home (he was actively suicidal and self-harming before being admitted, and spent two days on suicide watch in the ER while waiting for a bed to open up).

She is torn between his desire to come home and her desire to see him safe and getting his severe depression treated. She would like to speak to adults whose parents made them go through hospitalization(s) as teens to
hear about their experiences and the long-lasting effects of that. Is anyone willing to chat with her over email
about their feelings on the subject?"
0,"I had a vision of myself living on my own (with my dog) in an apartment close to work by the end of this year or early next year. I am 32, work fulltime in a government job, but I still live in my parent's house because of two reasons: I am still waiting to be promoted to afford a monthly rent (plus I want to have an emergency savings fund before I live on my own), and my mother is very, VERY clingy to me. 

I have been living with schizoaffective disorder for the past 10 years. Are my goals/dreams to move out a sign of delusions of grandeur? 

Can anybody relate? Any advice? Thanks."

0,"Hello Friends.

A quick note about me.  I suffered for quite some time with depression. Most days I felt as if I could sleep for days, everything felt very surreal and confusing, and each and every day, from beginning to end, felt like a struggle. 

It all came to head when I had a massive anxiety attack while at work.  It was so bad that my mind couldn't shake counting it as a ""near death experience"" because of how convinced I was that I was going to die that day.

I can't promise what I'm about to say will help you, but I can tell you it helped me tremendously. 

I decided to learn a creative hobby, and I chose to paint.  I've now decided to live stream these paintings to help others paint beautiful pictures in a simplistic format.  Again, it may not be a ""cure all"" for you, but maybe it'll take you away for at least an hour.

I wish you nothing but the best.  Its a long journey, but stay brave."
0,"I needed to take an exam today. I studied really hard. Took the exam in about an hour, and now I'm just wiped. Does anyone else get completed wiped out by mental exertion? After one exam a few months ago, I was physically sick for two days after. If feels like it hurts to think. Too bad I picked a profession that requires me to use my brain....

In the last 5 weeks: I lost my job, was ghosted by a person that I had been seeing for months,  my Grandmother died, and I got sick (on my birthday- which was a milestone one). It’s just been hit after hit and I can’t see anything improving. I have lost every ounce of faith and hope. I’m scared to keep going. I’ve had depression for the last 20 years and I just feel like I’ve hit the darkest place that I have ever been. I’m really scared."

0,"I used to be able to work on large and epic projects. I was once able to self publish childrens picture books and create animated short cartoons. I used to enjoy these hobbies, but now my motivation is gone. Its been more than ten years of rejections from literary agents and film festivals. Why should I continue? Its just a waste of my time and effort. If I continue my creative endeavors, it just feeds into my delusions of grandeur that someday I'll become famous.

Can anybody relate?"
0,"So my name is Natasha, I live in the UK. I'm not sure why I'm writing this or why I think this will help. Ive attempted suicide too many times to count... obviously and unfortunatly to no avail. My last attempt was two week ago, has well has the occasionaal self-harm. I'm currently and finally under the crisis team after much begging for help with my thoughts and voices. But it's not enough they visit me at my home every week but it's not enough it doesn't stop the thoughts, it doesnt stop the constant voices battling in my mind. I have been in hospital once before after I was raped that was my first true attempt and I was taken by the police and sectioned and to my surprise it did help me get back on track with the sole focus on immediate therapy access and routines it really did help. I'm not saying thats what I need now, I don't really know what I need I just know I need help soon, now, before its too late.
The lonliness i'm living in is all consuming, don't get me wrong my partner is very supportive but he is also very busy has a key worker which I understand but he also volunteers and will do a friday shift at work 9-7pm then straight to notthingham to volunteer and sometimes won't get back till 6.30am saturday morning, I'm unemployed due to debilatating seizures. So, It’s a long time to battle the feeling, the need to end the so called life, a long time to try to ignore the amplified voices telling me to finally just do it, end everyone’s misery. I know and I understand he needs his works has his outlet for stress and let’s be honest he gets a lot of stress from me so why would he want to come home. It hurts because I can see that my depression and my suicidal thoughts are affecting him, I can see what they are doing to him, but at the same time I feel I can’t control it. I see him motionless, his misery, because of me. That’s what I have done, that is what I’m doing to him, I’m making him a shell of the person he used to be. So if all I’m doing is destroying the people closest to me why won’t they just let me go once and for all and end everyone’s misery, even mine, in a selfish way most of all mine. Last night especially was a difficult one, I felt I was skating on thin ice, I had the means in my hand and I was so close to self harming but I didn’t. I managed to use self-distraction techniques by keeping myself busy. I made the bed and got a shower even if it was 12am at least I stopped that self harm, causing yet another scar on my skin like the lines joining a dot-to-dot puzzle. I’m tired and defeated of having to decipher what is me and what is the voice because I just can’t seem to distinguish between them anymore and they are getting louder and louder. Therefore, I’m scared that eventually evil will reign free over me one day, sooner rather than later too.
I’m just so tired but not the sort of tired that sleep can cure, I’m tired, I’m tired of trying, I’m tired of letting people down and I’m, tired of having to fake happiness for the sake of others, to make others feel better while I’m still tired of being sad. Sleep to me is a wonderous concept, always just out of grasp. And if and when I do manage to grab a hold of it , it’s fleeting. Maybe I get 3 hours in one go if I’m lucky which lately seem to full of voices and vivid paranormal nightmare. Which feels scarily real till I wake up to a different kind of nightmare... reality. If I do manage to get peaceful dreamy 3 hours which is ever so rare, I feel like I don’t want to want to wake up because I was having a much better time asleep, which is sad and depressing in itself. It’s almost like a reverse nightmare like you wake up relieved but instead I wake up into a nightmare, I hate that feeling because I know deep down, if I really think about it I have so much good in my life. Kenny is my saviour and the reason I have lasted this long but if I cannot appreciate or see what I have then I clearly don’t deserve it. So, may be if I died, my organs could go to someone who would appreciate them, who would appreciate life and all it has to offer. Maybe if I did die, they could use my organs and save lives worth living then, then I would have a purpose and a brilliant purpose at that. Maybe I’m not strong enough which is funny when you think about it considering everyone say people who commit suicide are weak. I disagree, I think they are strong, stronger than those if us living for the sake of it in unhappiness... like me. Why can’t I be that STRONG? Why can’t I DIE?
Tomorrow will be Friday, those are the hardest days and the days when the voices are the at their most loudest and when I'm likely to act. Kenny thinks he has all my medication but what he doesn't realise is, he hasn't got them all and I can't stop. I need help, but no one will help so what am I suppoused to do?"

0,"It's been a beautiful day here with sunshine and warmth. Too nice to be spent alone, walking around seeing everyone else hanging out, playing sports, having picnics, hiking etc (more or less socially distanced of course).
This is just a ramble of my thoughts on having a very lonely day. 
I live alone. Most of my acquaintances are co-workers. I don't have a strong core of friends anymore and I'm wondering who the hell I can spend these sunny days with when we're aloud to socialise properly again. 
But I survived the day and kept myself busy with chores and walks and music. 
So if you're alone out there, I share my feelings with you and I think of you, even without a face or a name I know there are others in a similar situation and I want to tell you (and myself) that this won't last. 
We'll all spend sunny days with loved ones soon enough."

0,"I feel like I can’t take it anymore. I have no confidence in myself. I hide in my room all day. I’ve never lived on my own. I fear losing my mom. I just think how my parents are getting older. I fear losing them. I fear losing my mom because she’s the only one I trust in the world. I feel like I want to die now because I am hopeless. I’m starting to get anger issues too. I am jealous of everyone. I erased all social media because I don’t even talk to the people on there. Some old school classmates added me probably just to have a higher number of friends. I was starting to get addicted to posting things and wanting Likes and attention. I did online dating and I give up. Guys like provocative women. I am jealous of these women who are confident and sexy. I hate myself and have a negative attitude. I want to stop therapy and all support groups. I’m gonna get dementia because all I do is lay in bed and look at my phone or sleep. I have no hobbies or goals. Nothing to offer in life. Feel helpless and hopeless. People tell me to get out of my shell because I have social phobia. My therapist makes me mad. She tells me to say positive things about myself and throw my hands up in the air and is forcing me to pretend I’m happy and positive. I didn’t want to throw my hands up and say I am amazing. Instead I looked down and got so mad and said I’m really uncomfortable and don’t want to talk. I have this immature attitude. That’s what my therapist always tells me. I am easily offended,nervous,shy,self conscious. I was in group therapy and I opened up about my low self esteem and regret it. They act as if it’s easy to get over. It is not just low self esteem but self hate which makes me hate everyone. I feel miserable. I’m also trying to cut out sugar,carbs,dairy. Because It causes acne and boils. Which causes low self esteem. It’s so hard to do. I have hidradenitis suppuritivA. I don’t want to be so negative."

0,"After a horrible 2020 where I lost a sister to cancer, another sister to politics and 2 very dear people to betrayal, I have been performing a review of my life. I've always struggled, sometimes financially, sometimes socially, some people say I might have aspergers, I have struggled with school, I have a terrible memory and a weird way of comprehending things. My romantic life has been a long string of jerks and some abusive people. I am divorced but more like a single mother since the father is a very absent figure.

In my country I can't complain much about my struggles because I'm white and they automatically assume I am just a spoiled brat that knows nothing of life. But I've walked many walks, some of them hard choices, others apparently good opportunities that always come with many obstacles I've had to sort out.

I am finally in a stable job with stable pay and I am finally living in decent conditions. I rent a house, my car is really the company's car, all I have is a little money that I am about to use for a medical procedure, worn out furniture I wouldn't even give away to charity and many books, my most prized treasure. I am ok with all of this.

What I'm not ok with is people. I've had gender dysphoria for 30 years now, it took me a long time to figure out it was never about wanting to be a man, I just didn't want to be a woman because it sucks. The social expectations, the abuse and constant harrassment, vulnerability, etc. And it was always hard for me to relate to women. It was easier to make friends with men, so a vicious cycle started since I was 13, girls hated me so I hanged out with guys, that gave me a slut reputation that was completely uncalled for (I lost my virginity at 22), so I was alienated by girls, which made me hang out even more with guys which would in turn sluttify me even more. But I was always proud of how easy it was for me to get male friends.

Recently I noticed a pattern, after my (lost the count) failed attempt at finding love, I decided I give up. It's just not worth it. That was when I noticed the pattern, those guys that I thought were easy to hang out with, about 85% of them eventually made a move on me. Some declared their undying devotion, others took ""no"" very badly and stopped talking to me, and a couple did manage to get me into bed and then ghosted me, one after 5 years of what I thought was a very good friendship. My conclusion to all of this is no, it hasn't been easy to relate to men. It is easy to get their attention, phone number, start a conversation. But for this to turn into a friendship, I must first prove I am more than just a vagina, more than just an ""I'd hit that"" girl. More than just a f*ckable person. I am tired of people not seeing the other things I have to offer. I am tired of being dissapointed. At this very moment, I feel like I don't understand this world and I don't feel like trying anymore. I don't understand how friendships work, and let's not even go to the love theme, that is just starting to gross me out. I am tired of the importance of sex that apparently justifies hurting people to get it. I am tired of being judged by women for things I don't do and tired of men just wanting an easy time.

I think a lot about not being here anymore. I don't want to die and I don't intend to do anything to speed that process, but I just don't want to be here anymore. I feel like I belong in another planet. Right now I feel like isolating myself from the world. Would it be healthy to do this? Not as in taking time off, but as in devoting myself to my kids and my work and my books and just avoiding people all together?"
0,"I’m so fed up, my depression has gone on for too long now. Nothing is getting better and I feel like I’m crying out for help so much and no one is listening. Since the pandemic all my mental illnesses have got worse, I’m so sick of them! I’m trying everything my mental health team are saying but it’s not helping.

 Due to Covid, my group therapy is postponed until further notice, so it’s anyone’s guess as to when that’ll start. This lockdown is also making matters worse too and it’s also anyone’s guess as to when it’ll be eased.

There’s only one way out, and one way that this will all go away, and I’m considering it. I don’t want to die but I guess this is the only way. Idek."
0,"The two sides of the same coin, anxiety and depression. For me it's mainly the anxiety, at least lately. I can deal with depression, I have medication that addresses that. And it's been awhile since I allowed my depression to get out of control, 3-4 years.

But anxiety? What can you do about that? Sure, you can pop a Xanax, but that has it's own risks. You're limited to how much you can take of benzodiazepine medication. I drink alcoholic beverages to take the'edge' off, but the relief I get from them is short lived and you can't abuse it.

Really, anxiety for me is much more difficult to address. Part of that is my intellectual makeup. I am an engineer by profession, problem solving and thinking things through to their final outcome is what I do for a living. Turning it off after work is the problem, I carry it over into my everyday life. Catastrophizing has become an integral part of my personality.

I wish I lived with someone, that would help I think. Having someone to talk to, share your concerns with, would be great. I live alone and work long hours out of the home due to the Pandemic. The feeling of isolation and being alone isn't helping the anxiety. Anyone in the same boat?"

0,"At First.. I’m sorry for grammatical mistakes, I’m from Germany so I‘m not the best in writing in English.

I have a big problem that bothers me wow for already a very long time, and I just don’t know what i can do about it. it’s something that affects my daily life and my close relationships.

I think I suppressed my sadness for too long  and now it all turned into anger. My therapist diagnosed me with depression, but meanwhile I’m thinking that there could be something else too because the way I’m feeling is not normal.

I barely can keep friendships, I never had a healthy relationship that was without manipulation and controlling, the relationship to my family is miserable and I have very strong problems with getting along with people I have to work with, no matter if it’s in school or at work.

at first I will tell you a Little background Information so you aren’t completely clueless why I’m the way I am, or what the causes could be for my behaviour.

Since I’m young I teached myself that being sad means being weak, and I have to defend myself or have to set myself into the ‚I’m heartless mode’.

The reason why I decided to do this was my mum. She has an alcohol addiction since I’m young and she is highly manipulative. I always lived alone with her, and when it started getting worse the rest of my family always left me alone with her and made me feel like it’s my responsibility.. so I needed to find myself a way that it wouldn’t hurt myself so much.. and the defensive and cold attitude was the easiest way for me.

from kindergarden till now people always saw me as the weird one, or just the one they could bully easily.. and now, even when people don’t have something against me, I feel like they don‘t like me or feel like they wasn’t to attack me and I have to prepare myself for a ‚fight‘

I can‘t have a normal friendship/relationship, because as soon as i feel attacked (even if I don’t get attacked) I get very cold and push everyone from me away.

when someone really hurts me, I get incredibly angry defensive and I’m making sure that this person will feel the same pain as I do (extremely toxic I know) afterwards I feel bad but then I’m like ‚who cares this person wasn‘t worth my time anyway‘ and I suppress it.

i also tend to cut people to fast off because I prefer to stay away from them & the possibility doesn‘t exist that they could hurt me again and I Look/feel vulnerable.

when I’m normal I’m completely friendly and nice, but as soon as something triggers me I turn into a whole different person. I sometimes wonder If I really know who I am and I’m maybe somebody else but just try to act different?

the things that make me realize my problems the most are my past relationships / lovers.

When I was in Highschool I got bullied of the boy I love, and I really really did love him. After a while someone told me that the girl who was my best friend at this time slept the whole time behind my back with him, and I never wan‘t to feel this pain again. I cried so much at this point, and now nowadays i have such a strong anger against her that I would like to hurt her. When I’m in a good mood and somebody says her name I get so fucking angry it’s normal, my best friend says that she is sometimes scared bc I suddenly have such an anger inside me.

i also had unhealthy online friendship, that was mostly based on arguing. I met him only when I was 12, and we had contact until I was 16 (bc Then i started dating someone and left him.. but we will come back to that later) we always argued so much and hard he loved to provokedme bc he loved seeing me down and feeling like the stronger one.

So now my last relationship.
When me and my ex- boyfriend were together there was a girl (who was his best friend before) who Tried to tear us both apart and really tried to make everyone hate us. He told me that he would never go back to her. I have Generally very strong trust issues and I’m always very scared of loosing someone so I felt extremely attacked. When she didn‘t stopped annoying her I texted her if she won‘t stop doing it I will get extremely angry and she will regret it. I didn‘t say Anything more but she could feel my energy through the message bc the next day she told people that she is scared of me. Of course when we broke up he posted a new video of him with her and I got so angry that I called him and extremely screamed through the phone. My whole body shaked and I was outside with my friends at this time so everybody could hear me but I didn’t care about it. I told him that I will take every single piece of his clothes, will set them on fire and will distribute this on his area bc I know she lives there too. After the call I calmed down and became extremely sad again and felt like the person who called him wasn‘t me.. or was that Me? I don’t know"

0,"As a young child I was always happy walking around without a care in the world. I would make friends with just about anybody that would talk to me. I remember one day at school we walked around the track 4 times, walking one mile. So I came home from school and told my dad that walking 4 laps around something was 1 mile. I believe I was about 7 or 8 at the time. So he said then walk around our table 4 times and I didn't want to but he forced me to and in a stern voice said was that a mile. It crushed me so much i cried. Jumping forward to when I was 12 as I can't remember much of my youth. This young girl about 17 years old nocked on the door and told us she was my fathers daughter. I remember she hung around for awhile and one day we were washing my dads truck and I sprayed her with the hose and she told my dad and he yelled at me for it. I believe it was a few months later my dad told us he was leaving to go be with this sister of ours. I broke down and cried for 3 days straight but on the 4th day i stopped crying and havn't cried about anything sense. That was the start of my mental breakdown. My mom was taking me to a therapist im guessing to see the effects the devorce had on me. But going forward a few more months the only friend I had at the time passed away from a heart condition. That was the final straw that broke my mental stability into pieces. Like a piece of glass my mind shattered into fragments. After that I only saw darkness in everyday life. I began to be bullied and school and getting into fights almost everyday. Around 14 years old i stared self harming as a release and when I was 15 I was arrested for having a knife on school grounds. The officer didn't care that it was an accident so he took me to juvie and i spent a week there as he waited till the last minute to file his paperwork. So as apart of my release i had to go to therapy and that lead to seeing a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and insomnia. He ended up prescribing me about 6 medications to manage my emotions and sleep. I was expelled from the school and had to go to a community day school. We had a few different teachers and there was one that i couldn't get along with and knowing the issues i had said that people with depression only have themselves to blame as its easy to be happy and its not a real condition. So the school moved me over to the credit recovery class as they wouldn't allow me to the main campus as i was expelled from a different school district. Continuing in this class one day our teacher was running late so they split us up between two teachers to wait for our own teacher to arive and they put me in the same room as the teacher i have issues with. I sat there on my phone as its not my class and I didn't have anything to do and she told me to give her my phone so i said no your not my teacher and I am in here waiting for my teacher. She said again give me your phone or go to the office so i stood up said f you flipped the desk walked out the door punching the wall on the way out. Now sitting in the office cooling off i felt mild pain in my hand looked down at it and noticed i broke my 5th metacarpal bone and told the lady I was with i think i broke my hand and she asked why so i showed her and she called my mom to pick me up and take me. Needless to say ma wasn't very happy but whatever right. So after that whole accident I was never put around that teacher again. Now 17 years old I had gotten really depressed and self harmed and took an overdose. I dont know why but decided to tell my mom i guess to say goodbye and she came in and took me to the er on the way i passed out and woke up in the hospital. From then on I have been in a constant state of ups and downs. I finished high school and went to school for automotive work and tried living my life. Around 24 i decide my meds wernt working anymore and stopped taking all of them and started to live a little happier. I got in touch with a girl I was friends with in high school and she had a 2 year old son and we eventually started dating and things were going good and we moved in together we both got a traveling job working together and traveled all over California rebuilding stores. We had a daughter together and now we are engaged trying to plan out a wedding. The biggest pain in our relationship is no matter how good she tries to make me feel i just cant share my feeling with her and it makes her pull away every now and then. I dont know if its the anxiety or the fact I grew up being told I cant have feelings or a mix of both.

Sorry for the long story and it jumping around but that is all I can remember of my life.

Thank you to anyone who read my story and gave me a moment of your day."
0,"I've had 3 bouts of depression and anxiety, 1 at 18 one at 25 and one at 36. The first 2 times I was prescribed fluoxetine, I got worse for about 2 weeks, then after around 6 weeks started to feel back to myself.
The 3rd time I was prescribed fluoxetine, this time it didnt work. 
It took about a year to find medication that worked, and a long time after that to feel any kind of normality.
During this period my brain wouldnt stop racing, my thoughts didnt feel like my own and I was terrified of every thought I had however normal. I cried daily and it's no exageration to say every second of every day was a battle. It's hard to describe but I really felt this wasnt just depression and anxiety, but that I had gone mad. I would be sectioned, lose my wife, children and job as well as sanity.
During this, every day at work I would trawl forums looking for a glimmer of hope, how long until i feel better? Are these thoughts and feelings normal for depression and anxiety sufferers. Which tablets should i take. What are the side effects. Etc etc etc.
I never was really able to find anything that would give me comfort or a light at the end of the tunnel.
Now, after a long extremely hard journey, I'm sat here typing this. I feel myself, no daily crying, no being scared of my own thoughts. I take tablets daily (venaflaxine - which finally worked for me) but now I am 100% back to 'normal'.
I hope my (very annotated) story provides some ray of hope for somebody somewhere outthere.

I've had a poster on my garage wall with a picture of Christopher reeve as superman for years with a quote that says never give up, dont lose hope and dont sell out, which I think about a lot, I even get the dont sell out part now!

You can get through this, be strong, keep going, seek help, talk to family, friends and your employer and never ever, ever give up."

Its unlucky that I am having worrying side effects. My jaw feels tight, not enough to bother me but it definitely feels tired and achey all the time.
I still have to wait for gp to ring him and sort it out but this guy has been so counter productive towards helping me i feel the next time I speak with him I will tell the pompous idiot that he is a detriment. Actually I have told him before, what I mean is I am going to cuss the guy out.

Has anyone had side effects like this coming off meds?"
0,"I feel like I just can't continue like this anymore. To distract myself from the reality, I tend to surf through social media for hours, seeking comfort by paying attention to other peoples lives than mine. Even if the idea is temporary; It feels like such a relief (not worrying) that it's become more of a lifestyle, but whenever I keep my phone down, the thought of studying, leading and living a normal life becomes way too overwhelming that I quite often resort back to my old habits. I've been sleeping more than 8 hours during the day to escape the present and breakdown way too often. I have no direction and I'm completely lost and lonely. Lonely because I've pushed away the people I love, communicating and keeping in touch has never been harder for me. I once used to be a straight A student with high ambitions. Now in college, just attending the daily lectures has become a struggle, forget actually studying the matter. I've been battling depression since almost 6 years now, but I don't remember it ever getting as bad as this. I have a DNET brain tumor which will be operated on this may, to stop the seizures and medications I take. After the operation I'll have a partial vision loss for the rest of my life. I also have an eating disorder but I think I'll save those struggles for a later post. At the end of the day, I can't help but think, why me? It all feels so worthless, life feels so worthless, numb and painful."
0,:sorry: I don't know what to do. Really bad day today. I won't be able to return to the university of my dreams.

I was all set to return to uni in my second year before I got cancer.
0,"I think a lot of my past depression has been brought about by making some bad decisions such as decisions regarding career, relationships, or financial matters among others.  There might have been good reasons why I was not in a place to make good decisions, but now that I am in my senior years I think I know a lot more to enable me to make better decisions, but have difficulty making them.

When things start to go well for me, I get nervous and uncomfortable and sometimes I think I sabotage myself so that I fail. For example, when I misplace something in my house such as  a book, a cap, or my keys.   I might spend hours looking for the lost item, but often when I eventually find it, my immediate emotion is not joy or relief, but instead I feel disappointed.  That is a very trivial example but perhaps is a taste of what I feel when things go well. It is like success is scary and not something that is good.   I have the same emotions when I get a compliment from someone.

Has anybody had the same experiences or can help me understand this?"
0,I prefer being alone more and more.  It’s gotten to the point I don’t even want to leave my bedroom. Talking on the phone - seldom happens because I just hate it. My patience with people is very short - even if I love them.  This is not living. It is hiding. Trying to keep my emotions in check.  Being with people - even my kids and grandkids is taxing. Exhausts me. 😕

0,"TW: death and suicide mentions
I am 22yo female diagnosed with anxiety and BPD.

I wanted to call my psych today and ask her for some sleeping meds, as lately I haven't been sleeping. Instead I spent all day sitting here, staring at the wall. I've read some post on Facebook about woman with cancer slowly dying and the incredibly vulgar and disgusting thought occured to me: ""I wish I was her. So close to peace. So close to being content.""

Last few weeks ive been feeling like I am balancing my entire lifes worth. Thinking if it's been worth it - what could I have done better, or if I should have taken different path in life.  It feels way more final thought. As if I was looking back at my life, knowing that there's no changing/improving/doing something else and just observing before leaving this earth.

My bf says everyone feels like this because of covid restrictions. I don't want to make myself into special snowflake, but I don't really think this is normal state of mind.

I am not suicidal per say. But this...feels like I am slowly dying from inside, and rotting at that.

That brings me back to wanting to call my psychiatrist today. Well, what can she even do? Prescribe me more meds so I'd feel even more distant and tired? Lock me in which I can't afford at all due to my job? Psychologists aren't taking new patients and I doubt they'd have solution for this. There's no solution. This is the only way my life was, is and ever will be and no amount of ""happy vitamins"" can change that - trust me, I tried. So is there even point in contacting my psychiatrist? How should I approach this situation? As I said, I am not actively suicidal. But it feels like I am sinking into some weird hole I've dug for myself."
0,"Hi, I'm just wondering if anybody here has tried Esketamine or Buproprion? I believe that after extensive clinical trials NICE has decided against the licencing of Esketamine as a treatment for depression, although other sources have said that it did gain a licence about a year ago, so I'm not sure. 

About four years ago I asked my psychiatrist to consider me for Buproprion which I had heard was being used by some people for an off-label treatment for depression. It was rejected. However I now read that NICE has approved the use of Buproprion as an antidepressant where a patient has not responded positively to the more conventional antidepressants. 

I am 55 years old and I have tried just about every standard SSRI and SNRI, none of which have been successful. 

Any feedback would be very gratefully received. 
Thanks, 
Robert."
0,"I find the only way to really deal with my depression other than taking care of my mental and physical hygene is escapism. im lonely a lot so im an escapist. if im not doing my hobbies or going out for walks i trive on the net by being on websites i like such as youtube or on amazon. i also escape within the video game world, the philosophical book realm and book novels. i live in partial poverty so i cant travel that often.

0,"I have written earlier about my aggressive partner who would seem to have uncontrollable anger that would push her to the extend of grabbing knife for threatening, hiding my personal things, using foul language

The love for my kids and this pandemic compelled me to stay on with her but usually keep avoiding her through my 3 level home. The very moment she comes face 2 face with me.. she would find some or the other house chores to curse me or berate me. She hates me to the core but doesnt want to leave me. Many times I have requested her to let me start our separation.
She keeps harping that Kids life will get affected by this separation. Now.. I love my kids more than anything in this world but I cant let them live in this hostile environment where father just keeps avoiding mother and mother keeps yelling through the house. The reason I am writing here is to find if there is any treatment that I should suggest her before I initiate the separation. I have a big reason to believe she has mental issues and Here are the symptoms
1.. She has compatibility issues.. would fight with anyone she would share her house with. she never lived in a shared accomodation because of this reason. In fact she had torrid relationship with her parents before the our marriage.. She would often tell me about physical fights between her and her parents. She has conflicts with all bosses till date at work.. to the extent that she would punch them hard given a chance
2.. She yells and fights with our 8 yr old kids. She would even become physical by twisting hands or pinching them in anger
3. She would hide my or kids stuff out of anger with us. Will make us say sorry to let us get them again
4. She would yell even in the middle of the road or in crowded malls with absolutely no attention to amused soundings. 
She would even yell hard when I on my work call

I heard that medicines can cure such gust of anger. If thats true.. where to start with?"
0,"Several years ago I began seeking treatment for a rare disease called MALS (Median arcuate ligament syndrome) and was seen by a top provider as my symptoms included discomfort with eating and stomach pain. Within the clinic I had a Primary Physician that was quarterbacking my treatment. One of the steps involved going to a Psychologist which I was prescribed medication (Klonopin) to treat the symptoms of the MALS as they thought it was merely psychological (in my head). In December of 2017 I had an angiogram performed which solidified the MALS issue, however the surgeons declined to move forward as they had a different opinion that it was in my head as childhood trauma. This left me hopeless and instead of giving up, my family researched MALS through social media and was able to identify a list of top doctors/specialist that worked on MALS. I sought treatment with another clinic through a specialist (top 3rd doctor) and within months had surgery that alleviated the the symptoms. Keep in mind I was still (and currently) taking the prescribed medication (Klonopin). Given that the top provider refused to perform surgery which was done through a different provider, I changed primary doctors and moved to a different clinic.

I am seeking guidance today on how to remove myself from Klonopin as the side effects are not providing a good quality of life, and they were prescribed to treat the stomach issues which have now been resolved.
I do not know what to do next to remove this medication as it seems to have created/contributed to depression. As medical marijuana is becoming more widely accepted, I am looking for how to identify a doctor that can safely transition me from one to the other. The issue I am running into is when researching doctors, I cannot find one that seems safe from an eagle eye perspective. This means that the building/office looks shady or the reviews are not encouraging. I am not discounting that I now have depression, but the current prescribed medicine was prescribed to treat the symptoms of MALS as the prescribor did not have knowledge of MALS given it is rare and concluded it was psychological.

How do I find legitimate doctors that can help with this to transition off Klonopin and explore medical marijuana? I am not asking for names or medical advice, instead looking patient advocacy that can provide recommended online searches to identify a doctor as a conduit between the depression medication and medical marijuana."
0,"Hi, I’m new to this forum and come seeking advice please.
My partner suffers from depression and has done for around 15 years. He recognises that he is depressed and from the things he tells me (even though I’m not an expert) it does feel that is the case. I think he may also have underlying mental health issues that contribute to him feeling the way he does but he will not seek professional help. I have tried to talk to him about getting help without being pushy and some days he is receptive to the idea but it is very short lived and we are soon back to square 1. Has anyone had any experience with someone that won’t get help and how did you deal with it please? I know it is absolutely his choice so I’m not looking to make him do anything that he doesn’t want to, but is there anything I can do to help him from home? Thanks."
0,"tw // some discussion of childhood sexual assault

I'm not quite sure where to put this post because it is a thought I had but not really a debate or lighthearted enough to put in The Debating Chamber/Chill Out Lounge, so I'm just putting it here. Today I heard the Taylor Swift song ""Never Grow Up"" which is one of her older songs. I haven't heard it since I was probably 9 or 10 years old, so about 10 years ago. It's a song about how life is so much simpler when you're a child, but as a child you just want to grow up because you don't know how hard it is to be an adult. Not everyone has a happy childhood and many have their innocence stolen away from them very young but it's almost as if it might not even have its full effect on you until you grow up. For example the assault I experienced when I was a child was completely blocked out of my mind until I remembered it happened when I was in high school. The trauma was still there because I was deathly afraid of sex (still kind of am) while all the teenagers around me were going off and doing everything. I didn't know what was wrong with me until I remembered it happened and while it was nice to have an explanation then I had the memory of it in my head. I miss the years in between it happening and learning about sex because at least then I had no pressure to just be okay with sex. Things are better now because my current partner actually is asexual and doesn't want to have sex so I don't have to force myself to be okay with it for them. But it still hurts me that I've never had a positive sexual experience, even ones that I technically consented to were uncomfortable. Anyway, this song also reminded me of how when I was little I wanted to grow up so quickly because I was held back by my parents and couldn't do whatever I wanted. But then when I actually started to grow up and became a teenager I immediately wanted to go back to being a child. I was so innocent and even though I couldn't do anything I wanted everything was so simple. Every year I grow older I want to head back to when I knew less. My birthday is in less than 3 weeks and I will be 20 years old, so no longer a teenager. I'm still very young so I know years from now I will look back on these times and want to be this age again, even though I am currently suffering and always have. It makes me tear up just thinking about it. The only time in my life I wasn't suffering was age 11 and younger. The fact that I also never thought I would make it this far is something I should probably be proud of, but it just makes me confused because I don't have a plan. I think it's so odd how so many of us want to be older when we are kids but once our eyes are opened to how the world really is we spend every day trying to go back to how it was when life was simple. But we will never be able to go back. Perhaps that's a little too cynical but I think many would agree with me. You just can't return to the bliss of childhood ignorance. Hearing that song for the first time in 10 years made me realize that I didn't understand its full meaning as a child and now I do. A weird experience."

0,"My friend finished helping me with a project and I was so elated. The end result is so good. For once I finally felt like I could accomplish things, I can get my life back together, I want to keep working on so much more. I noticed I got really chatty with him all of a sudden. I thought it must be one of my high moods again, which made me upset because that means the happiness isn't real. It became really hard to focus on anything and I ended up at Youtube instead of doing whatever it is I meant to do. I don't even remember what I was so excited to start doing.

So then I watch a video review of a movie I haven't seen and another random video, and both the movie and the random video's comments have casual sexism in them and...I'm just so tired of living. If everyone hates women so much then why do I even exist. Then I started seeing bad movies in my head again and I'll probably get banned if I tell you how they end, so to be brief I die in the end every time. It just gets more and more tempting every time they come to me. 

I am tired of everything. I'm tired of the highs and lows. I'm tired of the bad movies that come to my head. I'm tired of feeling like the only solution is to stop existing since people hate women so much anyway. Who even enjoys being a woman in the first place? Not a single piece about womanhood is fun or enjoyable and women who speak up about it are villified or told to stop being silly. I told everyone I was a trans man and they told me to stop being silly about that too. I'm tired of sex and gender being hot political topics that people who aren't affected by them engage in for fun or to make sure everyone knows their important opinions. I'm tired of having nowhere to turn to for help. I thought ranting here might help. I'm tired of not knowing what's wrong with me and waiting for professionals to tell me. I'm tired of continuing to see people and coming up empty because they tell me nothing is wrong with me. I have vertigo again and I'm tired of always feeling nauseous and dizzy on top of everything else, and not knowing why I have that either.

I was so overly happy and felt like I could take on the world, and I hoped it was real, and 30 minutes later I'm deciding I should definitely be dead. I'm so tired of this. I wish we had mental health teams in the US. I wish I had professional resources like all of you have, like a mental health plan or something. All my therapist told me to do is go to the hospital. They don't do anything. I've been there twice with heart palpitations or chest pain and they put me in a room for two hours, tell me my vitals are great and nothing is wrong with me, and send me home cheerfully.

Ok, I think this helped. Not sure if I should thank you for reading or apologize if you read it."
0,"Hello, I'm writing in this thread because I believe I may have depression. I've suspected it for 5 years now but I'm not sure. Allow me to explain how I feel:

It usually starts randomly when I wake up, I get this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and usually by the end of the day become emotionally numb. My hygiene starts to decline (i.e. not showering for long periods of time, not brushing my teeth) because I start believing that there is no point in taking care of myself if everyone (including me) is going to eventually die. For about a week or a week and a half, I feel like I have a heavyweight on my shoulders, then it turns into stiffness in my entire body. Two to three weeks in, I begin to drop all the activities I  was doing, nothing is entertaining anymore, nothing makes me happy anymore. The emotions then start to kick in, the insecurities, the helplessness, everything kicks in at once and I usually have a big mental breakdown. Then for the weeks after that, I don't feel anything, I just stop caring about everything and everyone. 

I'm now a month into my depressive episode, apparently, insomnia is becoming a part of my life, I haven't showered in two weeks, my hair is matted, my skin is breaking out and flaking, my room is messy, everything feels so out of control. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, does anyone go through this? If so, how do you get out of it? what are the first steps? do you have a support system or are you alone?"

Who knows..."
0,"It's been about a week or so, since my last episode hit me hard, and I have been thinking about it and trying to analyze the triggers that got me into it. 
I belive, it had a lot to do with feeling unappreciated in general. 
To give a bit more background, I have no friends, and live with a sister and a brother. I work and sleep basically, and lately after a few years of isolation I met someone I risk to meet cause she seem pretty good person, she's still haven't proven otherwise.  
So, in those 3 aspects, I had pretty bad experiences at the same time. 
.Work, have been bad for a while, i do more job that I have too cause either is done wrong or not done at all and I can't stand it, gives me more anxiety to see it unfinished or causing problems to car owners. And we had a bit of a meeting and I ended up being completely opposite of appreciated. 
.At home with my family, my sisters car got hit by a neighbor and he didn't pay us the bill in full, and I spend my money helping them out fixing the car and again instead of being appreciated, I got only complains on a repair that was actually pretty good and that I shouldn't have to had payed anything for. 
.With the girl that I met and have been the most attending as possible I have been rejected or cancelled, and mostly she's way to busy to spend time with me, either a message, or and hour in person. (I do know for a fact she's busy, she's not lying about it, but she's still pushing me out and denying doing so) 

So. I belive that was the 3 main triggers that got me into a close to suicide episode. 
Many other reasons affect me on a daily basis, but I control myself a bit better at them, and work the out."

This of ""loose your mind"" feels like a ""break"" for me, something on my mind ""cracks"". Theres a point when you feel so lonely, the brain cracks, is too hard to handle, you ""loose it"". Really destroys me. 

The need to talk. Its quite an unique sensation. To speak out. To make sentences. To form an idea, using your voice. Imagine to feel desperate to use your voice, dream and feel like ""talk with someone is just a fantasy"", too good to be true. 

Just imagining how talk with someone would be feels so good.

14. This week we bought a dog to start his medical training. It's the exact dog I want. I got my vaccine. They said start looking for another place for her to live. It wasn't expected to happen this early.
15. I can't say no because if I do I will be still stuck here. I know we are going to be looking at places like group homes with people and staff around but I don't want that. People trigger me. I have no friends and my counselor only works two days. My family will never get me so I can't talk to them either.
16. My mom wants to turn my childhood house into a group home for me. My response to that? Ew. 
17. I am going to escape from wherever I am when it's available no matter what.
18. I am tired of letting other people choose what they think is best for me. If I can't make a choice for my own life I would rather honestly die.
19. And that's why since Thursday I have been extremely depressed, no appetite, not even my favorite things helping me at all. I am currently awake in the morning typing this for like the millionth time because my phone keeps pressing done when I'm not done. I don't know what to do. My apartment building is my dream home. I don't want to live at all if I can't live there."

I feel like shunning the lot of them and I feel like I want to go mental. I fed up with my life I suppose it's something I will have to get use to now.

0,"Hi There!

    My daughter (22) has been struggling with depression and anxiety all of her life. Lately she has been complaining of some symptoms that have me and my wife baffled. We do not know of it is an effect of the two medications she takes (
Zoloft, Bupropion) or if it is a more serious neurological problem. I would like to know if anyone has ever had to deal with this symptoms, what have their experience been and if what type of specialist should we been approaching to help her.
I asked her to write her symptoms and this is what she wrote:

Sometimes I forget who and where I am
A lot of the time I feel like I'm asleep
I feel constantly tired and like I need more sleep
I can be in the middle of a sentence and my mind just goes blank
When I look in the mirror or see my reflection, I don't recognize the face looking back at me
Sometimes I feel dysphoric, like I don't belong in my body
I feel paralyzed, I feel depressed

Any help would be very appreciated.

0,"So, I've lost a lot in the last 5 years. I was in a stressful job, although not many people would see it as stressful - much misunderstanding about that work. Adding onto that was the restructuring at my institution, the worst in its history, according to my senior colleagues. 

Since then I found a way to go through the disruption, confusion, loss, knowing that I was put in a much worse situation than when I started. I didn't quit before the job was done, though, because I told myself I wasn't a quitter. 

I struggle to do my job with much less support than promised, while trying my best to contribute, to put myself out there, to push for positive changes. But most of my effort resulted in nothing, because the institution was still recovering, the timing wasn't right, or was it just me? I don't know. 
But I could see how the toll on mental health has had on some colleagues, and I can't deny it has affected me too. I tried to suppress those feelings to keep myself going. 

The worst consequence of this process is I have lost all faith in pursuing this line of work. After I finished what I was hired to do, I quit, feeling like I couldn't keep much of it. The struggle seems to have no value. I feel worthless. 

So I feel like my life needs a complete redo, and after a few months of stumbling about, I realise I want to write for a career. The only thing that I totally enjoyed in the last job was the writing, and it was intensive advanced writing. But to become a working writer takes some time, right? So I'm working on that. 

Meanwhile I've moved back home, feeling like an alien in my hometown. I don't earn enough, depending on family. I feel so much guilt, shame, and despair that the thoughts of suicide have come up quite often. I know this is the first warning. Hence I joined this forum. 

The thought of having to do any kind of work other than writing fills me with dread and despair. I have a deep fear of seeing my hard work resulting in nothing, because that happened with the previous job. I'm so scared that I can't bring myself to try for any new job other than writing, even when family and friends are pushing me to do that. 

And with writing, I can only write fiction right now. I've tried working on other types of writings that may earn me more money short term, but I just can't. Any time I tried to push myself to do that, the thoughts of ending it all comes up again and again. The feelings of despair, guilt, shame, hopelessness, indignance, and grief can be so paralyzing, I end up not doing any work. 

So yesterday a thought dawned on me: I don't just write to build a career, I write to save myself from sinking. Writing seems to be a kind of therapy for me, not just a way to earn a living. 

In short, I just want to write my stories, even though I'm not earning (yet), otherwise, I feel like ending it all is easier than going on.
I don't know sharing it here will help anyone, but I feel the need to write about it. I hope it may resonate with someone in the same situation. I may be looking for validation, too, the understanding that what I've been through is difficult so please don't judge. Maybe I also need that forgiveness from myself."

0,"Why are some so in tune to mental health, yet others ignore it? I’ve tried to seek out help from my doctors past and pre. I’ve had pretty much all of them just brush it away like it’s schumtz on my face or something. The most ignorant encounter, was probably when a doctor told me I wasn’t depressed whatsoever. 
I‘m not a fan of the medical field for so many reasons. The biggest being-I was born with a skin condition that’s mainly genetic but, some cases just happen for craps and giggles as I like to say. It made me uglier than sin and unfortunately, made people have this judgement that I’m weird.

The condition has made me depressed. I don’t have a social life, I talk to people at work, but, no one goes out of their way to be my friend. I’m bullied at work as well. I live alone with my cats, just moved and lost my stepfather to whom I was quite close.  This pandemic has made everything 10x worse. I’m not one to freak out over wearing a mask-but, it’s fine if others wear them. Life is too short to not want to move on and have things open up again. Why when I have reservations made am I not jumping for joy and excitement for a vacation in June? I’m happy, but, not like I should be. Losing my stepfather was extremely hard-he served in Vietnam boots on the ground. We went on the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight in 2018. He and my mom were on  married a year, but together for sev years before that. My dad is in my life, but it’s so complicated. I want to be happy, I try to be happy, but I’m just not. I cry probably more than what’s considered healthy and sometimes over stuff that I deem totally and utterly stupid.

How do I get my doctor to prescribe something to help with my mood?"

People never talk about how the person who ends their life never has to suffer a second more. It’s just over with. They only talk about what they lose. But losing life is always a good thing, when your life is full of bad. I have my major issues still, with no help. I’ve tried to get therapy when I was younger so don’t bother me with that, and tell me that therapy is the answer. Great well I can’t get it. I ask for a simple thing with ppl. Just listen to my issues and hear me out, then give solutions. But people still cannot do that. They are so fucking stupid that they can’t do that. And guess what no matter what’s good in life I still have to live with these stupid problems. In a place I hate living in, with people I hate. My life has never been my choice but suicide would be a choice and something that stops the pain. But yet people say not to do it for no reason. People are stupid. I want to just kill myself I need to desensitize myself to people saying not to do it, then I would be happier."

1,"Hi guys,
I have been diagnosted with a trauma from bullying (not PTSD, but it's similar, a ""soft"" version of it so I'll post it here).
For like half a year I have been having the following issues:
When I am trying to sleep, I wake up every hour and I keep having the same nightmares every time. I always dream about how I am in school again and how I meet my bullies, which are quite a lot. Sometimes I am remembered of bullies I don't even think about, which causes new unpleasent memories. I am at a point where I don't even want to sleep anymore, I keep seeing these people every time I fall asleep.  

Is there a way to stop these damn nightmares? It's driving me really crazy. All I want is having a peaceful life and relaxing sleep. Also, why do I keep waking up every hour?

Thank you for your answers."
1,"Sooo, in November 2019, around Thanksgiving, i had a suicide attempt.  I ended up with severe injuries, and spent a few months in hospital (2 months) and then a month and a half in a psychiatric hospital.  But the strange thing is, i have almost ZERO memory of being in the ICU, BUT, i remember everything else; i remember being in the ER.  The last thing i remember is ICU nurse giving me a call-button for my IV pain medication, which was a very short memory (i think it might have been morphine).  Then i have one very clear memory of waking up from surgery and eating a sandwich and throwing up a lot. My only other memory is EXTREMLY foggy and vague and really short, which was talking to a psychiatrist.   Then i just remember waking up in the pediatrics ward after my other surgery. I was in there for approximately one week. so why can i barely remember anything??? I don't think it was due to trauma, because i remember everything before they gave me the pain meds, so my theory is that they either sedated me, or the pain medication was naturally sedating. I just want to remember SOMETHING more.  Thanks"

1,"I was diagnosed with PTSD back in December.

I thought it was just really bad anxiety at first. I couldn’t put my finger on one of the symptoms, though.

I explained the symptom to a co worker. I said ""when I’m around lots of people, or when I have been put in a situation, when I feel threatened. I feel as though, I’m not in the room, like it’s all a dream. Non of it is real""?

my co worker then said that it could be dissociation.

I told my therapist and they told me that dissociation is a whole other mental health condition.

it means split personality.

however, my therapist said a symptom of PTSD is dissociation.

1,"Hi all,

what I'm about to describe might seem silly (to me, it definitely is) and perhaps unmatched to what ""real"" PTSD is. My ""trauma"" is nothing close to sexual abuse, violence or something that serious, but it gives me some problems in daily life. So here we go.

In few weeks, I'm about to have an exam of skills and knowledge obtained on a certain course (no neccessary to go into details here). Yesterday, I had dreams that I failed it and I'm afraid I'm about to have those dreams regularly in following weeks. Anxiety attacks are becoming frequent as the date of exam is closing in.

This started to happen during my college time, when I first experienced such dreams. Always some time during exam period in January, June and September. It became regular, especially during senior years. I graduated and left college in 2013, but I experienced those kind of dreams and anxiety moments until 2016 (always, each year during January, June and September), when it kinda faded away. I can say that I stressed pretty much regarding finishing college, since no viable option was left if I failed.

Nowadays, every time I'm about to take some kind of exam (whether be language after completed course, driving exam, literally ANY kind of test/exam where my knowledge is rated by someone, instructor or professor), I start experiencing anxiety attacks and bad dreams at least several days before. No matter of importance, it can be just some petty course, even if I'd fail, it wouldn't have any negative impact on my life (contrary to exams in college).

Is it possible that this ""trauma"" has been caused by stressing too much about successfully completing exams years ago? It's becoming quite annoying to deal with. Is there any method to get it under control?

Thanks for your answers!"
1,"I’d like to talk about what’s happening to me and hopefully it’s at least a bit understandable. It’s going to be a long post, because I want to be clear what’s going on with me.

I suffer from severe anxiety and other weird problems. I haven’t had a clear diagnose. I’ve been to therapy multiple times and I have heard a few things coming by like avoidant personality disorder, agoraphobia, ocd, autism and more. The only thing I’m aware of is my official diagnose on ADHD and social anxiety disorder. The last one is obvious for me. I feel severely anxious around people, but it does not seem like a typical social anxiety issue though. I’ll come back to ADHD later on. 

So, if trauma can be the reason of why I feel this way is correct is kinda vague for me. My coach (not a official therapist) is pretty positive in the case. He showed me the symptoms of (c) ptsd and I must say, I relate to a lot of them. 

First of all, I must tell you where I deal with and I need to tell a bit about my past as well. I’ll try to keep it short, but that’s going to be a bit hard though, because there is a lot to tell. 

First of all when I was 5 years old my parents divorced and my mom met a new husband. My mom got pregnant pretty fast and soon we became trapped basically. At least once a week there was a situation getting out of control which ended up of me or my family getting hurt. Physical abuse, but also mentally. This went on for 8 years with a few situation that are still in my mind, but it’s mostly the constant feeling of not feeling safe. This all seems blurry to me though and I ask myself if I actually didn’t felt safe. I’m not sure, it’s a long time ago. Things came to climax after 8 years where the husband of my mom beat my mom up and we literally escaped to another place. 

I was very insecure at that time. Mostly socially. However, I am pretty good at hiding it. I finished high school which is quite a achievement if I look back again. Not much later I started experiencing with marijuana, which made me feel a bit paranoid or however you want to call it. However, I was smoking weekly with my friends, because I didn’t want to be different then them. In my first year of my new study I fainted in my classroom which was terrifying. Especially if you take the social anxiety in consideration as well. My first major panic attack happened because of marijuana. I basically experienced many of the same things I had with the fainting. One day in summer I decided to try magic mushrooms. Very impulsive. My friends experienced with drugs and I didn’t want to fall behind. The fear of losing control was very prominent while taking it. I just felt a incredible feeling of unease. I also took it in a forrest which wasn’t comfortable at all. I regret it still.. After that I finally decided to stop doing these drugs. Not much later however I experienced full blown panic attacks while feeling sober. However, it’s often not noticeable, because I feel like I have to hide it. So usually I pinch myself heavily when I feel there is a need to hide it. I started to feel super anxious in public and especially in places I couldn’t move out easily. 

I went out to search for help and after a few months I found some. I went to therapy over there for longer then a year. Long story short, it didn’t made me improve. It actually just went worse. They didn’t had a clear plan to really help me. I just did a few things here and there once a week. When that was over I fel in the deep and I spend longer then a year without help. I was waiting for therapy, but the waiting lists are very long. I started to develop more and more fears. Many aren’t easily to explain. I think the best way to describe it is that my mind constantly notice things that I can place in the category fearful and danger focused on going insane and losing control. In general I felt like I experienced the world through different glasses then others. The world just felt (still feels).. Unsettling. It’s just very hard to explain unfortunately. It’s just a constant feeling. Everything I feel and see.. Just feels fearful. Like I’m not supposed to be here. I also experience(d) intrusions which made me totally freeze up. Intrusions about hurting others. At least, I hope they are intrusions. Certain colors, drinks, foods, and numbers became fearful to me. Everything I can place under the term dark makes me totally anxious. In the meantime I went to look for help 1 time at a different place and it was a horrible experience, although it was just 1 meeting. I felt like I was in some kind of horror movie. Everything just felt very fearful. The people as well. 

I didn’t even tell about this yet, but I spend almost all of time at home. The first thing I wasn’t able to do was going to my study, later the bus, friends, family, grocery stores till a point where just simple walks where not possible anymore. A important notation is that I still live with at my moms house, so that’s why that’s possible. The contact with her is relatively good, although my fears are blocking the full potential. 

1 year later out of nowhere they called me for a appointment. In the meantime I developed all kinds of things, so the original question for help wasn’t really valid anymore. The time was limited to just 3 months and was completely focussed on exposure. Long story short (again). It didn’t help me. They send me to my current coach and I’m waiting for a new psychologist. I recently started in a social group via my coach where we go outside and just do some work like cleaning gardens and such. A huge step. Today I went for the first time and it was super tough. Most of the things I describe here where things I experienced today in high intensity. I felt just super intensely weird and overwhelmed. And again, it’s just hard to explain. 

I’m depressed. That’s not even a doubt. I think that also makes a lot of sense. I’m 21 years old now with no hope for the future. It just feels like I’m doomed in a fearful world. Sometimes I think about ending it all, but I know I’m way too frozen for that and I know it’s wrong at the end of the day. I’m afraid there is nothing I can do. I’ve tried a ton, but it never made me improve. Emotionally I feel completely stuck. I can’t cry. I hate how I lack of empathy. Although all of this avoiding is not only for myself, because I don’t want to hurt someone. I fear that I have something as schizophrenia or something like that as well, although everyone says I don’t have that. My fears just feels very weird. The way I think feels very out of order. 

Honestly, I can say I wish I was normal, but I don’t know what normal is anymore after feeling like this for almost forever. Social contact is something I struggle with. I wish that wasn’t the case. It’s just that my brain is just constantly speaking nonsense. I don’t know.. 

If anyone made it this far. Thanks for your time. If someone thinks he or she can might help. Please don’t hesitate to send a reply."
1,"Hello All,

I question if this is PTSD. 

I have been through a lot.

history:

Alcoholic parents- never hit me but demeaned a lot.

Ex-Husband abuse- He came back from war different and would attack me. But not the fist to the face. He'd push the air out my chest by pushing me down and with all his weight. He'd also put his full weight on my shoulder I injured in high-school. He'd also lock the door in the car speed and poke me in the face till I'd cry. He threw me in the Tub when I was throwing up from morning sickness. He verbally abused me and financially crippled me. It's been 10 years and I finally finished paying the debt I was left with. I was too afraid to fight so I paid.

My daughter's passing - She lived to be 4 years old. Don't like talking about it but she was sick then fine then sick then fine then sick and she went over her dad's house and never came home. She passed in her sleep.

Sexual abuse - I went on a date and I concented to sex, what I did not concent to was the manner. I was bruised from head to toe bleeding and bite marks. I never said no or stop because it was terrifying. I was also used to being obident with from the ex-husband but he never sexual abused me.

Since then I tend to find the same kinda abusive asshole. So I've stop dating, 3 years now.

I did get into drugs and alcohol for a bit of time, quit that too. I drink responsible and never past a certain point. (once a week, if that)

I have issues sticking with decisions and change my mind often career, hair color, fashion, car, and diet. Horrible memory issues that hit me at random. I feel lost a lot of the time and not worthy positive things. I am also confident in my work ethic and capable I can do any job. I lack confidence is social situations and relationships. It's been 9 years and I have finally decided to make friends, all female. Males scare me if they give me a compliment or want to hang out. The second I step out of my comfort zone, I almost have a mental break down. I keep moving back home too. The voice in my head is my ex-husband and my other ex. I sleep what I would consider normal, like before all this but I do still get out of control nightmares and I have issue knowing where I am when I wake up. I also can deal with paranoia the my ex husband is going to find me and hurt me. I always use my parents address even when I don't live there, I've changed my phone number an insane amount of times. 

Is this PTSD or something else? I've sought help for dealing with my daughter passing but I never connected well with the therapist. So 3 sessions only. 

Any suggestions would be much appreciated, I am sick of fear and doubt."
1,"Hey all,

First time on this specific forum so I'll try and be as thorough as I can. 

Basically I've had two different diagnoses, from two different medical professionals, one being PTSD and the other being a hybrid of various phobias and my pre-existing panic disorder. 

Let's start with symptoms. Most prevalent are insomnia and night terrors. Lot of sleeping problems based around my body being ""frightened"" awake, like how a loud bang or something would scare me walking out and about. Heightened aggression is also on the list, I'm way more on edge and aggressive than I've ever been in my life before. Things like loud noises, being trapped in enclosed spaces or among big groups of people, all send me into a frenzy of panic attacks, followed by my cognitive functions stopping entirely; I literally cannot think so I either freeze and stand there for 10 mins or I start destroying everything around me. 

Context: Almost died a couple times (all events occurring while I was alone), usually in situations that arose and passed in a matter of minutes. Also seen death plenty. Family members, pets, all dying in real time right in front of me. Then again, I'm under the impression that most people go through this. The only outlier was an incident in which I fell under lake ice as a child, and had to be rescued and resuscitated. 

My point: I've never been in lethal combat or gone through any other severely traumatic experiences outside of what's common. Yet I'm constantly ready to 'fight or flight' with the lightest of triggers. Loud noises and icy water. Two seemingly normal occurrences, make me fear for my life on a regular basis. I can understand the second one, but I cannot make heads or tails of my sleeping issues, and my aversion to excessive noise. 

Is this PTSD? Or simply a mix of phobias compounded by an existent panic disorder? I don't know much about PTSD so it could very well be a type of panic disorder on its own, which is why I'm asking for advice here, on this forum."
1,"TRIGGER WARNING:

Mention of rape and description of forced sexual activity in this thread.


Hello I’m new here.
I’m here to ask this because I genuinely don’t know. Apologies that this will be long.

So I’m 23 and a few years ago when I was a teenager, I was in an INCREDIBLY abusive relationship. It only lasted a few months and I did break up with him, but in those few short months, the things he did to me have left me with a lot of trauma. A lot of emotional, physical, mental, verbal and sexual abuse. Just all of it. 😞
For a little more context and so you can hopefully understand my story a little more, I’m a transgender man (female to male), and I am gay; I currently have a wonderful, supportive husband.
(Note: I’m not interested in people’s personal issues or opinions or whatever about either of these facts, so please don’t bother going there in the replies. These facts however, are relevant to a part of the story.)

Anyway:
I was in this abusive relationship, and he did rape me.
This was proven to the police, and in a court of law. Obviously at first he denied it but then later confessed, and after a horrible and long ordeal, he was finally put in prison. However, there was an incident mere DAYS before the one which got him imprisoned...
I don’t know whether it was rape or not.

He had two best friends; one of whom was also his cousin. They weren’t particularly nice people either.
On this particular occasion, my then-boyfriend had these two friends over at the same time as me. We were all playing video games together.
But the three of them kept making sexual comments, whispering to each other and laughing.
Something about it all made me very uncomfortable, and I kept wishing they would leave.
At one point, I went to the bathroom, and when I came back, they were all standing up and the TV and console has been switched off.
My then-boyfriend was laying a towel down on his bed.
I figured his friends were now leaving.
My then-boyfriend held his arms out to me and pulled me against him to kiss me. Again, I was pretty uncomfortable doing this in front of his friends, so I gently pushed him away.
But he pulled me back and kept kissing me and his hands were wandering.
Again, got uncomfortable in front of his friends, and asked him if they were leaving now, and he laughed and said no, we were going to “put on a little show”?
I turned around and at this point, his friends were now sitting down...touching themselves!?
Obviously I got even MORE uncomfortable and told my then-boyfriend I wanted to be alone, just me and him. But he said no, it’s rude to ask his friends to go home, and besides I “needed to prove my trust in him”!? I said “are you kidding? You’re still trying to earn back my trust?” (He had cheated on me - a one off as far as I know, and had somehow manipulated me into giving him a second chance even though I had dumped him after finding out. He was VERY good at messing with my head.)
He said “this will prove it. This is something I would only ever do with someone special.” And I had no idea what he was talking about.
The next thing I remember, was his friends starting to grope me all over. I had recently had my top surgery (double mastectomy), and one of them said to my then-boyfriend “I thought you said he was trans? Where are his t**s?” And my then-boyfriend said “oh he had that surgery already.” Then that same friend went “ugh where’s the fun in that?! Oh well. We’ll have to make do with what’s there.” At that point my then-boyfriend told them I hadn’t had my ‘other surgery’ yet.
I freaked out at this point and said to his friends “I’m not here for anyone’s ‘fun’. I’m *insert name here*’s boyfriend; not yours!”
They laughed.
My then-boyfriend then took over and pushed me back on the bed... 
The next thing I know, all three of them are on me from all angles! I couldn’t get up and I said I don’t want to, but they didn’t listen to me.
My then-boyfriend told them it’s fine and to go ahead. He doesn’t mind!
I said “well I mind!” But again nobody listened to me.
Then they took it in turns to have sex with me. I tried to get up but they would keep just pushing me back down again.
They were all pretty muscular and masculine guys and I had trouble pushing them off me. But I didn’t shout or scream or fight. I did try to get away but they would just drag me back in place and carry on like I was a rag doll...
Eventually I just stopped. I couldn’t do anything. I completely froze and was dazed, I remember feeling completely “out of it” even though I hadn’t been given anything to my knowledge?
I just... there are parts where I remember exactly what they were doing, and there are parts where I just draw a blank and don’t fully remember...
When they were all done with me, I just lay there and couldn’t move.
My then-boyfriend slapped me on the behind and said “good boy. You did really well. I’m proud of you”.
And I couldn’t even say anything.
Then his friends all got cleaned up and dressed again and left. My then-boyfriend told them “same time again next Saturday fellas. I’ll text you.”
The whole time it was happening, none of them spoke to me. They did everything with my then-boyfriend’s “permission” but not mine. They just passed me around between them. And I was so “out of it” in my head and my body just felt limp and like I had no control over it. 

Anyway I’m sorry to go into such detail. I hope I didn’t trigger anyone. I’m so sorry if I did!
My question is, was this rape?
Because I did freeze and my mind went blank. I didn’t do enough to stop it but I definitely didn’t consent, and I didn’t want it.
I didn’t climax or anything like that. I know that much. I definitely didn’t enjoy it!
I know I was so stupid. I would never willingly sleep with more than just my romantic partner - I’m not that sort of person! 
I feel like it’s all my fault though because I didn’t do enough.
I finally confessed all to my husband and a close female friend; both broke down in tears and said they were so sorry and that it was gang rape... 
Was it?
I’m not entirely sure.
I did not consent to any of it, that much is true. But I froze and didn’t fight hard enough.
I quite literally didn’t feel like I could even move! I felt too light to move, if that makes sense?

Please can anyone shed some light on what you think this was? I really don’t know if it was rape or not? Since I froze like that and didn’t push them off me hard enough or protest loud enough. I didn’t want it I swear! They asked him instead of me, but...
I’m so confused. I’ve held on to this for years and I blame myself entirely.
I’ve never told anyone until now. They knew about him raping me on his own, though.

I feel like an idiot even asking, but I genuinely don’t know. The trauma from it has been eating me up and affecting me in various, very specific ways ever since.
I couldn’t hide it any longer.
It’s been causing me to act impulsively out of fear (fleeing the house and pushing my husband away - without meaning or wanting to! - at the slightest argument), avoiding certain things like gaming because of what was going on just before this took place, and just having awful thoughts and nightmares. It’s been getting worse and worse. I know I’m traumatized, whatever it was. I’ve been feeling so low and worthless and hopeless, just feeling dirty and disgusted in myself and like a sl*t... 😞
I hate myself so so much. I can’t bear it.
I know me fleeing the house at the slightest argument, and pushing my husband away is hurting him, and I hate myself even more for it. I don’t mean to hurt him of course! He is my whole world. He’s been. so understanding and caring and supportive though, which just makes me feel even worse. This is why I eventually had to come clean to him about it. He’s been fantastic and I hate myself so much for hurting him because he’s just been so supportive and so kind and caring about this whole thing. I don’t deserve him 😢 

Please help me shed some light on the truth? Was it truly rape? I don’t even know anymore. I get so many mixed messages and mixed feelings about it.

Thank you so much for reading this far.
Sorry if I haven’t made much sense."
1,"I am of course new here and I thought maybe talking or rather typing and reading things that others are going through similar to me would help... I have PTSD and BPD due to a horrific childhood abuse in every form of the word. I am 41 now and have made some really bad mistakes due to me trying to ""punish"" myself as my dr said because it is what I know. So a little back story is I am married with children and have a wonderful spouse. However after we had a child something really changed me and I decided to cheat and cheat more than once and when I did I became someone I am not in real life. My spouse has kept me around and even helped me through a few hospitalizations. I am past that part where I feel the need to cheat and become anything other than me but I am really bothered by how I block EVERYTHING out. I don't remember most of my childhood nor a lot of the years while I was cheating. It's like I can remember somethings like they were yesterday but I literally feel like a black hole when it comes to a lot. I feel lost sometimes when my spouse brings up the past because I can easily forget about it BECAUSE I really don't remember it. They however do and sometimes it builds up and it unleashes (which I do not stop because everyone needs to be able to get things out) I get super emotional of course because of the way I made them feel and what I have done to them but I also get so mad at myself when I get asked questions or get asked if I even remember because they do not think I block things out they think I just don't want to talk about it. Honestly in reality I wouldn't enjoy talking about it but I would prefer to be able to. I get HORRIBLE flash backs from my childhood but when I try to remember things its like I am trying to remember what happened to someone else. I feel alone in this and just need some kind of hope that I am not the only one dealing with something like this... Does anyone else have any problems like this and if so how have you been able to live with it? Any insight might be nice"
1,"Long story incoming with lots of background detail on existing relationship for context: 

I have a very loving relationship with a man who I’ve been with for five years now. He has supported me and stayed with me despite a large amount of that time being long-distance, with me relocating three times for work or education related reasons, and at times rarely being able to see one another, and although there has been strain because of these issues, our bond has always been incredibly strong and loving. There have been times in our relationship where perhaps I did the wrong thing - for example I decided after we should break up at one point when I was studying overseas, as I was finding the distance too difficult and missing him too much. This only made the situation worse, and I realised this wasn’t what I wanted, and we were able to reconcile things. Another two years later, at a particular point while we were living together, my partner was incredibly busy working two jobs, and I was busy with my own job in a bar, and as he was very tired and we were rarely having sex or connecting emotionally, I began to feel neglected, and started to develop feelings for a person I worked with. I communicated this to him, and we had a week or two apart while I figured out what was going on, and ultimately I came to understand that I was just needing more support from my partner, and was afraid that I was losing him emotionally, and that I didn’t want anyone else, so we were able to rectify things, although understandably it took a while to rebuild trust in this situation. 

This year I had been planning to move overseas for a one year job contract, but due to the pandemic my departure date of last September was continually pushed back, and me and my partner passed a year living together really happily. I was amazed at how while other couples seemed to be struggling with strains of the pandemic on our relationship, we had only grown closer. The only real issue we experienced in our relationship at this time was that I struggled with his extremely overblown reactions to what he perceived as criticism. If I would ask him a seemingly benign question sometimes like what he had planned for the day, he would suddenly switch into this angry irrational state where he shouts at me to **** off, before coming out of it and realising that I wasn’t intending to attack him and being very apologetic for his behaviour. This has led to many arguments with me not understanding why he would speak to me that way, but one thing that kept coming up was that in the moment when he felt attacked he would say he was incapable of rations thought and just reacted. The more I read up on this, the more it became apparent to me that he was suffering with PTSD. He has told me about various traumatic events that happened to him when he was younger that left him returning to his mother’s home and barely living for quite some time, only really leaving the house to go to the pub. He also  suffers from various unexplainable ailments such as fibromyalgia, random sharp pains and headaches, and issues with IBS, which it amazed me to read are common in trauma sufferers, and allowed me to make a lot more sense of what he was going through, and feel more sympathetic to it. He struggles also with being in places that are unfamiliar to him, and will be on extremely high alert at all times in these situations, struggle to take in conversations and react to small changes in the environment. I had previously thought this was just some form of anxiety, but the more I read on PTSD the more all these patterns of behaviour fit together. I also have been reading lots of books on PTSD to try and help me understand how to help him better, as he is incredibly reluctant to speak to a therapist. 
 
At one point in the past couple of months, he broke down and told me he couldn’t cope with me leaving overseas for the job, and that I’m his whole world. I tried to tell him that it doesnt have to be forever, and if we aren’t coping well with it either I can come back or he can come out there, and we will see how things go. It seems silly now, but I had planned at around the six month mark of being there to ask him if he wanted to marry me, but I never communicated this to him, so I can understand where his doubts would come from about me going, especially after the break up we had the last time I was over there.

During the pandemic, my partner also lost his grandmother who he was not able to see leading up to her death at all, and although he rarely showed emotion around this, I understood it must have caused him a lot of pain. Earlier this year, he also found out that his grandfather’s cancer was terminal, and he had been discharged from hospital so can no longer see him. He is a very sensitive person who feels things incredibly deeply, and although he may not often verbalise his feelings, I understood that he was really struggling with this.

This was around the time I noticed a sudden and dramatic change in my partner. Some days he would be still be his usual self, but there were becoming more and more days where he would sit on social media all day doing nothing. He started to develop obsessions with the past, constantly scrolling through decade old pictures and changing his social media profile pictures to these, obsessing over finding pictures of his old cat that passed away a long time ago, and suddenly taking an interest in hobbies he hadn’t pursued in a decade or so, such as skateboarding. I became increasingly concerned because I could see him spiralling and didn’t understand whether this was grief or PTSD, and he was also spending significant amounts of time making emotional and personal posts on his Twitter account,which is very out of character for him - he tends to just post about films or post jokes. He seemed to be connecting with more women via social media, which was making me feel incredibly insecure, and we spoke about this a couple of times and how it was making me feel. He very rarely seemed capable of genuine smiles, and all his silliness that I love so dearly seemed to have disappeared overnight. I tried talking to him about this on several occasions, and he told me he was just feeling numb to everything at the moment.

Eventually, it got to a point where I felt I was being as supportive as I could, and he was still reaching out to other women on the internet a lot, and liking their selfies etc, and I told him I felt this was really disrespectful to me, especially as we had already spoken about how it makes me feel. He seemed understanding of why I would be upset by it and apologised, but the whole time it felt he was almost not even in the room with me. At the end of this conversation, I asked him, ‘There isn’t anyone I need to worry about is there?’, and he hesitated before saying that there might be, and that he had been speaking to a girl on the internet over the past couple of weeks that he thought he might have a crush on.

I was in shock and devastated at this, and I asked him did he still love me, he told me that yes, he loved me deeply, he had never been more attracted to me, and that he still thought we were insanely compatible and were soul mates, so he couldn’t understand it either. We talked emotionally for a while, and he kept reiterating that he loved me so much. I admitted to him that I had wanted us to get engaged in the near future, and he broke down and told me he had been thinking the exact same thing, and had had a lot of thoughts about how the wedding would be.
He told me he had spoken with his best friend about these thoughts he’d had about this other woman, who had told him that it’s quite normal to get crushes when you’ve been with someone a long time, and that what matters is how you choose to deal with it. 
we agreed to give each other space for him to clarify his feelings, and at the beginning of the week he would message me telling me things like how he had never had any doubts about me and always been totally crazy about me, but then towards the end of the week he suddenly became very robotic in his messages and cold, when he replied at all. I was unsure at the time whether I should carry on messaging him and supporting him through what he was dealing with, but then two days ago had a realisation that as long as he isn’t sure if he wants to be my partner, it’s not really my place to give him constant reassurance despite my feelings towards him, and it was doing me a lot of harm.
Having this space to myself has made me realise a lot of things about my own past traumas and fear of intimacy that causes me to become very uncomfortable when things are smooth, and explains why I have felt the need to move away so often in the past. I realised that moving overseas for this job isn’t really what I want, and that I would much rather make plans together with my partner, and find more satisfying work I can do here, as I was already having doubts about whether the job was really right for me. I’m working with a therapist to help with my own fears of intimacy and goal setting for the future, and have been doing lots of mindfulness and self-care activities to try and clarify my mindset. I am also seeing a rape counsellor to speak about something that happened to me when I was in my year abroad at university. I communicated all of these realisations I had had to my partner, as I was feeling that it was likely his feelings that I was abandoning him may have been a huge cause of his emotional withdrawal, and he told me he was really happy to hear this and wished he had known sooner, and that he just needed time to process what he is going through.
I don’t understand how a person can be madly in love in one instance, and withdrawn and numb the next, and I can’t help but feel he has intentionally or subconsciously put up some kind of guard to protect himself because of his fear of me going away. The strange changes in his behaviour tell me that something more is going on than this being just about our relationship.

Can anyone who may have been through a similar pattern of behaviour, or knows more about PTSD give me some advice on this situation? I’m deeply in love with this person, and would do anything to help him through this, but I appreciate and respect his need for space."
1,"Hello everyone, 
So my sister was sexually assaulted during a trip she went one year ago to visit her best friend who was participating in a student exchange program at that time. Her friend was basically very busy during my sister’s stay so one of those days my sister decided to hang out with a guy she had just met there. They just went for a morning coffee and then he suggested to  go to his dorm room. Unfortunately, his intentions weren’t pure and my sister was forced to experience something so horrible, so devastating in a trip she has been dreaming for months. When she told her friend what had happened she wasn’t very supportive , as if she couldn’t realize this was a sexual assault. She couldn’t understand how serious things were. She never understood and never helped my sister. So when my sister came back she was totally broken. As we live in different cities we were only talking on the phone every day at that time . She hadn’t told me  what happened until six months later, when she came to stay with me for a month. I was shocked. I could tell something was torturing her those six months as she was telling me that something bad happened on that trip but it never crossed my mind. Oh my god, it was horrific. I didn’t know how to react, I just cried and cried and hugged her. I was devastated. I still am. The thing is i didn’t know what was the best way to help her. So I decided not to ever bring it up again, I didn’t want her to remember and relive those moments.  I don’t know if I’m doing the right thing just pretending it never happened. I’m just scared. It’s very difficult, I think about it almost every day, what I should do or should have done because it’s been a year now. And I don’t want this to affect my relationship with my sister. I’m so afraid to ask her how she feels. I don’t know what to do. Can someone help me deal with this and advise me how to help my sister ?"
1,"I was in an emotionally and sexually abusive relationship several years ago (I'm female, partner was male).
Sometimes I see him in other people, and get a bit disturbed. I had a boss recently who had the same personality as my abusive ex, and I had to quit the job because he reminded me too much of him. This has happened with other people sometimes -- friends, potential partners, coworkers.
I even see it in myself sometimes -- I'll get super impatient with someone and have a slight outburst, but I recognize it. I consciously realize what I did, and that it is probably a result of having been in an abusive relationship.
Is this part of PTSD? Seeing traits of an abusive ex in other people?"
1,"******LONG READ ******


So lets begin with the good. I am 27 (M) she is 28 (F).


My ex and I were together for 6 years. I became very close with her family and siblings. Constantly going over to their houses for family events, dinners, and doing double dates with her siblings and their partners. Each week we made sure to go on a date forsure and spent many other days throughout our entire relationship. My ex and I were best friends, she doesnt have any friends. We took trips each year together, we got 2 animals together, we lived together for 4 years together. I would always do romantic gestures like leaving things on her car after work, or flowers randomly, or bath and spa nights. I put her on a pedastal and did my best to make her feel truly loved. 


We never fought and honestly barely had any arguments about things. Thats how well we fit together. Similarly we had many of the same interests and even tried each others interest. I was there for her through tough times when both of her grandparents tragically passed away. I was an usher to walk the caskets down, which can tell you how close I was to her family. Each year I went with her family on family trips. 


Further, we had similar values. We both didnt smoke, didnt do drugs, highly valued our religion that we share and had many similar world views and values for relationships. We valued each other enough to stay in communication every day no matter what by texting or talking. When we lived together, it was never an issue with cleanliness, cooking, etc. We both did our part and never expected the other to have to do such. We had similar future goals and dreams (travel, marriage, family, living on a lake, etc.) 


I can continue, but lets just say that we both felt very happy and in love together. We both expressed this daily. I never lied to her, I never cheated on her, I never did many things that would hurt someone outright. Further, I always tried to support her with her trauma and her own issues.


Now for what happened:


My ex has a trauma history from her past 2 relationships. Abuse and lying. Neither relationship lasted more then 6 months. This happened when she moved away for college before she met me. She mentioned it to me, and told me how she can find it difficult to trust at times because of this. I always remembered this and made sure to never do anything sexual when we drank because I didnt want her to feel any negative way regarding that. As well, I consistently tried to build that trust and never hurt that trust until this last year.


She grew up homeschooled with all of her siblings in a strict household ran by her narcissistic and autistic father. For example, living at home at 28 she still has a curfew otherwise her dad yells at her. She fears her parents and wanta to make them happy and proud, seeking validation by doing right constantly. An example of this was when she started college it was for a career they suggested. Being in this environment, she has social anxiety and thus has 0 friends. All the years I was with her she made 3 friends and cut them out within 2-3 hangouts. 


My ex was diagnosed with CPTSD, depression, anxiety, and that was before we met. Those things all but went away or here I thought the first 5 years.


So no issues for 5 years, 6th year we have 3 things happen. I was planning to get engaged in 2021. As well, after college (end of 2019) we both moved back to our parents houses as we searched for our first jobs post college. Covid began, making it hard.


First thing:


My ex and I go to my cabin. She gets on an ATV with my cousin, I make sure they both have helmets and I tell my younger cousin she needs to drive very responsibly because my girlfriend was on it. She said thats okay and I even told my ex if she would rather drive with me she can, yet she was alright going with my cousin. 


15 minutes later they are involved in a head on collison with a truck going around a very sharp turn at like 15 miles per hour. I was following them in my car and I was behind them by like a few hundred yards so I didnt see it happen due to the curve. Anyways I ran to my exes side. Held and compressed her leg as she was bleeding. Fast forward, I followed to the hospital and went into her room and waited the whole time with her. She was able to leave within 2 hours and had a tear in her muscle behind her knee, as well as a traumatic brain injury, and further a deviated septum.


We go back to my cabin, and I pretty much take care of my ex the next 24 hours til we leave for home. I helped her bathe, get dressed, made meals, grabbed ice or heat stuff, and even tried cheering her up by watching comedies she likes. 


After dinner my aunt (mother to my cousin) asked me for help. I asked what for and she explained to me that my cousin didnt finish her test to drive the ATV before we left. I told her that I feel uncomfortable doing that and so I opted out. An hour later she asks me again but now tells me that if I dont that the state could sue my grandparents. My grandparents live month to month on their retirement and social security, thus I felt obligated. Later I found out they had insurance and that she was manipulating me. However in this moment my ex felt like I broke her trust by taking this test that I felt obligated to take. She felt like I intentionally set out to cover it up that my cousin should not have been driving. I see where she is coming from but also I felt pressured into it by my aunt and I explained this to her but she said it hurts her still and her trust was broken. I apologized by writing her a letter explaining how I never intentionally meant for that.


Now fast forward 2 months, my ex is still healing and I bring up possibly going to my cabin for a holiday and asking if she wanted to go. She said absolutely not, because my uncle and cousin may be there. I said I understand but this worried me because I was thinking about our future and how it would work regarding family occasions. I brought this up to her and we had a disagreement about it. I asked if they could come to a future wedding of ours, or if we held a family holiday would they be able to come? To which she said again absolutely not. I expressed how I felt about this considering this uncle was the one I was closest to. I said do you think in time your feelings will change? And she said no because of the permanent damage she felt from the accident. Then she brought up covering up for my cousin and that I should never speak to them again because of the pain they put her through via the accident and trust breaking. I took about a week to consider everything. During this time she thought and convinced herself I was choosing them over her BECAUSE I was arguing with her about them being in my life for future events. My family members also never reached out past the first week following the accident and she felt hurt by this. Yet, I reached out constantly and was supporting her healing process. I even wrote to her parents my apology for the damage she had been dealt. Unfortunately I will touch upon this later but her dad banished me from their house and family events.


I blocked my cousin, aunt, and uncle and sent them a long message regarding everything. Up to this point 2 months after the accident I had not spoken to them, and had been supporting my ex's healing progress. So not only did I not speak to them, but I blocked them and wrote what they did wrong and how it was not acceptable. Thus in this moment choosing her over my family members. She came back at the end of that week despite all of this and said my actions showed I chose my family over her and she felt very hurt by this. She said my actions to argue against her for people who hurt her was clear to her how I felt. These arguments were never yelling or anything, it was simply me asking if they would be able to be at certain events and my reasoning why I would appreciate them there. And even after me making my actions clear about not speaking to them since, and blocking them, she still felt betrayed because as she said, ""my actions are clear and you chose them over me.""


Well we dropped this topic moving forward because she was focusing on healing and I blocked them. Yet she still seemed hurt. Now her father is a great person, yet he is strict and he has autism. She never shared with her parents all the details. Simply the details of the accident. Before the accident I was at her house 2/7 days in a week I would say because that way my ex and I could see each other because she liked being at home. Then 2/7 days at my house. And 1 of those 4 days we would do a full date all day or all night. Anyways, since the accident her father grew very resentful to me. Despite my apology in writing, and even in person. He would argue with my ex that she needed to break up with me and that I was not a good person because I let her get on a dangerous machine. Mind you my ex is 27 and I am not controlling thus I did what I could by warning my cousin to be safe and giving them helmets. So her father blamed me, and he told I am not allowed over to their house. So now, my ex and I only saw each other at my house and less. Even so, my ex told me that she had to lie to her father where she was going because he would consistently yell at her to break up with me because I am not a good person for letting her get hurt.


Fast forward 3 more months, were still doing weekly dates and still having sex frequently. We are getting into a better place as we close into graduating. At this time, we were at our parents doing internships. I still am not allowed over and she is even having me pick her up a street over because she did not want her dad to see when we would spend time together. This was hard for me but I never argued about it and just understood despite how bad I felt that her dad hated me when I didnt cause the accident. We are spending less time together because of her father on her back, and because she doesnt prefer to always come to my house (I have smokers in the house and she hates the smell, as do I but I need to deal with it until I could move out again) i would always spray and light candles to make it better.


Event 2:


Now another month forward we are now into the beginning of 2020, we find out that we are unexpectedly pregnant. We used birth control but it must have failed. She brings out the test and as I wait I am smiling thinking about everything. When she brings them both out they are both positive I hug her and then I begin to have a panic attack. Let me make an important note here, I have an anxiety disorder which she knew about. My panic is breathing heavy, heart racing, face likely looking panicked, and intrusive thoughts. These thoughts began to come out, as I explained to her this: ""I am so grateful and happy for this. I am worried though because neither of us have jobs, we are living at our parents and you dont want to live with me because of your parents, as well your parents are going to be mad at me even more then they were with the accident."" She begins to cry, and tells me this is suppose to be a happy moment. I tell her I agree 100%, and I am happy, but we are going to need to figure some things out so that we stay happy. I dont want her and I to struggle financially in any way, I grew up poor and thats why I push myself to work and find a career. She agrees but still seems really sad. 


I see her about a week later and she begins telling me we need to go to her therapist. I ask why and she says we need to make a big decision. Continuing I ask whats that. She said we have 3 options, keep our baby, give our baby up for adoption, or abortion. I tell her thats okay and we go to her therapist. During this session she breaks down crying because she is worried about everything, she speaks for atleast have of the session about her parents and why she is worried they will disown her, and why she is worried about their opinion about premarital sex and a baby our of marriage. We leave with the therapist telling us to come back in a week with pros and cons for each option. 


After seeing her cry and worry, I spent the next month looking for work 8 hours a day. Yet it was covid layoffs happening and so I couldnt find squat. Anyways, a week later I bring my pros, my cons, as does she. I preface the talk with saying I want to keep our baby, I have been looking for work, and I dont want her parents to be a reason why we choose something like this. Then I also say I will continue to step up.

We give our pros and cons for each and hers are mostly focused on her parents and the lack of financial security. I understand and we talk about the options in therapy.


Another week and at this point we are going together to all of the doctors appointments. She talks to me and asks me what do I want to do? I tell her she seems pretty set on abortion based on our talk in therapy, that I want to keep our baby, but if not then I still want children in our future. She tells me she is leaning on abortion, and I tell her I will have to support this decision.


Finally she and I go to a doctors appointment and the whole time I am nervous because the night before I was highly debating buying an engagement ring and proposing to her. Yet, I was arguing with myself because I didnt want her to feel like I was doing this only because of the situation. During this appointment I was in my head and distant as I contemplated it. Afterwards, she mentioned how my actions were pretty clear in this appointment that I was against having our baby. I told her I was only distant because I have something on my mind I cannot share with her, because mentally I still hadnt decided. She didn't believe me. I couldnt pull the trigger because like I said I didnt want her to resent me thinking that I was only doing it for this reason.


A week later she scheduled the abortion and told me that she decided to go forward with the abortion. 


The day comes and I drive her there, outside I tell her we can leave and that we do not need to go in. She trudged in, and seemed very distant, understandably why. We go into the room and I am asking all of these questions out of concern for her during this. And then we wait, I told her we could leave, but she said no. 


It happens and then I bring her home and do my best to make everything both comfortable and enjoyable by making her favorite dinner, and watching her favorite movie etc.


We do not talk about it and do not have sex for 2 months. I told her I am not going to pressure any of that and when she is ready we can go slow into whatever she wants to do. We are having good sex again, but she is very worried about anything getting into her. So we begin to see her therapist again, still we both are looking for jobs, and still doing our weekly dates as best as we can with covid and not being able to go to her house. 


Fast forward 2 more months. And she got a job! I am still looking because in my field (teaching) they were distance learning and not in need of subs nor teachers. Soon summer was upon us and she was working 40 hours a week.


Event 3:


Well by this time, I was pretty depressed by the abortion, the previously mentioned betrayal she felt from the accident, and now my lack of finding work. On top of all of that, with her working so much, I only got to see her max 9 hours a week. I associate that to both her busy schedule and her withdrawing from me. But during this time, I would mention getting married in our future and having a family when we are ready and simply telling her I still wanted that. I maybe brought it up once a month and she would cry and tell me she is not ready right now for those and that in the future she might be. I would tell her, I fully understand and that I only bring it up to assure her I still wanted that with her. 


Well for 3 months we handle this, and juggling little time spent together on her end, I had a bunch of free time because I was still looking for work. I would ask her to go out and do things (hikes, walks, water activities, movies, etc.) And she would tell me how she is busy and cannot until the weekend. Before all of this her and I would go on walks almost 4/7 days if not more with her dog for like an hour. I was becoming needy because I would ask her to include me in those things. I would sometimes cry and ask her if she wanted to see me, and she would respond that she sees me already as much as she wanted to in a week (9 hours).


She had me over for a family bbq and mind that at this time I had not been over to her house in almost 9 months. When I use to come over for many hours every week and help out her mom and spend time with my ex and her family. When I was there I was nervous. I stayed outside in the backyard with her siblings. When they wanted to go into eat, I denied the food because I didnt feel welcomed by her father and thus I didnt want to eat the food out of fear of him saying something. Well they grab food and come back out. My ex however does not. 3 minutes later I get a text telling me to leave and meet her near her house because her dad just yelled at her when they were alone in the kitchen. I slipped out and we take a walk and she is hurt, her dad told her that if she didnt get me off their property he was going to divorce her mom because of her. This hurt me deeply that he would say that. I texted her mom telling her thank you for inviting me and that her husband told my ex those things.


Now to the most current thing:


Still in this realm of feeling sad due to time spent, and everything, my ex and her family go on their family vacation. The one normally I always go on, yet I was not even invited and my ex never brought up considering inviting me. They leave for a week and I am happy for them to be going.


When they return I plan a date for my ex and I the following day. It goes really well until the end. She begins telling me about the trip and how her sisters friends went. This made me feel sad and left out and I began to cry. I explained that I just felt excluded from her life the past few months. Especially now between the bbq and the trip where other people not even affiliated with any family member aside from being friends with them was invited. As well as the lack of her inviting me to do things we use to do together.


She is mad and tells me it is completely out of her control. And I tell her I understand completely that part (cabin/bbq) yet I wish she would try to invite me to more parts of her life I can be a part of.


The next day she is majorly distant, and so I call her and she tells me she is pissed at me. I give her a few days. Then we meet up and essentially she tells me that she doesnt know if she can give me what I need anymore. Going on to tell me that she doesnt see a future together, she doesnt want to have children with me, doesnt want to get married. She tells me that she spent a week having fun and that I ruined it by bringing all of that up. Then that we need to have space and a seperation. 1 month but we are still together she clarifies and that were not dating other people.


2 weeks pass, and she texts me she cannot do it anymore. She calls me and tells me she wants to break up. I beg and plead, and she tells me she doesnt trust anything I say, she feels heart broken, she feels I hurt her, and that my actions have showed her this. She tells me she has given me many chances and that she keeps getting hurt. I try to defend myself by saying I understand but I have never made the same repeated mistakes of hurting her. She says nonetheless that they happened and unintentional or not, she is done being hurt. This hurts me because I truly never did do the same mistakes over and over again. She ends the call by telling me I love you."
1,"Back when I was only 21 years old I had been in a very physical and verbal and mental and emotional relationship with an ex-boyfriend who was 20 years old at the time and he had told me that he had been enjoying watching and viewing porn and it made me sick to my stomach. So badly that I just thought that if I had used my own body for his issues then I could save children,  while he was doing the act on me and I felt hurt by how my body would just let go and he was pleased by how my body would do stuff in reaction to his sicken ways.. I got confused on why the body would reI was told by that ex-boyfriend to call him personal family names it made me feel sick and he had raped 5 different nights throughout our sicken evil relationship in 2011 while we would be in his grandparent's basement and he would tell me if I ever told anyone no one would believe since I enjoy doing sexual stuff in my past. It made me sick and I went to court for an order of protection against that ex-boyfriend at that time I was fearful of him since I had let him use my apple iPod and I never knew until later that he would use that to view all that disgust and sicken stuff. I was fearful I would be charged by the police since it was my item and my iPod.  I am sorry I felt as if I never get out of that sicken evil relationship. I could be hurt and even murdered by this ex-boyfriend. I still feel if I told anyone maybe he could get help mental with his issues. Am I being too hard on myself since I had been raped victim back when I was 15 years old by a disgusting pig who lied about his real age at the time back in 2005 and shown me a fake drivers license saying it 17-year-old person who turned out be found online on the sex offender registry in my local US State website and that 17-year pig turned out to be really a 23 year who had raped another minor even younger than me being 15 years old at this time.



I am really sorry if I had triggered anyone. I do not mean any harm, I am just very confused on why my body had reacted like that with the ex-boyfriend who is a disgusting pig of a person."
1,"I have PTSD from military service and it has been causing lots of issues. I'm so distant from my family they don't hardly know me anymore. I live in a constant state of panic, fear, anxiety, and depression. Three years ago I took a big promotion and pay raise and it required moving away a few hours from friends and family. The job was great and I was glad that I made the move but underlying symptoms and health issues soon started surfacing.  My family had a very difficult time with the move and still trying to adjust in some ways. 

My employees started commenting on how I was forgetting things and not getting any direction from me. It was almost as if I weren't there. My boss had a stern conversation with me and was threatening to fire me. Never in my entire life has anyone threatened to fire me. I've always been a top performer and never had a bad evaluation. My boss and I had a good relationship so I opened up a little to him and he had no idea what I was dealing with. He said my staff had come to him saying that I was forgetting a lot of things and was disengaged. He wanted me to get better and work things out. 

Several months before this I had fell into severe depression and wanted to die. I hated myself and my life and had no will to live. I remember waking up a lot of mornings wishing I had never been born. This I know carried over into my work life and is the reason things transpired the way they did. 

I talked with my family about what I was going through and they wanted me to take a step back and go back to my old job. Less stress and being closer to friends and family seemed to make the most sense. Things were lined up and ready to go for the transition back to my old job until COVID had other plans. I took another job and was determined to not repeat the same mistakes. I stayed six months, busted my tail, worked crazy hours, and had glowing reviews. Only problem is the drive was 1.5 hr away and working 12+ hours a day wasn't working. A company 10 minutes from home called me out of the blue and offered me a job for about the same pay.  Now I'm two jobs down the road and scared I'm about to have another unpleasant situation at work. I've had three jobs in the past year and really don't want to do a fourth. Over the last 15 years (excluding the past year) I've only had two jobs. I think I'm hypersensitive to any perceived threats and my mind goes crazy playing out doomsday scenarios which tends to lead to being homeless and living under a bridge. This can stem from something as simple as ""hey how is that report coming?"" My mind will somehow take that harmless conversation and turn it into a final warning and one more slip up I'm done for. 

My wife has said many times that I'm drifting further and further away. She said she can't remember the last time I smiled or laughed. We haven't been intimate in a long time which bothers her. It's really difficult for me to be intimate because of the depression and anxiety. 

How can I balance PTSD, my loving family, and career? I'm worried I'm forgetting things, starting to get disengaged, and feels like I'm headed down the wrong path. I feel like I'm paralyzed and can't do anything to correct any performance issues. In reality I may be fine and don't have nothing to worry about. I want to overcome this and hate feeling this way! Once I can overcome this I want to focus on reconnecting with my family."
1,Why can’t I get out of this town where I was adopted into and always been lied about and Physically and mentally and financially abuse my whole life I’ve always treated everybody with respect and worked my ass off And I was there when the people that adopted me and abused me until they died of old age but yet I’m still a Big piece of Crap and now I’m broken down and just about crippled the only way out I can see is to die I’ve been begging my whole life for God almighty to take my life but he won’t let me die it looks like he gets a joy out of watching these good Christian people torture me until I go crazy or what ever
1,"Hi everyone!
This is all very new to me but I just feel like I need to write this down.
Just started therapy and that’s only making it clearer my girlfriend doesn’t want to work on it together.
My story:

I’m a lesbian and in a relationship with a woman who also identifies as a lesbian, but has a history with men.
About 8 years ago I got cheated on by my girlfriend at the time with multiple men.
Some of those men confronted me with ‘evidence’, harassed me (I should leave her alone, what can she do with a girl, she needs a real man..).. I really loved and trusted this girl and always believed her excuses when she had to work late or had family things.
Until one night, one of the guys she was seeing, broke into her apartment while we were sleeping upstairs. He pulled me out of the bed and beat me, threw me down the stairs.. He said I should leave his girlfriend alone (MY girlfriend I thought..), said really disrespectful things about lesbians, humiliated me, I was devastated..
Obviously I broke of what I thought was a relationship.
I was completely lost, didn’t date for 5 years.. I didn’t really trust anyone enough to start a relationship again.
And as long as I didn’t commit to anyone I didn’t really feel the issues I had developed from that experience.
Now I’m with a woman who has slept with men before and I completely freak out by that thought. She also is friends with a guy who she used to sleep with. He comes around all the time, she doesn’t get that it bothers me (she knows my story).
I don’t expect her to drop her friend for me, I just don’t get why he needs to be here weekly.
He cheats on his girlfriend, he’s a real macho, I don’t trust him at all and have difficulty trusting my girlfriend.
This has been a constant argument for us, so I realized I had to work on my issue.
I’m started edmr.
Talking to my therapist has made me realize I’m not crazy, I’m not overreacting, I have ptsd.
My girlfriend says things like : you’re overreacting, this guy is something that’s in the past, there’s nothing to worry about..
One time she also mentioned to a friend how great he is in bed, while I was sitting right there..
I get that my jealousy and stuff is not easy for her, but I feel like I deserve better..
Now she told me that we are over because it’s too much for her and she doesn’t wanna feel like she can’t see her friends..
Anyways, just wanted to write this down.
I’m done with feeling like I’m crazy/overreacting.. I’m ready to work on my issue, with or without her support."
1,"hi, I've been searching for info and other's experience with EMDR and any possible side effects. I've had trauma in my life so I'd say I've got PTSD and I heard about EMDR, it sounds like I could benefit from it. Now with the Covid-19 and variant viruses I could not get help irl so I was wondering about doing it myself, hearing about that you move your eyes from side to side while talking about your traumas? I'm wondering how do you do it and I hope I get the help that I need here. Thanks so tremendously"
1,"TW i am going to talk about my own experiences with my past and i hope someone can tell me what they think. 

At 17 years old, i met my first ""real"" boyfriend. He was an avid weed smoker, i mean 15-20 joints a day and at this time, i was young, impressionable and definitely wanted to seem like a cool stoner girl. So, naturally, i smoked everyday with him ignirant to the abuse.

What makes this story 10x worse is that at the time of meeting him, he was in the early stages of paraboid schizophrenia. I did not know this at the time as i had no awareness of the illness myself. However, there were things that seemed odd but as I was so young I brushed them off bc I thought he was the ""one"". Long story short, he emotionally abused me, accused me of cheating everyday, called me horrible names and refused my help. He would even get paranoid about me looking at strangers in public. 

He was also an avid drug user and because i wanted to impress him, i took cocaine and ketamine often with him (which he asked me several times to buy for him to which i would). At the time i thought this was normal. Looking back, i have not only caused trauma for myself but now a list of mental health problems i didnt think i would ever get. I was very ignorant. 

One time he had a schizophrenic episode to which he locked me in his room and cellotaped the doors so i couldnt leave. He was seeing people that werent there and thought he was going to die. This was very traumatic for me as i was so young and had no clue how to help. I stayed up all night with him until 11 am when the crisis team came to evaluate. 

I was told several times it wasn't healthy for me but the abuse and manipulation kept bringing me back. 

Its been 2 years now and i dont really think about him, however, i notice my anxiety has gotten worse, I struggled for a long time to watch tv and relax doing the thing's i enjoy, i was a slave to his abuse. I sometimes have flashbacks of the events but nothing too extreme, however its affected my motivation, happiness and anxiety. 

Could i be suffering from ptsd? I never thought I could be until i read more about it online. 

Thankyou"
1,"I've been referred to psychology for trauma treatment and received a letter today saying I'm on waiting list for EMDR.  Not what I was originally expecting but apparently waiting list is smaller so I'll be seen quicker.

Has anyone else had this and what does it entail?  How long does it usually last etc?"
1,"Anyone on a steady dose of Ativan for ptsd?  I take an anti depressant, a mood stabilizer and 1 mg of Ativan every other day.  My PTSD is bad plus I have a disfiguring autoimmune disease so the dr has allowed me to stay on the Ativan indefinitely....plus I am 63 so it’s about quality of life verses quality.
Anyone else take Ativan regularly for a number of years."
1,"I have PTSD from witnessing a murder as a child, OCD for me goes hand in hand with it - my issue is rationalizing what is likely and what is nothing to be worried about.. Since I have OCD I can obsess and become terrified of almost anything. To make it short I had a gaming group and so did this other guy, he was mad that people were preferring me.. He started slandering me weeks ago and I didn’t care then girls that used to be in his gaming cult Bc that’s what it is messaged me and said he stalks people relentlessly, he doesn’t leave them alone once he has a target that’s that. So this made me a little uncomfortable and then the girl showed me his mugshots and all his criminal history including murder for hire and tons of violent offenses. The guy himself messaged me and said “this is unacceptable you can’t have people defend you” (I didn’t know people had come to my defense) I could sense his god complex where he needs people to bow down to him... so I simply said I apologize sir I never realized this would be such an issue I’m deleting my groups and anywhere I’ve posted anything gaming wise and again I am sorry if I caused u any issues that was never my intention. He said get your people to not post in my group (they were just saying that I am not charging them and that he was slandering and bullying) I said I will and again I’m sorry and I do not know any of these people personally goodnight. He says “you know we are almost neighbors? You’re like 45 mins away from me”  Then I deleted my entire Facebook out of complete fear … I’ve been obsessing over this and it’s very scary to me. I definitely don’t live as close as he thinks Bc I don’t say where I really live on FB. But either way there’s some creep that could potentially be stalking me idk! I’m so scared what if he was to show up somewhere near me OVER a friggen video game ? like I’m so uncomfortable. Everyone try’s to tell me don’t worry he’s just some guy who needs to feel in control sooo I thought I would let him feel in control and delete everything and maybe he’d go away but I just don’t know what to think! I’m like so scared and I ordered extra security cameras and all that meanwhile he lives 700 miles away… idk so obsessing. HELP ME RATIONALIZE. I can tell
This guy is poor, uneducated, unstable, seems like he is on drugs or maybe he just is not well... but what are the chances someone halfway across the country is really going to try to stalk me and ruin my life"
1,"I've been diagnosed with PTSD after an accident I was in several years ago.  I experienced anxiety for several months after the accident, then it went away with the help of an Zoloft.  Now, it's come back and I've been shaking with headaches and adrenaline surges for the past 2 months.  I can't sleep without ambien. I can't watch TV without shaking...the sound is messing me up.  Bright lights mess me up, too....and ibuprofen isn't touching these headaches.   The Dr. keeps increasing my antidepressant, but it's not helping.  I'm also taking therapy and so far, it's not helping. I'm losing hope....why does this continue on....is there no cure?  Should I be talking to a specialist instead of a GP?  Should I try a different antidepressant?"
1,"Hi - I'm new here. This thread will contain content about sexual abuse. I apologize if I'm in the wrong forum or in the wrong place. But, I would like advice on if I just experience sexual abuse or assault or if I'm thinking too much into it.

2 weeks ago I had to get an x-ray done on my neck. A week later, the office that referred my x-ray called saying the doctor that saw me wanted me to see him at his clinic, in-person, to discuss results. I've gotten x-rays done before and most of the time results are discussed over the phone, so him saying I had to come to his office to do so alarmed me a little bit. Mind you, his office is at a different location than the one I saw him at (30 minutes away difference). So I scheduled my appointment to see him.

He tells me my results (yes, something was wrong...but it's not really important to this story) so then he asked if he could feel my neck. So I moved my hair to the side and he starts feeling around. Then he moves my hair to the other side, made a comment that my hair is soft, and starts massaging the other side of my neck. He massaged my neck and shoulder for a good minute, saying I need to get a massage done. I've had back problems for years and I've never had a doctor...massage me...like that. He found a ""knot"" and said he wanted to try and 'get it out'. So I nervously laughed and kinda shrugged my shoulders hoping to get his hand off. He stopped and brush his hand across my back when he was done.


Small. But enough for me to feel uncomfortable. I've been sexually abused before, so this is why I posted in the PTSD group (yes, I'm diagnosed). But never by a doctor and I don't know if he was just doing his doctor thing or if this was borderline sexual asssult."
1,"Hi. I’m 22, diagnosed with PTSD but haven’t been to therapy in a few years bc it’s really expensive. I used to take meds for depression but I’m not sad anymore. 

Lately I’ve been having weird episodes where I feel like I’m not a real person and I don’t know what to do. This has happened before, when I was a kid. I was just walking at a baseball game after school and suddenly I was convinced that I wasn’t real, like my body was a corpse just moving on its own. And people interacting with me were interacting with some version of me that no longer existed while I was spectating. 

I just graduated college and it’s happening again, but really badly. I’m not sure if this is normal for PTSD-havers to experience? It’s worse than my normal “dissociation” for me. I feel like I’m actually a Thing, an echo, an object, a body and I need to check to make sure I’m not transparent or cold or fake. 

I genuinely feel so crazy talking about it. I know it doesn’t make sense. I’m not even “sad” but I feel and sometimes truly believe that I’m a ghost or a corpse just walking among real people or that everything is all fake. 

Is this a normal symptom of PTSD? If other people experience this, how do you stop? How do you be productive?"
1,"I’ve suddenly been having intrusive thoughts of hurting myself and they scare me so much. I haven’t had much sleep this whole month and I read that sleep deprivation can cause that too. This is causing me so much distress ever since my panic attacks started. I’ve never in my life felt this way before. I want to cry and scream because I want these thoughts to just go away. I would never act up on them because I’m terrified of death or suicide. Every time I hear of someone passing, my body just goes numb and I start to panic. I’m super terrified. Why am I feeling like this? These thoughts come and go and sometimes they stay to haunt me. I’m so scared. Please help! Any advise?"
1,"My wife has a fairly large online presence, and is a big advocate of mental health awareness and all that, but I don’t FEEL like I have much support, day to day. Is it me? Am I too dependent? I guess it would have to start with, what even does “support” look like? Day to day. Through ups and downs. Fights, all that. Can I expect that? SHOULD I? If my mind is always putting me down, will I know if the support is there? How would you know if someone wasn’t, or stopped supporting you? What are signs of support fatigue? Like, someone just can’t. How do you know if you should leave someone because you might be too much and dragging them to a darker place? Are these relevant to anything I started with?
I feel very lost and alone and I’m in this weird mental prairie and there is just nothing but clouds and rain for miles."
1,"I thought that I was the problem and that I was broken and messed up, but I was having a normal reaction to an abnormal (unhealthy) situation. 

It seems like for a lot of my life, people made me to feel like I was the problem and like I was difficult.

I got out of a toxic circumstances in my life and then healed myself using self-help and therapy, and now I am mostly better...I am still having flashbacks and ruminating and having the occasional panic attack...but I am functioning and getting better.

I guess I just wanted to say that it's ok to shut down or to want to run and hide. It's ok to respond to traumas in ways that are socially not always accepted or understood.

There is nothing wrong with us and we are not actually broken...we're reacting based on our natural predisposition + traumatic trigger.

You are ok wherever you are in your journey."
1,"So recently everything that's gone on with my nieces (which is still ongoing and I'll explain in an update soon) have brought forth something that comes up once and awhile, which is I think I was sexually abused as a child.
Every time I pondered this,I quickly shoot it down as impossible but this time the feelings and suspicions are not going away.

I am not sure what to believe.

When I was 8 years old, my sister was married and had a baby and I loved babies, so I always was willing to go over. While during that time my parents were split up and things were stressful, my brother closest to my age was being sexually abused by his cub scout leader (idr what they are called) so my mom pulled him out and was arguing with the church to get the pervert removed,things were so stressful my brother chose to live with my dad. That caused more fights. I knew a lot about what was going on because my mom didn't believe in leaving me in the dark. I was also informed that my older four siblings were abused by our grandparents in the past, my sister who had the baby supposedly lied about being abused and she was just an attention seeker because the oldest 4 had been abused and she was so ignored. My mom supposedly feels bad and calls it sick sibling syndrome and says its her fault for ignoring her so much and that is why lied. I don't know what's true, that happened 10 year before I was born. But I do know, I have always been afraid to be like her, she is a compulsive liar and would get me in trouble, my family didnt like her and compared me to her when I was bad, I was afraid to be l like her.
 
Anyway I was bored, stressed and lonely and so I was always so willing to go to my sister's house to play with her baby, I honestly pretended they were my real family, my sister was my mom my brother in law was my dad and the baby was my little brother.
My brother in law played with me a lot, I enioyed it a lot, but at points the way he'd grab me thinking back it was inappropriate which is why I would yell stop and normally he would. I'm still piecing it all together. But instead if rambling nore I'll cut to the chase. One day, I ran into a porn dvd. I remember the cover in great detail, I found it while I was in his room playing, waiting for him to come capture me in our game and when he came in I asked what it was and he told me, in detail. I remember most of that incident in very clearly however, after the conversation, I don't remember a thing but, it's always felt like something bad happened.
As shamed as I am to say this, I started experimenting with other kids too right after that, consensually of course. I was very hyper sexual for years, yes sadly before puberty(though I started my period at the age of 10). Now I'm repulsed by sex of any sort. If I wasn't abused, I was at least impacted greatly by the incident.
It's something I go back and forth on. Like my emotional mind is convinced I was abused but my logical mind reminds me I have no proof, not even a memory
..although there is one other incident that might prove it happened which is when my sidter  was divorcing him a few years later, I overheard my mom and other sister speaking and my other sister said ""He was talking about making murasakibee his wife (wont and cant use my real name*"" and my mom looked replused and said ""she's 10! ""
That was the first time I felt like I remembered him touching me, I felt at the time he did it a lot. But I quickly went to going with that it was impossible.
There have been several times after that I pondered it but I figured I was wrong. Or I wanted attention because my brother had been abused. I never once brought it up, this is all contemplations I have only had in my head.

Recently though i realized, I have kept all these concerns to myself and I keep going back over and over and really, who am I fooling? Who am I lying too? I am so convinced it happened yet I call my own self a liar. Maybe I'm paranoid or I imagined it. I have no physical memory of him doing it to me, just emotional. I try and try but it does feel like something is off.

Sorry if none of this made sense I'm nust trying to figure things out"

1,"TRIGGER FOR PHYSICAL ABUSE, SEX, DECEPTION


I feel like I need to get this off my chest but I also kind of need advice for handling it. I really love her and I wouldn't want to leave her. If there's a way I can help her, she really deserves it. She never struck me as the type of person to do something like this or even have mental problems that would bring her to do something like this. Now it's really really messing with me and I'll need help getting through it. Even seeing things about pregnancy or best friends triggers the hell out of me... I can't even go to work and trust people or talk to anyone who we saw at school or look at memes.... I have live with no friends or no one to talk to but now there's no trust. If this counts as a catfish, then I got catfished in real life.

She's literally the only family I've had besides for my boyfriend.. We met through a big mix of friends who were at the breakfast and lunch table. I'm a few years younger than her though she was in high school with me for 3 years because she would miss a lot of school and get held back due to her own family problems. Back then 3 years was a long long time, just because I was going through so much, constantly getting kicked out of my moms or dealing with her drunk boyfriend and moved in and out of the foster home because of physical abuse and things like that. She was there through everything. She was my role model, my hero like a mom to me, literally like a god. She would always bring food to school help with my medical problems and give very genuine consider advice. Never judge me for anything no matter how big of a nerd I was. She's literally my big sister. Even after she graduated and moved away, she still supports me online 6 years since we first met. She became my sister, but as lot of times she was actually like my mom and I called her mom and it felt so special and genuine and she would hold me just like you imagine a mom would....

The thing was, back in high school about a year after we met, she started talking more and more about a best friend. (I never met this best friend but of course through genuine daily conversation, I just didn't have reason to question his existence. ) He eventually became so important she was talking about dating him and she has a lot of pictures of them, and he and I would talk online in a meme group with her and other people at school. Cool enough. I never went anywhere and this is a really big city with many schools, and she was popular with so many people, so I really didn't question anything as long as she was happy and safe. Eventually that conversation gradually turned into them being in love. I was happy for them but a shit ton of stuff was happening for me and I was going through a lot with my mom's boyfriend. Her support still came in and both of them would send me money and things, so he became like family to me too. She helped me through my first sexual experiences, a pregnancy scare, my mom's boyfriend's abuse, me losing my little brother, everything. He was also by my side. When my boyfriend hit me and blackmailed me and I got suicidal, she was EVERYTHING, she'd come over at 3 in the morning if I needed it.

Her senior year came along. She was definitely going to be graduating that year and she also had some plans for college. I was a junior and I was kind of sad but I was already coming to terms with the senior thing and I knew she would still have my back. I knew her boyfriend would have my back too, especially when she revealed that he proposed to her and they were engaged. This was my first positive exposure to marriage with science for all my fantasies, so I can't explain how excited I was for them. January rolled around and before Christmas break ended, she stopped by to bring me some presents, and told me something that made me super super super happy-- she was almost a month pregnant! Everyone at school eventually knew about this within the first few months and she was so proud about it, of course I have no reason to doubt it. She would tell me all about her pregnancy and all this cool stuff about her life, both of us ended up making some new friends, and whenever her boyfriend was working a lot shall I would have movie nights and things like that. As her belly grew, we would go baby shopping like sisters and eventually I forced her to let me buy her some baby clothes as a present using one of my compensation checks. Same with food, eventually she caved in. She was now out of contact with her family and starting a new one and she was getting her life completely on and all she had to do was graduate, I was very very proud of her. She had all these amazing ultrasounds and it was all so beautiful, she gained a little weight but carried it very well. She caved in and eventually let our mutual friend give her massages and feed her and everything.

Graduation came. She was six months along. She got me my support kitty, who I still have and live to death and even named after an inside joke. For whatever reason, she ended up not attending graduation. No big deal even though it was a lot of money and time spent planning for me to get myself and a few other friends there. I knew she'd graduated and I just assumed she wasn't feeling well. But not only did she disappear from graduation, she basically fell off the face of the Earth physically. I never saw her anywhere around or her to literally anything about her from anyone else, even though she never change her City on Facebook which she's very active on and even listed online jobs. Her only existence was on my screen and she would answer maybe a few times a week, sometimes every day, sometimes not at all. Though she always tells me that she loves me and she is very very supportive and I always have what I need. Eventually in the Summer she did have her baby and nobody even knew about it until she posted online, which I understand because she's had a lot of problems with her family and did have problems with a few people at school. She can have stopped posting on Facebook for a while, posting maybe once a month and stopped using her other social media. She's only had maybe five pictures of her baby, even in private messaging.

About a year-and-a-half later, the fall after I graduated, life really wasn't going well for me. The only thing I had to look forward to was her revealing that she was pregnant again! She just found out that she was almost 3 months and everything was going very well for her. Needless to say, no post on Facebook, the birth of this baby was the same exact same as last time. Since this one was a girl in fact, she would be named after me! The middle name would be the nickname that she gave me and I practically graduated my role as her baby girl  and let it go to a second child who I knew would have an amazing parent.

They started coming in regular contact with me almost everyday since their kids were one and two and she was a stay-at-home mom. Constant support, constant good advice and comfort, 3 a.m. phone calls whenever I need it, food whenever I need it even though it's sparingly, her giving me a ride to work when I need it. Now that I look back on it, should have two babies sleeping in the car with blankets over the seats, and of course I would listen like a small bean and I wouldn't have any reason to doubt her or make her parenting difficult.

All that being said, am I allowed to see the babies when awake? No. None of our friends are. There's always some kind of excuse despite her being a stay-at-home mom. Do you know why? Tuesday evening, I was on Facebook. I commented asking for another picture and talking about how cute they were and everything. I noticed all her boyfriends old comments, which would be him answering other people's questions on her behalf, we're all deleted. Because his account didn't exist. Deleted account Maybe? Now that I think about it, probably suspended because it's fake with no way to verify it. I was asking people have to get in contact with them and they had literally no way to contact. I want as far to message someone who worked in the same place he was talking about working at, and they had no idea who it was. Nobody who works there at the idea who he was and so did nobody at the school he went to. Just amazing.

The pictures also had comments from her cousin, who is extremely blunt because she is special needs and obviously doesn't know about this whole sham. Comments were saying things like ""There's the cutie dolly! She finally came! Etc"" normal for her, and then one stood out --- ""did you see those baby's that are like the baby alive they eat and make sounds but there for adults and I know your just the avid collector so are we expecting one of those next month??? :)"" .... Yeah, that didn't sound right to me, at all.

I looked through more and finally noticed what once felt a little off. They have the same positions each time or have pictures that hide their hands/etc, all pictures of them sleeping, which adds up to more suspicion. I went back to the post with the cousin's comment, and it was deleted, but not before someone else from school could comment asking wtf. 

I went ahead and messaged her grandma, who had made a Facebook a while back ago, and was the only family she mentioned in a positive light. Turns out, she's living with her grandma, lost her job (because of her boss committing a felony and assault), has no money for school except for the college classes she did, has gotten in trouble for harassment and sexual misconduct, just living a shitty life in an efficiency with nobody except me and two friends she keeps in touch with, and being a mom to her baby dolls. I asked about boyfriend and grandma wouldn't say much but she did relay that there was a guy by the same name she used to have a lot issues with who she currently stalks and hacks..... His current girlfriend told me that he's told her about him being sexually harassed by and lied about. But girlfriend is also a huge drama queen, by the impression I used to get from her.

I have never felt so low myself, let alone knowing my only family member who helped through EVERYTHING imaginable is now and has always been lower than anyone I know...

Everything was taken from me last night. My family and the person I trusted most, the only person I trusted in my entire life. I don't even know what's real and what's not and I keep looking back at everything that wasn't and there's no cutoff to it.... She is obviously sick but I don't know what to do for myself or for her. 

Tl;dr: she was my best friend and the only one I could ever trust, going through sex and abuse and grief. Her boyfriend and her became like family in my darkest hour, and Tuesday it all had been ripped from me. Her babies and her entire life are fake as f, she's went out of her way to deceive me and everyone, and her boyfriend was probably her catfishing me (based on a boy she may have harassed and now stalks to the extreme). After all she's done for me to keep me physically safe and taken care of as well as emotionally supported, I am now deeply concerned and she deserves any help I can give her. I don't know how to help. I don't know how to move on for myself. Even seeing things about pregnancy or best friends triggers the hell out of me... I can't even go to work or talk to anyone who we saw at school or look at memes...."
1,"Hi, my parent's house is full of really horrible memories from my childhood that leave me feeling like it's unsafe to stay here and like I'm going to be hurt. There is currently no way to move out because it would cause me to really struggle financially no matter what help I could get. I'm looking for advice on how to feel safe at home?

Is there anything I could do or tell myself to lessen these feelings of being trapped, threatened and vulnerable? Thank you"
1,"When I was 14 or 15 I had a lying problem. I lied about my mum being dead. Me having cancer. My dad abusing me. This went on for around 6 months and was eventually stopped when one person I was lying to contacted social services and I got called into the head teachers office, who told me someone was concerned and I ended up telling her the truth. My mum got called into the school and I went home and we had a family discussion, followed by my dad going through my social media accounts checking my messages between people. A few weeks later, other people found out I was lying and we all got called into the head teachers office where I got shouted at by the people I had lied to. I deserve everything I got. I’ve struggled with my mental health since this, mainly with anxiety and depression and recently having been diagnosed with PTSD because of what happened/what I did. I’ve been through several other traumatic experiences since this, mainly abusive boyfriends and I always tell myself I deserve to be hurt by other people because of what I did. I haven’t talked to anyone about what happened in 10 years. I know that I deserve to suffer because of what I did. I’m now starting counselling and whilst I can talk to the counsellor about the abusive boyfriends, I’ve yet to be able to tell her about the lying as I’m worried she will judge me for it. I know I am an awful human but I would never even think of lying about anything like that again. I was just a stupid kid. I just don’t know what to do anymore. It’s ruining my life."

A girl that made me like a part of myself took her own life, because life was cruel to her in ways.

I can't talk to anyone because rhyming off my problems just trivialises them. I hate that all I do is infect people.

I trigger when people try to set me up on dates, or ask me intimate questions about my love life. I especially trigger when the men at work start their misogynistic BS.

I only understand being alone. Every day I'm suffocating, and there's no one to talk to, because infecting others is a selfish option."

1,"Hi everyone.

My name is Ally and I'm posting here looking for a little reassurance/comforting advice. I've been dealing with (mostly untreated) C-PTSD for over 5 years along with other mental health issues, and it's been an ongoing process for me with lots of ups and downs, and unfortunately not a lot of therapy as it's not been an option right now.

I'm looking for some advice as today I ended up seeing a photo of a person who was very connected with that time in my life and it triggered me horribly, setting off feelings and emotions I can't control or get rid of. It upset me so badly that it triggered my OCD on top of it ( I deal with what I call PTSD-related OCD, too - feeling like if I do something that at all connects to that event, it will either happen again/undo everything I've worked so hard to fix, or send me back to that place, if that makes any sense) and I feel like everything is going to go bad again. I know it's irrational (and probably stupid), but I can't help it and I'm panicking. I've worked so hard to get myself to a better place and while life isn't ever perfect, I'm scared of losing it all. Has anyone felt this way, and if so, what did you do? And did whatever you were afraid of, actually happen? I've done a bit of DBT work in the past and keep trying to use the skills and remind myself that what I'm feeling is not real, and it's not the same circumstances and therefor doesn't mean anything, but it's not that easy as most of you probably know. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. It's nice to have a place to not feel judged."
1,"Just to clarify, Terry is not my real name, in case any concerns.

Basically this event happened a couple of years ago, but it was so close to home that I became a very paranoid and anxious person. I live on a busy street, but it's a nice area overall. There is a plaza on the busy part of the street, and a group of teens tried robbing me one night, and I defended myself. Unfortunately, this seemed to piss them off, because months later they saw me again in the plaza and violently assaulted me in broad daylight, in front of many people.

Because it was so close to home, I was always anxious about running in to them again, while on the bus, waiting at the bus stop, getting groceries etc. I'm not sure how to move past this incident and tell myself that a third incident won't happen.

ONE REALLY IMPORTANT factor of all this is that I've been afraid to get legal intervention, because I do not want to escalate things further and potentially cause danger to my family, and not just myself.

Because I don't feel comfortable going to the police, I feel a little helpless. I'm not sure what I could do to prevent a third incident. Can anyone please give me some advice on hot to not feel so FEARFUL? I've honestly avoided certain parts of the area, and it's becoming too draining. 

Please do not suggest moving away  - I am trying to avoid living in fear and acting on emotion.

Thank you

1,"I’m 31 now. When I was 18, I was in a horrible car accident. After that I was scared to be in a car or a car that would go fast. When I was 21, it suddenly hit me, my first panic attack that sent me to the hospital. Til this day, I can’t be in a car that goes fast, I drive slow and try to be a cautious driver. If my boyfriend goes over 75 mph, I’m already freaking out telling him to stop. I’m constantly checking how fast he’s going. There’s times when I can be perfectly fine, I start to think about all the bad things that can happen while being on the road and then I start getting a panic attack while driving so I have to call my boyfriend or a family member to be on the phone with me while I make it home safe.

Thank you in advance for your answers. Xoxo"
1,"I moved back in with my abusive mother back in September moving back from another country and having no other choice, I’m now in a situation where she’s started to continue her old patterns of abusive behaviour (not physical because I’m an adult) she’s always infantilised me but it’s become worse now I’m aware of it and she does controlling things like not letting me cook for myself or do any housework asking ‘if I’m trying to be more independent’ by doing normal things and telling me not to vote because her boss who she rents from would be aware of me living in her house and she didn’t want her knowing (she didn’t tell her until February 5 months after I moved in) being weird about the government knowing where I live. 

I’m trans and I was outed to her before I moved in and while she said she accepts but she’s always been a bigoted person and she doesn’t get my pronouns right and calls me by a name she decided suits me better and not the name I want to be called and also makes really uncomfortable remarks about my body (commenting when I don’t bind for example) and and asks invasive questions regarding my transition. I moved in knowing it would be hard for me to try to survive around her but planning to get a job and work to save up in order to move out but she’s become controlling about me finding work and uses my mental health as an excuse as to why I can’t work and suggested giving me ‘pocket money’ every month instead so I don’t have to work and asking why I need money. 

Because of all this and the memories of the things she did before (kicking me out as a teenager, blaming me for abusive men not liking her)
I have panic attacks and flashbacks almost daily and her attempting to again control me as an adult has been making them worse forcing me to uncover new memories that I hadn’t realised I had pushed down before that I’m not ready to process, I’ve never had therapy before because she prevented me getting it growing up so I wouldn’t be around people I could report her to but I’m on a waiting list for therapy now because the waiting list for trans services is so long and I planned to use that to work though my abuse without her knowing, with the lockdown now that’s been pushed back even more and I have no way of knowing when I’ll be able to talk to someone. 

I really need help I’m feeling more and more scared and stressed about my chances of leaving when she’s so controlling about me working and having money so I don’t know what to do. I have nowhere else to go my father is also abusive and I tried living there once as a teen and he threatened me with homelessness if I i didnt do what he wanted and all other relatives side with them. I don’t know anybody I can go to. I would like to know how anybody who’s situation was similar was able to work/get money to escape"

1,"I know that from around the ages 4-5, I, along with my sister 2 years older than me, were molested by out neighbor. I don’t it remember it being rape but I have very clear details of it happening. I tried to “confront” my sister about it when I was 12 but she got very angry. Which is proof enough for me that it happened. I am terrified of hurting children. I’ve been that way since I could remember. I have intrusive and nasty thoughts about them that happen only when I’m around them. I think it’s anxiety as I’ve never acted on those thoughts. Nor do I have the desire to. I have had depression ever since 5 I believe. It finally blew up into schizophrenia and depression of which I was rediagnosed as bipolar 1. I have a lot of cognitive difficulties stemming from the depression. Honestly, though I know people shouldn’t say they just want to move on and not tackle their issues but I’ve known I was molested for a very long time. The depression pretty much numbed me out but now that I’m on the right medications, I’m starting to be happy again. My cognitive abilities are coming back but, as of yesterday I was obsessing over what happened to me so much so that the little emotional stability or happiness I felt just dwindled. (I used to be very bright but I know that because of what happened, my brain as a way to protect me, broke into pieces.) I just want to move on. I know it wasn’t my fault. I know I didn’t deserve it. I know that if my older self could have gone back and stopped it, I would have most likely killed that man. How can I move on. I only see my therapist twice a month and with the Coronavirus, I’m not sure when I’ll see her. I keep having the same drowning dream that I thought went away. Any advice would really help."

1,"I lost my mental independence in relation to my mom, sensed I was like a ten year old, by not wanting to be alone, not taking responsabilities alone, have a kind of mental shutdown, lost all of my interests in life, etc. Had a traumatic experience when going to Lisbon to make an EEG some time ago, plus I had a severe moto accident tenty three years ago.Do I have PTSD or is it another condition? I'm diagnosed as paranoid schizoaffective bipolar type."

1,"Hi this is my first post.  I was dx with PTSD after some abuse in my relationship and also childhood.  And a lot of bad choices on my part.  I still blame myself and am not sure it was really abuse.  Me and my husband worked through things, it was hard, and the abuse has stopped now.  But a new problem has happened.  His sister has told us about a genetic condition that he has to be tested for.  It all became a big fight as his family will not talk about it.  Then I find out his parents knew all along.  And never told us.  The condition can be life threatening if not known about (we have kids).  My husbands dad has been very verbally abusive to him and so has his sister   .  It reminds me of how my husband would deny my /my kids experience and  I feel utterly shell shocked  and am now not sure I can trust my husband.  I told him this, as I was feeling unable to cope-i wanted reassued-  and he got really angry and told me how much I hurt him as I'm the only one he has left.  I feel so bad he needs me now but I'm so scared and untrusting inside, I'm not coping well and am not sure if I'm paranoid or if he is untrustworthy.  I used to defend his dad and now I feel so stupid and a mug.  I always believe people cant be so bad.  I always think they're just misunderstood but I can't believe what's happened.  And it's making me doubt my husband again.  I'm so shocked a parent could with hold such information from their child and them attack them on asking about it.  I'm utterly lost.  It's been a long line of stuff and I'm overwhelmed.  I have a therapist but it's the time in between.  And I even find it hard to talk to her though I'm starting to trust her after 3 yrs.  Often I want to sack her because she isn't available enough.  And also I don't want to become reliant on her.  Does anyone understand any of this?  I can't seem to get the help I need."
1,"Where do I even start to be honest, I hope what I write in this thread possibly educates or even help someone perhaps. To let them know there not alone in this and I too was and sorta am still haunted by this that it caused me to get C-PTSD. All because of what people have done to me online the most my whole life. However  as I write this now I'm  not surviving  anymore  but thriving and becoming more at peace and happy with my life. I'm learning to let go and not let what happen to me effect or ruin my life anymore. Now I tell you my story. I joined here to "" try "" to converse with others practicing my social skills being around people once again online. You heard or possibly heard over the years and still hear the horror stories that happens online with some unlucky innocent people excluding kids and teenagers. Though it can also just as well effect adults just as much too. You heard about Catfishing, bullies, pedos, creeps, extreme mental health individuals from those who won't seek help nor want it. Them then brining you down with them severely with your own mental health at stake. You trying your very best to help or even safe them from not ending there lives. That it's becoming a extremely dangerous road for you to be around the person as you think if you stop helping best you can for them they end themselves,  thus blame yourself for failing. 

 

However that's not all what happens online today that no one wants to talk about. Nor want too discuss  and sweep under the rug because it happened  to them and their ashamed or blame themselves for falling for it or it happening to them. Really anyone reading this online is not as safe as you may think nor a good place to post a lot of your information  on as well pictures of yourself. It is dangerous to tell the real harsh truth, you can believe me or not but it is the truth. 

 

Where you can meet extremely messed up individuals that enter your lives that could cause stalking, threatening you, exposing you by black mailing and anything else you hear as well in movies and television today like hackers as well. I'm here to tell you what I wrote happen to me about half of those things starting at age ten when I met a pedo online. Thus began my traumatizing journey  being online like every other kid and teenager  was in the 2000s. It being the popular thing to be so call "" cool "" and accepted by everyone.

 

People in society  today don't  really talk at all about these things to kids and teenagers not enough as they truly should. To truly prevent kids, teens or even adults taking there own lives or other very bad things happen to them. I mean really talk and explain what could happen if you post pretty much your whole life sharing it on social media, pictures, information and ect. People can and will use it to steal your identity if your not careful causing those types of problems for you if your not cautious as you should be when talking to people online.

 

As for talking to people online today in this society it's okay to do it since a lot or half of the population in this world only have online sources to interact and meet people. However no one really wants to do or try to be cautious when talking to yes strangers online and you then be friend them just like that. Listen you truly and many people including my family even professional  therapists  told me you don't  truly know anyone online at all.  Society  puts it out there like its the ""  normal "" thing to do but really it's not. It takes years to truly know someone and trust someone online. A process I do is talk to them a long time do voice and video chat with them to prove they are who they say. 

 

Then if you both want meet each other irl and hang out, ect and know what they look like then I think thats alright. Not knowing what they look like or sound like. Them  giving you excuses of them not wanting to even just for a minute  to prove to you they are who they say is a major reg flag. Personally my opinion and what I learned the hard way you should reconsider  talking to them for safety. All this is the dark side of the internet people ignore and think it won't happen to them so be friend someone quickly, fall in love and date quickly and ect. People truly don't  get it can effect them badly as for me traumnically and pretty much ruin there lives if not careful as they know they should.

 

I could go on for hours of telling you all the red flags I know and think everyone  should to be careful of if meeting people or already been talking to them if there truly a legit person to you. Being 100% truthful to you about who they are and not lieing to you, messing with you with mind games, manipulating you to get something from you and so on. However for red flags I know would help people it  would take a long time so sadly I can't say it all to be more helpful in this this post, apologies. Since this is probably a long post already. However I think anyone reading this gets the idea of being safe online and what you should and shouldn't  do so none of these things happen to you.

 
I've  tried to help while being online more active at age fourteen to people sharing my story and trying to save them from my fate I had happen to me sadly.  Some listened to me took my advice and thanked me. While others didn't care and thought I was werid or wrong about the online world, since that what I said wasn't a big deal, true or could possibly happen to them. Putting themselves out there not caring  like everyone did to be "" normal "" ,  cool and accepted by society. 

 
All I said here is the truth as well my opinions we should all do or try and be more cautious when being online I suggest to help you be safe. I would be saddened if anything I went  through happened to anyone else. Lastly I like to say follow your intuition,  if you feel even the slightest off about a person, things don't  make sense or add up about them there a person you need to leave and not have in your life for your mental health and safety. It's your choice and life what you choose to do with it. All I ask is just be careful is all online. You can listen to me or not but it's what I learned over the years.


**Note: I hope this alright to post this and hope no one gets mad and debates with me on my post. I'm  just sharing my story and vewis on online safely and my opinions on how to make it safer. No one has to take my advice since its your choice and life afterall to do what you want."
1,"Yesterday was another trauma anniversary. I had made a post saying I was going to take a forum break so I don't lash out at anyone while symptomatic. I've decided that instead of running/hiding I would go with what I'm feeling and talk about it until it all passes.

Yesterday evening I started feeling super anxious and breathless. Like close to hyperventilating and I'm still feeling that way now. I'm going with it and consciously trying to keep my breathing at a slower level. Even doing that though, every breath I take I feel it catching right below my ribs.

I have a sickening feeling below my ribs where it's catching. That feeling of something really, really horrible is going to happen to me. Fear. Deep,deep terror.

I feel like I've done something very wrong. Like I'm waiting for severe consequences for something I've done  

I'm shaking uncontrollably. Even my shoulders are visibly shaking. All the shaking feels like it's moving inward inside my body,to that place below my ribs and collecting there.

I feel like crying. Or screaming. 

I am seeing flashing lights in my mind on and off,police car lights. 

Along with the shaking I'm shivering cold. Shaking from fear, shivering from the cold.

My right hand is hurting.

I just feel like I wish I would die rather than go through this.

I know all this is in my mind and will eventually pass. Hopefully it will pass soon."
1,"Are we all here for the same reasons. Bullying and abuse from our childhoods?

I’ve only just been diagnosed with PTSD. I had a screening for Dissociative identity disorder, but my symptoms pointed more towards PTSD. Since being diagnosed with this, I have done a lot of online research.

I even did one of those online tests and I got a score of 42 out of 50, which means I’m really struggling with PTSD."

I highly reccommend reading this post to get a better background of my culture.

 When I was a teenager, I read a newspaper article about a man who was abused by his abusive father. He was honored because he endured the abuse all his childhood and never called for help.

He says that's unconditional love. I say it's madness! My blood boils. He could've ran away. But he didn't.

I understand where that shit is coming from. You have to honor your parents in Korean societies. Since that man was Korean- American and US easily puts restraining order, they don't want to lost their family member.

If that shit is the case, flee! Run for your life. Do you want to be maimed for the rest of your life? Physically and emotionally scarred? But no. You have to suck it up. Fuck this.😡

But I guess same shit goes for me too, if my family member physically abuses me (they didn't). Just suck it up and keep your fucking mouth shut.

I got traumatized for reading that article and the memory haunts me right now.

I don't want to suck it up and endure the damn abuse. Hell, no! It's a dangerous thing to do. But wait... I have no fucking choice. If I don't, I might face persecution that is worse than abuse. Korean- Americans are more nationalistic and old- fashioned than the Native Koreans. If I EVER sued a family member for abuse, they might harass or physically harm me. Now, that might be not true, but I'm scared it might happen..."
1,"Hi all,

I was sectioned under the mental health act and spend 7 months in a psychiatric hospital.  It was very traumatic for me.  Staff restrained me multiple times, they broke my wrist, broke my collar bone and punched me in the face.  I'm suffering from really bad flashbacks to this experience.  I have 7 months of horrible memories of hospital and I;'m really struggling.  Feeling very suicidal."
1,"Hi all, I would be grateful for some insight into your personal experiences with regard to the efficacy of counselling/ therapy please.

Did you have Counselling and did it help you with your issues? What was involved in the sessions? I’m about to start receiving counselling/therapy and I don’t know what to expect. I need to manage my expectations about feeling better. I need to understand the possibilities and limitations of this type of treatment.

I had quite a difficult childhood/adolescence and I’m only now realising that what I went through may be causing the mental health issues like anxiety im experiencing today.

I’d really appreciate your input , thankyou."
1,"I recently lost my sister unexpectedly, and due to the circumstances of her death I have been diagnosed with PTSD. I have changed so much as a person, I dont even know myself anymore. Every night I have nightmares and wake up soaked in sweat, I barely sleep. My self esteem no longer exists and I'm afraid to leave my house. I don't want to be around my friends or family and have been completely isolating myself. I hate who I've become and I dont know how to change it. Any advice?"

music going for walks hot shower watching a movie don't work anymore at my wits end need sleep but can't smh 😞"
1,"It was exhausting to be honest. 2020 is coming to a close. Although 2020 wasn't difficult as 2019, it was draining.

The year started off great... until the middle of March when my mother relapsed. Her tone was off, and she became suspicious of me. I forced her to take her medication, but she was bitter and angry days later. She was having auditory hallucinations, and I had to struggle through school. I couldn't understand jack shit on the lessons, and didn't learn much.
Thankfully, the ordeal was shorter than last year. My mother was ill for seven months last year, but a small fraction of that this year. Last year was hell. My mother was more violent and no medications seemed to work on her. The doctors rejected her, and I had no money to institutionalize her. South Korea is poor in mental health and the government is reluctant to pay us off. And fuck yeah! US is worse off in terms of medical care. We couldn't afford a DAMN THING in getting us basic medical help. This why the hell we ended up in South Korea. We couldn't afford medical care, and Korea could provide us affordable medical health.

I told the same issue on Reddit, and a user was distraught over my issue. The user said:

""Wow... I genuinely could have written the first portion of this where you’re describing the afternoon depression that keeps creeping in earlier and earlier each day.

As for the rest of it... my friend, you’ve got so much on your plate. I wish I could hug you. Genuinely. I’m so sorry that you’ve got all this educational and familial pressure. I wish I had a solution. As for now, just know there’s someone over here in the US thinking of you. And hoping you can catch a break.""

No one has a solution because my issues are so severe. I've went down in the deep end.


Thankfully, she is much better because she is taking pills from a hospital that is known for its legendary status. Samsung Hospital (Yes, Samsung has a hospital in South Korea) is Korea's #1 treatment center. Finest professors treat the patients with excellence.

But I'm exhausted. So exhausted. Tried to fight off the depression that came after the chaos that lasted less than 3 months this year.

And 2019 was so traumatizing... I don't know how to deal with the trauma.

I get triggers and flashbacks. I feel sad."
1,"I feel like it's unfair that I got sexually and emotionally and physically assaulted and that I got bullied all through grade school, middle school and high school...and I no longer hate myself...I am just angry at those who let this happen to me...I guess it's progress? At least I no longer want to die, right?

I am trying to forgive the people who hurt me now. That's where I am at...I am doing this so I can move on with my life."
1,"I am sorry for gramma. English is not my first language. I was sexually abuse by my uncle when I was a kid plus I have  abandoned problems because my mother left us to USA when I was a kid and I didn’t see her for 10 years. We still had contact by phone. Anyway, I never told anyone about my uncle I just pushed it on the back on my head a pretender it never happened. Life went by and I end up coming to USA to visit my mother. I was supposed to stay with her for 9 months.  I felt in love and I never came back to my country. My now husband started to see a red flags in my behavior and he started asking questions and somehow he dig out what happened to me. After I told him I was never able to stop thinking about it it never wanna to go away like it did before. He advised me that I should tell someone else too so I told my Stepfather but all I heard from him is You can not tell you mother about this! I was devastated he just swiped it under the table! My husband finally convinced me to see a professional and I was going there every week since January and it really started helping me and I felt good. I learned that my mother is control freak and she want to control every aspect of my live by criticism me and molding me how she want. And with my therapist help I started finally standing back to her. Until about month ago my therapist said that she would like to meet my mum and learn her view. Why did she left me as a kid and maybe talk her into changing her behavior toward me. I was nervous becouse my mother is not a easy person to deal with, but my therapist promise me that she will not argue with her and she will not let her take control. I agreed to bring her in. Thinks went really bad. They end up arguing and on the end my therapist throws my mother out of office. I was a little disappointed in her becouse I thought she is professional and she will have experience dealing with difficult people. But I didn’t tell her that I just apologized about my mother and I said I will see her next week. She stopped  texting me or call me again or show up on sessions. And I don’t understand what happened. Her phone goes straight to voicemail. I gave her two weeks but still nothing. My husband tried to call from a different phone and he got signal with no answer. When I am calling from my phone I am getting only voicemail. Now is been over a month and I still didn’t hear anything. I feel like I lost my friend. Like another person in my life left me. I mad becouse she mad a mess in relationship between me and my mother and she left me with it by myself. I what’s worst about it I started taking that anger on the only person that really cares about me - my husband and I know that’s bad but I just can’t control myself sometimes. I don’t know what to do :("
1,"Has anyone been in a toxic relationship and it gave them ptsd?

My ex was a doctor, he represented authority to me and I put my trust in him, told him about my life and childhood. He'd be emotionally abusive and made me hold my breath constantly about whether or not he wanted to be with me / if I was good enough, yet would question my sanity if I wanted to leave. 

As a doctor he was quick to see who I was, what were my scars and how to use me.
He played his little mind games for a few years and when things ended, I found myself to have symptoms of withdrawal, feeling physically ill and very traumatized. 
I couldn't listen to the songs I or we listened to during the relationship, go back to certain places we went to together and to this day, certain behaviors and words really make me panic. I still relive some events, have plenty of thoughts and fear / anger.

I think what scares me the most to this day is that I didn't think a doctor could be so disturbed and twisted."
1,"So I don’t know if this belongs in the ptsd forum but I didn’t know where else to put it. So I have been told I have ptsd from a therapist but I don’t really know if I do. I don’t really feel like what happened was really that traumac. Like, sure it was upsetting, but whatever. So i was raised by my grandmother because my mother was a junkie and basically fried her brain. My aunt was in and out of my life since I was a baby. she and my grandmother don’t get along. They basically both say the other is a narcissist. i personally think they both are, but they both think they’re the victim of the other. The last time my aunt was in our lives they both used me to pretty much spy on the other. So I was trying to be loyal to both of them. At the same time I was being swayed to see things the way my aunt did. It eventually all blew up. My aunt who I thought had my back and loved me turned around and threw me to the wolf that is my grandmother. My grandmother is fine about half of the time but sometimes she’s cruel and confusing and hurtful. But she has a way of acting innocent. I’m an adult but I can’t afford to leave. So I feel trapped. Anyway, so my aunt left. Completely out of the picture. Once in a while will either send a hurtful message about me or a message trying to “expose” my grandmother. When I hear from her it’s very triggering and tonight she sent me a home video of when I was a kid. It just instantly made me sad. I played it over and over again. I don’t know, just seeing myself young and happy and oblivious to how I would end up. Just very saddening. I miss her and a my cousin so much, but I don’t trust her at all. I can hear her voice in the video talking about what I’m doing in the video and she sounds like she cares about me. But I know how she has hurt me. Theres no repairing what she or my grandmother has done. But I have to live with my grandmother. Also she seems to know when I’m at my lowest or most vulnerable. It’s like she has a sixth sense or something. 
 This is a lot, I know. Any advice or kind words would be appreciated."

I need a little help. I myself have depression and anxiety so I hope to find a home here but my motive is to help someone else. I have a dear friend suffering deeply from complex ptsd and needs some reassurance that she is not alone. She does not have familial support or much outside of a few close friends. She is finally in a loving caring relationship and I love her very much but it is not enough to heal years of abuse and pain from several deep losses. She is most recently suffering from the loss of her dog. He wasn't just her dog though. He was her son, her best friend of 10+years and the only one who really knew what she was going through. They are both survivors of years of physical and mental abuse and he was her saving grace and she was his. They made it out together. I would like to show this her at a later date (and encourage her to join as well) and show her that she is not alone. I can not erase what has happened or make the pain go away but I can steer her in a direction of healing because she is an awesome person and is worth it. If anyone finds any of this familiar and maybe show that healing is possible, may you please say hello. Thank you :)"
1,"So recently I've been having trouble with the fact that my PTSD, Anxiety and NEAD have been taking over, does anyone have any advice on coping mechanisims? and possible things which are good for escapisim? The world doesn't make any sense anymore."
1,"Hi so basically, I've never really talked about those events that lead to me developing PTSD, yet they involved a lot of people. I think its about time my stories were released into the world so here I am, telling my truth in an attempt to find a way through, or at the very least show someone else that they aren't alone.

pre warning- my memories are a bit fragmented.

When I was 10 years old, I was on a school trip. I was sitting at the font of the top deck, we were travelling down the road when suddenly a fire began to spread along the left side of the road, which was covered in a line of trees. As we travelled further up we saw that a car had crashed into a lorry and the lorry had set fire to a tree. One of the drivers had died at the scene, that was the first time I saw a body bag. The police helped our driver make a 3 point turn without backing into the fire...that was just foreshadowing.

A few months later, I was on a different school trip. It was january and snowing quite a bit. We were travelling to a historical place of interest and were basically in the middle of no-where, the only thing in sight was a roadside cafe. I was at the back of the top deck, the row in front of the row where the engine was. This time I sat with a friend who got travel sick, she had the window seat and I had the isle seat. Suddenly all the people behind us started standing up and smoke began to pour out from the wall. A teacher's assistant came upstairs to see what all the fuss was about and she shouted downstairs to the driver ""STOP YOUR COACH IS ON FIRE!"" She told us to stay in our seats. My friend was confused as she had been asleep and had only woken up when she heard the TA. I told her that the fire was right behind us and we were told to stay in our seats and cover our faces. I don't know how long it was until we got out. I was told to take my bag so that my friend didn't trip but I dropped it on the stairs. As soon as we left the bus, we were told to cross over to the side of the road...a fireman was kind enough to rescue my bag and my friend was hungry so I gave her my lunch....the next thing I remember is a bang as all the windows burst, I got separated from my friend and there was the sound of 60 people screaming. The driver was smoking a cigarette. Then there was fire engines and police and ambulances. So many people were screaming in agony, our lungs felt like they were burning from the inside, people were getting checked out by the ambulance crews for smoke inhalation. I couldn't calm down, I don't know all that much of what I did or how long it all went on for or even how I got back to where I'm from but I couldn't calm down and I was being shouted at. I had to go home with someone else whilst my parents came home from work, they thought I was over exaggerating until they saw the pictures. My mother knew that I had been diagnosed with PTSD after the event but she didn't tell me that that was what it was called until February this year.

Later, when I was 14, 6 of my classmates nearly died because of a rockslide whilst we were doing a watersports residential...

Finally, February this year. I was meeting up with a long-distance friend who I had met in person once and had become good friends with online. We had a great day and got to know eachother even better, even became closer as friends. We were walking down a side road on the way to the train station, where we were due to part ways when we saw a woman attempting to walk away from a man. He was really aggressive and sounded as if he was either on drugs or alchohol. We hid in the shadows. He grabbed the woman and pinned her against the wall...another passer by asked us if we had called the police, my friend told them that we were about to so she asked me as I had my phone out. But I couldn't move. I was completely frozen. All I could do was give her my phone and stutter that I couldn't make the call. She called police and they said they would be 5 mins. They weren't. They were too late, the man pulled the woman away and they still hadn't arrived. We debated about if we should wait but the other bystander said that they would and advised us to leave as it was getting late and dark. My friend and I parted at the train station due to the fact that we live in separate places. I had to travel home alone.

I hate how powerless I was the first time. I don't know if I can forgive myself for what happened the second time, I could have done something but I didn't. I shouldn't have frozen. Those people were screaming out in agony and I didn't know how to make it stop, I wish none of it had ever happened and I wish those people hadn't gotten hurt.

I don't know what happened to that woman, but I sincerely hope that someone helped her escape that situation.

I will forever be greatful that I was the only one out of those people on the coach during the fire to have developed PTSD, even though I hate living with it I'm glad that none of them have to suffer through it."
1,"In a nutshell, 3.5 years in a relationship with my partner. She is undergoing DBT at the moment for BPD. In 3.5 years I've been through isolation, manipulation, gaslighting, physical abuse and all sorts of other terrors. This has lead me to councelling, anti depressants and the diagnosis that I am now codependent on her. So now I'm the crazy one - or so she'd have me think.  

My partner is now 34 and desperate to have kids, before it's too late. She told me she was leaving me and we agreed to take a month apart. She has moved out. 

In this past month, she has been attending DBT and there is a noticeable change in her behaviour, and I have really been getting back to being myself and getting stronger, although I miss her greatly.

My psychologist has now diagnosed me with PTSD as a result of the relationship as I'm still experiencing the odd nightmare and exhibiting fearful behaviours. 

The problem is, it's just about decision time...do I commit to her and have a child? I really do love her and if this ""new"" her sticks, we'd have our happily ever after. Or do I just let her walk away. The thought of letting her go makes me feel empty and her being with someone else would be really upsetting.

Otherwise, I could be committing to a lifetime of abuse, if she goes back to her old ways. She really does not want to be like that and she is trying so hard, but I just can't stop thinking about all of the ""incidents""."
1,"Hi all,

So, my spouse has CPTSD, and has done for around five years.  The initial diagnosis determined that it was prompted by the medical trauma associated with the death at birth of our first child, and also some earlier traumatic experiences.  The episodes at first took the pattern of a breakdown triggered by something (not always easy to tell what).  She would fall to the ground, sometimes rolled up, and would be screaming or sobbing.  After the first time, and especially after the first few times, we figured out how to deal with it a little better, using various techniques to reduce the severity of the episodes.  

Since then, things have been a mixed bag, with some good times, and often periods of months without issues, and some very bad times, with breakdowns on all sides (I have suffered from depression, and we also have two children with special needs).  My spouse has a good therapist and has gotten good advice, and she hasn't had a serious episode of the initial type in years.  Still, she had trouble with sleeping - lots of nightmares - and stressful situations often bring out serious issues (almost every vacation is preceded by a near breakdown).

Now though, we have a new situation.  She feels very dissociated from myself and the kids (and the dog).  She feels like she's meant to be somewhere else, like that she's meant to be where we were 12-13 years ago, and that either she's switched place with the spouse who is meant to be here, so that her ""other"" life continues with her being replaced, or that she's simply travelled forward in time, with her life and loved ones from that time being left with her having disappeared.  

Now logically she knows that is not the case, but it's how she feels.  She feels very dissociated from us, and like we are basically strangers.  She talked to her therapist, and the therapist said it's cause she is burned out, and needs an escape - so her mind is basically seeking escape routes by dissociating and imagining this other option.  She said it was probably depression with psychotic features, and was somewhat related to the PTSD.  Her recommendation was to look into ways of getting a bit of a break from things, and that even researching options like that was helpful in terms of making the escape seem possible (I guess thinking it through). 

Now, she had a sort of a creeping flashback type of situation on Thursday night, and had a difficult time dealing with on Friday (but not all the way, like she was still seeing the kids as hers), then she went to sleep on Friday evening and slept through to the next morning.  I was hopeful that the next morning she'd have slept it off, but she was having a much harder time, and was texting me to say that she'd done this and that ""for your kids"", as though they weren't hers (I was at work).  She had to go lock herself in her room for most of the day.  Luckily she had an appointment set up for that evening with her therapist (pre-arranged), and after she talked it out with the therapist she seemed to be doing better.  She talked things out, and by late in the evening she seemed to be her usual self, and we were able to spend the evening together.  She was able to lie in the next day, and when she did get up seemed fine, was affectionate with the kids etc.  Then she had one or two moments of frustration, and had to take a break in the bedroom.  Following that, she quickly reverted to the same as the previous day.  

So the timeline was Thursday middle of the night - flashback, Friday daytime some feelings of exhaustion and frustration, slept a long time through to Saturday morning, then most of Saturday till she spoke to her therapist she felt dissociated.  Then from around mid-afternoon today has been dissociated again.

Does this sound recognizable to anyone?  Has anyone experienced similar issues, themselves, or with a family member?  Any advice on how to handle this?"
1,"Lately i have noticed my anger {i have bipolar? PTSD}is getting a little more on wedge "" i am yelling at my poor dogs and i scare them and i truly feel bad , i snap at my wife and she is getting sick of my ways she told me i walk around the house like a BEAR and snapping at the poor cat who freaks out when i yell "" i guess what i am trying to say is i am feeling the negative energy of the anger i'm feeling - my marriage is solid and its a happy marriagei want to get a handle on this before i loose it all.

Can anyone help or have any gentle suggestions, at this point want to have some kind ece of mind,  thank you and please stay safe."
1,"..then when I stopped drinking immediately without medical help, I slipped into psychosis, unbeknownst to me.  I would have rages beyond control and this lasted for 2 years until I was finally hospitalised.  Now, I still don't drink but I don't have much of a life left and I'm traumatised that I lost my home, my stability.  I am trying to piece my life back together, first by accepting that I got ill, the fact that I have to take medication, the fact that my immediate situation has no quick fix.  I could have/should have/would have gone into rehab had I known only drinking beer for cheer was not ""only drinking beer for cheer"" - I was not against the idea and I went to see a doctor at the time, as well as joining an infamous self-help group that I thought was officially helpful, as opposed to using the word ""God"" to be the answer to everything.  I had nothing against the word ""God"", or thinking laterally about healing but I really needed expert help.
I take Abilify now - has anybody else taken Abilify for PTSD and does it work long-term?"
1,"Hi! I'm sorry that it's not so detailed, I tried to get some important parts, but also tried to keep it relatively short. Please tell me if you want to know more details or something. :)

I had some stuff go down a few years ago regarding my mothers ex-girlfriend. 
She would scream at me in the middle of the night (over really small things like me not putting one plate in the dishwasher), accuse me of stealing in her home, read through my phone, kick me out, turn me into the police (for something I didn't do), call my friends and pretending she's me, mentally abuse me, etc etc. 
What I do most nowadays is tiptoe around my own house because I'm scared whatever I might do will cause a hysterical reaction and me being mentally abused as per usual.. 

A few weeks ago I experienced a similar situation with my dads girlfriend. We were all sitting down, eating dinner, and my dad jokingly said that I could live with them as long as I needed to. I thanked him and said that I'll consider it. my dads girlfriend told me that when my little bother is starting to grow up, I might need to move downstairs so that she and my dad could be upstairs close to my brother. I said of course, ""it doesn't matter to me"". We had a normal conversation after that, but after a few minutes she turned to me and said in a hostile tone that I was being arrogant. I said to her that of course I was going to move out someday, thinking that was what she was referring to. She said ""you know that's not what I'm talking about and you're being really selfish right now!"". I asked her calmly what was going on and I didn't know what I had done. She told me that I was being selfish and arrogant for not caring about what they wanted about the room. I explained to her that I was sorry she took it that way and didn't of course not mean it like that. She kept yelling at me, and I kept it together. It felt like I was being torn apart when she screamed and yelled at me for something so harmless as me offering to help when my brother grows up. At last she stopped and I took away my plate and went upstairs, I felt exhausted and cried myself to sleep that evening. 

Then a few weeks later, she started yelling at me for not saving enough money. I tried to tell her that I could possibly not save more than I earned, and that 60% of my earnings went into my savings account. But with covid-19 and me studying I only had about 3 months worth of a full pay, and the rest was 8000kr (about 800 US dollars) a month. 
I felt like my argument as to why I could not save that much a month was reasonable but she didn't. She kept yelling at me that I should just go out and get a full-time job. We had a long discussion and I really tried to keep it together but when I finally went to my room I cracked. It was horrendous. The first 20 minutes i scream-cried, and for the next hour i lied sniffling and semi-crying. I didn't move out of my bed that whole day and could definitely not go to the kitchen in case I met her. 

Nowadays I'm scared that I will get into another useless argument with her. 
Could my reaction to this be PTSD or is it just trauma catching up with me from my moms ex girlfriend? I know you're not doctors, but maybe someone has a similar experience and wants to share?"
1,"I have never been formally diagnosed with PTSD  but I believe I probably do have PTSD to some degree. I have discussed this event once in the 20 years since it happened- with my husband and afterwards told him I never wanted to talk about it again. It was deeply traumatizing to me and broke something inside me I can never fix. I guess I’m just seeking some perspective on how major what happened actually was because I’m still so affected by it to this day and it’s been even closer to the surface since I became a mother myself. I mean, have I made it out to be more than it is in my head? I remember every detail like it was yesterday. But I feel you don’t hear about this kind of thing very often in terms of people “speaking out” with their experiences.

***TRIGGER WARNING- description of event involving firearm**

My father is a classic narcissist- the kind who is well respected and successful. He was never really physically abusive, a few times I got spanked but nothing serious. Both parents were functioning alcoholics and home was like WW3 a lot of nights.

One night when I was about 12, a huge argument erupted that I was dragged into and he pulled out his firearm something he had never done before. Instead of trying to protect me, my mom ran off to hide and left me to get chased down by my huge father who pinned me to the wall by and pressed the weapon right between my eyes while screaming he was going to end it for all of us. In a pure act of instinct and the only possible thing I could do, I kneed him as hard as I could and I think he was so shocked it gave me a split second to run, grab the phone off the base (late 90s, no cell phones) and locked myself in the bathroom calling 911 while he tore the door off the hinges. I can still hear myself like an out of body experience telling that 911 operator “he has a firearm” and her asking “who ” before he got in and hung it up. I think at that point he realized the position he was in and I was in such shock that I did exactly what he said when the cops came. I lied and told them he was just cleaning his weapon and I got confused. Being Mr. Pillar of the community, he sweet talked his way out of being arrested, but got his firearm confiscated. And then, it was never spoken of again. I woke up the next day, got ready for school
and was expected to just go on as if it never happened.

I don’t know if he would have actually used the weapon in that moment of seeing red but I know that night ended my childhood. It ended my ability to ever trust anyone 100% again. I could never look at my mother the same because what woman would leave their own child to fend for themselves against a  grown man with a weapon? How could any police officer buy that bullshit story from a petrified little girl? I absolutely went off the rails and in the years that followed ended up in a slew of other bad situations that likely never would’ve happened had that incident never happened. Sometimes when my own husband and I have a disagreement, it’s like I travel back in time even though he’s a loving man who would never do something like that. I also have flashbacks whenever I see a news story about a family who was killed in a murder suicide knowing how close I came to that being me.

I have a few people close to me who know something happened to me but seem to assume it was a sexual trauma because I refuse to talk about it. While I’ve never lied and said that, I’ve also never really corrected the perception either. I’m afraid people wouldn’t get why it was so life altering for me because I didn’t actually get physically injured. Also the fact my father is still so well respected and loved by everybody.

Thanks for listening and your perspective."
1,"🗣Today I was thinking about my memory. Things I’ve experienced in life. One thing that sticks out for me is that I seem to have always gotten my way through kindness and being polite. The more I think about it the more I think I should’ve battled my inner demons better because now I feel this overwhelming feeling of guilt. The one thing that shows the same feelings of guilt which has been posted here a lot lately is pleasure.

 I think to categorize it into different kinds of guilt would be useless. And to categorize it into different feelings of guilt confuses me. I wish I didn’t take out such aggression on myself sometimes in times of struggle because then I wouldn’t feel so ashamed or guilty. Thanks for the read"
1,"Hello Everyone,
This might be a stupid question, but I feel like I have no right to call what I have a post traumatic stress disorder. Many people lose their loved ones and the grieving process is different for everyone, so why do I feel like this is more than just grieving?

Let me explain. I lost someone close to me not too long ago. He was my best friend and growing up we did everything together. During and even after college, we would go off together on weekend trips. We didn't live in the same town, so we didn't see each other as often as adults, but every time I was in town, we would hang out. To my family, it seemed like we were inseparable. He got me in ways others didn't and there was no topic off limits between us.We didn't always agree on things but it was never confrontational, just sharing of opinions. I never judged him and he never judged me.

During one of my visits, I had noticed he had lost considerable amount of weight and looked a bit gaunt and sallow. He said he had been sick, vomiting and unable to hold food down the last few weeks. Then during my visit, he went in to the emergency room because he had fainted at work. That was the start of a very difficult month before he passed. I won't get in to the specifics of his illness, but he became quite sick very quickly. He was diagnosed during that ER stay and we decided I would be his power of attorney to not complicate things. He was single without kids and only had his mom and siblings. We feared that his mom and sister would be unable to make the difficult decision and honor his wishes.

The month was filled with emergency visits followed by a few nights of ICU stays. I postponed the start of my new job in order to be there for him. I became his advocate, talking to the doctors, understanding his medications, advising him through the process. We talked about his illness, the prognosis, what to do if he and when he got more sick, who to share the information with. Every time he went in to the ER, I flew to see him and spent nights in the hospital with him until he was discharged. Then I stayed for a few more days until it seemed as though he was stable, then flew home. I would only stay home for a few days before having to fly back because he was back in the ER. This went on for a month before he went into a full coma and the prognosis wasn't good - his brain was swelling and would continue to do so until. He would most likely never regain consciousness and on the slim chance he did, he would not be the same. 

Based on our conversation prior to this, I knew what he wanted and made the decision to remove him from the ventilator. I sat with him until he passed away less than 12 hours later.

I have found it extremely difficult to concentrate and be motivated at work. I find myself wanting to stay in bed most mornings and feel angry and sad most days. 

Is this just normal grieving or PTSD? Is there a difference in how to cope if it is PTSD?"
1,"My PTSD has given me the terrible curse of hypersexuality. Anything even remotely related to my trauma or even menial things makes me aroused, 

I'm always aroused, things that shouldn't arouse me do, and I feel so guilty being with a man who is very...non-sexual. He's not asexual by any means but his sex drive is very low compared to mine, I feel like I burden him.

Many people tell me I'm too aggressive or open about my sexuality, I feel like I burden everyone around me, anyone else dealing with this I guess...under-spoken about side of sexual trauma? 😥"
1,"And what if I wasnt at abused and I'm making it up... I hate this feeling too beside the obsession. 

What I wanted to ask was.. 
Is it part of ptsd to think obsesivly about a person (and feel like can't get that person ""out of your head"") who was abusive for a long period of time and the abuse happend recently? 
Or is just another symptom of my ocd? 

Sorry if it doesn't make sense what I wrote."
1,"Hi! I am Alex and this is my first post.

My problems relate to intimacy relationships. I had 3 past relashionships and am cureently in the forth.
My issues start when I cannot deal with some situatiin. For instance, I cannot have an argument without feeling a lot of stress and chest pain. Also, if my girlfriend pushes a little to strong, I start having very unusualfeeling or reactions. For instance: at first, I feel that I am right to be upset, but after she does not serve me justice(like accepting that it’s her failt), I start to feel really really guilty and direct everything towards me. In that moment, I feel like I really want to die, to punish myself and I event hit me pretty hard. I expose all this things to her and she is supportive but she has her limits, past which she either gets angry or leaves me alone. She is really supportive with me a lot of the times also.
I finally went to a good therapist that understands me and was able to make sense of mu reactions. It appears that I have those feeling because I was neglected and had very bad relashionship examples when I was a kid. My mother always yelled at me and made me feel guilty. Often I cried my eyes out asking her to forgive me and she would not move a muscle to show me it’s OK. Now, it’s like the same applies with my intimate relashionships.
My therapist says she has to also make some changes, and I really think she wants to, but she also comes with her emotional baggage. And due to that she is really reluctant to go to therapy.
Right now, I am feeling very bad, I’ve hit muself and I feel to do it again. I am very stressed and lonely and I feel I don’t want to die anymore. Cannot do anything or talk to anybody due to fear and guilt. It seems the only thing I need is her affection, and now she is also exhausted and cannot do that for me.
Also, my therapist suggested sometimes that if she is not willing to do something for me, I should take the right decision and break it. But I love her like no other and I know she loves me back.

I just don’t know how to handle all this.."
1,"My girlfriend went through very bad childhood trauma which understandably she finds it very hard to talk about. Her family don’t really know much just the general of what happened because they went to the police. Her friends all know, she’s open about the fact it happened it’s just the details of it she won’t really tell anyone. She once told her ex girlfriend a bit but her reaction was terrible and I think that scared her off from wanting to open up again. 

the other night we went to her friends house and the topic was brought up, she’s only been friends with this person for two months but her daughter had a similar experience so I’m guesssing they all chatted about it  at some point when I wasn’t there. I’m really happy she was able to find that support but part of me is a little upset, I understand it’s her story and she will hopefully one day feel ready to talk about it but I kind of feel like I’m the only person who doesn’t really know anything. Everyone kind of knows bits and pieces but all I know is that she went through sexual abuse for a long time. I feel like a bad girlfriend because I don’t know anything and she just doesn’t talk to me. I’m also a bit upset that she was able to speak to other people and not me? I know it’s selfish and I’m sure it’s because they shared a similar experience but I just feel so shut out.

I just wondered if anyone who has kind of been through the same may understand her reasoning behind this? Or be able to explain things a bit more to me? I want to be the best girlfriend possible for her and help her as much as possible."
1,"Traumatic memories keep playing in my head and I realised I have more that I know. 
All I can do is cry and I want to die because I'm no longer healthy to move forward in life. 
Chronic insomnia is affecting more my brain. I have symptoms of dementia already from this stress and insomnia.
I don't even want to know how bad it is."
1,"Hello there.
 
Has anyone been through this and found a way to get past the gatekeepers?

  **** I dont need assessment for agoraphobia or ptsd because I already have diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum ****.
---------------
It's taken me around 4 years to get to speak to the correct team for diagnosis assessment (START team / nhs) in Lancs.
I've been told that I tick a good amount boxes for agoraphobia and cptsd by several GP's, several therapists (some of have refused to proceed with therapy because I need more intense therapy) AND the psychologist psychiatrist who assessed and diagnosed me with being on the autism spectrum.

My gp referred me for diagnosis (to the START team).
So the START/nhs team. 
I was first pre-assessment was with an admin/secretary of sorts.  I was told from the beginning of the call that ""diagnosis is a label"" and to just go to cbt (which is where i was sent from because of needing diagnosis and more intense treatment).
This call ended with being told I can re self refer at any time.

I asked to re-apply, self refer again and was told a manager would call me back.

Two weeks later I got a call from someone saying they had no idea why they were asked to call me.
I explained and was met with the same theres no point, you wont benefit blah blah.
This person isnt the dr and is not in a place to tell me not to bother seeking diagnosis.

While explaining the list of professionals who have told me that I need further help, I mentioned the psychologist psychiatrist who assessed me for autism spectrum.
The man on the phone asked ""did you get diagnosed"". 
Yes.
""And what help did that get you""?
Slight peace of mind but no treatment yes because I cant leave the house and havnt been able to communicate because of the suspected agoraphobia and cptsd.
He continues to try to convince me that I dont need diagnosis because it doesn't help.
I persevere and who knows what little info he took with him to put to the actual doctors to see if I can get assessment for diagnosis.

The following day I get an answer phone message from him, telling me that case will be closed as drs said that **** I dont need assessment for agoraphobia or ptsd because I already have diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum ****."
1,"As a child I had been criticized very harshly from both my parents, but especially my mother. Nowadays, every bit of criticism from people around me has the potential to throw me into another PTSD crisis, which entails endless days of obsessing over the words, feeling panicky, deserted and in existential agony, cannot sleep well, feeling unable to escape from negative thoughts, etc. 
Has anyone experienced such PTSD symptoms? I need your help and advice! Please."
1,"Is depakine good for ptsd? 
Olanzapine? 
Anxiolitics? 

I'm left with these meds cause they won't give me treatment for ptsd."
1,"What's the point in taking medication making you zombie and further more easily to be abused?
And for how long I will be good or pretend I'm fine and ignore abuse? 
I'm still surrounded by dangerous wild animals. 
What to espect next from them? 
Seems like almost all know here who I am and what they know about me are of course mostly lies. And I don't know many people. I have such a bad reputation because they associate me with some nasty members of my family. When they think you are scum they treat you like scum and I haven't done wrong to them. 
I don't know if what I wrote makes any sense. 
And I never interacted with them or their families friends etc but they can still judje me and mistreat me and abuse me. 
I don't feel anything anymore. Is not emotional void, more that that."
1,I had a mental breakdown because of my past this last Friday I got drunk something I don't do a lot of. And I was married and I was with the same woman for a long time she used to abuse me. So I've been dating this one girl for about a year. She's never once hit me I love her. I kept asking to quit getting hit over and over and that I was being abused I don't remember the night but she's never put her hands on me so I must have been talking about my ex-wife. I do have this problem when someone tries to touch my face and she noticed it long time ago I flinch and I'm used to someone hitting me I've been divorced since 2016. And I really don't know what to do. I really thought I found the one. She has been wonderful to me but she said if I do it once I'll do it again. And she's talking about the drinking. And everything else I guess she has her own pass and I've always looked past it because I thought that's what you're supposed to do when you're with someone. I was so scared that night when I was in the car and she was driving. But I'm not scared of her she's never done anything to hurt me. And I did not put my hands on her or anything. I do get angry sometimes and upset I'm not perfect. In the last year since we've been together she's got drunk once and I got drunk last Friday we've had a few drinks here and there but neither one of us has ever got drunk. My ex-wife about 2 weeks ago now did email me she told me I was worthless and that I was garbage and that I was a failure and I'm always going to be that. And quite a few other things. I don't know why I did what I did.
1,"So my father molested me and my sister. His father was awful towards him and beat him, therefore it makes it ok (?!?) to molest his daughters. Umm... I don't understand that, but I don't have an advanced degree. Anyway, my sister and I went on to marry and divorce abusive men. I have finally met a very wonderful man, who is totally understanding about it all it seems. But I still drink. I still have nightmares. What happens now?"
1,"Hi every one. I’m new here. The reason I sought out this forum is mainly because I’m desperate to tell my story just to stay sane. I’ve never had therapy before, at the moment Im on a long waiting list but I’m not sure if they will believe me as half the time I don’t believe what I feel myself. I‘ve been so anxious and hyper vigilant, I cant shake off the ever present sickening worry that some drama is just about to unfold. I suspect I grew up in a toxic family environment and probably a victim of long term childhood trauma. I’m not sure if my childhood experience qualifies as ‘trauma’ or ‘abuse’but im definitely traumatised and I feel so anxious. Basically I want to share my story with kind people if only for affirmation that I’m not absolutely mad in believing my current desperately anxious state of mind is linked to my childhood.
 
I did not grow up in the UK where I live now. I grew up in an environment where my father left to find a better job overseas (he never did) and we were left behind to fend for ourselves more or less. My mother was targeted and abused by her own narcissistic mother as a child and subsequently married my father who also came from a dysfunctional family that was often violent, verbally and emotionally abusive in the extreme. When my father abando us under the pretext of finding a better life for us, over the years she unravelled mentally and bordered on the unhinged. My life under her roof was a nightmare with few good parts. I have flashbacks when I question if all this ever happened. She had terrible tantrums where she would cry and bawl for hours. She had episodes that brought out all the pain she suffered over the years and I became the target so to speak. She was targeted by her mother with her older sister being the favourite, the pattern was repeated here. She had frightening turns where she expected me to grovel for hours for forgiveness mostly over nothing for example saying I did not want to visit a relative with her or did not want to go shopping with her right now or even choosing the ‘wrong’ seat if we ever dined out. Any perceived affront to her brought back all the rejection of her past and she was inconsolable and cruel. She hit out with whatever was in her hand and showed no mercy. She cried for hours and I had no escape from punishment until she calmed down. My life was hell. I walked on eggshells. These episodes were infrequent but regular and predictable. My sister had in her late teens somehow landed a job which brought in a good salary so she became someone my mother looked to as her salvation. This sister became her main focus and I became the scapegoat. In my mother’s eyes my sister could do no wrong especially when it came to her dealings with me. Knowing that my sister took advantage . Growing up we were never close and she was never nice to me and couldn’t care less if I was hurt or cried. All her callousness was overlooked though because I supposedly made things up and was lazy and rude while she was useful and could earn money. I never felt safe. Life was nothing but pain and counting the days till I left. My mother used all the money she got on her own needs and wants. I could at times borrow her clothes but nothing was ever bought for me. I had to pretend and manipulate in order to breathe. I hid from my sister who was domineering, loud and a bully if she saw me. She had an air of dominance and superiority which unfortunately my mother completely failed to check. She still can be a bully if I let her, especially if I was unfortunate enough to live within her power my life wouldn’t be worth living. I was in trouble with my mum if I didn’t show my sister meek compliance. Ironing her clothes, going with her if she demanded it etc. Protesting was useless, she was always found right by my mother which meant more abuse for me. I stopped complaining because I knew the outcome. To this day this hasn’t changed. My younger brother was my sister’s favourite who said yes to everything but later made excuses and was forgiven. I was more straight forward so very much the problem. I wanted equality and safety but made to feel more like the hunted, the prey. The feeling hasn’t left me, I’m seeking therapy. I still startle to find their phone messages waiting for me. Years ago I cried for months and years in secret and prayed to get out of this hell. I was a timid, kind, conscientious and respectful young person compromised by my circumstances. Please note I wasn’t able to leave home or work or be independent safely in that country any sooner. The abuse ended when I left the country in my early 20’s. Its been 15 years now. I have visited them and invited them over too . Things have vastly improved in that I live on a different continent and I have two beautiful children and a good husband. My mother and sister have probably long forgotten all this because it’s easy for them to forget but the undercurrent of their superiority remains. My mother’s narrative of my childhood is glowing full of all the ‘support’ I was given which I believe is a form of unintentional? gaslighting. I think I still live my mother and feel sorry for all that she went through. I still can’t express myself to them. They don’t believe I suffered at all, just that I am rude, selfish and ungrateful when they can’t control me over something. Numerous times in the recent past when I have tried to talk to her about how her unfair treatment of me with regard to my sister she doesn’t admit it at all. To add insult to injury at the end of the conversation she would always tell me to call my sister, ask her how she is, suck up to her, fear god and not be unkind to the poor child?!? My mother and sister are both controlling in their own way. I can talk carefully to my mother but in the end due perhaps to her dependence on my sister she will always side with her if put on the spot. I will be labelled selfish if I express any need, even today if I ask them say to alter their plans /visiting dates for example they will not be happy with me. My needs don’t matter. To them my needs are ‘selfish demands’. The only acceptable answer is ‘yes’. The outcome is I like to be alone. I don’t like them staying more than a few days.. I have developed a mistrust of people. I feel they will necessarily disrespect my boundaries. Maybe I still love them but I’m allergic to them as well. If I don’t comply with their demands they will withdraw their ‘love’. I must stay within reach, ready to be controlled if the need arises. I don’t know why I’m still so afraid of their anger and being unloved and forsaken. I don’t want to risk their goodwill but I don’t want to be walked over any more either. If I don’t text my sister back my mother sends me long voice messages that I’m not being a good person. My anxiety is tgat my sister will force a visit and act all close and become overbearing and I can’t seem to find any peace .  I know I need help or I’m going crazy. I’m sorry if all this doesn’t make any sense..."
1,"Hi all.

I got out of an abusive relationship three years ago. I am very much over her romantically, but occasionally think about her/worry about her. I also worry about hurting her feelings so I’ve never deleted her from social media/blocked her from anything and I am always willing to reply to her or say hi if I see her.

This is causing major tension and possibly breaking up my current relationshp. I’m very much in love with my current partner and I would hate for it to end over this.

I’m wondering if anyone can share experiences with not fully being able to let go of an abusive partner - maybe any articles or podcasts if they’re out there (I haven’t been able to find anything on this specifically)"
1,"Hi,
without going into too much detail, i was forced to take the morning after pill by the abuser, i obviously have pain from the assault itself but.. the manipulation surrounding the experience after is almost too much to bear.
Does any body else have experience of PTSD around events involving morning after pill? 
I don't know if this anxiety and self loathing is relating to pregnancy or because I didn't fight him. Thanks for your time in advance"
1,I suffered a severe nervous breakdown last year that turned into a psychosis (brought on by stress not drugs)... I was going through something very intense & couldn’t sleep for weeks because psychosis made me feel like I was dying... since then there have been strange & perplexing changes to my body that have not changed back.... one of them is that alcohol no longer affects me at all?? Previously I could have 2 drinks & feel tipsy - now it doesn’t affect me at all... have tried to drink and experiment with different quantities to no avail... it’s very perplexing... not to use as a crutch but to not be able to experience any effects at all is bizarre? Anyone had this happen to them?

1,"When I was living alone back in 2015, I had a break down of some kind and my family was there at the time, just my mom and dad. I was living in supported living, I have Asperger’s so it’s hard to process things properly but I had such a melt down, the police were called. Obviously I started to panic and I had no idea what to do. I wanted to run away and never come back, I wasn’t drunk, under any influence of drugs. 
so anyway, the police came and started talking to me, and I was adamant I was not going with them, they wanted to take me to the hospital so I could talk to someone. However at the time, I was terrified. 
so finally, and this is where it became hell. I was literally handcuffed and dragged out of there screaming for mom and dad to stop them but they didn’t listen and I was placed into the back of the car, I hadn’t committed any crime other than the fact I didn’t want to go with them. 
so I was taken to the police station and placed into an actual Cell, I was absolutely terrified and couldn’t believe this was happening to me because of my mental health, I hadn’t been screaming and making a noise, I wasn’t being violent. 
I remember being told to undress which I said no to obviously, and the lady officer said she would psychically make me change into these clothes. I was shocked and crying so I did it and was humiliated as I got changed. 
I was left in the cell all night. I had nothing but a small wash basin and a camera watching me all the time. 
I asked to speak to the doctor and he did come to see me but never come back with Any medication. I never saw him again. 
I was placed into that cell without being told why I was there. I am traumatised about it to this day and have never told anyone ab it because I was ashamed. They were cruel to me because I had a mental illness. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. And because I have autism, I still don’t understand why my family would allow something like that to happen, infront of them. My dad picked me up the next day and my mom said if that ever happened again I wouldn’t have a home, but I did not do anything wrong. I felt I was being punished for my mental illness. 
as I get older I wonder why this happened and just wonder if this has happened to anyone else. The police gave me no explanation on why they did it. 
I asked my mom a few months ago and said it had been for my own protection but that’s not protecting someone, that’s causing enormous stress and anxiety and physical pain Because they literally dragged me outside to the car and it was the most humiliating thing to go through.Sitting in that cell all night wandering why this happened to me."
1,"I remember when i first met my wife (about 12 yrs ago) and i was standing in my bedroom i started to hear voices calling my name "" Richard Richard Richard "" they were not telling me to do anything they were just calling my name and it completely  freaked me out and i was stuck standing there in my bedroom so afraid to move or talk , my wife was unsure what to do however at some point i ended up in the ER having having absolutely no clue how i got there ( my wife drove me ) all i remember is seeing a bunch of colors swirling around the room and like a little boy just so afraid , the Dr came in the room and asked me a bunch of questions ( am i suicidal or homicidal , do i feel safe ) he told me after doing a bunch of tests that my PTSD caused me to decompensate and lose touch with reality then he went into what kind of childhood did i have and that of course opened the flood gates to i was molested by my mother and foster father when i was 12.


My past doesn't own me like it used to but i damn sure will never forget how alone and afraid i felt in my childhood and how alone and afraid i felt as an adult, when i was having the ""episode"" of PTSD in my bedroom nothing that i could remember triggered me but not being able to sleep and up all night the night before i was manic (I'm bipolar) i spoke to my therapist about it and she said i could definitely be triggered by lack of  sleep as my brain cant handle going that long without sleep'

AnywayI'm no longer having flashbacks or am i triggered , thank you God , I'm in recovery for alcoholism ( over 8 yrs sober ) and being sober has been the best thing that has ever happened to me ( except my wife of course ) i try to live my life as best as i know how but my source of comfort and happiness is Lisa as she is so silly ( i need hat in my life ) :loveshower:and ALWAYS so positive( i also need positivity in my life as well ) anyway i never expected to go on for so long but i wanted to share a part of me that not a lot of people know yet comfortable enough to do this without feeling souncomfortable, thank you for taking the time in reading this i hope it can help someone because with people in my life i know it helped me."
1,"I was bullied very badly in high school. The whole school, including the teachers used to bully me. High school ended 10 years ago and I still have those awful memories. I saw the facebook of some of my bullies and I see their lives are amazing, they have money, friends, everything. Meanwhile I am dirt poor, jobless, living on less than 1$ a day. I am so angry at everything. I have ptsd due to people treating me worse than shit and it won't go away. I am pretty sure serial rapists and murderers aren't treated as bad as I was treated back in school.

My bullies continue to be ultra successful in life while I am becoming more of a loser each day. I wish there was some kind of justice system or karma for my bullies but there isn't. It's a messed up world where anything can happen. These people got away with torturing my mind for 5-6 years. What's the point of living like this? Why shouldn't I kill myself? I am tired of being bullied inside my mind 24/7, it's an endless mind torture."
1,"I've been struggling with anxiety, vivid dreams, and hypnagogic  hallucinations. I haven't felt right for months now. Some days are better than others. Can you get PTSD from years of stress over losing a business?"
1,"I picked this forum but not sure if it’s the right one. There should be an anger issues forum.

I don’t know why I get a feeling of anger but when I see an instance of a parent being kind or loving to their kids, it makes me angry. I physically feel a knot in my stomach. I hate that I feel this way. It’s probably jealousy more than anything.I see posts on social media where a parent is wishing their kid a happy birthday and doting on them and telling everyone how great they are. And I get this feeling of anger and I hate seeing it. I usually say shut up and scroll as fast as I can by it. I know feeling this way is bad. I would never say anything like that to anyone personally. But the thoughts are there nonetheless. How do I stop it? I wish i could get amnesia and just make it all go away."
2,"Hi guys! Do anyone stay on high alert so much, u end up getting headaches on/off throughout the day?"
2,"29 year old male.  I have never been diagnosed with CTPSD but I have read about it and can relate to much of it. I didn't want to write loads about my background, but anxiety, OCD, social anxiety, insomnia, and a fragmented identity have been central to my life.

Any ways, has anyone some friendships which 'don't feel right' and which only sustained themselves because you never had the confidence to move away from the friendship? This is one of my biggest roadblocks that I'm struggling to come to terms with.

2 examples.

Guy 1: Let's call him Andrew. Andrew and I were best friends in primary school, it became apparent to me throughout high school and early college years that Andrew and I were quite different. Different interests, different taste in things, different demeanour, different in many ways. In truth, I never felt excited about hanging out with him and I still don't. However Andrew also had a bit of a capricious personality for years, particularly when drunk, which made me scared of ever ignoring him or drifting away from the friendship incase he reacted badly. Co-dependency emerged, whereby I pretended to like him to avoid conflict. Andrew's capricious personality went away, he became more at ease with himself, and instead my co-dependency transformed into simply not wanting to hurt Andrew's feelings. In doing so I have hurt myself by not being happy. Andrew has asked me to be groomsman at his wedding next year, which doesn't feel right to me as I am not excited by our friendship at all, but it is what it is.

Group 1: This is a group of persons, not just one guy. They were my friends for a few years from the age of 22-26, partly because of confidence issues but also I guess I just didn't know many other people at the time. We did have some stuff in common, but music is very important to me and they were not on the same wavelenght as me when it came to music. At all. For example I never got the chance to go to music venues to see artists I liked, or go to bars and nightclubs I enjoy, because these guys were not into it and were in fact very narrow minded. And in general, I just didn't feel I clicked with them. For example there were groups or categories of people I would like and feel at home with, who they never felt at home with. It never felt right to me, but it just happened that it was the group of people I lived with at the time and was around with at the time. I guess the inability to drift away from this group was partly because of confidence issues, but maybe also just the reality I didn't have any other friends at the time.

Thankfully at the age of 26 I moved to another city which had the exact music scene I wanted, and met loads of new people who were defo more 'up my street'. From 26 and half, to 28 I had an absolute blast and made up for those lost years. Corona obviously came then, but at that point I actually felt burnt out from all the socializing and partying.

However even though I had a great time the past few years, the past was hanging over. Why was I still friends with Andrew even though I felt no connection? Furthermore, despite the present being great, I still had so many regrets for the years I wasted with 'group 1'. People would ask me about different experiences about clubbing and music, and it felt like an empty hole was missing. Also I'm still in a Whatsapp group with Group 1, which means it's hard to escape from them.

My friends over the years should have been people like me - into music, politics, small interest in sport, and generally chilled. I had some of them over the years, but the majority were not and I never really clicked with them. Thankfully my friends in my new city are on the same wavelenght and I was at least able to enjoy my mid-late 20's.

Summary - Some of my closest friendships to me don't feel 'right' at all and only came about due to lack of confidence and co-dependency. I have no way of escaping this, as is the case with the wedding next year. It doesn't feel right at all, my identity with these people doesn't feel right at all, and I don't know how to deal with it. It actually causes me severe anguish and frustration, I sometimes feel like physically hurting these people who are supposed to be my friends. Part of me just feels like being absolutely direct with them and ending these friendships, but that's just gonna result in hurt and pain - particularly for Andrew when I have his wedding to go to next year."
2,"Hi, does anyone here have any physical effects from cptsd, I have many..I learned about them on the website ptsduk... I'm looking for anyone that knows about or has experience of this...I'm very physically weak, physically ageing quite fast ..  peace...."
2,"I've been going through a shit ton of trauma lately. I posted recently and I'm trying to figure out if I have psychotic disorder or not. I was in grad school and I had to drop out. I noticed that my language is all messed up now. I remembered trauma from a very young age. My teachers said I learned to write weird. I always had trouble with my left and my right, with distinguishing v's and z's...... but other than I've always been really smart and have a great vocabulary. Now I get letters and words messed up all the time. My mind moves really fast too. I think that has to do with it as well. Any thoughts?"
2,Hey y'all. I have c-PTSD and a never ending amount of trauma. I was recently diagnosed with Graves Disease as well which is not under control in the slightest. I've been experiencing some audio/visual hallucinations I think.... they're more like distortions. I can recognize that they're not real. I'm just really scared it may be something else. Part of my story is a very deep and significant history of traumatization in Mental Health settings so I have a lot of internalized stigma. Has anyone else experienced hallucinations with this disorder?
2,"I started a new job as a lab technician on Tuesday. On Friday morning I walked out of the lab because I had a sudden panic attack. I drove home and emailed my boss to say that I quit.

I feel short of breath and overwhelmed constantly. Financially and professionally this is taking a toll.

If I weren't living with my mother I would be completely screwed. 

I'm completely incapacitated by my trauma right now. The people in my life don't understand and it makes me feel so alone.

Can anyone relate?"
2,"I have Complex PTSD, so I've learned to wait till the very depressed times or those of high anxiety (or aggression) to pass. Sometimes the emotions are relived (flashbacks but emotions only), so they have nothing to do with the present moment, while at other times the emotions are from present circumstances.

Lately, I've been feeling, I guess a meta depression, where I'm depressed from reliving depressed emotions, and just the overall process of waiting for these times to just pass. I'm also feeling very isolated as most people simply do not relate or understand the added layers of complexity.

It feels like another level to what is a rather hellish situation, and I won't lie, I think about my own death a lot these days. Nothing definitive in regards to suicide, I make sure anything I could use is locked away, and generally ensure there's enough impediments in place to discourage impulsivity.

But the thoughts are distressing, and at times, tempting. What they aren't is comforting. I'm reminded constantly of how isolated I feel.

People in my life who mean well feel distant and self-absorbed. Every nuance in behavior of others is analyzed and found calloused, thoughtless, and motives questioned.

I know it's the PTSD that fuels all of this, but it's so difficult not to be swayed by such convincing inner monologue when it's just you, alone with these thoughts.

Every misunderstanding from friends, family, or a significant other pierces so directly to the heart, even though I know that's not their intent. Every attempt to explain how I feel and why is reflected back distorted as those closest to me try to understand. Their frustration, and at times, anger just hurts me more. Thoughts ever so cruelly snatch at these experiences as though to prove, ' See, they don't know you, and they never will. They will be at your funeral mourning a person who was never you.'

In either case, thanks for providing a forum where I can voice my thoughts."
2,"I've not been around here for a while. Lots has changed for good. But I'm suddenly just. so. sad. And helpless feeling.

It's the worst. Some of it is because I'm not externalising negative feelings onto anyone else anymore so am having to sit with them.

Some of it is because /big changes in my life/

Trying hard not to believe that some of it is a punishment for trying to do things which make me happy and fulfilled. But that way of thinking sure feels attractive.

This isn't a question. Just a vent."
2,"I am feeling ashamed and humiliated by the flashbacks and nightmares I am having at the moment. I physically feel the implements that were put into my body and other physical pain. I don’t know how to deal with this. I feel like a freak. I just need to know if anyone else has experienced this and how they handle it. I am also wetting myself a lot whenever I have a flashback or a nightmare. I’m sorry, I don’t mean to trigger anyone, but I really feel lost with this. I’m sorry."
2,"I wanted a centralized thread for everyone to discuss the process as they get down to business.

Feel free to share stories of treatments and the process, results, etc., advice for specific situations, rankings of various activities and treatments.

Good luck on your journeys!"
2,I have suffered from PTSD for many years now. But I  still realy struggle to manage it and the triggers...mood swings...hopelessness of it all. A lot of times I just wish I could die as I just feel mentally and emotionally tortured inside. Don't know Me anymore. Can't seem to find a way out of it. So exhausted going round and round trying to find help with it.  Pretty alone in world. Can't function well enough to keep relationship with anyone going as too much pressure on my head. In fact I can't seem to handle any pressure at all..even the tiniest amount. Does anyone else suffer this? My mood is one extreme to another. Unstable and tired. What actual help/ therapy is there available for this? It ok to be told that is what I suffer by a doctor but what's the solution? Desperate here. Realy am. Please any advice?
2,"Hello.

I feel drained. I've been dealing with too much in the last decade, my faith in humanity is rather low, except for my significant other, they bring light into my life... I'm overwhelmed and in physical and emotional pain almost on a daily basis, but I truly want to get better... I don't want to get too much into this now, I just want to write it here to be taken into account...

This afternoon I had a fight with my significant other, because I felt left out and neglected by them. We always eat together, we have a schedule for that. It was time to eat, I was hungry, but they still wanted to work and finish something. I understood this, and I told them to please let me know when they were ready, they agreed to text/call me as soon as they were ready. But they made me wait extra, they decided to take their time and go prepare a drink and didn't even tell me because they felt like it and thought ""it was faster and more practical this way since they were almost done with what they had to do anyway."" I ended up waiting for an hour but it felt like much longer, especially when I found out why they had taken longer.

It triggered a hurricane of emotions in me, and those emotions turned into a barrage of questions that I poured on them (things like, ""do you not love me enough to at least let me know or wait to have a drink with me during the meal since you were going to finish soon anyway? Do you not care enough about me to be considerate of the fact that I'm hungry and have been waiting for you?""). And the less they were able to answer, the more unloved and desperate I felt, the more I yearned for them to apologize and be kind and gentle and loving towards me, but they were getting (understandably...) defensive instead... I just wish they had been reassuring and protective even, as soon as I'm shown love it's easier for me to snap out of this state. But I can't depend on that, and today was the proof, it escalated so much... I wanted it to stop, I almost break up with them. I wanted to disappear.

I know that what they did wasn't alright, but it wasn't as terrible as it felt (life or death almost)... I wish I could have stopped the storm of emotions and told them in a more assertive and calm way, I know they would have understood. They can't possibly be always loving towards me, no matter what... I know it's unrealistic of me to want this so desperately... they're human, they get tired too, they can't be emotionally available 24/7.

I feel extremely guilty and ashamed because I just can't seem to stop it. With the situation getting harder for me in the last few years (long story), I've become so much more sensitive, anxious, tense, hypervigilant, needy, etc... I'm tired of how much this hurts us emotionally and mentally... I feel like a burden, like they'd be better if I wasn't around... but in truth, if I disappeared, that would harm them so much more... and I do want to have a happy, peaceful, and healthy future with them...

How can I protect my significant other and myself from this? How can I stop it from spiraling out of control? Especially when they're unable to calm themselves down too, it triggers me so much more when they get angry/defensive...

I already meditate on a daily basis and take care of myself in other ways, I need to know if someone knows a way to stop it before it happens or while it's happening... I'm aware and reasonable when regulated, but when I get triggered like this I'm not, I have all kinds of pessimistic, angry and depressing thoughts about everything... they spiral so fast and hurt like Hell.

Thank you for reading me..."
2,"Over the last two years, I have experienced extreme distress over certain thoughts and experiences that I would have. It’s possible that I have always felt this sense of discomfort and distress, but I didn’t start getting a more amplified negative physical and emotionally reaction to these thoughts and experienced until recently.  

Thoughts/experiences that trigger me:

Feeling uncomfortable and anxious when people are unresponsive (e.g., not giving me eye contact; not being genuine when talking to me; their body language is closed off and not open to me; not being emotionally attuned). Then my body begins to shut down and I get into a “freeze” response. I can’t exactly escape the situation but I can’t fight it with either. 
When I am constantly questioning my sexuality. There are moments when I don’t question it and I feel better, but the moment sexuality shows up in my thoughts again (and I can’t seem to stop thinking about it), I start getting distressed as well as getting into this intense state of fear - that I’m not who I thought I was. I begin to feel afraid that I am actually asexual. I think this is attributed to my fear of lack of control. 
When people try to get to close too me, or the opposite - they avoid me. Although I crave being close to others I also have a desire to avoid people at the same time. I suffer from chronic loneliness too. 
When people question my choices and who I am (a lot of the centered around my sexuality), I get extremely distressed, insecure, and there is a feeling of humiliation in the mix

These are among the biggest that seem to be triggering for me. I am not sure if they can be attributed to c-ptsd. I went through a lot bullying and emotional neglect as a child. I’m not sure why the topic of a lot of these triggers are about my sexual orientation, but I’m hoping I can get some non-professional advice from this forum."
2,"I'm terrible at telling my story and I don't even know if I belong here, but something inside is telling me to write on here so here goes... ***TRIGGER WARNING - discussion of emotional neglect and abuse.

I am a 27 y.o. female, and for all of my life I have always had an anxious disposition. As a child, I never felt close to anyone in my family (except for my mother but we have a codependent relationship which I just realized recently). I didn't notice until the last few years or so that I don't have the relationship with my father that my friends have with theirs. He is emotionally distant, neglectful, and sometimes emotionally abusive, especially towards my mother. She once told me recently that he's pretty much a sociopath. No empathy. No emotional capacity whatsoever. He has always been this way, but I never realized any of this.. that I actually was emotionally neglected and abused throughout my childhood.

My father never once made an effort to get to know me or understand who I am, nor would he ever notice if I had a problem going on in my life. Any emotions I would express around him he would either dismiss them completely or tell me that they weren't real. ""You don't really feel that way."" ""You don't mean it."" He would never keep any eye contact with me, as if I do not even exist or am worth talking to. After everything that has happened with the pandemic, my father not once checked in with me (I unfortunately have been living with him). Every time I am with him, I feel even lonelier then when I am actually alone.

I had a cat recently who had attacked me, and when my father came home and I told him what had happened, showing him my bloody arms and legs (it a was horrible attack. I don't want to get into detail.) clearly in pain, but he didn't feel sorry for me. No emotions to be detected. He just looked at me and gave me an awkward smirk. Didn't want to take me to get cared for or didn't bother to try to do it himself. He just went back to business as usual, reading the newspaper and watching tv. I had to drive myself to the fucking urgent care with my bleeding arms and legs to get a shot and an expensive medical bill. I was there alone. That felt like a turning point for me.

I stopped bothering to talk to him because anytime I ever tried to connect, he wouldn't follow through. I sometimes feel guilty for not giving him my own attention. But why is it up to the child to pick up the pieces? To this day, he is unwilling to have a relationship with me. Every time I am around him I feel unloved but at the same time, I want to avoid him like the plague. He never makes the effort to tell me he loves me. He doesn't feel like my dad. He's just a person that I live with. I honestly probably won't be that sad when he finally passes.

As an adult, I feel that I have exhibited many symptoms that could be related to C-PTSD. I feel that I have severe abandonment issues - more like a fear of rejection. At the same time, I avoid close relationships. Ironically, I have never had a serious relationship before so it's like, ""how could you know what abandonment feels like if you had never been in a situation where abandonment was possible?"" Maybe it has to do with my father? I would hear stories of women who constantly seek male approval in toxic relationships, but that has never been me at all. I avoid everyone. So the ""clinging to relationships"" box is not checked off in my case.

I experienced a lot of bullying in high school too. I have major trust issues and struggle to connect with others. I am unable to open myself emotionally. I'm such a people pleaser and perfectionist, I would put people's needs often before my own. Assuming everything is my fault? Check. I am hyper-vigilent in my surroundings and struggle with anxiety, depression, and identity issues (centered around my sexual identity). I am always jumpy when people get too close to me, and I would constantly hear other people asking me why I am I so nervous and anxious all the time. I go emotionally numb when conflicts arise and cannot function almost. My body just shuts down. I often have feelings of shame and guilt. I went to see a psychiatrist for an anxiety diagnosis but she could not find a proper diagnosis that fits so I was diagnosed with ""unspecified anxiety."" Obviously I was not happy about this.

All I know right now is that I have anxiety and depression... but I have a feeling there is trauma there in the mix. Possibly OCD too. I know that emotional neglect is not the same as sexual or physical abuse, but I feel that I am experiencing similar PTSD symptoms. I just know something is not right with me."
2,"I’m worried this is my new normal. I feel changed and different. I’ve been trying to get back to myself but I don’t know if I can. Because that person pushed so much down and didn’t notice certain things. But now I notice them and I’m not okay with them, I’m not okay with so many things about this world. My perspective has changed in a lot of ways. What if I’ll never feel at ease again? What if I’m always going to have to push so hard every day to be okay? What if I’m never going to get my libido back? What if I’m going to be so overwhelmed for the rest of my life that I won’t be able to participate in life? My brain is overloaded, I can’t think. I can’t make conversation very well. Not that I could well before, but it feels a lot worse. Everything feels a lot worse. I’m worried it’s going to be like this for the rest of my life. I’m crying most days. I’ve been struggling to eat for months. I feel like I’m drowning in a drowning world that’s trying not to drown, but...every faucet is always on. I’ve tried the positivity. It saved my life once. But I can’t fake that stuff anymore. I can’t push anything more down."
2,"I’m thinking back to feelings of being unwanted. I have to give myself reality checks. I hate this part of mental illness. Sometimes it takes a lot for me to reach out to a friend, let alone ask them to hang out. I did that tonight, but the question (mentioned in the second half of the text) wasn’t addressed. Only the first half of the text message was. It made me think back to how many times I’ve put myself out there to do something scary and I get shot down somehow, or there was some weird obstacle, mistake, or fumble in the way. Even if it’s just in my head. Which may be the case because maybe she just didn’t finish reading the whole thing, which might’ve been done in a hurry. She was with another friend at the time, I know that. This person has done nothing to make me think she doesn’t want me as a friend to hang out with and get closer to. I feel so stuck. I don’t know how to respond. Do I say, “Hey, did you finish reading my text?” How do you even do that without making it awkward? I agonize over this shit. I’m so tired of it. I feel trapped. All these subtle difficulties in communication kill me. I keep trembling."
2,"Tonight..I realized that I am a survivor of childhood sexual, physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. I acknowledged my emotional and psychological abuse since I started therapy and treatment at 17. I usually told people I had trauma from bullying in school and mentioned only in initial sessions that I was abused early in by a babysitter..and briefly mentioning the covert abuse from my father. After four years in recovery so far, I accepted that more than that has happened especially with the abuse from my family finally ending when I escaped the house in October 10th. I am finding a therapist and other ways to truly heal. I have other ways I will..and I want to utilize in more resources. I am however afraid to tell someone the full truth..so what has anyone here done when scared to admit the severity of prolonged trauma to a therapist or an kind of social service assistance? I am from the US by the way."
2,"Hello,

I apologize for using SOS in the title of the post but I am really disturbed by what I am feeling.
The problem is that I was bullied for a very long time and when I finally stopped I became hypervigilant about anyone using that particular word for bullying me. The word used to bully me was the N-word.

Now many years later I am still hyper vigilant regarding that word but now I am worrying that what if I get triggered by even the first letter of that word (the word was the N-word and the letter is N) and now I am noticing the letter “N” everywhere.

I am hypervigilant regarding the existing triggers and I really don’t want more to add to the list.


It is like my sensitivity is decreasing and the triggers are increasing.

What is the problem which I am facing and how to stop more triggers from being added?


Pls help!

By being severely hurt by people in so many ways as well traumatic situations sadly as well happening to me. I finally know what I have and it's  C-PTSD and I fully accept I have it.  I have now in my life a truly wonderful therapist who specializes in that field ( After half my life of searching for professional  help ) who is helping so much as I make truly unbelievable tremendous progress with her every time I see her. She helped get my mother and sister on board on so many ways they could also help me and better support me even more as well in my healing journey.

Since sadly they never understood or get for years my pain and suffering I was going though thus we then argued about it all the time, it strainly my relationshipwith them severely. It also making my relationship with them really not great nor healthy for my healing journey, so years they never could truly fully help me  get better with my mental health and my now C-PTSD. However  this year now after my wonderfully and also  totally awesome  help from my therapist by speaking to them both explaining  all I went through to make sense to them my struggle. Our now relationships between  all three of us is so much stronger  and extremely better between all of us.

 Truly all thanks to my therapist by speaking to them about what I've go through  and struggled with for years, they finally get and understand me better for the first time. My relationship with my mother and sister who help me out so much in my life in so many was, I'd be truly lost with out them and the help and the support they give me even before finding my therapist best they could. They are both truly my rocks, very best friends and my sister even being a 2nd mother to me. They finally understand me truly more and are helping me so much best they can to also heal my trauma and helping me learn to let go, forgive and focus on the present. Never to dweal or letting my past that hurt me so much my whole anymore. Now I'm extremely thriving overcoming my C-PTSD not letting it defined me anymore, so it doesn't effect me anymore and run my life.

 That I can finally find my true peace as well  happiness in my life again or even for the very first time. I wrote about what I've been through a bit on here already my story. I wanted to share my thoughts on this and how I won't let my C-PTSD win anymore and effect me as well. It's going be still very tough and I will have off not good days as well still. However I know I can and will overcome this. Also hopefully anyone who else suffers with this as well can too heal and become healthier,  stronger and find peace in their lives. It might take  for you as me still time but it can be done and you can live better and love yourself fully  and enjoy your life."

I feel a lot of guilt and shame for my past actions
 Does it ever go away? Do the guilt and shame ever go?

2,"Hello my fellow traumatics. Wanna get angry? Wanna get REAL ANGRY?! This is a war that we are fighting and its time to start winning. Our care systems failed us and Its time to start making some noise about our backup systems that failed us. You suffered and that's wrong. But we can end suffering here. We know those warning signs. Chances are you wanted to work in care and got put off because you couldn't handle your own emotions. This. ends. here!

SHOUT

USE. YOUR. VOICE

We survived. we'eve adapted. but now, we overcome.
We are survivors! through all life had thrown at us we didn't back down! We won. We can now ask for proper help. But there are people out there like us that still think that what they experienced is the norm. We need to help them before they become like us. I never want any child to experience the pain I did.

Psychology has come a long way, but it still has a lot more to go. It's about time that we bring everyone else up to speed..

I'm using the energy I had to use to protect myself to now help protect others.

If you were failed by ""care"" systems then speak out against them. Don't let others fall prey to them.

I'm writing up a complaint about my mother's facility and my school as we speak.

I was put in the care of the crisis team. I needed help and reached out and no one reached back! I was told to go to the GP and get my medication increased to deal with what seemed to be anxiety and depression, to which I've recently on just found that my actual condition is CPTSD.

I feel angry and disgusted at the level of care that I received during the course of my childhood. I talked to teachers who told me to speak with another CHILD because her brother had autism. HER BROTHER!... not her PRIMARY CAREGIVER. I had no help and no one got social services involved. I was a CHILD on my own left with a STRANGER whilst my mother was receiving mental health care and institutionalised for trying to kill/hurt herself. This system left me in the care of a STRANGER. I have been living my entire life thinking something was wrong with me, when instead the NHS failed me.

My mother was treated and even though now that she has left, she is receiving no social support work even though she is a constant risk to herself/ and possibly others.

As far as I'm concerned my ABUSE and NEGLECT stops here. I need help and currently, my only available help is the same people who failed my mother.

STEP UP! or I'm going to be making some noise.


Also here's a little picture I draw to commiserate my journey to getting better :3"
2,"I am trying everything within me to not lose it and self-harm as well as make this week my last week. I feel like after six attempts, working towards freedom, accept myself, going no contact with toxic people, trying to accept that I need help, and lifestyle changes..I honestly feel like I have no choice but to die. I am a citizen with missing documents, abusive parents, and very little support. I listen to so many stories of success and see many that get justice. I see great things happening to other people. I have a glimpse of that and that it gets taken away. I tried to go to the law and DSS..none of them took this seriously. I am afraid to be on the phone now because I am afraid that I will be judged. I am already ashamed to be alive. I have been discarded even by those who treated me. I had to go out of my home state to receive help. My father won't stop trying to hoover and keep my social security card. I have no proof of much abuse because my sister was the center of attention. I experienced trauma symptoms since I was 3. My parents even lied when I spoke my first words. I remember my first abusive babysitter..I never asked for much in my life. I haven't even got new clothes officially since I was 15. I tried cleaning so much and no one tried to help me. Until my school got involved, my mom took slow time to get help even confiding having suicidal ideation. I feel like no one wanted me to live and when they heard I wanted to die, they told me what I wanted to hear for their benefit. Yet.. I feel like the world isn't for me despite how much I love life. I just feel officially I don't deserve it. Life is only for a certain type of people. Even if after being honest, hard-working, and humble or confident or happy or sad or logical..no one gives a fuck. All because people who abused me the most are the most ""charismatic"". I really feel like I talked myself off the ledge..for nothing. My family doesn't even truly care if I suffer."
2,"Is anyone else always constantly overwhelmed? Even when I’ve got not much going on, I still get overwhelmed. There is pressure coming from all sides. I’m having a hard time accepting that this is the way life is. There is so much pressure to be responsible and being responsible for anything gives me anxiety. How am I supposed to have a career and help people when I haven’t even figured out how to be at ease? I’m trying positive self-talk, I’m in therapy, I try to validate my own feelings...It’s like I’m in a constant state of overwhelm. I just want to feel like I’m good. Like I’m okay and aren’t constantly doing something wrong. I want to have confidence in my capabilities. Right now I don’t and it’s terrifying me because I have to get a job. It’s been months since I’ve worked. But I have to now. And I’m so scared that I won’t be capable. I don’t have confidence in the way my brain works. When I get anxious around people, I get a freeze response and my brain sometimes goes blank. I can’t think and I don’t have much to say. 
Good lord. There’s a lot I’m worried about. All the time. Any tips to help with constant overwhelm, the freeze/fawn response, and deep insecurity about my own mental structures? And deep insecurity about friendships..ugh. I wish I felt like I had more control over my life and myself."

2,"Hi Everyone

I've recently come to realise that I have cPTSD. The trauma comes from years of bullying at secondary school as well as a very critical father.

I regularly experience emotional flashbacks, crushing toxic shame, a vicious inner critic, depression and social anxiety. The fight/flight response is activated during an emotional flashback and when this happens I always freeze. If it is an intense emotional flashback then the sympathetic nervous system becomes hyperaroused which often leads to sweating and occasionally facial blushing.

The flashbacks range in intensity but are often stimulated in situations where I'm with strangers, especially white people since it was white people who traumatised me.

I'd like to know if anyone has experienced something similar and what the possible treatments are.

I've tried the following;

CBT - Didn't work
MDMA - It helped me to access those traumatic memories so now I'm able to talk about it openly with people without becoming too upset
Meditation - It helps to ground me

Has anyone tried something else that has helped to cure them?"
2,"I am a survivor of sustained emotional abuse from early childhood. I've separated from family because of it but with significant health issues. Trying to get a diagnosis to account for my symptoms has been difficult. But C-PTSD describes me perfectly. I have asked that to be considered and have been told it is not a legitimate diagnosis unlike a personally disorder that they are pushing which I do not match the criteria for - in at least one very  significant category.

What did the psychiatrist mean when saying C-PTSD isn't a diagnosis?"
2,"I've been reading this book and have now finished part one, Overview. @AliceinWonderland is also reading and I wanted to set up this thread. Anyone else who is familiar with the book or who has questions is welcome to post.

The book is really well written, each idea presented in a small chunk. I also love the non-clinical language. It feels so validating. 

I'm already finding the ideas incredibly helpful. Too much to break down now but it really is helping with my recent efforts to stop seeing myself as intrinsically defective. 

The emotional flashbacks section was really well put, first time I have understood the concept. This understanding was followed by ""Ah! So that is what is going on with me!""

The book is also helping me to begin to feel... (whisper it) as if I maybe starting to like myself a little!? :sorcerer: It has also introduced me to my new favourite word, 'parentdectomy' :D"

2,"I try my best to be myself, but for some reason I just can’t seem to do it. I say things I don’t mean, I behave in ways I don’t recognize, I say things I end up disagreeing with (things that make me cringe), and I freeze/fawn around people. I feel like I’m pushing my friends away, but I’m also prone to painful over-analyzation and self-reflection. Myself, other people, the world...nothing ever seems certain. Nothing seems for sure and solid. Clear. I just wish I knew what was real and true. I wish I could start over. Does anyone feel like this? I would really like to know. I’ve been trying to stick with meditation, I’m on meds now, I have a bit more structure in my life, I keep a bullet journal to stay on track, I’m in therapy, I have a coping toolbox. I’m making a bunch of effort to help myself get better so that I can not only feel confident and free, but also so I can love others better.

2,"This is an odd one. I'm currently (finally) having therapy for longstanding issues. Some of what I'm experiencing has all the hallmarks of trauma, but the feelings aren't attached to any memories. My therapist says she thinks it likely that memories will attach themselves to these feelings as we go forward, but I can't help but worry that there's nothing, that nothing happened and I'm just somehow making this all up for attention, or something. 

So I guess I'm just after reassurance that others have had similar experiences. This may also be the wrong forum, so feel free to move if so."
2,"I know people mean well when they say this. Even I've said it to others who have survived abuse as well. The truth is I really don't draw any comfort from this sentiment. I'd feel better if I was the only one. I'd feel better if nobody else knew how I feel, knows what it's like to feel terror so severe that your brain just malfunctions when trying to process the trauma and is stuck on an infinite loop. 

When people say ""you're not alone"" what they really mean is ""it happened again to someone else."" I'd gladly serve time in this hell if it meant nobody else would ever find themselves here too. Let me be lonely here so I'd at least know the world is changing for the better."
2,"Hi

I've been working on my MH seriously for some years. 

I have never been diagnosed with anything. I am aware that CPTSD can only be diagnosed* after an in depth interview with a suitably qualified professional but I now suspect that CPTSD what I have been struggling with. 

I say suspect because 'denial' again but the truth is I (un)comfortably meet the reputable academic diagnostic criteria I have found online. I have also found that it is only on sub-forums for CPTSD that I (finally) see my experience of life being described by others.

A diagnosis is only valuable to me if it results in proper treatment; however, my memories of childhood are so vague that I doubt EMDR would be effective. It is more a totality of experience than specific memories that I need to address.

I have previously had therapy that focused on identifying and integrating the different parts of my personality, the psychotherapist also helped me to identify and process emotion. That helped hugely. I am also very familiar with CBT and mindfulness which are also a massive help. 

I am continuing to explore my childhood and my emotions via open-ended counselling and finally I am starting to no longer see myself as a person who needs to be fixed, who needs to be better. Instead I am starting to see my intrinsic worth.

My difficulty now is where to go from here now that counselling is coming to the end of its usefulness. I still have a number of symptoms significantly impacting my life.

Has anyone benefited from specific treatments for CPTSD? Particularly those that help with self-soothing the parts of you that are always defensive, always on the alert?

*There does not appear to yet be a globally accepted method of diagnosis . This condition is not yet in the DSM but it is in the latest WHO classification of illnesses."
2,"It's been a few years since I was in therapy, and last time I looked into it people weren't really being diagnosed with it. I was emotionally abused my entire childhood by my father. I started having panic attacks a few months after I moved out (which are well under control now, this was 10 years ago), I'm assuming because your body doesn't have that kind of reaction while the trauma is still taking place.

Anyway, point being that I believe that the trauma is the main cause of my anxiety, depression, and hopeless feelings. And I guess I'm just curious if anyone's doctor has given them this diagnosis."
2,"Emotional flashbacks are sudden and often prolonged regressions ('amygdala hijackings') to the frightening circumstances of childhood. They are typically experienced as intense and confusing episodes of fear and/or despair - or as sorrowful and/or enraged reactions to this fear and despair 

I am realizing I have way more emotional flashbacks than any other PTSD symptom. 

How many of you that have been diagnosed with PTSD(or cPTSD) have them? And have you found ways to deal with them?"
2,"I believe (as did my former therapist) that the majority of my mental health struggles derive from the emotional abuse from my father. While I was a shy child and therefore probably prone to anxiety, I feel that it was my mistreatment that led to the severity of my problems.

CPTSD, although widely talked about by those who have it, is not widely accepted. I don't know if I've ever gotten real treatment. But how can someone not be affected by being constantly on high alert for 20 years? I started having regular panic attacks after I moved out, this was years ago so those at least are under control. My father died a few years after I moved out, and the grieving process was difficult due to the complicated relationship. I think of him as having his own mental disorder that he never got treatment for, severe narcissism. Growing up nothing we ever did was good enough, any slight mistake warranted being screamed at by this large man. His way was the only way. I once got screamed at for asking a question about a medical procedure that I had to have at age 15, because my dad was mad that I was afraid. 

But I feel I have no sense of self. I startle easily still. I have no interest in anything really, just short term distractions. I'm still afraid of ""getting in trouble"" (for example, being too loud and making the neighbors mad), and obsessed with doing certain things the ""right way"" (such as being a perfect driver and never making a mistake at work). I just restarted a med that helped me years ago, and I'm hoping it'll start to help. But part of me thinks it's just my outlook on life, my idea of ""what's the point of any of this?"""
2,"I am 21, and was in foster all my life until I aged out at 18.
My biological parents was very absent from my life, and I only started seeing my mother more after my father passed away due to cancer last year. 
My father was an opiate addict and an alcoholic who was very violent physically, and I have been physically hurt by him many times involving one incident which resulted second degree burns all over my upper chest and shoulder.
I was sexually abused by one of my foster fathers from 7 years since I was about 8 till when I was about 15 when he died by suicide.
Thats just part of my childhood, and I went through many more emotional, physical abuse and severe neglect.
I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa when I was 15, and subsequently diagnosed with BPD when I was 18. I was very unstable when I was a teenager and the main concern was severe self harm and suicidal tendencies. However I don't really relate with a number of other BPD symptoms like fear of abandonment, unclear sense of self, emptiness and things, I do have extreme mood swings but it fits more with bipolar and I was later diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic systems, as I experience much longer periods of mania and depression.
I struggles with flashbacks, hyper vigilance, dissociation, hopelessness and helplessness which aligns with CPTSD, and I have a very clear traumatic history and experienced long term abuse. 
Anyway professionals wouldn't scrape off borderline personality disorder from my chart even though it doesn't really feels like the right diagnosis. I have been pushing them to look at it more carefully, and actually consider my history before jumping into conclusion but no one have listened so far.
Shouldn't CPTSD be considered in my case, especially I have to say BPD is a very biased diagnosis by many mental health professionals.
I am seeing a new psychiatrist in my CMHT in a couple of weeks and I really want to express myself well, and push this forward."
2,"Hello all, I’m new here 👋

(Trigger warning)
As the subject line suggests, I have C-PTSD (complex PTSD) after being raped in 2008. 
I was sixteen and the rapist was my incredibly abusive boyfriend - we were the same age - I reported it to the police, had evidence of him bragging and laughing about it with a friend, yet they took no further action. (Apparently him outright admitting it right before denying it, isn’t enough evidence?! 🤔)
Anyway, since then, I’ve been experiencing PTSD symptoms, which actually started about a year later and at first, presented as more mild anxiety? Over time, it’s got increasingly worse, to the point I would have panic attacks whenever I went out.
He told everyone I “lied” about it and some people - even my own friends! - believed him. I was harassed and targeted for it and still am to this day.
I have become housebound with severe agoraphobia. I haven’t left my house in 8 years 😞
On top of this, I also have Aspergers. 
I’ve also been emotionally, verbally, physically abused and emotionally neglected my whole life by my parents, been bullied all my life for being ‘different’ and ‘quiet’ and ‘a boffin’ and ‘weird’ etc etc. I have been stalked and harassed by numerous bullies, too. I really wish I was making this up but sadly I’m not. Police, social services, mental health services, teachers, school support, even my own family have all let me down over the course of my life. Everyone who was supposed to protect me and everyone I cared for (ex boyfriends and even friends included), have all turned against me because of my struggles. 

Over the years, I’ve had therapists and counsellors, and of course I physically cannot go to them, so I had to have home visits.
They all gave up on me.
I have tried numerous different medications, various doses, but to no avail.
I was always very active and exercised often, took part in a lot of activities... Obviously I can do longer do those! 
Now, there are no available therapists who can come to me, and I obviously cannot go to them. I’ve checked counselling directory, asked my GP multiple times, contacted Mind who were of absolutely no help whatsoever!! I’m at the end of my tether. I feel like there is just no point to my existence anymore.
I’ve tried so hard over the years to try going out, but even still, I can’t even get around the corner of my street!
I’m on ESA because obviously I can’t leave the house to go to work!

At this point I just feel like a burden. I know what people think of me... they think I’m a “sponger” or a “waste of space”. Honestly I feel like a waste of space.
I see no way forward anymore. I feel so alone. People around me won’t let me talk about it because they don’t want to hear it. I keep being told to shut up.
I’ve lost everything and everyone, pretty much.
I am so, incredibly miserable. I can’t believe that people actually think I chose this life or that I enjoy it.
I don’t feel safe in this world. I don’t fit in. I don’t belong. I’m a worthless loser. I know that. 
I wish I wasn’t here anymore and I feel so alone...there’s no future for me...

I’m not really sure what I’m asking for to be honest. Sorry.
Just needed to get it out I suppose, since nobody in real life will let me or listen to me/believe me.
Sorry this was so long. 
Thank you for reading anyway

2,"Hello Ok so here goes..

I’ve got some behaviours (/symptoms?) which have been troubling for me and unacceptable for the folk I live with for several years (it may have been longer, but I moved around a lot so its hard to trace).. Though it affects me in ither ways its oarticularly my where I live and how I live that I’m thinking about.

Firstly I’ve been cagey around others for years but in particular, if I ‘am disturbed by’ noise when I’m trying to go to sleep I feel at least very annoyed, often resulting in me shouting through the ceiling/wall and potentially punching things a lot. Its been improving ng as I don’t feel so physically triggered (rrally tense like my whole body was on high alert) when I’m going to sleep like I used to. But I still try and block out sound and get annoyed (and often yell) if I’m woken up.. On some level it feels like I’m trying to assert myself, like I dont want to not be considered. AND i find the noises and people being near my room very annoying/ puts me on edge.

I’m not sure if this is PTSD or an ASD (my GP has suggested testing for this) response but can anyone relate? I’d really appreciate it if you could reach out!

Also I grew up in a home where swearing was normalised (mainly one parent, who was mentally unwell, at another) but everywhere else its been totally unacceptable - which I get, but I find it very hard to control, even if its too myself)
 in my room).

These behaviours have, I feel imroved, but still I’ve been asked to move out again..

I think I would like to understand this, so that I can seek a way of reconcilingwith this. Ultimately, I want to live and be accepted, probably like lots of other people need too,

Your advice would be really welcomed. Thank you for reading."
2,Does anyone here have CPTSD?  Just wondered how others cope with PTSD and CPTSD.  Thanks and take care.
2,"Ok sorry for the very long first post. This is my way of coping.   So I want to ask if you think my wife has c-ptsd and what can I do to have a happy relationship.
 
I will start off by talking about the fight we had the other day (fight still in progress)...
 
I had a small issue with my 12 year old daughter basically I was trying to get her attention but she was not in the mood. I tried to do a secret handshake with her but instead my daughter gave me her middle finger. Basically my daughter is  a young women now and I have trouble getting her to open up or communicate with me.
 
I was feeling sad over this and contemplating over the current seemingly poor relationship with my daughter.
 
This sadness was noticeable to my wife and kids. I was just very quiet and in my own world. Finally, later it in the evening, I said ""hi"" in a friendly way to my wife. Immediately she started being aggressive towards me. She said: ""are you done with your game"". Instead of being able to sympathize with me (which I longed for) it  triggered in her an emotional flashback. She immediately displayed aggression and started to personally attack me saying that I am a selfish person. Her logic is that I should hide my sad mood so that it doesn't affect the people around me. She continues her abuse by saying: ""I have no empathy and your mother never raised you right.""

This has been and ongoing theme of hers for some time now.  Recently when she gets angry she blames my upbringing and criticises my mother and says things like: ""your mother never cooked, your mother never cleaned, your mother babied me too much"" etc. This reaction from her is very much offensive to me and she knows it. What I said in return in anger is ""you don't do anything"" (she's a house wife, so I'm implying that she doesn't do much work around the house). I know that this hits a nerve and is very much a trigger for her.  The mess  really doesn't bother me as much as her  attitude towards it. She always feels the need to tell me that she does so much and is always cleaning and implying that I am not pulling my weight around the house. 

There was a time where we negotiated (with a marriage counselor) that I (on top of working full time on my own business and doing full time university) would also do the dishes (lasted a few months), cook a few times per week and then finally i switched to laundry duty (which also lasted a few months). I very much get it, that housework is not fun and is hard work.

I thought this would help our relationship but instead around that timeline she had an online affair which she repeatedly denied until I brought her proof of screen-shots of her getting naked online for a guy while talking dirty to him. Until this day she is defensive if I bring that up. She will say it was my fault, I pushed  her to do that because I was not giving her any attention. ( I had University exams and was sleeping in the guest room because my wife basically was really angry at me all the time for being absorbed in so much work).
 
Anyways back to my main point:
We ended up in a huge fight because of this. My wife is so upset at me and in her mind I am the one who started it all and I am to blame for saying that she doesn't do anything. Now it's been nearly a day and a half and we are still not on talking terms. Just a few hours ago she yelled at me saying that ""all of my (her) problems are because of you"" she claims that I'm immature and I'm not empathetic. Basically more personal attacks on my character. She  continues with saying how bad my mom is for raising me. The weird thing is that when she was saying these things I was thinking the exact same things about her.  In her rage, she almost broke my macbook.
 
Now I do suspect my wife might have C-PTSD because her and her siblings all have similar issues and hearing about how she was raised I realize that she was in fact neglected and abused emotionally. Her mum also cheated on her Dad (and there is another long story to go along with that.)
 
Anyways this message is mostly just to vent but at the same time I am looking for some sort of validation that I am not crazy.
 
 I'm stuck emotionally, I am always contemplating whether the things that she is saying about me are true. I have self doubt, fear of failure and social anxiety. Although I feel sorry for my wife I also am beginning to feel sorry for myself.  In her eyes  she said: "" all of my (her) problems are because of you""  I am more and more beginning to think that she is projecting this on me and in fact  MY emotional problems are a direct result of her treatment of me. I remember a few years ago when when I was diagnosed with a depression my wife's reaction to that was: "" you do know that depression is for selfish people."" She claims that she has more reasons to be depressed but for the sake of the kids she gets out of bed everyday and sucks it up. She tells me to suck it up and be  a real man (condescending). Luckily my depression didn't last long. I took meds for about month, didn't like the way they made me feel and that was that (although I still feel mildly depressed at times).

She hardly ever admits to be anything but perfect. But when she does it is usually to blame me that I am the one who made her like this. When in retrospect that cannot be true.
 
Over the many years of marriage there are countless amounts examples that makes me think that ""all of her problems can't be because of me"". It doesn't make sense that her problems are because of me because she had them before I even met her.  She tried to cut her wrists a month before we ever met! 
 
Another  example of when we had first met (we were dating for a couple weeks at this point): while we were together I bumped in to my (recent) ex-girlfriend at a public place and  my ex  said hi to me and smiled I said hi back and immediately my then girlfriend (and now wife) ran away in a raging anger. I had to drive next to her with my windows down with her walking because she totally was ignoring me (and not telling me what I did wrong) She was crying and eventually after about an hour of walking she was ready to talk to me. She finally told me that she never wants me to do anything like that again. Still to this day I don't really  understand what it is that I actually did but I do get that it has to do with her insecurity. They way I see it is that I was only being polite when my ex said hi,  I said hi back and nothing else happened after that. I left chasing after her my future wife! 
  
She used to repeat in anger  that I'm a narcissist,  lately her go to attack is that I'm selfish and have no empathy and that there's something wrong with me.
 
 I really believe it could be true but I'm confused. I try to think how can I change. Even when we went to a marriage counselor (couples therapy) the counselor often took her side. Only recently did we start to see a new therapist and started EMDR therapy. We have the same therapist but we do separate therapy and EMDR. The result of my therapy has shown that there were some different issues bothering me from my childhood however I was able to successfully able to recognize it, cry over it and come to a positive  conclusion.  My  therapist is happy with my progress and has said that 70% of the work is done. Now my wife has the same therapist and although our therapist is not allowed to share any specifics about her therapy but from my understanding she is not progressing as fast and still has a lot of work to do in therapy.

These days we have both stopped going because we had visitors and lot of stuff going on and couldn't make the time for it. 
 
My wife keeps rubbing it into my face and when she is angry she feels the need to tell me that I need to go back to therapy. 
 
My wife is a highly suspicious and jealous person. She is always checking my phone online, asking me who I am messaging and when I go out she makes sure she knows where I am and that every second is accounted for in my day. She always gets very jealous if I talk to another person when she is around whether it is another man or woman.  She says ""how come you don't talk to me as nicely as you talk to them."" One incident was after I had a conversation with her sister.  It really got her furious, she still brings it up to this day and she even referred to it as ""cheating."" Although we were only discussing politics and general topics (her sister did get uncomfortably close at one point to see something on my phone.)
 
Another example  of her behavior:  I went out of the house a few months back  in anger for about 30 minutes and when I came back my wife was so furious. Just yesterday she did the same thing but she left for about 6 hours. I even called her, message her and she finally responded to a message saying that she will not tell me where she is and who she is with. And to justify it she brought up the incident where I left for 30 minutes (when I left,  she had never tried to reach me while I was gone). It's very much a childish game where she tries to think of things that I have done and tried to get me back to invoke that same pain that she apparently felt. Well it is very much working as I find myself often in despair.
 
 
To summarize why I think she may have c-ptsd here are some characteristic traits  of hers to consider (symptoms):
 
My wife has emotional flashbacks
disassociating
rage
violent
 extremely jealous
 low self worth
 Can't take any form of criticism without wanting to cry
 Acts like she is perfect 
 never admits to being at fault
tendency to self harm
Identifies herself as an INFJ personality type (Myer Briggs)
 Turbulent and unstable relationships with her family and friends. (She doesn't talk to her sister and basically cut her off almost completely, she cut off her father, cut off her mother 
intentionally cut off most  of her childhood friends and all her friends for some reason or another calling them toxic
 her latest friends she praises and gets along well with however she hardly has the opportunity to spend a lot of time with them. 
At times she is very insecure about her looks and body and at other times she is overly confident in it.
 
 
So basically that can summarize me and my wife's relationship.  We have been together for 18 years and have 3 amazing kids with a 4th on the way (not planned).  We do fight in front of the kids and I think that is affecting them as well.
 
Despite everything I still do love my wife (although I understand my feelings may change if things don't get better between us). When things are low, I do often contemplate the idea of running away and never being found. We are lucky to get through a month without a major fight and a few days without a less major fight.  Some years have been worse than others, I always think that we are getting better until the next major incident.   It should also be noted that these are my view of events and I am sure her view would be much different from mine.  I also tried not to exaggerate anything but I do have that tendency.  That being said I am also to blame and I am very much childish and play the tit-for-tat game pretty well.   
 
I think if she read this she would either get very defensive and say that i twist the facts, or she would get very sad and want to self harm herself.   I do not imagine her reading it and admitting to her faults and trying to improve herself and our relationship.
 
I am looking for your opinions on who is wrong here ( me only, her only or both of us)?
Does she sound like she may have a diagnosis for c-ptsd, borderline personality, bi-polar, narcissist etc.
Do I sound like I may have mental health issues?
Tips on what I can do to make her realize that she needs help .
Tips for coping.
What should I do or say to get over the current fight
any comments on the examples i provided"
2,"Hi, I’m living with complex ptsd. After years of counselling I’ve more or less learned how to manage it but now and again I still get overwhelming feelings of panic and bouts of crying that are hard to get under control. Does anyone have any advice on what I can try the next time it happens?"
2,"So my doctor believes now I have C PTSD rather than BPD. I can't stop exploding with anger - mainly to my other half - and the episodes are becoming more frequent. I feel as if the things he says to me are extremely triggering, as though he makes me feel worse rather than better. I'm tired of feeling suicidal and screaming at him on the phone and driving around like a crazy person."
2,"Does anyone know of a suitably qualified and experienced psychologist in Sussex? 
I desperately need some professional help, but am finding it impossible to find. 

Any suggestions appreciated."
2,Either way....I seriously cant cope in my relationship but I cant bring myself to leave. I am constantly triggered.
2,"I listened to a podcast with the above title recently and i really liked it, it explained, how through researching and understanding our cPTSD (and i think PTSD too), we may come to think we have depression, anxiety, other problems....

We own this stuff, but in essense it isnt us, but has become us....which differs to a lot of other mental health problems

i felt it had a lot of truth for me, as i spent years treating depression, treating addiction, treating lack of assertiveness etc etc and doing courses, and books......but now understanding trauma and cPTSD, has been a load off, and makes me feel at ease somewhat

i think i am rambling, but thought i would share to see if it made sense to others

I havent posted the link, as i forget the rules for posting such items

thanks"
2,"Just a thank you to those that have recommended Pete Walkers Complex PTSD book - surviving to thriving

I bought it actually in December, but as i was focusing on my EMDR and some other stuff, i put it away (likely to be binned).

Starting on these forums, i saw it mentioned a few times and picked it back up....upto page 70 - have never related to a book as strongly as it, it explains so well my struggles and issues, and i have felt tearful many a time just reading its insight....and then cried doing a few of the exercises

anyway, a strong recommendation from me, but also a big thank you to those that have mentioned it"
2,"Background info: I moved across the country and I had health insurance from my state, but no longer have it now because I moved to a state that doesn’t have expanded medicaid. I am currently not seeing a therapist. I am currently not taking any medication. When we move again soon, I’m applying for state healthcare and continuing seeking out behavioral health aid.

If I went to explain my entire life up until now- at 27 years of age- I’d have you reading for 27 years. I’ve never really known a life without violence, sexual abuse (molestation/rape), verbal/emotional abuse and toxicity. I never experienced one year of my life without it since my earliest memories. It’s what I know. As many of us are familiar, what we grow up with- we subconsciously seek out in our environment because it feels familiar, even if we can’t realize why until the huge red flags start to show up very announced.

It’s hard not getting into the details to explain exactly how I ended up where I am. I also don’t want to trigger anyone here. But after my last abusive relationship, I had to undergo a severe emotional cleanse. Asking myself why I keep attracting such physically/emotionally/sexually abusive people had me begging God, “why me? why does this keep happening to me?” In search of this answer, my entire past came to the surface in very powerful, vivid ways. As someone who got into alcohol and other substances very young to escape my home life, I was no stranger to gravitating toward it again in a deeper way. Where I used to live, substances of all sorts are available constantly, and for low prices (we were very close to the border). I hit an all-time low. I dropped out of school, I was living out of my car for a few months. Life was so different. The facade fell.

Before that ex, I thought I was “okay”. I had a great social life. I performed music, and poetry. I hosted art & music festivals. I hosted my own open mic for a few years. Behind-the-scenes, I fell apart. Often. Always “delirious”, when I’d try to talk about how my “mind” was feeling with my friends, they looked at me sideways. I started to realize this wasn’t a shared experience. Before that last relationship, I found something on Tumblr about dissociation and PTSD. That day, I’d discovered how much I self-identified with the symptoms of DP-DR, a natural coping mechanism for PTSD. After that relationship, I’d had gotten really deep into that ‘deliriousness’, and still do.

I guess that’s why I’m posting today.

I’m in a better space now than I’ve ever been. I moved across the country a year ago, to be with my best friend of 5 years (the man who actually helped me through and getting out of my last abusive relationship). My reactions to triggers are still incredibly debilitating, but they are less frequent. I’ve been sober for a year (minus a few occasions where I drank with my boyfriend and his family, or “consumed cannabis”.) but have been 100% free of other subtances I used to heavily rely on and found in all my previous regular social environments.

I still feel anxiety on a daily basis. It varies depending on the day and how it goes. I’ve learned my baseline is just: on-edge, and that’s my “comfortable” place to be. Though my tolerance for dealing with daily life is high, once things start stacking (as they often do as an adult trying to navigate thru life) I’m so vulnerable and shut down so easily.

I’m feeling good today. This means, I’m not stressed. I always feel a strong uneasiness, but nothing in particular is causing it, or exacerbating it.

When my day goes horribly, or my boyfriend is expressing his anger in ways I am unable to process, I can’t feel my body whatsoever. It’d be a miracle, at that point, to be able to move at all. I tend to hide in very ‘claustrophobic’ type spaces and once I’m there, I’m t h e r e. It can take hours of being calmed down to try and move my legs.

But every day, regardless of how great, I feel detached from myself. A general deliriousness.
I’ve noticed drinking coffee/5-hr energies help with the symptoms of not being able to focus, but I still look around my familiar environments with a sense of “where am I? These people love me, and I know I love them too, but I feel like I have no idea who they are, or who I am.” Being in a new environment makes this feeling worse than it was for me back in my home state. Because, I don’t have many memories to back up my experience here. And as people from home contact me less and less, my feelings of detachment seem to get worse.

After 6 years of my boyfriend being my emotional support, I wasfinding myself feeling more and more guilty that he won’t open up to me because he thinks I’m already going through enough- that he shouldn’t bother me with what is going on in his head. So, for months, I stopped talking about........ until things stacked too high, and I fell apart. This was 2 weeks ago.

He was so hurt that I played off being fine. I guess he thought my anxiety was just “better”, and things were ‘normal’. But I’d put the team on my back for sooo long... being responsible for all the laundry, for grocery shopping, for cooking, for cleaning the dishes and the floors, tables, dusting, sweeping, mopping... feeding the cats, contributing the most financially,  being a full-time online student for my home state university, driving him to and from his job (which was 30-40min away each way, and bringing him lunch mid-day)... it was just too much.

I cracked.
We had another really big fight, and things are okay now.
But something doesn’t feel right.

Before I learned it wasn’t a totally universal experience for everybody, I used to find joy in it. It inspired so much of my art and music. It felt so ethereal. I could read people because while hearing their words, I’d really be analyzing their tone, their body language, their eyes. I connected with so many people in deep, meaningful ways because I could see through their walls, so to speak.

But now, it’s impacting our romantic and daily life together. I can tell he feels hopeless, and unable to “cure” me... because we’ve had conversations about this. I’ve told him- all I need is reassurance and love, and I’ll do the rest. We fought a LOT last year. A lot. It was hard to believe the long-distance best friend I could always count on to get me through tough times in my life was the same man who was berating me and punching holes in the wall. He’s come a long way.

I’ve expressed my boundaries to him and before, he would express that he feels like he’s “not allowed to be human and feel emotions,” I remind him that- of course he’s allowed to feel anger, but that- it’s his responsibility to decide how he expresses it toward me. Especially when, I just do the most to love and nurture him. His anger is for his past. I don’t take my anger out on him for my past. So I won’t tolerate being spoken to rudely, loudly or disrespectfully. That, if he couldn’t respect my boundaries 100%, then I couldn’t stay. Ever since, he’s made lots of better decisions, but we still hit a dip every now and again. It used to be a few times a week. Then, once a month. Now?

Two weeks ago was our first big fight in months. The correlation I see? I didn’t talk about my mental illness for the same amount of time.

I wish I could go to therapy. I wish I could stop feeling so detached, distant and vague. Grounding techniques don’t work for me. Sometimes the temperature trick helps when I’m in total panic, but for the most part- I have to hold my breath til I pass out, or I stare blankly into the void until I pass out. I am still very friendly, affectionate and intuitive- but he can tell when I’m feeling ‘blank’. I tend to zone out throughout the day. My boyfriend has his problems, but my anxiety keeps trying to convince me he would be happier with someone more neurotypical.

Does anyone else go through this? What works for you? Has medication ever helped (bc back home, I never found one that helped me)? Even to hear someone relate to this feeling would be incredible. I am so tired of feeling so alone in this when I know I’m not

Thank you. ♡"
2,"I have cPTSD, was diagnosed about 5 years ago, and I am not on medication.

I don't want to get too lengthy or in detail, but years ago I tried to share CSA to my mother. I was in a really bad place, suicidal, addicted to alcohol, etc. She pretty much told me I was making it up and, typical of her, she never showed me any support or care. Never brought it up or asked questions, just an immediate dismissal as though I were a liar (told me I can't just ""make stuff up""), and I again was left on my own to manage. This was a very crucial point in my life where I had courage and was broken enough to ask for help and immediately regretted it, I understood why I never said anything to anyone.

Fast forward from 5 years ago, I've since moved with my child to another state to be with a boyfriend. He and I broke up, now back together living separate. My mothers house was foreclosed upon back in my home state, and due to her poor physical health, I allowed her to stay with my kid and I until she could get her own senior living arrangement which I told her I'd help her with.  She moved here last June.  I never asked her to pay rent or anything, she offered to buy groceries as an offset which was fine. 

I felt in my heart and knew somehow that my mother was sick and unable to take care of herself.  I knew moving her here would facilitate a huge, dramatic shift in our roles, in power, etc. My mother has always been angry, mean, cold, manipulative, accusatory, abusive, stubborn, headstrong and paranoid.  She had a rough upbringing, I understand it's just who she is.  I felt tremendous guilt at the thought of leaving my mom by herself to figure out where to live, she's disabled, etc., and knew it would be difficult to live with her. At the same time I felt I was doing the right thing and had hope for a new chance at a possible relationship of some kind not only for her and I but for her and her grandchild.

So she got here last June. In November, my mother was transported from my apartment to the ER via ambulance for trouble breathing. She then was moved to ICU and was diagnosed with terminal cancer and given ""maybe 11 months to live"".  After her hospitalization and brief rehab, she's back with me to live as long as she can until we need to look at Hospice care.

Ok so, I hesitate to call anyone a narcissist because of how trendy it's become to throw it out at anyone showing self-centered, inconsiderate behavior, but my mother is definitely on that scale, the high end, if not then she is definitely suffering from a disordered personality. I've forgiven her some pretty awful behavior. I've forgiven theft, abuse, character assassination, flirting with my ex husband, and her having some sort of emotional romantic rekindling with my sexual abuser AFTER I disclosed to her what had happened, she lied about it but the truth came out really innocently and she had no ability to play it off as something else. I had no suspicion of their rekindling as they had been not on talking terms for years, but it doesn't matter now since she's dying and I don't believe they are in contact presently. If they are, I'm unaware and I don't think I care anymore given how close we are to her death. I forgive her those things.

Anyway to my point.  I had felt after she shrugged me off years ago when I told her about the CSA, that she had forgotten completely about it. Like, completely forgotten... I really thought she did because it was like that day never happened. She never once asked me about it, never showed concern for me in any way to be totally honest.  

But now that my mother has realized that her life is coming to an end before the year is up, she's been trying to start a conversation about the CSA in very indirect ways, but it's very obvious what she's doing.  I don't blame her for wanting to know, but I don't feel like it's any of her business anymore. I know how that sounds, but to me it feels like she had the time and opportunity years ago to have this discussion, to be supportive or caring to me in any way and she proved back then that she would not and could not do those things as my mother or anything else.  

I really resent her attempts to start the conversation, but I hide it very well and pretend like I don't even hear what she's getting at. Its not to be petty, I just have ZERO interest in talking about it with her ever again. To me it feels very private now, and I want to deal with it on my own as I feel she cannot be helpful and honestly it's none of her business anymore.  There's nothing I can imagine her doing or saying that will help me should I engage in conversation about it with her. She's never been very compassionate or warm, or motherly toward me.  I've felt more like the mother between us two in those ways and that I've always tried to take care of her and honor her as my mother even though she couldn't honor me as her daughter.

I've suffered a tremendous amount with the CSA, cPTSD, and dealing with my mother's own mental health/personality issues for my entire life. I feel like a very broken person. I feel exhausted from cPTSD and I avoid my mother because I'm so annoyed with her toxicity and her attempts to talk about this.  I feel guilty but I feel like I'm right about it and she can just talk to God about it herself soon enough.  Am I wrong?  How do I handle her attempts to bring this up?  I don't want to have this painful conversation with her and I feel it should be respected.  What do I do?  I don't have any friends to talk to"
2,"I am doing phone therapy at the moment because I am unable to leave my house. I have had a very rough year and can’t say how I am feeling. It’s not good. The therapist said that I have CPTSD. I was  beaten quite a bit as a child. My Mother would go into rages. I had to be careful what I said or did because I never knew what would set her off. She would come after me. It left a scar that has never gone away. 

I see that It has effected every decision in my life. Why I am so afraid and have such anxiety.

I have harmed my self twice in my life and when something happens it’s hard not to go to that place. 

This trauma has caused all kinds of     phobias. That didn’t make a lot of since until now. 

I stopped taking my medication for a year that put me in a very bad state. No one around me helped me. I’ve been sitting here unable to take care of myself, telling my husband, I couldn’t think straight, I was in pain and had depersonalization. I couldn’t see what was going on. I didn’t feel like myself and couldn’t see a future. I was gone. Not functioning. I am back taking medication but this year almost killed me. I may never be the same again... too much has happened."
2,"Is it possible to maintain a romantic relationship with CPTSD?

That's complex PTSD; trauma that took place over years at the hands of my primary care givers.

I paid rent on time this month. Usually I pay it the day before. Automatically, the thought of talking to my landlord to pay rent made me suicidal. I am not sure why I'm wired this way. I really want to move out of state.

Self-analysis leads me to believe that my fight or flight got triggered, and that's why I want to move away. I don't know why I'm so crazy.

I am so crazy. I can't remember day to day details. Things that you're expected to remember. Names. Faces. Deadlines.

I'm losing my marbles. I really don't have enough to lose.

I dunno what I want y'all to do. Pray for me, I guess.

Thank You So Much!"
2,"Hi people

i am quite confused about what type of therapy i should be doing.

So i have attachment issues, early developmental trauma and a few other trauma instances - which gives rise to the cPTSD

Now having done research i have been receiving EMDR, which i feel is helping but i am wary other people and the Bessel book (body knows the score) states Sensorimotor or other types of therapy are better.  

Really keen to not waste more time and money, so keen on opinions on treatment experiences / thoughts etc

thank you"
2,"I was abused by my teacher. I wake up most night with night mares about the abuse. I tried to get help from the school but they blamed me. I was diagnosed by private therapist . If I get official diagnose what will be the consequence on jobs. Why did she ruin my life every time I do successful stuff I contribute it to the abuse so i don’t do successful stuff anymore and have frozen. 

I am stuck in the cycle I can’t break free ."
2,"A very brief resume of what has lead to me thinking I may have complex PTSD.

My wife (now ex) developed an acute psychosis out of the blue in 2011 - her age was early 50s (I posted here at the time). She was hospitalised for a month or so. Truly awful to see her terror through it all (and I was terrified too). Unfortunately I was the focus of her paranoias. Me + conspirators. During the acute incident I was threatened with a weapon that you only see in movies (it felt like I was in one). Even more unfortunately, she refused me any communication with her health care team. It was so isolating. She was back to a functional life in months, but never seemed to get over me. The best I got was that I was no longer a threat' and if I was not `guilty' why did I not help her against `conspirators'.

The next 3 years I did my best to look after her (she never saw me as a carer). She did a few things with me, like going away for a few days, but there was little joy. Then one day she said she was leaving in 1/2 hour and that she'd instigated divorce proceedings. I've been living on my own since 2015 and a year later fell into deep depression from which I still suffer. A lot of losses over a very short period - partner , house, children (who were at the age for leaving home and have indeed left now), retirement age (it should have been).

Getting to the point, in the decade or so prior to 2011, she seemed to fall out of love with me to a position of increasing contempt, criticism, blame (always 100% my fault). It was kept away from the children all the time (she was dedicated to them - can't fault here there). We used to once enjoy having discussions about controversial topics, but it changed and all to often she'd get very angry with me. Sometimes she was raging from close up in my face. Occasionally, her anger would raise me to anger, but then she got angrier still. If ever she cried, I felt for her, and wanted to console her, but if ever I cried, she hated my tears. I used to say to my best friend that my wife has a special `madness' for me - with everyone else she seemed fine. She also said to me that everyone thinks I'm so so nice, but they don't know what I'm really like to live with. This behavior bewildered me totally. I went to a marriage guidance counsellor, and then asked my wife to come (who said it would be a waste of time - she was right about that). All this time, whenever incidents happened, I felt frozen. It was scary to be on the end of her tongue lashing. Sometimes, I tried to go to another part of the house to escape. There were some what I now see as warning symptoms of impending psychosis - there was a valuable document that she'd mislaid/lost but she was certain that I'd taken - 100% certain. My behaviour she said when I was cross-examined by her was that of a guilty person. There was no way I could prove my innocence.

And here is the spooky thing, her mum developed a psychosis at the same age, and it had a very similar pattern to my ex-wife's.

Overall, I even began to doubt my own sanity. Was I perhaps an awful person and didn't even know it? I feel so damaged by it all, and though I've been away from her for nearly 4 years, I'm suffering for it, suffering so much. I have these feelings that I should be so angry at what she's done to me, but then I know it wasn't her fault (she had a bad relationship with her mum). Everything (readings/advice) tells me this is not a healthy place to be.

Complex PTSD does seem to be a diagnosis for what I have read and I'd be interested in anyone who has knowledge an informed any opinions on this. I understand that cPTSD relates to chronic exposure to stressors and trauma."
2,"Hi everyone,
I'm new to the forum so bare with me this might be a bit of a ramble. 

So, I'm 27 and have just disclosed the childhood sexual abuse I was subjected to. I have been diagnosed with CPTSD, and I am awaiting specific treatment for that rather than the anxiety & depression treatments I had previously. I have been having so many more panic attacks that I haven't been able to get under control myself like I used to and I can barely sleep. My doctor has prescribed me Levomepromazine and advised (I presume off lisence) that I take one when I feel like I can't control a panic attack and when I can't sleep. After getting home and reading the info on them I'm concerned at A) whether he thinks I have schizophrenia B) that he's prescribed me the wrong thing and C) now I'm questioning my sanity even more than I was before and I've become a paranoid wreck!!

I wish I could just take my brain out and replace it with a fully functioning one!! 
I was right about the ramble! 😂

Thanks in advance

2,"17 Mental Health Symptoms That Stem From Complex Trauma | The Mighty

I thought this was a very helpful article, I could relate to a lot of the 'symptoms' people describe. Especially no. 2 shame, no. 13 difficulty allowing myself happiness and putting others' interests before mine to an unnecessary degree, no. 14 not trusting my own judgement, and no. 16 abandonment and trust issues."
2,"Monkey with the Thousand Yard Stare, eating a rat, encapsulates living with Chronic PTSD ~ Going through the motions, to survive"
2,"Well...my situation is complex and I could post in several of the forums on this site. 
I’ve come a long way with this disorder in the past 12 years. It never seems to be enough for other people. They only see the parts of the disorder that remain. You never hear “ wow ! You can ride in a car now ! Good job !”  You only hear “ well I don’t understand why you can’t use public transportation like everyone else ! “.  People are fun aren’t they ? Clueless unless it’s happened to them.
  So... I was in online counseling with better help. Several years.  Lots of money spent. My councelor left and I had to update my profile and look for a new one.  Upon updating I got a notice saying they would not take me, that I should be seeing an in person councelor. I said I’ve been using this site for years and it’s helped me greatly. They said a councelor had reviewed my application and denied me for the site.  But...they took me before and my issues were the same..... it didn’t matter. I got dumped. I’ve spent thousands there.  Apparently ptsd and panic disorders are more than they can handle even though their councilors claim they can on the website. 
I told them I can’t see an in person councelor because I can’t drive or walk and the nearest is 10 miles away. “ oh you qualify for med transport”. Well...that is part of my issue....I can’t get into a vehicle with people I don’t know. Not to mention I’m terminal and my immune system is insanely low. It would be very risky even if I weren’t phobic of riding with strangers. 
  So yah. I got dumped by my counseling site online at a very stressful and bad time. I felt very betrayed. Used. My trust of people regressed. I used to self harm and hadn’t done it for years since I had online counciling. I didn’t know what to do. So that started again. Once.  They set me back years.  I was angry...now I’ve just settled into a realization that this is my life.  Apparently I’m too messed up for even shrinks to deal with. I’m a joke of a human being. That is not being said to garner affirmations, it’s simply the truth by what current society dictates I need to be. 
  I am in kidney failure. I don’t have much longer to deal with this. But still 3 to 5 years I suspect depending on what my body decides to do.  Really I guess the complex ptsd/panic now revolves around stability.  Being dependent on others which mortifies me. Having a roof over my head.  Not knowing what some person in my life may do next that will effect me adversely.  The helplessness of it all.  My only hope right now is to buy a used rv to assure myself a place to live. So... lots of stress. It’s a game against the clock and the wildcards ( people ). 
  Right now... I’m scared to death I have said something wrong and my post will be removed or I’ll get banned.  If that is the case...please at least be humane enough to tell me why."
2,"I read these couple of articles about Complex PTSD and found them helpful. I especially liked the first one from The Mighty, it explains clearly how anxiety and depression in c-PTSD are different from anxiety and depression in other circumstances. The second one talks about how c-PTSD is being better understood all the time and will hopefully be included in the DSM and the ICD before long (the diagnostic handbooks used by mental health professionals).

When Complex Trauma Is Misdiagnosed as Anxiety | The Mighty

What Is Complex PTSD? There Isn’t Nearly Enough Awareness Around This Illness"
2,"Has anyone recovered from their experience of cPTSD enough to feel you can cope reasonably enough day to day?
I'm at the end of things now. I tried to get through on my own for years (and too ashamed to speak what had gone on), have tried to work with professionals to get help. Very limited help, am in worse position now than ever. Repeatedly told that people either won't or can't help due to risk. Which is no help whatsoever. 
Where to go from here I don't know other than the obvious.
Thanks."
2,"My life could have been very different if my Secondary School had addressed my bullying but instead they blamed it on me.

Judith Herman pioneered the establishment of Complex PTSD to be included in the DSM and people with PTSD are highly vulnerable to Alcohol and Hallucinogen abuse which is what I did.

If the very worst comes to the worst and I really don't want to do this but I am thinking of suing the school for neglect and defamation of character.

But that's the very last resort.

Don't suffer bullying at school in silence and if the school authorities blame you for the bullying your suffering for fuck sake move school.

I so wish I did."
2,"I am not sure where to start. Ok, I went to see a new therapist. I told her my all my issues that my social anxiety and trembling has reached a new pinnacle, to where I refused a perfectly good job offer and, now, find it hard to go to public places. I try to make myself go out and face my fears. . . . About seven years ago, I was told I had major depressive disorder, after I had attempted suicide several times and tried to harm myself. I was put on anti-depressants/anxiety medication, including mood stabilizers. Nothing worked, it felt like I was taking vitamins. Anyway, long story short I went and saw this new therapist. She told me what it sounded like was complex PTSD. I grew up in a chaotic home with an explosive father whose rage left the house furniture in shambles, maybe a black eye, and tons of psychological terror around. Basically, I grew up in survival mode trying to dodge flying pieces of furniture. My mother was a codependent who enable his behavior and several times blamed it on me. 
I don't want sit here and blame my parents for my problems now as an adult. I want to want heal from all the crap I have experienced. I would like to talk and connect with people without expecting the worse or becoming so afraid I can't utter a word. 
.... I am 29 years old and don't want to do anything with my life. I am a student and working on a degree, but I don't really want it. I am just doing it to do something. So, I am not completely lazy. This must sound so awful, but I am being honest."
2,"diagnosed with BPD but told may have CPTSD. a few years down line i am struggling a bit

hi I was diagnosed many years ago with borderline Personality disorder and went through some DBT 3 years ago. for most part it has been successful. I am still having a lot of anxiety around people from my past (emotional verbal and occasional physical abuse in childhood, teens and into adulthood from a close family member). I am mostly stable now but do have these bizarre attacks of anxiety which either cause panic attack with physical symptoms or turn into extreme rage (looks like a toddler tantrum but I am 34!) I have been violent and confrontational in past when I get these attacks and there is a history of self harm in various different forms. 

I am no longer under secondary mental health service but with an IAPT (Improving Access to Therapy/LIFT) -referred therapist in  my area (South West UK) and my GP. I was discharged by psychiatrist earlier in the year. I am no longer on mood stabilisers but do take fluoxetine for anxiety, binge eating and OCD which are issues for me right now. Fluoxetine helps me a little but with Christmas coming up and family stuff triggering me I feel I need more help? my therapist tends to invalidate my feelings- I have been with her since June but she says because my therapy is short term she doesn't want to get deeply involved with my trauma history. She DOES acknowledge the trauma is there, and has been very helpful when I was getting nowhere with Binge ED getting me to go to Overeaters Anonymous, but she has a tendency to put down my feelings regarding anxiety and identity issues.  It isn't that she is nasty but I feel uncomfortable with her in some ways. She pooh poohs the idea that I need reassurance that I can trust her and other people. paranoia has been a huge issue for me and social anxiety too, and when I get into crisis in between week long sessions I feel unable to talk to her.  

I had an episode last week where I ended up in A and E department over anxiety and the mental health team is writing to my GP insisting I need a med review. it has taken me a couple months of trying to get GP to see me. the practice is oversubscribed and out of hours have just told me I need to speak to her (my usual GP) about medication. My usual GP is a lovely lady, but because she is good and understands MH so many people go to her.  But the paranoia tells me maybe she has got fed up with me always asking for things. last time I had to ask for help from GP surgery I had nasty meltdown and I just feel that maybe they fed up with me. 

I have a support worker with a charity in my area- she tried to refer me to courses fro help with anxiety organised by a local Wellbeing College. sadly because I see a therapist I am not allowed to attend courses or get peer support as WC is under the NHS primary services. 

I feel abandoned (which was what triggered my crisis the other week) and that they think I'm a waste of space."
2,So in 2015 I was raped. The perpetrator is in prision after going to trial where the Jury found him guilty but Im finding it really hard to move on because my point is I'm just going to be about healed at the time he will be let out.
2,"I've only ever shared this once before in a therapeutic setting that I thought was safe, and was met with so much shock and judgement that I never opened my mouth about it again.Hoewever, I still feel the need to get it out, explore what it could mean, and hopefully find out more about it. I can't imagine that i'm the only one who has them. There have to be more people out there, but there's so much taboo on the subject, that nobody really talks about it. I hope to find some people who can relate, and explore what it's function/symbolism/meaning might be.Disclaimer beforehand: These are thoughts that I would NEVER act on, and that I don't take literally in any way. They are no reflection of who I am, or what I do. They are just thoughts.Ok, so here goes. Trigger warning, mentions aggression towards children.Ever since I was young (I have memories of this going back to..I don't know..seven?), if I hear a child cry or whine in a certain way, it triggers instant aggressive thoughts in my head.I feel this intense rush of anger, and I see myself lashing out, hitting the child, sometimes just completely beating them up. I can't really descibe the trigger exactly, it's a very specific type of cry and it makes me wonder if it represents something that happened to me, that I just don't remember. But it could be more broad, obviously. Repressed anger over injustice that was done to me, that I then project onto someone else. I don't know. Either way, I feel really ashamed and horrible for having these thoughts, and i'm terrified that if people knew, they would think that I'm a bad person who can't be trusted with children. Which is absolutely not the case. Like I said, i'd never do it, or want to do it. They are thoughts, and many people have vengeful or aggressive thoughts/fantasies that they would never consider acting on.Anyway...i'm really curious if there's anyone else out there who has this, it would be somewhat comforting to know that i'm not alone. And i'm really curious if you guys have theories as to what it could mean, where it could come from, or what function it has. Thoughts?"
2,"Hi Alter-eg0! I don't have too much to say, other than I think intrusive thoughts are quite common in CPTSD. Also common to some degree for most people I think. I also experience quite scary and terrible thoughts, especially when I'm already triggered in some way. I don't feel ready to share what they are about though... Just wanted to tell you you are not alone, and I agree that they are just thoughts.Sorry you only recieved judgement the first time you opened up about it. "
2,"CPTSD  can start from infancy onward. What I found out about myself was because my mother neglected me and when I did complain or whine or speak up I got a quick, stern, ""Stop it!"" As a child that is devastating, especially because I was already in shut down (freeze-mode). So when I heard a child whine or whatever, I got angry. It's my mother! Her attitude towards me becomes my inner attitude towards the child, which is really my attitude toward my Inner Child. When I trace my feelings back to what happened to me as a child, that's when I begin to understand why I am like I am.I hope this made sense and was helpful."
2,"I do a lot of thinking of this sort, wondering about thoughts -- so perhaps that helps explain why this response ended up longer than I'd probably like. As humans we seem to have endless possibilities, fed by thousands of thoughts that can resemble a roaring waterfall pouring all sorts of information into our brains. Some stick there, while others move downstream and onto something else.It's too much, really; and where they all come from, some expected but mostly not, is hard to figure. Somehow we also have a capacity or wherewithal to at least partially decide what we notice, what we discard or hang onto, or put in our 'either/or' basket. Sometimes we're not really sure, or mature enough, to decide what seems to truly belong and/or what we want to keep. Unfortunately, our development can be rather dependent on outside thoughts, especially those originating from those people around us when very young. And -- too often, at least with regard to c-ptsd -- the thoughts can dreadfully mess things up.If we suffer from enough abuse and/or trauma, we're thrust into confusion, contradiction, and panic over what's going on. It's very easy to internalize it and start blaming ourselves, not knowing any better.Meanwhile more thoughts continue pouring down the waterfall. Hopefully we'll learn how to discern enough to not be so affected by too many negative vibes. Boy, is that easily said, but so hard to wriggle free of. It starts being contradictory to what life seemed to be. It leaves us in a fragile state of anxiety and self-doubt.Okay, so that's my drift. My point is simply that our thoughts come and go, often from sources we have no clue about. The most prone to stick, unfortunately can also be very troubling when we can finally try to figure it out. Bottom line -- the never-ending deluge of thoughts is very much a normal part of what humanity is supposed to be about. Yes, we have lots of aggressive or contradictory thoughts in the human package. Many of these thoughts can't be stopped or easily controlled. Judging them as wrong or bad isn't so much the problem. Picking out the ones that don't seem attuned to our authentic self is challenging, and tiring; especially considering the innocence in which we develop.In lieu of full control, all we can do is hope for better discernment, built on our own inner sense of self; problematic as it needs time to grow and develop in order to withstand abusive outside influence. Some thoughts aren't really ""our own"", but were thrust upon us by others. Hope you made it this far -- in summary, thoughts aren't always random, but can derive from many sources. And it's okay to not be okay about certain thoughts, too. Maybe there's a reason for them, but scoping them out can feel like like trying to find the needle in the haystack. As for the ones that obviously don't fit who we are, we have the choice to honour our own values as to whether they truly reflect who we are. Sometimes, they really are just thoughts."
2,"Woodsgnome.. Thank you so much for that! It's very obvious you have been reflecting a lot on this issue, and I very much agree. I think as survivors we are very vulnerable to be stuck in that roaring waterfall of thoughts, ideas and information in general. We haven't been taught how to regulate, which affects much more than ""just"" feelings. We have not been taught how to discern our thoughts in a healthy way.Like you wrote, I also think it is the cause of a lot of our confusion, contradiction and sense of panic.You are very good with words, Woodsgnome. I love when I get new ways to look upon something, and new perspectives. "
2,"I'm not sure if it would help, but if you ever manage to find an example of what the cry sounds like, I've known several women in my life who could identify what a baby was upset about by the type of cry. Once we were in public and there was a small baby doing short, impatient sounding cries and the woman I was with pointed out how it sounded and told me the baby was hungry. Another time a woman made an exasperated comment about how a nearby baby was tired and should be taken home, saw my confusion, and explained that the cries were long but not wailing: a tired cry. Apparently long and wailing or high pitched bloody murder cries are ""I'm hurt or something unfair happened, pay attention to me"".Idk if that information would be useful to you? If it were me, I think I would find some peace in knowing what kind of cry it was so I could remember that the baby is hungry or tired and feel some empathy and softness for them and by extension feel some empathy and softness for my past self. Or maybe you might find that knowing the baby is hungry inspires some kind of panic in you? That could be helpful to explore. Why would a hungry baby cause someone panic? Or maybe it's a tired cry- why would a tired baby not be able to fall asleep, and instead be crying? Why would a ""pay attention to me"" cry go unanswered? My suggestion is that if you've ever seen a high school drama, the girls who are the meanest are also the ones who have the harshest standards for themselves. For me, and this will sound awful but I'm sure you understand, it's cancer patients. I never talk about it because it sounds so bad. I had really severe life-threatening health problems growing up, and no support. I couldn't really talk about it because of my family, there was very little empathy. When I see ""recovery parties"", or the outpouring of support for cancer patients, something inside me twists like a burning knife. I hate it, I don't want those feelings but they're there. Maybe if you weren't allowed to cry from a young age, there could be something in you that burns when someone else gets to? Not because you're awful but because you're still hurt. It's a kind of suffering. "
2,"That's a really interesting question, goblinchild. I hadn't even thought of that yet. And yeah, I absolutely get what you're saying. Makes a lot of sense. "
2,"What you have described sounds a lot to me like misophonia. I have it, and there are certain trigger sounds that send me into instant agitation and (unexpressed) rage. In my case, baby crying is annoying, but not an actual misophonic trigger—but I have other ones that do qualify. Basically, the second I start to hear the sound, something inside me completely and utterly wigs out. Usually, I try to get away ASAP, but that’s not always possible, given circumstances. When I can’t get away, I’m basically shot and useless until the sound stops. I won’t be able to have a conversation or even think. It’s a terrible experience. I’ve actually started avoiding certain activities that may end up exposing me to my triggers—it’s that bad. There’s a documentary about it called Quiet, Please. It does a good job of explaining what life is like living with this. It has really wrecked some ppl’s lives.Not trying to diagnose you, but it’s something that may be worth looking into"
2,"They walked around and looked into all of my windows first like a creep. They were talking to my neighbors and I didn't know?? They showed up when they knew I was injured and having an adverse reaction to the meds for the injury, impacting my judgement and ability to take care of myself. They know they're not welcome here. Ugh. Like, I don't need to go on about it. I'm sure all of your creep-o-meters are going off as badly as mine.  It's just that they were so squirrely. In the past I was so conditioned to feel like I was just being crazy when I noticed these things, but I haven't seen this in a year since I went low contact. The way they were speaking was strange for them, they sounded so weirdly desperate. Not groveling desperate, but ""I'm desperate, it's unbearable, so I'm here to forward my wants over your needs and safety"" That sort of thing. That ""I'm going to use you to make myself feel better whether you like it or not"" thing. It's been a while since I've been on the other end of that and I'm a little shaken and dissociated tbh. I have more of an inner compass now, and in my gut I feel like maybe I need to affirm my innate value and humanity to myself and assure myself that I'm not here to be used by any * who prefers to hurt people instead of help themselves. It's hard to push away the humanity of it all though. They've told me before to my face that they prefer treating people this way and have no intention to stop, and that they understand they have a problem but they just don't feel bad about it and don't want to change. They get offended at me when I suggest they need to fix it, as if I'm an unaccepting monster. It's so easy to get sucked into those memories. I hope I can use these feelings of anger and lack of safety to double down and care for myself even more. Protect and value myself even more. "
2,"I am too far gone. Cannot play games. People expect me to be normal and then when they find out I'm not - have a grand time making me feel worse. I hardly ever interact anymore but when I do, I am in dissociative mode. I just can't deal anymore. Are there any vlogs by anyone who is thriving with this? Any success stories?"
2,Read Pete Walker. An author who has CPTSD and helps others through it. Get support. ACA may help: Adult Children of Alcoholics and other dysfunctional families.
2,"I'm sorry you're feeling so bad atm, EdenJoy. Could you be in an EF? That could make you feel ""too far gone"". As for success stories, you could try our Successes/Progress board:  https://cptsd.org/forum/index.php?board=51.0 My impression is there are quite a few partial success stories here on the board among the mbrs, myself included. Things aren't easy, but they are way, way, way better than they used to be. Also as marti wrote Pete Walker who wrote ""Surviving to Thriving"" and is really doing it! You can read some of the book here for free: http://www.pete-walker.com/ "
2,"Sorry you're struggling Eden, Complex PTSD can be so overwhelming as many of us here know.   I just wanted to suggest that you fit in here because we get what it feels like and try to help each other recover. One important piece in that effort is trying to understand and accept it's our experience of abuse/neglect that was/is abnormal, not us. Our responses to that abnormality means we have had to develop responses (e.g., freeze, fight, flee, fawn), to help us survive and that's all, we ourselves aren't weak or defective.  Besides Pete Walker's book I'd recommend ""It's Not You, It's What Happened to You"" by Christine Courtois."
2,"Is this common? I think it probably is.Walking my dog this morning, as I always do, people do stop, in fact, someone had wound down their car window specifically to speak to me about their dog, and then I carried on walking with another dog walker, who was on their way to meet someone else, with a dog. As it turns out they were meeting someone I know, a mum, whose daughter was in the same primary school class as mine, our daughters had been friends then. Off they went, together. I went on my normal walk, sometimes I see people and walk with them, or stop and chat sometimes I don’t, nothing is pre-arranged as their walk was. No one makes ‘dates’ with me, I don’t suppose I make dates with them either, it seems difficult, I fear rejection. I feel I should be grateful for the people who do want to speak to me, however, briefly. There was one man I used to walk with quite a lot, he even called at our house to show my daughter his new puppy when she was ill. He seems to have changed his walking habits over lock down. However, there is a pattern with my normal walking acquaintances, they are generally male and 70+G"
2,"Walking the dog is such a good way to get some interaction. I'm awful at making and keeping friends and inclined not to do so because it overwhelms me, plus it's a struggle to be 'switched on' and fun enough to encourage people to want to be friendly with me. I'm OK with it and have never felt a need for many friends. When I have had friends I've always coped so much better with just one or two special people rather than juggling a large group. For this reason, when walking it can be really nice to see people and to have a pleasant chat with no expectation of having to make it a regular thing or commit to a friendship. I think it works well because as you say, a lot of people do seem to want to say hi and stop to talk. It does seem to fill a small gap if you're feeling lonely. "
2,"It's hard to see other people making their way in the world, whether with marriage, or friends, or groups, or in their chosen career, when I feel unworthy. But who inflicted that on me? My family system, my parents' inability to love and nurture me when I was totally dependent on them - from infancy through all the developmental stages. At each one I needed them and they weren't there. I was expected to already know, to be ""responsible"", to just do it without guidance. It's very sad and I've grieved a lot over what I lost, no, what I never had. A difficult road with lots of   and   and   and   AND   Yes a LOT of anger. Sigh."
2,"Wasn't sure where to post this tbh - sorry! So as like many people no doubt here, I am consistently hesitant to trust; partners, family or friends.I've been with my OH for 8 years nearly, love him dearly, most of the time. But as I'm discovering more about my CPTSD, and how i react, I'm starting to resent him. I don't know why exactly.And an old friend popped up during Lockdown which was totally unexpected; having stopped talking a few years before because we conflicted has made me have some super strange feelings.This old friend - I have never met him - we met on a teenchat room when I was like 15 (dangerous I know) and he was 14, and we have been speaking on and off for the last 14 years... He has always said that he has forever been in love with me (unbelievable to me), and still he knows he will likely never meet me. I am from UK and he lives in Canada - pretty far away!He and my OH are aware of each other, and I'd like to continue with my OH completely. But lately with being hyper emotional to everything, dropping friends like potatoes etc, I am finding myself OBSESSED with my old friend. But i don't want to be. Its like a totally new emotion that I can't control.I'd like to continue as I was but rekindling with a friend not like a crush - and drop this teenage obsession before i buy a diary to hide under my pillow.Has anyone else experienced this?"
2,"Today is the anniversary of my Fathers death.Feeling nothing. Like someone has taken everything, all feelings. Not in a numbing way, in a completely empty way. Hollow.Well that's it really, I just wanted to tell someone. To get it out, to see if it would make any difference. I don't think it has tho.Ah well, time to clear up the days mess."
2,"OceanStar, I hear you. Whatever you feel, or don't feel, is okay."
2,"Hi,I have been told by a couple of people that they walk on eggshells around me and that I take things personally. I can’t see it but I guess it must be true, so I need to work on this. Has anyone got any experiences on how to be less reactive, please? Thank you 😊 "
2,"The way I currently understand it, the reactivity that follows taking something personally stems from a sense of threat. One reacts in defense to threat. The thing one is defending is one’s ego/sense of “self” (felt as being separate from the rest of the world, to a sort of “pathological” degree, I suppose). Apparently, there are ways to tame the influence of ego, such as (non-dual) meditation or controlled use of certain types psychedelics that reduce activity in certain areas of the brain that enforce that sense of separateness "
2,"Hey dewachen, one way I learned to turn down the volume on my reactivity was I took an online CBT course.  I'm not a fan of CBT as a cure all for CPTSD, but what it did for me was help me learn to slow down and question my reactions before I acted on them. When we were being abused we needed to react quickly so we could respond to the trauma we were experiencing & flee, fight, freeze or fawn to help keep us safe.  These reactions become almost automatic so we have to learn to  see/feel what we are doing, slow down and assess whether there is any real danger and interrupt that automatic response.  This is the course I did  - https://www.learntolive.com/  - but there are quite a few out there now from what I can see. Hope this helps  "
2,"There is a women in my recovery programme who I've known for 5 years..I became more friends with her and stayed at her house few times ..I now don't speak with her on recovery calls or interact with her due to her condescending ,superior and iron fist attitude. I used to take it on calls cause she used to say helpful recovery stuff but the way it was delivered id get in a bad mood and in the end wasn't worth it .She openly says she has bpd and in some ways I think I've denied that as she has good eating disorder recovery. Over time I've just hated her more and now I cant stand her .This morning she was on the zoom meeting and get what she is the secretary surprise surprise .someone else was leading the meeting and there was an issue with sound .I spoke to the host and said I don't think the leader is on the line ...with that said person said ' Yes she is on the line ' in a sort a authoritative slightly aggressive way ....My anger went off like a rocket (internally)  and I was close to saying something of which I didn't and am glad I didn't...I wanted to say why do u talk to people like they are idiots !I'm now wondering if she is a narc she seems to fit the bill ...really inflated sense of self importance yet I know from her that she has crushing low self worth..I'm not saying i don't have some personality issues to work on and my goodness i can be condesending and ego at times too..I want to work on this anger I have towards her and be able to let it go ...its only eating me up..she is a sick person and I don't need to interact ..I have thought about not going to that meeting but it is one of the UK meetings and I need to be there to help newcomers ..My lesson from today is to not offer any comments about the meeting ,just do my share and be quiet ...I need to not focus on this women and expect her do what she does and know it's nothing to do with me ...It helps me to reflect on my own behaviour and when I'm being self righteous ego etc how that must be for other people ...glad I can see it a bit more in myself and can work with it ...Any thoughts /experiences on the behaviour i describe about her ...the condescending ,superior ,iron fist type ...Any ways to think abouT it deal with it ?"
2,"I read this book... (yes, here I go again talking about books! Sometimes I irritate myself) and anyway it helped me a lot with this same, idk what to call it, defensiveness I guess. Not that it still doesn't affect me, but it's easier to deal with if I remember that another person's words and actions are due to their damage, outlook, opinions, etc and don't really have anything to do with me at their core. Anyway the book title is ""The Four Agreements"", it's kind of new age-y and I didn't buy into that part, but overall it was really helpful. "
2,Hi three rosesThank u for your response That is just on parr with how I have been looking at it this past week. It is from her damage and has NOTHING to do with me...I have that book! And had actually put it in the charity bag so I'm gonna dig it out and re check it out with regard to this person... Thank u dear and I hope this finds u well 
2,"I want to hide. To be left alone to be me on my own without anyone else watching me, seeing me, knowing me. No noise, no expectations, no time boundaries, nothing.I am in an EF and I want to feel my way through, to begin to actually understand. I realise that pushing my experiences away doesn't help but right now I have no idea how to feel my way through this and be with others. Anyone any ideas. "
2,"Its a good first step to realize you are in an EF.  If you can spend some time and figure out what triggered it, and to process what you are / are not feeling and thinking that should be a big help. I think being with others comes after we are in a better place with ourselves.I know it can be really tough, but I'm sure you will make it through in time. Wishing you all the best!"
2,"I've found that I need space, a lot of it to figure out what I am feeling and why when I am going through an EF.  I used to feel guilty or whatever for needing to but I came to see it as necessary, much like a diabetic needs insulin or someone with a broken leg needs to rest and elevate. It makes sense that we need to feel safe during an EF because we are more vulnerable, but also to turn down the volume on additional stresses (people, sound, light, etc) so we have the energy to deal with it.  So FWIW I say hide away if you can and if/when you're up to it post here and/or talk to someone you trust to help process what triggered the EF.  "
2,"There are times I need to hide also. I feel safest on the floor covered with a blanket. I can't hide as much as I feel the need because of responsibilities, but when able I let give myself the space and care. "
2,"Thank you all. Your messages ment a lot when I was in a dark place.I am feeling better than I was. I know I'm not there now and I'm grown up but there is still quite a strong pull back. Does anyone else experience that pull back? It's like being sucked back into the past hopelessness.I don't think I'll make much sense of anything now, I'm tired. "
2,"That sense of being pulled back is definitely common OceanStar.  Pete Walker refers to them as emotional flashbacks when we 'regress' to a younger self and the feelings we had then.  There's also a saying among trauma survivors that captures this:  ""I'm not stuck in the past, the past is stuck in me."" We have a lot of unprocessed trauma that is not integrated into our self, it's stuck if you will and that's where we go back to under stress/are triggered.  So perfectly normal for us and it really does take a lot out of you so hope you will take time to rest and let the effects subside.  I used to feel like I was hungover and in fact found out I was in a sense from all the chemicals/hormones released into my body.  Along with reducing stress and getting more rest, I would drink a lot of water to help flush them out.Hope this helps.   "
3,"Hi, I would really appreciate if anyone could please give me some advice. I know that this probably isn't the right place, and I apologise for imposing, but this is a last resort. 
I have been my ex girlfriend's favourite person for over a year. We dated casually for a few months, then I ended it because she wanted something more serious than I was able to have. This happened in November 2019. A few months later I told her that I was casually dating someone else (very briefly - over now, he forced me to tell her).

I was unaware of her BPD until this point, when she had a breakdown and told me that I was her favourite person. Since then, she has been getting worse and worse everyday, self harms regularly and has attempted suicide multiple times. She has now stopped telling me about how she's feeling other than to say she's worse than she's ever been. 
I'm terrified that she might die soon. She has honestly done all she can, has therapists, medication... but she hasn't found anything helpful.

I don't know how to help because she tells me that all that would help would be if I gave her more love and attention. But talking to her everyday for over a year and seeing the impact of everything I say and do has on her has made me terrified of saying something that would cause her to hurt herself. It feels like I have to find a balance between avoiding telling her something that would lead her on (she still wants to be in a relationship with me) and avoiding saying something that will make her 'freak out' (her words) thinking I might abandon her. 
For example she often asks me to tell her I love her and how we will spend our lives together.

My real question is - Is me being in her life helping or am I putting her in a position where she can't move forward? 
I do believe that she would be in a dangerous position if I stopped talking to her, but maybe me constantly not being able to give her what she wants could be regularly re-traumatising her. I've asked therapists and friends what I could do to help her but only been told that I am in an impossible position. I'm hoping that there might be someone here who has some insight into how she is feeling and what she needs.

Thank you for reading <3"
3,"Hello, I’ve been googling a lot on this subject, but I can’t find any concrete information, so I thought I might try here. My partner has a brother who has BDP and ADHD (5 kids) and a late grandpa on paternal side, who probably had some mental health issues, but was never properly diagnosed (older generation). There are no other mental illnesses present among any other paternal (or maternal) relatives. 
Because of this, he is worried his children might have a stronger predisposition to develop BPD and he really does not want that, because he knows how hard growing up was for him and the whole family. 
What is the chance in this case, that our children develop BDP (my side of the family has no history of BDP) and is there any genetic testing to determine the probability and inheritability of BDP?
Thanks in advance!"

3,Hi all I've been recently diagnosed with eupd and bipolar and ADHD as you can imagine a bit of a shock I've been experiencing psychosis as just came to speak to people in the same situation
3,"I’ve been feeling so lonely & I don’t have any friends with BPD, so they will never be able to truly understand"
3,"im having a splitting episode and im trying so hard to hold everything together. Its been around a week now im ok with everyone but my gf she said something last fri and slightly upset me in normal circumstances but this time i ended things with her from fri to Tuesday i avoided her and when i did see her i wouldn't really speak i just completely shut off from her. Then Tuesday she came to see me said im been cold and heartless, ive explained all the stuff that adds to my bpd episodes and i need real answers to things that have happened in the past as they play in my head and i think it got too much and caused a splitting episode she gave me answers and now its time to decide if i believe her and can let go but im still having an episode as i feel arrrrrrrr towards her which isnt like me"
3,"Hello, i will try to summarize my story but it's gonna be a bit long (i hope my english is good enough :p)

I was with a girl for 4y and it wasn't doing great with her, we didnt live together and during quarantine in May i went on an old 3D virtual world game that simulate real life (you can make friends and doing anything there, even having sex or get married).

I went there to talk with some old friend and I met a girl who was really into me (she saw my picture on my profil and she liked me I guess), she was talking to me everyday, all the night spending all her time with me, we had lots of things in common (really a lot, maybe a bit too much it was kinda weird lol so she was probably faking things sometimes but i wasn't aware of it).

She rapidly told me she had feeling for me, but I told her I still have my gf (i told her the truth) she wanted my phone number, I asked her to wait since I'm not single yet. She was kinda upset and told me ""I don't want to be a plan B, I want to meet you in real life that's why I come here for you, if you want to stay with your girlfriend i'm gonna leave.""
After a few months, I stopped the relationship with my gf and I gave her my phone number... and she told me that she had money issue and lost her phone number, that she is gonna give it to me when she has a new one, I said ok... (she never gave it to me LOL)

We had to meet in real in september, she had an excuses to don't meet me, same in October again another excuse... and she was disappearing all the time for different reason, one time no internet connexion, another time someone died in her family, another time she was sick, she knew I was feeling bad when she was not here but she didn't seem to care about it anymore (before she was sooo into me and soo adorable, but she changed alot).

We had a few arguments because she always had excuse to don't meet me and then poof she left, she ghosted me for one month and half... during this ghosting time, i used google search thing and I saw that her pictures were fake. (she sent me lots of picture of her face and some sexual pictures too).

I sent to her a message and told her I know something about her, but she didn't reply me (she was still ghosting) she came back after 45 days telling me how sorry she was, she said she was trying to forget me etc... And it was very painful for her (pretty sure she faked this), I told her about her fake pictures and she said something like : ""yeah i am very sorry i was not myself, i was feeling bad and I wanted to be someone else and I don't like showing myself on internet, but you deserve to see me now, I will show you my picture"" she sent me another picture, it was another girl, less beautiful, but still ok looking and I am pretty sure it was still not her on this picture LOL.

We talked like before, she was ""into me"" again, always talking to me, saying she wanted to meet me in real, she also said she will have a new phone number for Christmas (I didn't ask for it, she said it by herself, but she didn't give it to me even after chritmas, so it was fake, not sure why she talked about it then).

After a month talking, a friend of mine discovered that she ""cheated"" on me with another guy a few month before, basically while i was feeling bad waiting for her, she was with another guy... I was SO angry at her, basically she said it was when she tried to forget me and she flirted with this guy for a week, I told her she was not a good person etc... (but never insulted her).

She left the game, and stopped replying on discord (yes I also had discord to talk to her), I got scared that she would ghost me again... So I contacted one of her friend on Steam (it's a gaming plateform for people who don't know) So i contacted and guy from her friendlist and told him ""hey I know a girl from there, could you tell her to come talking to me please"" the guy said ok, and she came back 5mins later.

She seemed so worried that I talked to one of her friend, she asked me ""what did you say to him ? How many people did you contact ?? "" I told her to calm down that I didn't say anything bad, I just wanted her to come back and it was my only option to reach her.

Then she said I understand, but she changed completely her mind about me (I'm not sure if it was because I got angry at her or because I contacted one of her friend) but she said that she had no feeling for me, that she used to have feeling at the beggining but she was not herself, then when she came back she was simply nostalgic that's why she wanted to get back with me, but that it was better to stay friends now and that we had too much problems and dramas.
I was in shock because a few days before she was really into me and wanted to meet me and I invested so much time and energy, forgave plenty of things, give her many chances... I really didn't know what was happening, anyway she was sure of herself so i accepted the friendship.

My best friend asked me to show him this 3D plateform and wanted to help me with this girl, it's what he did, he talked to her and I don't know what happened but she washed his brain or something like that... but he turned into her, he was always with her, faking being offline to spend time with her etc... and she knows I was feeling bad about it, that's why she was doing it.

I erased this bad friend from my life, he had a wife and a kid, I told him if he continues to talk with her i'm gonna repeat everything to his wife, he got scared and leave.

I tried to spend more time with this girl, i told her that this 3D plateform was toxic and asked her to move on another game, she said OK, i bought to her a game (she didn't ask for it, I did it by myself, she never asked me anything and it was the first thing I bought to her) She played like 2 evenings with me and then she started faking being sick again LOL (she always use the health excuse).

I didn't talk to her for a few days and then she came back saying ""hey I have no news from you, you seem really busy :) "" I replied it was her, not me, I also told her that she seemed loosing interest a lot again. She replied she was busy with her health and her job, and she said ""and I think when you talk to me, you're looking for more than friendship and you know it won't happen, i'm sorry it's not against you ""

i replied ok, then we stop here, she said hmm ok, i said  i'm gonna miss her, she said ""me too but i understand your decision and i respect you, you have always been so nice to me"" then she said ""goodbye mister.""

I didn't talk to her for one month now...  i knew her in May, so it has been a long time already, i deleted her maybe 6 times from discord but i always missed her so much this time i try to stay strong and to not reach her. I don't know exactly what she did to me, I don't know what she is too... she is catfishing that's for sure but there is something more about this person. She told me once that she was Borderline, i'm not sure if it's the truth or not, I could believe it, or maybe Bipolar or narcissic (lovebombing => loosing interest => discard) I saw that this stuff exist too on internet + the way she tried to make me feel bad with my friend, but i'm not sure  if those kind of people can catfish too, is it compatible ?

I'm also not sure why she said that she had no feelings for me and a few days before she seemed into me so bad, like i said it could be because i got angry at her and told her she was a bad person etc... or maybe because she got scared that i contacted someone from her steam (she has obviously something to hide there, probably talking to other guys i don't know or maybe someone that know her IRL, not sure).

Anyway I am empty as fuck, i have never been empty in my life, i'm a person with a really big heart and i feel really empty now, a friend told me to talk to other girls, it's what i'm trying to do, i'm talking to a woman from my town, she seems nice etc... and she wants to meet me but I feel too empty for that at the moment... And i have many questions in my head and i'm ruminating alot...

I'm wondering if this person will come back in my life ? i feel i hate her and i miss her at the same time i don't know why! i wish i could make her change and help her, i don't care much about the catfishing stuff because i liked her personnality when she was ""good"" lol. But i know at the same time that i did the right thing to leave... she obviously wasn't interested anymore so...

thanks for reading me ^^"
3,"Hi guys on there as been reasonly been diagnosed with eupd and bipolar and  ADHD as you can imagine a bit of a shock but I kind of expected it I've been experiencing psychosis people talking to me or person talking to the last year also or more about three years altogether I had been clever at hiding it from my mom and I was working when I shouldn't..they suspended me ...when i was going thru peoples bags the reason I was going for people's bags with because at the time was scared for my sanity I believe that people from work was trying to kill me with guns or with weapons and the voice told me that they were the in changing room so I went searching everywhere that changing room lockers toilets bags coats everything ...been doing okay now on medication for antipsychotic depression and he moved stabilised  and zopiclone to help me sleep. I've been off work an lots of people have been talking about me talking about the fact that maybe I was stealing from them the trust or moving things  shouldn't have been that i wasn't feeling well or was mentally instable they've made their own conclusions but they're meant to be my best friends and have chosen not to stick by me and it makes me really sad and now I feel got no one to talk to about my problems no one to talk to you but everyday things and just find myself completely lost and lonely  i had a group of people who don't care about me anymore 

Just wondering if anyone feels the same

3,I have recently been diagnosed with this condition and there are things in my life that have changed because of it. I have started fainting as a result of it and I was just wondering if anyone else has ever had this and what they have found to help as I may be losing my job over it which is making things worse for me
3,"So, Mother's Day, and as predicted my eldest son (31) had no contact with me and so continues the complete cut off from his mum since last year's Mother's Day, when I was brave enough to admit I'd been diagnosed, and told the family of this crippling affliction and what I was doing to address it. And even though I've never deliberately hurt any of my family, they would agree I've been a devoted mother, but nothing else hurts like this, it is unbearable. Being my eldest (of 3) he felt it was his task to 'fix' me, until I realised a year ago he was my main trigger, my other 2 children I have no problem with, but he couldn't cope with that so disassociated himself and also my first grandchild from me. My grandson is coming up to 2 years old and doesn't know I exist. My family are appalled by this behaviour, and like me do not fully understand, however I've honored his wish to disconnect from me even though a year ago I moved into the same town as him to be a hands on nanna, but surely mother's day is an exception? I'd value anyone's thoughts in this. Thankyou"
3,"I know that I am definitely not polyamorous. 💯

I have a very hard time with emotional relationships(mainly because I have borderline personality disorder and other mental illnesses)with just one person, I could not imagine an emotional relationship with multiple people. 💯 

With having borderline personality disorder, have you ever questioned being polyamorous or non monogamous because of your extreme fears of abandonment?

You feel like those fears of abandonment would not be as bad(or even close to nonexistent) because if you were polyamorous or non monogamous, you would always have multiple people in your life when you fear that one or more of them could eventually leave you."
3,"On the surface things are going ok. Loving my flat, on top of my bills etc. Got awarded LCWRA and it was backdated about 18 months so been buying a few things and I've got money put away for a car when I'm able to reapply for my licence at the end of the year.

I'm just so fucking low and I can't fix it. I've stopped spending on random shit now because firstly I've got everything I need and no more space for shit and secondly it's just making me feel emptier. 

I spent so much time stressing about it and fantasising that it would make things better but it just hasn't.

Don't know how to refocus or what to focus on now. It's just confirming that I'll never really be better."
3,"I get jealous very often when it comes to
my favorite person. It is an overarching part of my life that I have been able to accept and ignore. But, there are a few people that really set off my jealousy and send me into rages. I don’t know how to not act on it. Last night he stayed up really late playing games with one of the people that sets my jealousy off and I cant seem to calm down. I’m trying not to take it out on him because I try to maintain a healthy relationship and I know he can be friends with her. But I can’t force myself to not dryly respond and I’m trying to refrain from cancelling the plans we have today because of my jealousy. What can I do to stop this?"
3,"Hi,

A friend of mine has BPD. It sometimes feel like she is pushing me away. I have come to realize that for many weeks, I was actually making the situation worse by always apologizing when I said or did something that triggered her, whether I was actually wrong or not.

I've been reading a lot about BPD and I understand now the importance of setting boundaries, but I feel like I'm doing it all wrong. When she gets upset, I avoid arguing with her. I try to make what I have to say as simple as possible and I make it clear that I respect how she feels and love her no matter what.

She's actually noticed that I'm trying out tips like this and she says it makes her feel like the subject of an experiment, which I get. But I'm trying my best and doing it out of love.

I know every person, BPD or no BPD, is different. So there is no universal, simple solution. But does anyone have any advice for me? Should I try something different? Should I just accept that things are gonna get worse before they get better? Is it possible that, deep down, she actually wants me to go away?

Any advice helps, thank you for your perspective."
3,"I work part time, but I feel that is much for me. The stress... Responsabilities...
I don't wanna be a lazy or similar... I don't know what to do.... Also my friend abandoned me"
3,When I don’t see someone for a couple days I can’t remember what they look like. I don’t have facial blindness and I know who they are when I see them but if I had to describe someone to a sketch artist. I can’t. This happens with everyone. Friends. SOs. Family. It’s really strange and it makes me feel like a bad person when I think about it.
3,"I've recently decided to take time out of college to work. Great decision because now I only have to stress about work instead of work and school, but my BPD is raging. At work I feel like I'm walking on eggshells; my shift is usually 6 hours and they entire time my heart is racing. Anytime I get criticism I feel like I can't make any more mistakes or I might get fired. Today I never left my position  (food service sucks) even though I was thirsty and needed to go to the bathroom. I know in my head the entire time that my anxiety is irrational, but it feels like the world is crashing around me. I know this is something us with BPD experience and not out of the normal. I just want a job that i dont deteste every single day."
3,"I haven't smoked in years. Today I had an urge that would not go away, so finally I was ready to give in. I knew where I kept a pretty little case. Well, I went there, tore everything apart looking but it's not there. I remember looking at it earlier this year and thinking I should throw it away. I don't remember throwing it out, but I guess I did. This is probably good. These past few months have been a challenge of me falling into old habits or gravitating back there.  Anyway, I found incense instead. Nice. 

Thanks for reading and have a good night."
3,"I cold turkey stopped taking my meds 3 days ago. I wasn’t sleeping good. I had no desire for my partner. I freaking don’t feel anything. Since I was diagnosed only a month ago ( bpd, mdd, panic disorder, depersonalization/ derealization. I have been so upset that I have been stoned pretty much the entire time( work, home) my partner hates it but I hide it from her bc I vape.  I had already been taking Wellbutrin and the psych added cymbalta. I am over the initial side effects. Please give some advice. Is this part of my self destruction or is the weed messing me up? Also my uncle just passed and I live  about 2 hrs away but I can’t even bring myself to go see my family or call them... why? Am I weird or is this the bpd? I am still in denial that I even have bpd.   I am new and reaching out for support. In better news no violent freak outs lately 😁. Thank you new friends."
3,I recently realized how badly bpd was affecting my life. Now it’s gotten out of control. Like i want something really badly but i dont know how to get it.
3,"I have suffered from severe clinical depression.  It was so severe that I once spent 5 weeks in hospital because of it and was on very high doses of anti-depressants.  I have not taken any kind medication for over ten years and I rarely now get depressed.  However, I suspect that I suffer from BPD and I probably have always suffered from it, but my depression masked it, as I tend to withdraw when I get depressed.  I have done a few online BPD tests which give results ranging from ""maybe"", to ""likely"" to ""you have BDP"".  I know these  are not proper diagnoses, but I certainly have thought for a long time that I have BDP even though I have not been officially diagnosed with the condition.  

Has anybody here who has been diagnosed with BDP, previously suffered from depression or still suffers from it?"
3,"Hey folks, 

I am new here, so before I post my question, just wanted to say hi.

Anyhow, I have this problem for 8 years now. I should add that with BPD I am also Bipolar.

The thing is, and would really appreciate hearing if anyone had a similar case. I started to explore my connection with God. And in that pursuit, I became obsessed with reading the Scriptures, and finally, I came to the conclusion that there are two religions I am interested in. Christianity and Islam. Today I am a practising Christian, but even now, and for this period of time, I could never say 100 per cent, okay this is the one way to reach God for me, that is it, now let's move on in life. No. It is something that is in my thoughts 24/7. Even things in my everyday life like college before, jobs etc were problematic to deal with because all of the time I was so stuck in reading about theology and finding ""which religion makes more sense"" that this not only exhausted me, but it went down to the core of my being and became as a parasite that never goes away no matter what I do. 

I think people can relate maybe not with this situation but with some form of obsession regarding his or her identity considering the fact that BPD does have this symptom. 

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts."
3,"My impulsive behaviour is limited to spending/shopping these days. I stopped other impulsive behaviours slowly over the years. Buying cars frequently, drinking&smoking cannabis, last minute holidays are examples of previous impulsive behaviours. 
I often go on a spree buying clothes and footwear for myself and my kids, way more than we need.  Its harmful to my finances but other than that it is harmless.
Just wondering if anyone else has succeeded in controlling impulses in general but hangs on to one harmless enough way to vent the impulsivity?"
3,"I feel now a mix beetween lots of anger and sad because my teacher of university is pressing me by an email. I'm in a project that i've finished in a 94%. I don't wanna make that project but I don't have an exit for that. I feel I can't be OK, ""normal"" with ""good mood""  likein 2019, a non retunrn point. I'm to close to return to hypersexuality again, I'm clean from 2019."
3,"Im 18 years old and have been diagnosed with BPD for a little over a year now.
a year and a half ago i went through a major break up. these days i feel like i still love him and i have an attachment to him despite having no contact.
Am i really in love with him or is this a symptom or effect of my BPD?

Any advice anyone?"
3,"Hi all. new here and would like to introduce myself, I am NotSoWiseOldOwl. Chose that username due to my long and colourful history over the years. I have a dual diagnosis of EUPD (Borderline personality disorder) & Bipolar 2. I am currently taking part in structured clinical management therapy for the EUPD. I was diagnosed with EUPD back in July 2019 during a hospital admission but back then i was not offered any additional or follow on support, it wasn't until February 2020 that I was speaking with a CPN & informed him. It was my CPN at the time who put me forward for the therapy. My journey initially started out as bipolar affective disorder when diagnosed in 2007 & then became bipolar NOS (Not otherwise specified) due to treatment becoming complex and then this January finally becoming bipolar 2 due to having more destructive depressive episodes than mania's. I have been voluntarily hospitalised 3 times, 2017,2019 & 2020 due to my self destructive and highly impulsive actions, i won't go into detail as i really would like to avoid triggering or giving any ideas to any members who are struggling at the moment. I enjoy getting out for nice long walks and relax by listening to all kinds of music."
3,"I am 28, have known for at least 5 years. Finally confirmed and i feel like im numb. From my criminal background to my relationships, i fit description. Mine is impulsive BPD. Having trouble coming to grips with the fact that IF my parents cared enough, this wouldn't be things i have to confront a decade into adulthood. Im very aware, im low on the ""spectrum"". level II diagnosis. I begin  DBT therapy this week and begin Effexor. Can anyone ""GROUND"" me, because i feel as though i am losing control."
3,"Just wondering what others most troublesome BPD symtom is? 
For me it is angery outbursts, purely verbal outbursts. It ruins things for me over and over again. I manage a new job, new friendship or relationship for up to a year before I let a mood swing get the better of me and then hell pours out my mouth."
3,"Emotions are so intense for me. Out of nowhere. I'm sure they are for you too (obviously).
But sometimes my emotions are so intense, my body-- or mind, whatever-- will literally just shut down. Like I won't feel anything. I become stone cold. I don't care what happens, or who I lose, or what I say, or anything. Just a wall. 
It usually takes me a day or two, sometimes three, to kind of snap back and be like what the f*ck did I just do? Why did I act like that? That is not how I feel and now they think I'm a cold as*hole. When in reality, I just have so many feelings, all at once, I just can't... deal with it? 
I'm trying really hard to be able to communicate without shutting down or saying things that I don't mean. But sometimes it's just too much. 
Does anyone else deal with this? Or have any tips? Thx."
3,"Part of why I signed up here was to end my addiction to Twitter because I realized it doesn't go well with BPD. I'm always triggered if I'm not interacted with much and all of that. I had friends there but I felt like they didn't really like me much, they were just being nice.

 I honestly think if you're not one of those super popular mental health cutesy chicks, who have like 4k followers while following 25, you end up feeling invalidated and stuff... At least I did. 

It's a shame, too. I think all of us battling mental health deserves the same treatment and care. It just wasn't healthy so here I am. 

By the way, I spend so much time online because I have agoraphobia, a severe anxiety disorder that causes panic attacks in public."
3,"Hello,
    Tomorrow I have an appointment with a therapist. It will be my first in years, mostly because my appointments did not go well back then. I know what changes I want and why I want them.  If there are any suggestions to helping make this work that would be great. I don't want to go numb or feel distant at my appointment, which happened automatically before. Getting angry happened as well and that didn't help, but left future appointments with me feeling not present like I couldn't connect not just with the therapists but with me (shell feeling). However, when I left every reason that I was there was back with me. Thank you"
3,"Well I did it again.. 
I set up a dating profile. This will end two ways 
1. I'll delete the account within a day or two 
2. I'll go on dates fall for someone and end up hurt through my own insecurities or picking the wrong person just to have someone because I don't want to be lonely 

Anyone get stuck in this cycle?"
3,"..but I know I won't mean that later I'm just feeling overwhelmed. Why do small things add up to me wanting to hurt myself? My son accidentally headbutted me and cut my lip, my fiance knew this but when he came out of his office he didn't ask how I was. He went upstairs came down and went back to work. So obviously he's angry at me for being cross with our son when I got hurt. I mean he's probably not but that's what I'm thinking. And I was trying to make the kids lunch but him going back to work made them cry. And so now I want to tell him I hate him. And I feel so angry and stressed I want to hurt myself. I won't, but the urge is there. And then I start feeling like I'm a terrible mum because I keep trying to finish cleaning the kitchen but my son wants me to play with him and I've had to tell him I can't right now. I wish I was just numb and didn't have to feel anything. I hate these strong emotions 🙁"
3,Finally saw a psych. He asked me 2903480239 questions and he says he thinks I have had ADHD since I was a little girl. The impulsive behavior (the thing that makes me believe I had BPD the most) is a result of not being treated.  I have been told I have BPD and now ADHD. What the fuck. I am so confused. He prescribed me concerta. Has anyone else had a similar experience. I am giving up hope. I just want to get better.
3,"""I cant speak for everyone's experience ""

Ok. I was thinking this morning how would I explain to someone what a typical day is for me.
So here it is.
I wake up in the morning 9/10 times I have a headache.  I lay in bed until I quiet the noise in my head, when it lessons (but not completely disappears) I make myself a coffee. I used to stay away from caffeine but I need it to keep me awake, I take my antidepressants antihistamines and vitamin D. Then I take painkillers for my head. Turns out the headaches are from grinding my teeth away whilst I sleep, now I know why I feel tired all the time, so my sleep isn't safe anymore either.
So im now ready to not face my day the noise in my head is still there. Now I'm going to explain how that feels.
Put your headphones in your ears, put music on that you hate, put it on low but not too low, then put it on loop. Now. Get on with your day. Go to work make decisions do your normal day routine.  
By the end of that day you can take those headphones off and feel relieved that its over. 
I cant do that. I can press ignore from time to time. But it never goes away. I have no rest bite. 
The only thing that works is by taking the highest dose of sertraline.  
But doing that turns me into a zombie, it stops me from feeling. And my job as a carer demands that I care. Any job demands that you care. 
So I come down a little on my meds, and I start to let the flood in. It overwhelms me I break down, cry scream to the point my eyes are so puffy that one comes up with a bruise. I look like ive been through a war. And I have, my own personal war. Everyday the same rinse repeat. And you just want it to be over, you don't want to feel this way anymore it starts to effect those around you. Then you get told to, pull yourself together,  and you just look in disbelief because you think, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK IVE BEEN DOING ALL THIS TIME.
You only see the outburst you only see when ive had enough of trying to keep it all together. When im loosing it at you or those around me its because ive lost that fight you couldn't see. Because if you could see my fight! I have with myself everyday! You would admit me to a psyc ward. Or yourself. 
My partner always says, why dont you share with me before you go off.  And I say, because I wasn't ready to share, because I was still trying to pick the pieces of the threads in my brain apart to see what is going on. 
Its not that simple when dealing with your mind, firstly who wants to admit to themselves that they are weak? That's what society has always told us yeah? Hide your pain.
Well im done sharing. Its helped a little.
Thank you."
3,"And i have decided to never see her or anybody at the hospital (psychiatrist) again. Out of embarrassment. I asked them to take me out of the early intervention program and transfer me to a psychiatrist out of the hospital.

but because of bpd i feel sad about this."
3,"Sorry for grammar and spelling in advance as it very mind-consuming topic for me.
I think for a very short marriage we had and overall not that long of relationship I can write a book on taking a train to hell and back. 
Aside from loving her part of the reason, I proposed to her and we got married is to help her overcome the fear of abandonedonment.
In sort - it didn't help at all.
I have educated myself onBPD to the best of my abilities. I have a therapist now because of this. My wife has one as well. But at this point it is clear that even my therapist can’t offer anything as a reasonable way of dealing with my wife issues. And she is not just therapist but also a clinical psychiatrist.
In a way the reason I’m posing this as I have no other place just to find some words of comfort and understanding.
Over the time I lost a lot of personal integrity and self-respect and overall question myself and personal traits that were so valuable for me.
I’m a business owner and over the years to be successful I have trained to be emotionally intelligent with staff. Empathy was a good trait to develop.
I used that in the beginning of our relationship where BPD started to show up in my then GF character. But her systematic raging aggression for absolute zero reasons, many of which she doesn’t remember, brought me to the points where I started to show aggression in return. It took many incidents but eventually I was proven that there is a limit. Let me just note that there is no physical abuse on ether side or name calling.
It actually even helped a little and she stopped for couple weeks to be aggressive.
Soon she stated even more amped up rage outbursts justifying it by previous anger and being upset me “leaving her”.
“Leaving her” was couple times when I said she has to stop for this relationship to work. That is also being constantly used as justification for her outbursts. 
I have to say that in a way I guilt trip myself in to this marriage.
I never was blind stupid but emotions took the best of me. Despite I realized the vicious circle of lashing back out to her and was able to control myself most of the time I still had episodes where I showed signs of anger. And that’s all what it takes to have justification for her actions. 
It took my therapist some work to explain to me that eventually it would happen. And when I had to suppress myself for anger it showed in unrelated situations and people.
I’m ashamed to admit that I almost got in to street fights because this is the only way I could cope with my now own anger. There is so much more but the point it I took responsibility for everything: falling in love, marrying sooner then should while red flags were all over, my previous lashing out.
I did the best I could in this situation and learned a lot about my own emotions and human behavior overall. But the situation with my wife remains the same and while her aggression became more “stealth” its there, just more manipulative. 
In short I was placed in the position of being responsible for her happiness. Yes, Im aware that this is not ok or better say mission impossible. 
I fail at this “mission” over and over and dealing with guilt tripping blame.
So I think the only thing I have left is throw in the towel. But actually in a final way, no BS. Seems logical as I have exhausted all other options many times. 
And yet - even after all this I’m questioning myself. Did I do everything possible to save this relationship? Can perhaps I give it more time? Some other stuff that I use almost always to full myself to keep trying.
Where is a cut off line? Is there anything person who has BPD or have a spouse with one can say something about it. I will take in to consideration any advice. Perhaps some words of encouragement that I’m not a terrible person. I loved this woman but love can go only so far and now it feels like I have to end this or I will basically sacrifice myself for no particular good outcome."
3,"i had a mental breakdown 2 months ago, and it just ended about a week ago. I was extremly unstable, and experiencing psychotic delusions. Way more than my usual, like, literally every 15 seconds, my mood would change drastically. I would go from screaming in rage to crying to calm in less than one minute. (Not an exaggeration)  Now, it is all over, and i feel numb. It does not feel normal to me. I know how horrible those mood swings were, but i never feel this numb. Will my emotions ever come back?  I hate to say, but i'm so used to the unstable version of myself, it feels normal and i miss it.   I just want my emotions back, this is hell on earth and it's so much worse than the explosive mood swings."
3,Why I can't feel good when I'm not impulsive and just I feel better doing stupid things? I feel something but that things are bad And I try to not do that and I feel so empty again.
3,"Hi everyone, my struggle at the moment is about trusting my intuition & reason vs self-doubt related to BPD patterns.

Premise: I might be going through a form of depression, which I am not used to anymore at all since I got sober from alcohol 7 yrs ago, and which I'm scared of because I spent a long time there before sobriety.

Having said that, in the past few months I've been unsatisfied with my current therapist, I feel like we've reached a point where she can't help me anymore and although I feel it's absolutely, perfectly reasonable and proactive to try something else (specifically EMDR for trauma), I also realise that my life is too unstable at the moment to change therapists.  One part of me knows I must try something else to unblock, another part of me is so starved of any human contact, that losing this weekly presence that has been there 4 years seems impossible to do, too dangerous - there wouldn't be anyone left, literally, I don't have a single friend I trust.

Whenever there's conflict with the therapist and I expose my anger, which is sometimes directed at her, but which I really need to express, she suggests we split.  And this morning there was conflict, and after she suggested we split, she suggested that I might be abandoning her to avoid abandonment. Is it because I need to face conflict and am afraid I will be abandoned if I make any difficulty, I wonder?  Am I devaluing the therapist so I can abandon her (by ghosting, or breaking up dramatically) because I don't know how to be active, how to choose to separate and go through with it (this would be self-sabotage, right?)?  But doesn't it look more like she can't take conflict?  After all this person is just another human being... Here's where the self-doubt starts working, and rationalisation around moving on kicks in.

Re self-sabotage, in general one of my BPD traits is to devalue people when I feel uncomfortable, but usually, if it's not a trauma based response of wanting to flee when I get triggered, I feel uncomfortable because the relationship isn't serving me, I feel uncomfortable for good reason, and I would like to move on, or detach progressively, but don't know how to do it... 

The other thing that comes to mind is cognitive dissonance, again related to trauma. Two different parts that don't communicate are trying to do their own thing.  The part that wants to move on isn't acknowledging the vulnerable part that needs a friend there no matter what.  So that's where the self-sabotage comes into place.

Oh dear, I could really do with some more insight.  Not sure if anyone here is a therapist?"
3,I agree with my therapist that I might have Schizoaffective disorder. I was diagnosed with that before. But my psychiatrist believes I have BPD and he never listens to me.
3,"I've had enough. Knowing my poor hand-eye coordination and motor skills, this probably won't work. I just want to nap during the day or just be unconscious."
3,"soo i have two really close Friends and it literally switches all the time. sometimes i dont care About one of them and obsess about the other and sometimes its the other way around.

has anyone else experienced something like this?"
3,My daughter aged 25 often goes for walk at 8 pm and comes back late at 11 pm which is very very risky considering that roads are deserted .No amount of reasoning with her helps . She has been diagnosed with borderline personality and probably has depression .Why does she take risks like going out so late?
3,"So, my bf and I have been together for a year. I have a two year old daughter. Given covid happening and my work not bringing in enough money, and me getting back on my feet since leaving my daughter's father, I moved into a one bedroom apartment. The bedroom is my daughter's room and I made the living area like a little studio type set up for me. 
My bf has his own place literally right around the corner. However, most of his time is spent here. Like all of it really. He calls this his home etc. 
Well, a few days he said I make him feel trapped (or this place does). We have had some issues about me feeling abandoned when he leaves to go with friends, but things have gotten better. Even to the point where I will make him make plans.  I have been really proud of myself about the progress I have made and that we have something healthy. So this comment just hit me out of nowhere. I got so upset and I just shut down and went completely numb. I made him go home. 
We talked the next day and he said all the right things. And I dont want him to feel unhappy being with me. Or feel like he can't have anyone besides me in his life. I want him to be happy and I really want a healthy relationship. He said most of his feelings are self-inflicted because he doesn't believe he can go out without me being upset, although when I pointed out times where I have improved, he agreed and said it's all in his head. 
I went to his place last night to watch the fights and kind of do a date night type thing. We had a great time. But still in my head I can't stop thinking about how he's unhappy with me. And now after his comments, I do feel like he is pulling away and doesn't want me. Despite him saying otherwise. I do want to work on this with him and show him he can have others in his life besides me, but now with this thought in my head, I think it's going to be harder. I feel like all the progress I've made is just... gone. With that one comment. I'm scared I'm going to continue to hyper-fixate on it and ruin my relationship.

It sucks."
3,"Hi Everyone, I'm new to this (and any other) forum. I'm not on social media, but hope I can become a regular part of this forum - although I'm not sure I have much to offer. 
To begin I was just wondering, from your experience, what are the chances of me getting proper dbt therapy in Devon? As with most, when I've engaged with services, I've been bounced around a bit. Hence not getting the correct diagnosis for decades, nor the right treatment. 

Thanks for any thoughts you might have :)"
3,In work 5 hours of a 12 hour shift to go and I just want to go home 😥😢😭
3,"Will I be on meds for the rest of my life or can people manage BPD without medication?

I feel my meds don't do anything apart from give me side effects. 

Is anyone on this forum off meds? How has it been for you so far? What are your opinions about medication such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, anti-anxiety and any other medications you may be taking? ✌️"
3,"Hello, I'm interested to know how everyone manages their work life. Do you suggest full time or part-time? Are there any jobs you have found cause it to become worse or have helped? 
I'm struggling with my job at the moment, I've recently returned after 5 weeks off sick and I'm wondering whether it was the right decision to return."
3,"My head is all over the place with worry. Had a session with my therapist yesterday. She has said I am not fit to work. Basically, I could go back but she feels that within days, weeks of going back I will be off again. My employers need to know how long it's going to take as I work in a Day Nursery they have to manage staff ratios. I feel I just need time to stop life and focus on getting myself well. My attendance record is appalling because I have never given myself the time I need. My issue is money. I'm currently getting SSP which is terrible. Is there anything else I could claim. Thanks in advance xx"
3,"** online pen pal would be a blessing 


Hey world , Well where do i start, i have faced many challenges with my mental health since as young as i can remebeber but i think 16 was the real point where i was so aware of having bad mental health. I have always battled with what i was informed was anxiety and depression , reoccuring self injurious behaivours and suicidal ideation . I had a real break down at around 23 as my partner at the time left me because i had been to much for him . Ive always had rocky relationships , im always to much for people . I attach quickly and can be very demanding to say the least . I have on and off battled with the same demons throughout the last couple years , changing various medications never being able to find one that suits. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia at the age of 24 . Recently everything came to a head, i wanted /still often want to die, but id reached a point where i couldnt control the demons . As a result i had a psychiatrist assesment and i about three weeks ago now was diagnosed with :
Emotionally Unstable Personality Dissorder
So here i am trying to muddle through the overwhelming thoughts and the urges to repeatedly hurt myself, while attending DBT twice weeksly. Im very lonely although i have a very supportive family, i have friends who tell me to just cheer up . Im feeling lonely in terms of my diagnoses and would love to speak to some individuals who are on this journey to who would also like someone to chat to ."
3,"So, I consider myself a funny person. I like picking on people and making jokes. However, sometimes when my partner does it to me, I get unusually offended. Even if I know it is light-hearted and not meant to hurt my feelings. I feel like I take things more personally when it's with someone close to me, like it hits me to my core. In my head I feel like I have different people talking. One is saying ""It was just a joke! It was harmless!"" and then the other is saying ""They hate you. They meant that and they've been wanting to say it for a long time. Stay mad. Overthink it until you make it a much bigger deal than it really is"".

I know it's hypocritical because I joke around too. Almost like a dish it and can't take it kind of thing. How do I not take things so personal with someone I'm in a relationship with? Or how do I think differently about this?"
3,"I think my employers want rid of me. I was taken on as Nursery support and within the next few months I was promoted to key person, I was asked  if would like the position  but since taking it my mental health deteriorated and my condition was exposed to my employers. I have asked to go back to my previous role but they are saying it is not an option. I think that rather than dismissing me they are making it difficult for me. They are an outstanding Nursery and I have been told they want to keep that status."
3,I've been in a relationship with a guy for around 10 months. He literally doesnt have a bad bone in his body and I adore him. Yet I've kept pushing him and being nasty due to my own thoughts and issues. Then felt completely abandoned by him when he couldn't come see me the one day and flipped and ended it. I've regret it since. I believe he is the love of my life and I'm struggling on how to fix this. I cant cope with how I'm feeling and feel horrendous for being so horrible and pushing him away. How can I fix this and make him realise my BPD ways arent what I'm really feeling?
3,"Firstly, Good Afternoon Everyone! I hope you are all keeping as well as possible during this rubbish spell.

I wanted to ask if anyone has any thoughts on dealing with people (with BPD) who devalue you as an individual?

I have an acquaintance who I have to work somewhat closely with. She is roundly disliked by most people in the organisation, nobody can tolerate her attitude and as such she is constantly lonely and miserable. We know she has BPD as she has told people before. I find that she immediately approaches people with an attitude that they are useless and can't do anything right. If you make a tiny error she calls people out in meetings. For example, recently I forgot to send something out on a certain day, leaving it until the next day to send it - this made no difference to the project... she made a huge fuss in the meeting.

She claims that nobody helps or supports her despite the fact people go out of their way to make an effort. It seems she thinks that everyone is incompetent and she acts out quite impulsively to things that upset her (e.g. copying in senior managers into complaint-filled emails so that everyone is aware of your alleged screw up). She then gets upset when people gently point out how unhelpful this is.  

She went to mental health services and had a long wait. She said she told the person that they have done nothing for her when they finally gave her therapy, rather than feeling thankful she just started that same pattern with the poor woman who is trying to help her. 

I try to feel compassionate toward her because clearly she has alienated everyone in her life AND at the same time it is extremely hard to feel anything but anger and dread whenever I see her. 

Any tips on this? Managers are terrified she will make a complaint to HR re: her mental health problem and being victimised and so they are very gentle with her but this is causing the whole team to hate working there which is a shame because it wasn't like that before she started there last year."
3,Why does my sick note say recurrent depression when I was told by a psychiatrist I had emotional unstable personality? Feel like I'm not going to be believed
3,"I'm sure you can relate. Or at least I hope you can. The lack of identity is exhausting. I watch something, like Survivor and suddenly I'm looking up how to have wavy beach hair all the time. The next day, literally the next day, watching Desperate Housewives and I think how good Susan looks so I'm looking up the clothes she wears. And great there's a Desperate Housewives Susan perfume. Maybe I'll get some Desperate Housewives memorabilia around Susan. I hate it! Today I don't know who I am. I guess I'll let you know after I've watched TV for a bit. How do you deal with this? I get so invested in the person I've decided to dress like. I want to act like them and dress like them. And then all of that just disappears into thin air. Until the next one comes along. It feels crazy to me."
3,"Today I was feeling tired and fragile. I am at work and my internal voice keeps telling me no one likes me. 

I kept sweating and getting anxious all day and in the end I kept picking the wounds I made last week and that got stiched up by the doctor. 

I am trying to make peace with myself hating me. But feeling that others hate me breaks me every day. My arm is hurting and I am scared. Scared my colleugues hate me. The people here hate. I want to go home and hide in bed. I am such an idiot :("
3,"I’ve been misdiagnosed my whole life. It wasn’t until I was about 23 that I got a BPD diagnosis and everything clicked. I’m not on any meds (by choice) and part of me has accepted this as my life and my normal. However, I disassociate often. And I also get very depressed and that’s when I feel like I can’t do this the rest of my life. I can see it’s getting worse and I can see all the people I’m hurting in the process. Even if I do become okay with this being my normal, it’s not okay for others and the few people I deeply care about. I’m at a loss for words and direction. I just know I can’t go on like this. I will end up losing everything and everyone I love the most if I do."
3,"I feel like the years when I was in school and being bullied are still repeating. Like time stopped in that school and my classmates and teachers are still there laughing at me. I don't know how to move on. I'm so stupid. I should move on because all of that happened a very long time ago, but I can't and I don't know why."
3,Hello
3,"My life is getting better day by day, I have hope for a productive life, with small interruptions, can't be helped, that is just the nature of the beast I live with.  Praying all is well for everyone, love you guys.

Thank you for being here and letting me post."
3,"I haven't posted in a while. Not sure why I'm posting now either.
I guess I'm looking for something... I don't know what. Advice, understanding or something else..

Basically I have started some repetitive behaviours. Can't seem to stop myself.
I wouldn't say it is a problem just yet, however it probably could turn in to one."
3,"Hello all . I've always known something wasnt quite right and I recently came across the criteria for bpd during a mental health first aid course. 

I'm a very emotional person and cry a lot . I can feel on top if the world one day and have lots of postive ideas then quickly sink back down to feeling empty ( usually if I feel I have done something wrong or ""bad"")

I'm petrified of being abandoned and will swing from being clingy and paranoid about my partber cheating or withdraw if I feel I'm not good enough. 

After I separated from my ex husband 3 years ago ( he had an emotional affair) I felt like I lost my identity , a family unit was my indentity and i felt like i withdrew from the kids ( not intentionally) it took me a lot of self reflection to realise this was because i felt like i had let them down , i know this is incredibly selfish and it wasnt intentional. 

I flit between Interests and indentity and it's so confusing.  It doesnt take much for my self esteem to drop and feel like I'm worthless. 

I'm incredibly empathetic in understanding peoples point of view and will go out of my way to help others but a lot of the time I cant actually feel someone elses pain ( unless they are not close to me and then I can ) 

Does this sound like bpd? I am going to book in with a doctor ."
3,"I am unable to move from my chair most of the day, because I have a feeling that something horrible is going to happen when I have to get up and move around. Shortness of breath, depersonalization, dizziness, off balance. It's been keeping me from all but the most basic of taks. Does anyone else experience this?"
3,"This is something I keep asking myself. I have bpd and some others and depression. 

So I am at home a lot and then I think what to do to be kind to myself. 

But every thought is ruined. Since I am a neat and tidy person at heart. And on the rare moments I am doing real well I tend to look after my home and its all good. 

But now there is clutter. And if some people came over they would say what do you mean? It looks good. But its enough to hurt every positive thought. As I first feel the need to tidy and I have no energy for that. 

How you you all make sure to do something nice for yourself without getting distracted or troubled by things?"
3,"I feel like I'm going to lose the love of my life because I can't stop pushing him away. Last night he said I'm like two different people, sweet and loving one min and attacking him and biting his head off the next. He barely even talks to me anymore because I overthink and get paranoid over everything he feels like he's walking on eggshells. Has anyone every been able to be in a stable relationship or will I always be the problem?"
3,Who else is going to have a lonely weekend? I will be home by myself the whole time and I am already bored and feeling alone :(
3,"Hi guys. I’m new here. I just joined because I thought I could get some valuable information from people who also share BPD. I am sure you all know how you feel living with BPD. that alone is enough to deal with, but on top of that I have serious issues with my fiancée. Things have never been good with us. We have 3 kids together. From the time we started dating (12 years ago) until now, he calls me names on a daily basis. I’m pretty sure he has anger issues, and I’m almost certain he is a narcissist (yes I know the medical definition and criteria, I’m not just throwing out the term). I am not going into the abusive history (always mentally and verbal abuse, things were only physical once), but I will start with what happened today. 
I am at home 99% of my life, with the kids. He is never home, always out with his friends etc. He doesn’t currently work. He spends 0 time with us. I don’t have friends over and I don’t go out with friends, I haven’t gone out without him in over 10 years. It’s too much of a headache. I can’t even go to my dads House without being accused of being a slut, or a whore etc. 
So, my in laws have my kids for the weekend. I’m having a rough day today so I thought it would be nice for the two of us to maybe go to the mall and out to eat somewhere. I waited all day just for him to get out of bed. He finally got up at 430, we got to the mall at 6 and it closed at 7. We had just gotten there 20 minutes prior, and we were approaching the source. I said “I need to stop at the source” I guess he wasn’t paying attention or was zoned out, so I repeated myself. Again he didn’t pay attention. So we walked past it and I said “okay I guess I won’t go to the source, I can go to Best Buy instead” and he looked at me and said “next time I’m not paying attention, get my attention instead of being a stupid bitch” uhhh okay what? So I went in the source, came out, everything seemed to be okay. I didn’t bother to tell him he shouldn’t have done that because it would only create further issues. So I left it alone.5-10 more minutes of walking and I go to hold his hand. He flings his hand off me (not even subtly) and said “get off me” and I guarantee you people must’ve noticed that. There was no way not to. So I said “wow. That was embarrassing” and he proceeded to call me all the names in the book. Stupid whore, dumb bitch, etc etc etc. So I said”stop calling me names” and he said “stop saying not to call you names” so I said “stop it Nathan stop calling me names” and he said “stop saying to stop calling you names” and so I told him not to talk to me and he said “let’s just go home”. He said it in a way like a punishment. Like how you’d take your dog to it’s cage when it’s bad. So I thought what do you mean go home? We just got here and we were supposed to go to dinner. I never get the chance to leave my house much as it is. I didn’t want to goback to my cage like a bad dog. So I turned around and I walked away from him. I did this partly because I didn’t want to go home,but mostly because I was about to cry and didn’t wantto cause a fuss or a scene in the mall. I was already embarrassed enough. So I went and sat somewhere alone just to gather myself for a second. He got in his car and left, leaving me stranded at the mall. Then after he left he proceeded to accuse me of walking away from him to go cheat, how much of an unfaithful slut and whore I was, a cheap hooker, and how you can’t turn a hoe into a housewife.I called a cab. He made me take pictures of the inside of the cab to prove I indeed was in a cab. And I haven’t heard from him since. He’s not home.Even after he left I texted him and I said you can come back in at any time and we can still go eat and I’ll forget about all of this. He proceeded to call me even more names. I kept repeating myself telling him I don’t deserve to be called these names under any circumstances. Finally I broke and started swearing back at him, telling him he’s an asshole that treats me like garbage and If this is how it’s going to be forever that he can take the ring he gave me back and get out of my house. 
so I’m home now, he’s not here, not a single clue where he is. And let me tell you, I am devastated. I can’t break this cycle of abuse no matter how hard I try. If I try and defend myself it makes the situation wayyy worse. I’ve told him countless times that I can’t tolerate these names, and what it does to my mental health. Therewas one time last year that he wouldn’t stop calling me names and I snapped and started punching myself in the face and gave myself two black eyes, one that I couldn’t open for about a week. And that’s not the first time I’ve done that. When he pushes me to a point I’ll snap and punch myself. 
I know it’s easy to say “just leave” but with my bpd, it being centred around abandonment and loneliness and feeling inadequate, I choose to stay with him. Eventually he will come back and it’ll be okay...but this happens almost everyday. And he will easily blame shift, everything is always my fault, I was wrong this and that. He doesn’t take accountability for his names or for any of that. I’m always just a stupid worthless useless good for nothing bitch. Or a hoe. Or a slut. A whore. Shady. Cheating. When I’m not doing any of those things. I’m literally just trying to survive and do my best. 
I just don’t know what to do anymore and I’ve fallen back into my dark place, after what happened tonight. Please help. I’m disgustingly lonely and miserable and just looking for some advice. I’m a good person with a big heart and I don’t deserve to be berated like this by him everyday of my life. This is torture!!!"
3,"i'm sick of it

can i call it something rude"
3,Im tired about feel empty in random times. I got almost all outside but inside is a mysterious desert. I can't to try to help people because since 2020 I'm feeling so unstable. And care anothers (who deserves it)  one of few things that puts me in good mood. For the moment I'm trying to ignore that feel but is there.
3,Personally mine is the FP stereotype. I have broken my own heart too many times it destroyed me and I’ve never met anyone who understands. It took me 3 years to get over someone I didn’t even kiss when I was 11-14 because I was convinced I loved him. Sent me into a deep deep depression and I lost everything about myself. I was just a kid this illness stole my life
3,"Comorbid borderline schizoid does anyone else have this?
I would first like to start this post by making it clear schizoid is not schizophrenic- sufferers may be mistakenly diagnosed with autism instead and it is quite rare by itself.

I have been told by professionals I have schizoid/bpd after initially bpd only for PD diagnosis which I had suspected due to not fitting autism.
This mixture is as contradictory to live with as it sounds on paper- I want nothing more than to care for someone even my own family yet have no/limited empathy that makes doing so virtually impossible.
I only enjoy being by myself and not around others due to this near physical like draining feeling when around other humans IRL.
I have typical bpd behaviour but a favourite person is extremely rare for me and strangely enough only ever through online despite having close relationships with people in person and never feeling anything for them.
I feel like an alien- I feel i am in a constant tug of war with bpd wanting me to care for someone yet being unable. 
If you did not get upset when a caregiver was ill nor felt anything at all due to a lack of emotional connection how would you feel? Like someone with ASPD a sociopath or something of that sort.

Does anyone else have these two disorders combined?
What is the experience like for yourself?
My psychologist has said they find the way I think interesting and I do not blame them because this is not a typical atypical personality trait cluster!
I am hoping to relate to someone else but thank you for reading my thread I relate to usual bpd types as well.

-I do not get angry at all only at myself or if someone harms someone I care about
-I do not know what loneliness feels like but think it may be what being near people is forme which is terrible feeling so sorry lonely posters
-I have to intentionally show facial expressions and body language meaning it is tiring to behave conventionally with others face to face but I can do it fine and IME better than average.
-Not having empathy does not mean I wish harm or harm others at all I would not want to cause suffering as I know what suffering feels like for me."
3,I am now seeing a new psychiatrist. I will be honest we have gone private. She is doubting the conclusion my previous psychiatrist had about EUPD. Can a psychiatrist misdiagnose?
3,"*Note; I say the word you a lot, I don't mean you, I am just talking out into the ether, please don't take this personally. 
I hate the word hope. I hate hope full stop. People talk about hope like it's this lifeline that keeps depressive people from giving up, like hope is some cure. Hope fuels dreams, ambitions, aspirations. Hope makes you want to believe in life, so you do. But then you forget. At least I did. You forget that you didn't have hope before. You want to tell the world about your dreams, and they're so excited you got out of bed they tell you to chase those dreams, to make them true. And those people, they tell you they'll help you, and because of them, this time will be different. And because of hope, you believe them.
And then people let you down, they always do, but it's not always their fault. I have diagnosed BPD, one thing it does, is it makes the world black and white. As soon as someone betrays me, in even the smallest of ways, I can't seem to make myself forgive them, and nothing is like it was before. I push those people away, and because they don't understand me, they leave. 
So now you're alone again. But what about your dream, this thing you believed could happen, would happen, your one chance at a happy life? You try and do it alone, but it never works out. You miss things, fall behind, get overwhelmed, and the reality you believed comes crashing down around you. And what's worse is your now surrounded in what you built for this 'future'. For example I'm stuck at university, in a dream I thought I could do. Everyone believes I will be a university graduate, I'll be lucky if I survive the year. 
The world, what was supposed to be your world, is now so foreign, you've lost everything. And then you see it, your broken dream. But it's not the only one, it sits in a graveyard filled with every lost and broken dream you've had. Because bpd and depression isn't linear, it's a vicious spiral, and every new dream comes with amnesia of all the failed dreams you had before. You get so swept up in hope, you give life everything you have, and mental illness just pulls the rug from under your feet and takes it all from you. You go from flying to falling in seconds. 
It's not just the dreams that break, it's you, you break too. Alone and broken, that is where hope leads you. Hope is the most dangerous drug of them all, a silent poison. 
They say there is no hope in death, I hope they're right. I reckon most people find the absence of hope depressing, but I already have depression. For me, the absence of hope means the absence of false starts and broken dreams. Death will always be consistent in a way life is not, and for someone who is tired of the roller-coaster life her mental illness forced her onto, death has an appeal life will never have. 
I don't want hope. I don't want to hope, because I don't want to have to lose that hope. What is it Shakespeare said? ""Better to have loved and lost, than to have never loved at all."" Shakespeare obviously didn't have bpd, because losing is not worth the dreams I had. All I have are broken dreams, broken lives inside my head, and I hold hope responsible."
3,"Trigger Warning: Relationship Ending, Drug Use, Possible psychotic episode

Sorry in advance; this post is longer than I thought it would turn out. Thanks if you read to the end!

Hey everybody! I just wanted to post a situation I’ve recently been through and want to know if anyone had experienced something similar and if people think I made the completely wrong decision because I let my mind stray too much and catastrophized to the point where I believe I entered psychosis. I also haven’t been officially diagnosed with BPD but one of the doctors I talked to said I have 8 of 9 indicators and it ‘could be’ BPD- does this sound like behavior others with BPD have struggled with? Note that during all of this, I didn’t know that I had a personality/mood disorder.

I started dating ‘the girl of my dreams’ in July 2019. The way we got together wasn’t kosher at all. She was with a guy that didn’t treat her well at all and I swooped in. We set rules that nothing would happen until they broke up, but the tension got to be too much and things DID end up happening before they officially broke up. About a month of fooling around happened before their relationship was officially over, and then her and I immediately started dating. The first six months or so went incredibly well, but then my mental health began to slide slowly.

The first big incident happened when she was fired from her job. The owners insisted that she stole things and threatened to get the police involved. I thought I was incredibly supportive during that time but now looking back I’m not sure how supportive I actually was once my paranoia kicked in. After the police were mentioned I started getting paranoid thinking that police would show up at my door at any second, though she wasn’t officially living with me at that time. I let this paranoia control me and any time she mentioned the incident I became very uncomfortable and started feeling like at any moment the police would show up. That was the first time I started splitting and was thinking to myself that I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be with her and wasn’t sure if I liked the situation I was in.

After losing that job, I was able to get her on at a local eatery that I was the manager of. I was extremely excited of the prospect of working with her and was able to talk to upper management and speed along the process to get her hired ASAP. Again, things went well for the first few weeks or so. Then, she started to want to control some of the situation and help call the shots around the place with the ways we would do things, getting upset at other workers and pointing out all the flaws which in turn made me angry and see all the flaws as well. I split her again and started seeing her as a source of annoyance because I was supposed to be the manager and the one in charge of things. I started seeing her in a negative light because I felt like I was being overshadowed and that she was trying to guide me to do things the way she thought they needed to be done. Fast forward a couple more months and COVID ended that situation.

The next big incidence of splitting happened when she got a job in a place that required drug testing. Her and I both smoked a fairly moderate amount of marijuana at the time. She started as a temp and didn’t have to do a drug test; however, after a month or two they offered her a full time job and told her she would have to take a drug test. I offered to stop smoking along side her but she told me I didn’t need to do that, so I continued. She said ‘F it’ and continued smoking up until a little over a week before the test. She tried to stop but then her friend told her about a system cleanser that would cover up her urine, so she said ‘F it’ again and smoked up until two days before the test. Lo and behold, the cleanser didn’t work and she failed the test and lost the job. I lost a massive amount of respect for her after this because she kept saying ‘I’ll never get anywhere in life’, ‘why does this always happen to me’ and I couldn’t believe what I was hearing because she chose to continue smoking even though she knew she had a test coming up. This was a pretty big split in my mind and I again was questioning if I wanted to be in this relationship because of the way my mind works and the way I instantly switched her over to negative thoughts in my mind.

The last big event before my psychotic break happened right before her birthday. Over the last couple months we had started venturing into the world of LSD, I got into a really bad stretch and lost myself in substance abuse again, which has always been a pattern for me. We decided again to have some on the weekend before her birthday. I begrudgingly told her it was fine that people were over for the weekend even though I was excited to play my new console. The night happened and without going into specifics, it was a very bad trip. The next few days I was in a really bad mood and unfortunately one of those days was her birthday. In the morning when we woke up I forgot to tell her happy birthday until about two hours into the day. I had scheduled a prior therapy appointment for that day, forgetting it was her birthday weeks in advance. I didn’t want to cancel so I went ahead with the appointment, then we went to dinner. In the morning she made plans with her friend to do dinner as well since she thought I forgot about her day, so I was upset that we couldn’t have a 1-on-1 birthday dinner. I remained in a pretty bad mood throughout the day and the dinner made me have my worst split with her, to the point that I called my mom and complained about the crappy weekend. At this point I really wasn’t liking her and had nothing but negative thoughts in my head.

The next couple days she had a (rightfully earned) blowup at me and told me she was close to her breaking point. This led me to a breakdown where I felt like a complete piece of shit, I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and put on antipsychotics. Over the next month and a half my mental health really began to slide on the meds and she started snap chatting friends and then spending a lot of time at work with a new ‘friend’ and starting to Snapchat them progressively more and more. I started overthinking every day that she was cheating on me with this new guy, why would she need to be talking to this guy and “supporting him during hard days” at work and spending the entire day together (their shift ended 4 hours apart and he would stay). I worked the same job, a janitorial job, and ended up sitting in my closet for most of the day crying, having panic attacks and calling my mom and panicking and not really getting much work done. This got to the point where I stopped the antipsychotic meds because they were making me worse and making my paranoid thoughts worse and worse- this is where I thought my Bipolar 1 diagnosis was wrong.

Now about a month ago, and this is where things got really bad. I had split her so bad that I didn’t trust her anymore, I was in a constant panic she was cheating on me and really didn’t like her anymore because she didn’t want to talk to me, just be on her phone constantly and Snapchat her ‘friend’. I confronted her about the snap chatting and she said that it’s her phone, she’s going to keep doing it, and she didn’t understand my jealousy. My mental health got so bad that I didn’t want to live in this pain anymore. I went home with my parents for a week to ‘give her space’ and the night I left her ‘friend’ came over and spent 9 hours at the house.

When I got back home I had enough and I told her I would be leaving in April to get a landscaping job back in my hometown where my parents live. She supported the decision, told me to absolutely do it and thats what would be best, and said we could work on this long distance. The snap chatting kept getting worse to where she would tilt away from me when doing it and ‘go to bed’ two hours earlier than normal and wouldn’t actually sleep, just go back to Snapchat more.

I was scared for my sanity as my mental health was at its lowest point now. I finally talked to her and asked her if she needed a break and she said she thought that would be the best thing so I told her I would be moving home that weekend instead. The week before I moved she avoided me as much as possible and ended up going over to her “friend’s” house two nights for 5 or more hours each time and constantly on her phone when she was home with me. I asked her to not use it during our movie night and she got upset saying it felt like ‘an obligation’ now and was visibly flustered. The weekend came, we said our goodbyes, and she gave me a massive hug and kiss goodbye which was out of the theme of the previous week.

Right upon getting home (an hour and a half drive) I saw she changed her relationship status almost immediately to single and started posting things about moving on the next day. This made me uncomfortable and confused because I thought it was a break, not a full-on break-up. I’m living home now and she is paying me rent to stay in the house I own. I went over to deliver the lease and found evidence her ‘friend’ is now staying there in the bed with her. I wanted to patch things up with her and ‘come back’ and she told me no, she’s working on finding herself and getting her mental health back. When signing the lease I told her under no circumstance is her ‘friend’ allowed to live there and she promised, but the next day one of my family members was there and saw the car parked in my driveway while she was working, basically confirming that he is living there. I’m torn apart now and can’t stop the ruminating thoughts. I have since seen another doctor who told me he doesn’t believe it’s Bipolar 1 (which I had never thought it was to begin with) and that I have 8 of the 9 indicators for BPD instead. I have come to accept this more as it seems my behavior has fit with this disorder much more with my intense abandonment fears, paranoia, and irritable mood triggered by the smallest things.

My question is, did I overreact and ruin things by ‘running away’ home? Did I cause all of this because of my terrible behavior? Do these behaviors sound like behavior stemming from BPD? I didn’t realize that I was so angry and reactive in the moment, not now until I started looking back at it and seeing my patterns of love/dislike towards her. Did I manifest cheating because of my paranoid thoughts and communication with her? I’m sitting here broken and not knowing how to move forward because I think she was also my FP and feel like I have jeapordized everything and the potential of ever reconnecting in the future.

Thanks to all that read the full thing, I know it was very long!"
3,"Lately I feel so worried about myself im  trying to channel bad negative thoughts constantly and feel no escape/relief feeling like theres no way out, I doubt myself see the worst of me , I feel like I'm a blank canvas and my dark thoughts are painting this ugly picture of myself ..I have bpd I'm scared ..I don't want to feel like I have to kill myself to find relief.. It's a dangerous if it gets worse and tbh I I'm so confused on how to describe my mental state I just no I never suffered like this before.. too many intrusive thoughts, too much guilt from past mistakes, feel like my heads degrading ..sorry if I make little sense I'm just worried no1 to really talk things through I wish someone was here to tell me I'm ok and make me feel better"

3,"Hi everybody,

I hope you are well.

I am new here, joined today and I am hoping to make friends and find a supportive group of people who understand what a rollercoaster this is.

I have struggled with BPD since my diagnosis about 8 years ago. I got diagnosed after a failed suicide attempt, googled BPD and was so ashamed that I never spoke about it again. I have spent the last 8 years coping (sometimes not healthily) but coping without meds or therapy. My abandonment issues, intrusive thoughts, lack of trust and my impulsivity were still very much at the forefront of my life but they were manageable without an erratic episode.

Fast forward to the Sunday just past and I had a complete and utter break down. I lost it, I don’t even know what was the trigger but I completely lost my mind, had an extremely depressive episode, took an overdose and ended up in hospital. I haven’t been able to snap out of this episode since. I am in so much pain, the feeling in my chest is unbearable.

The hospital has referred me to healthy minds (uk based) so I am waiting for that referral to come through. 

Does anybody have any advice for someone who has finally accepted their diagnosis and wants to get help? Are there particular websites/treatment/medication/resources that have helped?


I want to get better, I don’t want this to control my life or my relationships. 

Thank you."
3,"I’m really not doing great atm, feel like I can’t cope with this much longer.

So I’ve had this fear for ages my friend and boyfriend are talking because their active times match up all the time. Now I’m worried they are meeting up on Saturdays even though we are in lockdown. Or maybe just phoning each other. Last weekend I didn’t hear from my boyfriend from 5pm - 8pm. My friend went offline at 5:20pm and came back online immediately after him. Then he played video games the rest of the night. 

Now tonight the same has happened. This time my friend went offline 3:45pm. My boyfriend was talking to me between 4-5:20pm and I have heard nothing since it’s 10pm now. At 8:40pm my friend came back online and I told my self give it half an hour and if he reappears then he must of been out with her as that’s how long it would take him to get home. 20 minutes later and he signed onto his ps4. Is something going on between them? I asked them and they said no but I’m worried. I know he didn’t wake up until 4ish as he was up all night playing video games and so he could of fallen back asleep and she isn’t online much on Saturdays anyway. They both also don’t have transport (unless he got his bike insured again) and live with parents but it’s so odd and I’m worried and can’t get it out my head even though people say I’m being crazy."

3,"im a bit useless really ,a big fat lump with no motivation or of no help to anyone
my replies on here are so useless

i give money away to feel like im helping

i don't have as much money as i used to so that is hard
i just wish i had more words to say of comfort to those on here

to be fair im going through a crisis ,but aren't i always?
this one is genuine though as others see it as one not just me x"

does anybody know why it gets better with age? how can i fast forward it to get better now instead of waiting for years to make it better?"

Im unsure whether this is even a thing. Whether its medication or BPD.  Its a touchy subject for myself so it maybe for others it might not.

Can bpd effect a womens ability to have an a full sexual experience?"

I appreciate it!"
3,"Some days i require more attention or is it a build up of not receiving the attention i want from my partner unconsciously it then feels like all of a sudden i require it. My partner like to play video games and games on her phone etc. i just feel and see every evening she's gaming till like 10, the other night i said oh are we watching a film as it was 9pm, which was her idea earlier on in the day. I was looking forward to it as it had been a while. She said she wanted another few games to unlock something and she had forgot all about watching a film so i said ok and if you dont fancy a film its ok. well 45 min later i go upstairs to settle to watch film she implied twice i bore her said it jokingly. She was on and off her film and only cuddled into me half way through the film and fell asleep. But gives me attention when she wants sex, may be im reading to much into it x"
3,"TRIGGER WARNING: possible sexual abuse and physical abuse 

This is my second rant in 2 days, this is going to be short. 

This one is about my mom. My mom has had really bad anger issues, but even if she and I have a lot of fights I know she loves me. But recently, I realized there was something she used to do that now, looking back, kinda seemed so bad(?). My mom liked to joke around by touching my private area when I was younger (I had clothes on) , it was her way of ""joking"". It used to make me so angry. You know that feeling that when someone touches you, it like sticks and you want to rip your skin apart because that feeling won't just go away. And every time I would fight back she'd either flaunt herself in a teasing way, like ""you can touch me too"", or we'd get into full blown fight (that includes kicking, hair pulling, idk). My mom liked showing me that she loved me by aggressively kissing me, or she'd shove her whole body on to me (I'm kinda underweight and my mom's on the chubbier side). It never occurred to me that it might be sexual harrasment, until a couple of months back, when she did it again and I went into a full blown rage attack, and I just kept hitting myself repeatedly. I know she means it as a joke. I've told her that I don't like being touched, but then she starts crying and saying that I don't love her anymore. I remember googling signs that a child is being sexually abused, and I could've sworn 8 year old could relate to a lot of it. My mom keeps bringing up how I used to love being touched when I was younger while sleeping, but back then I was so scared of the dark, I couldn't sleep unless I had physical contact of some sort. But for some reason if my dad was home, it would go away, so it stopped when my dad stopped working graveyard shifts. Since then I hate it when people try to touch me when I sleep. But my mom still does it, and then when I push her away, she'll say that  "" I'm not doing anything wrong"" , or, ""you've changed"", or she'll start hitting me. I'm honestly confused, because I know she means it as a joke. She used to choke me when I was young, and stare at me creepily while I was laughing and then just kiss me aggressively on the cheek, and I used to kick her away. It wasn't until recently that I realized that I sometimes find physical contact from my mom so repulsive. I guess that's what sets both my parents apart, my dad used to give me the silent treatment, while my mom loves to obsess over me. I sometimes feel like my mom is trying to live vicariously through me. Like I'm her doll/punching bag. She can go from treating me like a princess to just sheer aggression. This memory of my grandmom covering me in a blanket, and me screaming ""I can't breathe"" keeps coming back to me. My mom probably went through so much shit, and I'm terrified I'm slowly turning like her. I am mother's support system, she vents to me most of the time, and that's what I do whenever my mom and I have a violent fight. I feel bad for the people who had to hear the same thing over and over again. 

So my question is; is this sexual abuse? 

I just can't wait to get out of here, but I genuinely feel like I'm going to keep coming back here. 

Ahhh this ended up being a long rant. 

Thanks for listening."
3,"another unexpected death in the family, 
 I am not coping well."
3,just wrong
3,"Hi! So I'm kinda new here. I read a lot of posts about bpd and hpd and I think i might have one of them and I'm scared of both(but one more than the other). I always knew i was not a good person no matter how many times my friends will tell me that I'm not. I feel like I've faked all of the times I've shown concern towards them just to make myself feel better. I've always struggles with temper issues even when I was younger, I'm 18 now. I haven't done extreme things for attention, but I have done a lot to say the least. Like, I think i lied about having anxiety and depression, I say I think BC at that time I believed it but now looking back at it I may not have. To start off in 5th and 6th grade I got into trouble BC I wouldn't do my assignments and complete my notes (I got good grades tho, so I never saw what the problem was) my parents were so mad and they constantly treated me like liar BC I managed to hide it from them for a long time, and at one point I remember just holding a bottle of pills or smthng and crying so hard BC I just wanted to do it. But looking back now I don't  think I was actually going to do it. My parents are fine a bit physically abusive, my mom never spanked me but she pulls my hair a lot and kicks (not to the point of bruising), but thing is that I was aggressive too and I'd fight back. 

Okay anyways I'm ranting, point is in 7th grade I had a crush on my teacher, BC she humiliated me and I liked it. I actually thought she genuinely cared and the whole class knew and they told her, and she sort off put it off like I was her ""daughter"" and that used to send me off, this was around the time that I would cry non stop during weekends BC I missed her, I was basically obsessed and the people around me had heard A LOT OF IT. it went on until 8th grade, I realized that she was a horrible teacher. I also made claims that I had anxiety and depression, which I feel terrible about now. Around this time I met my best friend and I loved her sm, but she had a lot going at home and she was actually depressed. When I'm alone people don't see it but I get angry alot and I'd hit myself a lot, not to the point where I'd bleed or get bruises, but sorta out of frustration. Point is I'd feel a pang of jealousy whenever my best friend would meet someone else, I would get so mad but I knew that these thoughts were irrational so I'd keep it inside. 

I think around this I felt empty when I was alone but I hardly remember and it's frustrating me a lot, BC I feel like I'm lying for sympathy. All I remember was that I'd do nothing and my parents would get so mad, I'd be on my phone all day until my parents got back home, I wouldn't shower, I would binge on snacks and skip meals and I'd eat on the bed and that really triggered my parents. It happened all the way till 10th grade and my dad got home and he started drinking and he got so angry BC everything was a mess and he hit me that night with a belt. And he was so angry he kept hitting the pillow alot and it scared me, so the next day I broke down, I never meant to go to the supervisors office. But my teacher saw me and I felt sorta ashamed BC I knew if I told them that my bed was a mess they wouldn't believe me so I said part of the story. And I vented and I put my parents in such a bad light and I remember my story was very inconsistent. I told them not to tell my mom BC she'd tell my dad. But they called anyways, they kept telling me that they couldn't protect me at home and stuff and if I was being molested (I said no). My dad ignored for a month and I still feel guilty about it now, I wish I never said that. I cried that day for 2 hours but when I went back to class and talked to my friend I was fine and my teachers saw that. I know that one of the signs for hpd was mood swing shift and exaggerating experiences and I'm starting to get scared, I barely remember if this happened but I think they told me not to do anything stupid, so I must've told them I was going to kill myself or smthng but I don't remember. I have a very unstable relationship with my parents, both of them have had problems. I think my mom has hpd and I must've gotten it from her, she's loud in public and sometimes she screams randomly, sometimes I feel like she's exaggerating some of the symptoms that feels, and I see myself in her and I'm so scared. I promised myself I wouldnt be like my parents. 

So I shifted places about two years ago and I went to my moms hometown to complete my education and I pretended that I didn't know how to speak the language and I told them that I understood the language even though I could speak and understand. I hated my accent, and I though people would like me more, I'm trying to get over that. 

I'm not so keen on trying to look the prettiest, however I know that there's a part of me that wants to be the skinniest person in the room, and I don't have any eating disorders. I sometimes watch my calories, I sometimes binge, but nothing to serious. I am underweight, but I hate when people telling me that I'm gaining weight, I like compliments about how skinny I am, and it feeds my ego. I really don't know what's wrong with me. I am easily persuadable, I have trouble keeping relationship with people, sometimes I'll stray away BC I'm bored, or I'll go from liking you to hating and back and forth. But I feel like I'm exaggerating. I'm not the life of the party, but when I'm with a group that I'm very close with I tend to be the loudest and do weirdest things, but when I'm alone I hate unwanted attention. Ive told a teacher about my mom and our fights and now I feel like I've cried wolf way too many times. I've vented to alot of people about my parents, and I've felt I put them in such a bad light just to get sympathy. I feel like i keep bringing up the past so much just to get sympathy. Even if I just met a person I'll vent to them and then I'd feel embarrassed about it and then I'll push them away. I know I'm scared of people leaving, but now I'm not sure anymore. I'm not sure if I've made up this entire thing in my head, so I can seem like the victim when I'm not. I sometimes have fantasies where I'm on a realty TV show and I'm talking about things I've done and stuff, or I'm the main character in a show or smthng. Worst part is Im having suspicions that might have adhd and autism, but I think I'm just lazy, I honestly don't want to do same thing when I was young where I claimed I had depression when I probably did not. I just wanna know if anyone knows what I'm feeling. I used to stare at myself in the mirror for hours making different poses. I really really want to be considerate and listen more than talk, I want to go back and just change everything. I HATE EVERYTHING THAT I'VE DONE. 
Just AHHHHHHH!!!!!! I don't know, I feel bad for the people who I've projected on. I've hurt people In the past BC I couldn't control my temper. I want to blame my parents so bad, but I'm 18 now I can't do that anymore. I think I'm sad loser who craves attention all the time. I know that alot of people went through so much, but they're kind and genuine. I've done so much more in the past and lied a lot, and stolen food from the pantry because I had a bit of a binge problem. I stole cookies from my grandmother's store when I first came here and the entire Quarantine my grandmom was so suspicious of mom and they had so many full blown fights and I know it's my fault, and she sometimes projects it on to me, but I can't blame her. And I'm so sad BC I can't blame my mom, BC her mom was terrible to her too. Anyways I'm just ranting, UGHHHH!! I'd really like to know your stories and I'm sorry if you made it this far, BC this post is literally pointless lmao."
3,"I am feeling so incredibly stuck. There is too much to explain but I just can not stop doing things wrong and disappointing my wife. I feel like I can change and improve but then I'm just too lazy to actually make any positive changes. For example, I know that regular meditation is good for me but I only ever do it for a week or two and then it drifts off.

My wife then gets pissed that I haven't followed through with something I promised again and I get defensive or just completely shut down emotionally. Then the whole thing repeats again and again!!"

Long story short I was at home with my husband and my husband was just on his game most of the day which triggered me as i was doing the housework which seemed all day. I ended up getting overwhelmed and was crying which turned into anger and I was shouting saying all the things that is bothering me (random stuff) and how my husband doesn't always help around the home ect, which he said he will help more. 

My behaviour was out of control which hasn't been like that for ages! I then ended up physically punishing myself because I was so angry and more annoyed that I had let myself get out of control..a vicious cycle. Now because of that outburst I feel all the things i wanted to say to my husband didnt matter because i didnt mention in a calm way and now the guilt of getting angry has taken over it all. I feel very guilty I acted like this and I cant stop feeling like I am bad. How do you deal with guilt after an emotional outburst?

thanks for reading this far!"
3,"I say perceived because quite often, the feeling is in my head. Someone uses a slightly less patient tone than usual, someone's wording is slightly more passive agressive, maybe someone even gets frustrated with me over something.

I take it as rejection.

I've stopped lashing out at people, but instead I shut down and have ill thoughts about myself and whether or not I even deserve a place in the world if I'm really so unloveable.
Just reading what I just typed makes me feel like despite my age, 30, I'm still just some emo tween.

I feel so dumb for being so dependent on the people I like liking me, and I know just because someone is in a mood or doesn't speak the same way they normally do, doesn't mean they hate me or are getting sick of me. But then why does my brain keep telling me that's the case?
Why am I ready to cry or run away whenever someone takes a harsh tone with me?

How can I get more resilient?"
3,"God, do I hate him. Ever since the day he was born. He is an ugly, disrespectful, whiny, annoying, stupid piece-of-shit. ""Oh WhAt Is WrOnG wItH yOu, KidS aRe GrEaT-"" fuck off. I don't like kids but with my nephew that is the understatement of the year. I just don't understand how my sister can love that demonic spawn, I really can't. If I was her and was given the opportunity to go back in time and not have the little-shit I would accept so fast. Then again, I don't really understand love as a whole. I see parent/child and dating relationships and I just can't really imagine myself in their shoes. I can't imagine feeling that way. I had a relationship in the past that lasted for 2 years (which my therapist had labeled as 'an obession') but now that we're through, the person could catch on fire for all I care. I don't know. I feel this immense satisfaction whenever the kid gets in trouble, I live for it. The raw and unbridled rage I feel at his slightest act is enough to make me want to punch walls, break things, scream, curse. I hate him!!! Anyway, I think it's worth mentioning that I've never laid hands on him or plan to do so, so you can call off the cavalry now. Thanks."
3,Hate hate hate myself I feel so stupid I feel so so beyond stupid why am I like this I just want to pass away
3,"I don't. Human relations are weird and hard. I don't understand parental love, friendship love or even romantic love. I had a relationship for 2 years but realized that was more of an obsession. So yes, I don't understand love.

But for them? Anything.

People might think they're not real and fictional, but they're not me. They're everything to me. I wish I could be with them, I wish I could be like them, I try to be like them. I am in a constant state of embarrassment because I know I will never be like them. I don't act accordingly and am a pathetic excuse of a person. I feel them watching me from various parts of the house and outside, and that is mainly the root of my shame. They are watching me being an embarrassment and a mess. I can't see or hear them, but I FEEL their eyes. And I've never felt so judged before. I love them. I love them with every fiber of my being. With them, I understand everything. Love, friendship, parental love. They are perfect. I would give and do anything if it meant I got to go to their world."
4,"Cyclothymia :: Mental Health Issues :: Signpost UK

'Cyclothymia or cyclothymic disorder is a mental illness which causes people to experience mood swings which, in turn, affect their ability to carry out everyday tasks. Cyclothymia is often thought of as a mild form of bipolar disorder. The changes in mood that people experience are beyond what most people regard as the normal ups and downs of everyday life. The person's mood may change from feeling depressed to feeling very happy and energetic. However, these changes in mood are not extreme enough, nor do they last long enough, to qualify for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder.'

Bipolar UK | Home
Cyclothymia

Individuals experience mood swings but at a much lower level. Symptoms must last for a period of at least two years, with no period longer than two months in which there has been a stable state and no mixed episodes. Although individuals diagnosed with cyclothymia are on the bipolar spectrum, the relative mildness of the mood swings means you are not diagnosed with bipolar. However cyclothymia can develop into bipolar."

4,"I find I am looking for the pat on the back type of validation for all the mini accomplishments I get up to.  I live alone and feel like people want there to be substance before I reach out to them.  This is just a self imposed perspective, to a degree I don't adhere to it.  
I created a company website and it includes a blog as a lifestyle consultant. I reached out to a dozen people to ask for feedback and only 10:1 type of non reply to response came back. 
Often times I feel the craving to attention seek. It's not loneliness, I was just over at a good friends and sharing with them. It's attention seeking, wanting the pat on the back by acquaintances and strangers. 
I clicked refresh on my gmail several times an hour all day. I am left feeling the void. In this instance it seems rational that the people I reached out to for the website feedback are not going to engage promptly. But my craving and attention seeking demand I have is not rational. 

I have bipolar and am extremes of moods, extremes of attention seeking. 

Does anyone else have tips for releasing pent up attention seeking?  I try to practice patience, but that is so difficult and really barely treating the symptom not the source.  Speaking out on this forum is a form of release - do you think it is healthy?  Should I be more guarded to continue to try and suffocate public feedback desires.. I feel like staying in my bubble and only reaching the eyes/ears of my close friends and family is not healthy either.  There is a different tone and mannerism when speaking to the general public, and I think it helps to broaden my personality by not staying shut up in my bubble."

4,"I've been suffering from excessive thirst and dry mouth, and having to pee every 45 minutes for several years from my lithium side effects.
I had to drink about 6 gallons of water a day and it was torture.
recently about two months ago, i had the idea that i wasn't getting enough salt, and i tried this brand of salt i use
""redmond real salt"" it's a pink salt from utah. but himalayan pink salt may work as well.
it seems to make a difference what type i use. 
 because i've tried celtic sea salt too and that didn't work very well.

but anyways i mixed 1/4 tsp of the redmond real salt with a glass of water and stirred it up till it dissolved and i drank it and my dry mouth and excessive thirst symptoms went away! i've also stopped craving pickles and salty food as much, i used to eat a ton of pickles!
so the amount of salt in my diet hasn't become excessive. i sweat a lot too i work out everyday i need it.
i also took a fasting lipids blood test 2 weeks later and everything was ok my doctors said.
it's been a HUGE relief not having to constantly guzzle and pee all day, it can't be healthy..

I've read that lithium competes with the absorption of electrolytes in the body and lithium can cause hyponatremia (low blood sodium(salt))
and that's real bad. and if you have too low of sodium in your body lithium levels can also become very toxic.

I've noticed it only takes 4 or 5 dashes from a salt shaker in a cup of water to help me get rid of those symptoms
I've read about a study where people that drank some salty water needed less water because the body retains more water and hydrates better when they did that. 
This might help, just thought i should share this...

i'm not a doctor, consult your doctor, anything you do is at your own risk, always do your own research. :)"
4,"Hi everyone!
So I'm bipolar 2 and recently came off lithium. The initial plan was for me to start on lamotrigine but because the tapering caused depression and insomnia, I was put on quetiapine (300 mg) instead to help with sleep, which helps a little. I am still mildly depressed, but that's OK, I had that on lithium as well. I now sleep a few hours instead of hardly any, so that's improved too. But it's still not good. I also experience irritability and anger that I didn't have on lithium. 

I feel I'm in a mixed sort of state with restlessness, irritability, anger and insomnia, paired with mild depression. It's horrible. 

So now my pdoc advised Depakote.
Are there people on here who use it? Does it help with sleep and irritability/anger?
More specifically, is anyone on quetiapine AND Depakote, and how does that combo work for you? Do you have side effects?

Thanks so much."
4,"just curious what meds everyone takes for bipolar. im diagnosed as bipolar II with mixed episodes. my meds are:
lithium 750mg

seroquel 300mg
adderall so i can stay awake
i have been taking these meds at various doses for the past 15 years. ive been episode free about 5 years. lots of side effects though, i am prediabetic and have descreased kidney function which doc says are caused by the meds but that the benefits outweigh the risks."
4,"bipolar is a tricky thing because we get depressed over and over and over forever. so we have to get good at adapting to it. one of the tricks is to recognize that when it comes you have to let go of all the things high (or even normal) levels of serotonin allows you to do:

-more energy
-more power
-more intelligence
-more self esteem
-more pleasure

so with low serotonin you have to be willing to let go of all those things and the abilities and accomplishments that come from them.

with depression you have to be willing to be more tired, more stupid, more sluggish, more weak, more slow, more lazy, more pain, etc... and the lowered ability to do external things your used to doing

the faster you let all that go and make peace with it the better off you will be. because then you get your integrity back, your not mad with yourself and life for not having those things.

its just like if someone goes to prison. they better make peace with having less real quick. otherwise they are just going to suffer more."
4,"I've just watched Into The Wild on Amazon Prime.  A bit long but worth a watch to see how someone might isolate him/herself to deal with a traumatic childhood (although nothing compared to a lot of us!) and other people's expectations of you.

I'm just thinking of all the times I've been manic, and bought stuff I don't need and don't use, and I think he's right.  Most of us have been isolated for the last year and I am just wondering what other people's experiences are and what they think of this idea?

4,"I had a psychotic episode 11 years back but that was due to stress and a lot going on. At this point, I was diagnosed with undifferentiated sz and then schizoaffective.

Ten years and no psychosis, the psychiatrist decided it was ok to take me off the antipsychotic and put me on a mood stabaliser instead. The mood stabaliser gave me side effects so I had to come off it. I was still struggling with anxiety so they put me on Sertraline alone. I had a really bad psychosis which landed me in hospital after this. The psychiatrist believes it's a mood disorder which I assume means bipolar.

All I remember from it is I was struggling to make sense of what time it was, I spent a lot on books, and I wasn't sleeping properly. I was also very irritable. And thinking people could hear my thoughts. All this happened during psychosis though. I even tried to run away thinking I was getting on a train to America to save the world or something stupid."

Upon reading the HPD symptoms I could relate to some, just as I can in other disorders, especially during mania.  It was a good thing to learn and had less stigma attached the label."

4,"Hi forum, 

Hope you are all having a good evening. 

I'm proud of what the progress that I have made this past year. After finally coming to terms with my condition, seeking out help, rough patches, trial and error with meds; I finally feel that I am in a good place in life. I've set myself goals and have taken steps to achieve them

However, I'm having doubts as to whether I will be able to sustain this progress to bring things full-circle. Recently, a very good friend of mine passed away which affected me very deeply. And through the process of grief, I fell out of routine, fell back into some old habits and drinking a little too much etc. I am slowly coming to terms with the fact that he is gone. 

Nevertheless, I cannot shake the feeling that my efforts are redundant and in vain. These niggling doubts that I am having are slowly eating away at me and are discouraging me from pushing forward. I would not say that I am depressed, as my mood is well controlled by medication; but I am down. Maybe its grief, maybe anixety. I am going to go see a psychologist to tackle these issues. I know that these problems take long to get better; but my motivation needs to get better fast. 

Any advise or encouragement will be greatly appreciated.

4,"Hi all,
My husband of 17 years had a severe manic episode 4 months ago that resulted in him hopping on a plane with nothing but the clothes on his back and ending up on the streets of a city far away. After a few weeks he reached out to me and we have been intermittently talking by phone but he hasn't given me his exact location until very recently; now he is living/camping on a friend's piece of land. He doesn't exhibit many of the signs of mania anymore but is still adamant that he is divorcing me and not coming back home. He wants to come for a visit to take care of some things and to pack up his car and ship it to his new location. 
I have been waiting for 4 long months for him to get to the point of coming home but this isn't what I expected; I wanted him to come home and rebuild his life with me and my support. He insists he is not ""mentally ill"" and that it was his decision to get on the plane and ""start a new life"". He refuses treatment of any kind; wont' even talk to a professional because ""there's nothing wrong with me"". 
I am not excited about his visit at all. At this point I don't even want him here making me feel sad and scared and awkward in my own home. Not only am I now dealing with the trauma of him disappearing and having an episode and all that went along with it, now I am dealing with the trauma and grief of a divorce that I don't want.
He wants to act like we are buddies and nothing is wrong and that we are amicably splitting up. Its infuriating . I mean, wouldn't you want to talk and work it out after 17 years? We haven't even gone to ONE counseling session. He just wants to come pack some things and take care of logistics, ship his car down there. That to me says he's not even thinking about reconsidering his choice to stay there so whats the point? Don't even come then! He says he wants to talk to me about what happened in person though, not by phone. I fear he will try to just sweep everything under the carpet as is his pattern but I won't allow it because this condition impacts me as well as him.
How should I approach this situation? Be gentle with him and just wait until he is ready to talk about it or allow him to act like everything is cool and avoid the topic? I was thinking I could schedule an apt with a marriage counselor and if he is willing to go under the guise of ""help us figure out how to move forward with divorce"" and see what comes out during the session. If he says no I will cancel it.
Suggestions? Seriously, if he doesn't have me in his life there will be NOBODY there for him next time an episode happens."

Does anyone else self medicate with alcohol? It started a few months ago. It was 2-3 drinks 1-2 nights a week. The last two weeks it’s been 2-4 drinks for 3-4 days. Sometimes it’s day drinking. Sometimes it’s at night. I’m a SAHM with a Velcro baby. I can’t get anything done during the day without them screaming when I put them down.

I haven’t been able to go places on my own for about 2 years and have been constantly depressed for 2 years along with periods of rage. I now have paranoia that I’ve never had before, I feel like all of my neighbors can hear me inside of my apartment and feel like they’re listening to my conversations. When I go places I feel like everyone is making fun of me or knows that I’m mentally ill. I constantly feel like people have ill intentions and are out to get me. My fiancé and I moved out of our hometown almost a year ago and I’ve been spiraling ever since because my parents were my support system. I have been really dependent on him and when he goes out with friends or by himself I get really paranoid and feel upset with him and it’s not fair to him. I feel like he is going to leave me for someone who has their shit together. He is growing more impatient and less supportive, calling me names And telling me I’m useless right now. I went through a really bad manic phase and quit my job. I’ve been suicidal, I don’t think I would ever actually do it but I feel like I’m getting closer and closer to the possibility of actually doing it. I feel like I’m drowning and I’m now going into these fits of rage that I’m having trouble controlling. I don’t want to go into the hospital but I’m not sure what to do. I am also a mom so it is important that I get it together so my child can have the mom that they deserve and don’t grow up with trauma because of me. I used to take kolonopin for my anxiety and I was able to function but I made the decision to stop taking it almost a year ago because I was worried about long term effects because I had been taking it for 2-3 years. I currently take 100mg of lamotrigine. It helps but it makes me really unproductive and feel slow most days. I skip days so I can get things done ie. cleaning, calling to make appointments etc. I try not to self diagnose but Sometimes I feel like I may suffer from bpd also, but at the same time I can be a hypochondriac and worry too much about health. 
anyways I’m not functioning like an adult right now and not really able to care for myself. At what point did you guys consider checking into the mental hospital? What did you do on your situation and what was the outcome? I’m on the verge of losing everything and NEED to be able to take care of myself so I can be a good mother. I just want to be able to go enjoy things in life again, function independently and give my child the life they deserve. Please be kind.

4,"Hello, 

I was recently diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder after having a complete psychological breakdown that included intense paranoia. I have started Serequel daily. I also have Gabapentin for panic attacks on an as needed basis. I have been doing research and trying to wrap my head around the diagnosis. I am thankful to have an actual diagnosis and treatment available to help feel better, but I have had a really rough couple of days. I started a log that tracks my diet, mental thoughts, physical symptoms, events that could be possible triggers and things I did to try and improve my mental state. I did this in an effort to share with my new therapist in an effort to find a pattern and ways to better help myself. Today I had a feeling that no one around me really understands what it is like to live this way and their attempts to normalize and relate by saying ""we all have those days"" or offer up possible reasons for my mind state today just irritated me. I know they are trying to help and I know they love me. They are doing their best just like me, but I thought joining a forum with people who TRULY understand may be beneficial for me. This post has two purposes. First to say hello and second to find out if anyone has any recommendations for self care while in a depressive episode, and recommendations for a person newly diagnosed. I am just looking for come comfort and support during one of the hardest times of my life. I know my therapist will help with coping skills, but right now I feel very lost and alone."

4,"Hi All-

I am a 47 year old male with bipolar II and extreme social anxiety.  I have been out of work for a year and a half and just started a job last week.  There is an extreme amount of pressure from family that I succeed at this job.  I had massive anxiety attacks on my first days of the job but still was able to barely function.  The last half of the first week was better than the beginning.  I was just starting to make connections with other co-workers and my boss tells everyone that we aren't allowed to talk about ""non-work"" topics which is killing me because I need to make real connections with my co-workers.  Anyway I am scared shitless about performing well on the job.  My memory is terrible so I have to right everything down.  I am constantly comparing myself to others there who have been there for years and telling myself that I should know more even though its my first week.  I mentally beat myself all day long and it is exhausting.  I am just scared that I can never hold down a job long term.  It makes me think I will be homeless somebody or terribly poor.  Looking for support from the group.  Thanks!"
4,"Hey I’m new here and I just wanted to share some thoughts and maybe get some mild feedback.
I’ve seen a handful of doctors and all of them seem to think that some different medications and the person before is going to work to reduce my mania episodes that occur daily. I do believe that in certain circumstances people should be medicated and if you found a medication that works for you then that’s great I’m happy for you. But I have not.
I typically wake up in the first 5 to 6 hours of my day are absolute garbage, I feel like crap emotionally, depressed, don’t feel like participating in much at work… And then at about lunchtime which is 11 o’clock for me, it really starts to change and flips complete 180… Introduce manic episode… So I found that eating well (for me lots of meat protein and veggies) and eating regularly every 2 to 3 hours helps me feel nourished and gives me a little kick of energy and I’ve also found that when I get home from work and I’m feeling this way if I go out to my gym and pump some iron that I can usually burn off some of that energy or that heightened sense of craziness, But then there’s the part of me also that has challenges not drinking alcohol on a daily basis and I found that alcohol helps everything but only temporarily. I have this thought in my head that if I can get to a certain way certain body fat in a certain physique that I will finally learn to love myself which I do not in the least right now.

anybody got advice on what works for them without medication?

4,"I go through extreme highs and lows and when its either it lasts for a period of time, for the past month iv been depressed and dont feel motivated to do anything, I wake up late and dont have any self care right now but before this I was super well, waking up early, doing work and getting alot done, I was feeling on top of the world. Iv realized for much of my life its been bouncing between these 2. In between that on a daily basis my mood can change super fast, Ill be super happy and social to all of a sudden being passive aggressive and wanting to be alone and hating people even though nothing bad has happened. However sometimes I feel nothing, im just there but not really. Throughout the day my emotions are very rocky from feeling great to feeling worthless. My dad was diagnosed bipolar 1 (maybe its genetic?)"
4,"I’m interested to know how many years you had symptoms before being diagnosed bipolar. What finally happened before the diagnosis? I think I had symptoms, mostly depression when I was in high school, but wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar until I was in my 40s. I was working the night shift for several years which I think set off the mania which led into a years long depression and was finally diagnosed. In the end I’m glad I was diagnosed bipolar so I could get on the right medication."

4,"So I have been manic for a few months. And the other day I was driving when suddenly half my body went numb and my eyes lost focus in and out. I stayed that way for a few hours. At the hospital they could not find anything wrong. 
That night I switched out of mania. The motor inside me running stopped.
So I'm guessing my symptoms were psychosomatic caused by what was going on in my brain?
I can't find any literature on it.
Also if anybody has any tip on how to cope coming out of mania after accidentally sabotaging interpersonal relationships please let me know. I just started dating lately and have sabotaged 2 situations, I'm beating myself up and too frightened to hang out with the guy I'm currently seeing in case I ruin that too :("

4,"my partner had a bipolar mother, a childhood with economic insecurity, phisical and verbal abuse. he manages his job but still has some symptomes of bipolar disorder, like hipomaniac episodes, followed by melancolic ones, when secludes himself in dormitory for days, watching tv series with courtains blocking the light. no sex. in manic crisis he talking a lot, not listen to people from the pub we are drinking in, telling them „dont tell me, i know”, even if he obviously dont know annything, shouting at me for small things, arguing a lot. he is hypersexual and drinks tremendously. he sleeps little, calling friends at 3 am and finally sleeping at 10am or 1pm.
all in all, even if he is kind of bipolar, he is still functional, maybe a bit weird for others. 
anyway, in one of these manic episodes, he started to develop a kind of tourette - he cant help himself not to say „u-pup-up” in the midlle of the sentence ori even when he kept his mouth shut.

4,"I'm learning as much as I can about BP. 
My brother had a severe form and took his life.
As for me, I have experienced 1 depression which resolved over a few weeks.  In 2002.
Almost 20 years later, I had a severe depression under lockdown , with Psychosis and a suicide attempt. 

I knew and still know my brother's disorder. I lived with him for 20 years. 
So, during lockdown, towards the end of my stay, I began to exercise. I mean , really exercise. I was drug resistant but they kept pumping me. 
I began to sweat out the depression. Began to feel GREAT. I felt balanced and I felt well. 
It was lifting. 
Amazingly, and co-incidentally, I had been put on Lithium as a last resort. 
To my surprise, I was given a BP diagnosis. I asked what type. They didn't say. 
They said it was because I took to Lithium so well! 
I couldn't believe it, but I didn't care at the time , as I was well ! Who cares, I'll take anything. 
No periods of Hypomania or mania. No ups and downs. Just a couple of depressions ( admittedly the second was major. But I know that Lockdown created the conditions for major instability. 

Anyway, they said "" you might have had a Manic episode and never noticed ""
Well, I can tell you. . I'm married with kids and k how my wife 12 years and in all that time - no mania, even on a minor level. 
As I said , on Lthium and it takes its toll. A lot of people swear by it as a life changer. Man, it is robbing me of my emotions. Good for mania. And depression. 
Only thing it does for me , is helps me sleep. 
 
But I have problems with this "" maybe it's not BP disorder, but we will label you ""and treat accordingly.
I would describe myself as at risk for BP disorder. But at 42 years of age to suddenly get this diagnosis, is inaccurate. One psych describe me as "" at risk "" for BP.
I just wanna get some opinions. 

Is there anyone out there who has no history of BP but ends up with a diagnosis of BP?"

She has just emailed me to say that the Psychiatrist has given me a diagnosis of Cyclothymia.  After googling, this seems a bit like bipolar lite?  Honestly, I feel a bit upset.  Had just got my head around what I thought was my diagnosis and now feel my experiences have been minimised.  Will this make a difference to the support I’ll get trying to get back to work?  It seems from Google that it isn’t serious enough to qualify for benefits anyway, so I’ll have to anyway.  Does anyone have any experience of similar or words of wisdom?"

4,"Dear forum,

Therapy has been something that I have been wanting to do for a while now. Aside from my bipolar, I also suffer from anxiety and certain patterns of negative thinking. I also suffered from panic attacks in the past. My medication works great for controlling my mood swings, but has little to no effect on my general background level of anxiety. I'm not keen on taking anxiety meds such as Valium because they are addictive and harmful in the long run or antidepressants such as Prozac because they can destablise bipolar. In any case, I don't thinking more medication is the answer, since no medication has shown to treat Generalised Anxiety Disorder.

As such, last week I had an initial consulation with a psychotherpist. I am currently very strapped for cash, so this therapy was part of a programme to provide low cost psychotherapy for low-income people. I think its great that they are running such as scheme, but it also means that I might not get the best treatment possible. The psychologist that assessed me was only a trainee. She was a nice enough lady and gave me some decent advice, however, I could tell that she wasn't massively experienced. Of course its hard to judge from just one session, especially since it was only an initial consultation where she mostly just sat back, listened and tried to identify the key problems rather than a full blow therapy session where we actually address these problems. Nevertheless, I do have some reservations.

What are some of your experiences with therapy? Do you find it helpful? Does it complement the rest of your treatment well? What are some of the key areas I ought to focus when tackling anxiety in therapy?"
4,"All my consistency is ruined due to my episodes. I try to commit to things to better my future (saving money, making and keeping friends, taking medication, eating healthy, taking care of myself, having hobbies, therapy etc) but then it all gets lost in the cycle. I can't keep doing this it's literally ruining me and everything I have. I want to go to school and have a career and have a home and a family but i just feel so hopeless. Even when I'm so motivated through mania or even just naturally occuring motivation (which is very very sadly rare) either life throws something new right in my face and knocks me on my ass again or the depressive episode kicks in and i decompose for a month and fuck it all up. I'm so tired of this everything just gets lost in my head and in the cycle and i don't even know what to do. I have no friends since i think everyone hates me so i just go quiet until they stop talking to me. sometimes ill message them in my manic episodes but I've realized thats probably exhausting for them for me to ghost them so i just let it fall off these days. My family relations are screwed. I don't have a car or transportation of my own. I try to take my meds and then a manic episode will come and i'll decide im cured and i dont need them and stop. And i actually always believe it no matter how many times i've reminded myself that it's in my head and I DO need themand that i do this every fucking time. then the depressive phase comes around and im like well i stopped taking them so whats the point in starting them up again? and i just keepgoing onandonand onand i just want it to stop. im so tired of this and i have no one who understands me. literally not a single soul. im not even being overdramatic right now, I'm 18 and I have no one. I sit in my room and stare at the wall at night. No hobby I have is fun anymore. When I'm manic i just write lists. I write lists and lists and lists and stay up all nighton my phone and i post random stuff online that i dont really have a reason to post and i'll text people i havent texted in months andthen its all empty again. idk what to do how do i bemore consistent it just all gets ruined"

4,"I didn't know where to put this, as there doesn't seem to be an anger management forum, which may be for the best. lol

Anyhow, I have a... Had, a friend from my childhood who, over the past few years, has turned into an absolute monster. I know the significance of what I'm saying there, and I don't use that term ""monster"" lightly. He and I are no longer friends, obviously. And haven't spoken a word to one another since early last year.

A bit of background info: he and I went to school together. He was truly once an amazing person. He helped me though my high school years to not commit suicide. I owe him for that, even still. He was 18 when his mother got his little sister taken away by DHS, so he moved in with me and my family and we had temporary custody of her. Over the next two years, he and my mother butted heads more and more, and it eventually resulted in an explosive night where he took off in the car she had bought him after he assaulted her. Police couldn't find him, so we dropped it, just wanting to leave well enough alone.

I come back in contact with him last year, only to find out that his dad had died and he had picked up some heavy drug use. He also was now in a different state living with his girlfriend at the time. Some time later, I find out that he had verbally, physically, and sexually abused her and also roped her into drug use after they moved together.

Like an idiot, I decided to contact his now ex-girlfriend and try to figure out why he was acting different. She starts opening up slowly over time and that's how I found all this out. I honestly had trouble believing it all, so I confronted him and he admitted to it all. I blocked him and that was that.

Still to this day I get angry thinking about the injustice of it all, and to compound that I haven't seen his ex on FB since January and I'm worried about that, cause my friend is dangerous, for reasons I'd rather not get not right now. I need to, for my own sake, just freakin' drop it. To figure out why I can't seem to. Something! If I unblock him it'll get ugly, and he knows where I live still. Ugh..."

4,"Hi,

After being hospitalised twice in 2020 due to mania/psychosis I am now trying to be really mindful of my moods. 

I had been in a depressive phase from late Oct last year. This week I feel my mood has really lifted. I want to think it is the depression lifting but it feels maybe 'too much' for just this - very energetic, racing head, lots of plans and ideas, words and phrases I'm hearing linking to song lyrics (which I know definitely happens in mania for me), not feeling tired despite my sleep being very poor for a good few weeks.

Can depression switch to possible start of mania so suddenly? Feel like other times I've had a bit of a gap between lows and highs.

On one hand this feels so great after a few months of feeling so depressed but equally I don't want it to run if it is going to end up in full manic episode/psychosis again."

4,"I need help.



My boyfriend just broke up with me.



We were incredibly happy until a couple weeks ago, when in a bad week caused by stress, depression and anxiety I told him he was taking too long to reply to my messages (we are LDR). It was so dumb, I was overreacting and I wish I hadn’t done it, but my moods were all over the place. He was shocked when I told him but didn’t see the problem, still he started replying faster because according to him he was scared I’d get mad again. Knowing this hurt my feelings and we ended up fighting. He said some pretty hurtful things but didn’t seem to realise. We made up but he wasn’t changing his behaviour, which FOR SOME REASON triggered my anxiety. It’s not something that’s normal for me as I’ve never cared about this type of things, but I was having an incredibly bad week and my intrusive thoughts decided to act up. I told him a few times that if he didn’t feel like he could change then we could just be friends, which he avoided until our final fight (all within the same week) when he told me that we should do it. The truth is I only told him this because my then anxious brain was convinced he was falling out of love, but it still broke my heart when he just agreed by saying we should be friends for now at least.

I was still anxious and hurt so I told him I wouldn’t want to try again, which was a lie. 



Quick note: my ex suffers from bipolar and OCD. He has his routines and rituals and can get distracted by them very easily, which is what stirred my anxiety when I was in one of my lows. He currently receives therapy and takes medication to sleep. 



We’ve talked about it more because I’m struggling to understand his reasons, and these is what he said. He said that he didn’t want the fights to keep going and he didn’t see himself changing anytime soon (he means his time management, which I haven’t told him but is something I can get used to) as when we dated he was hypomanic and therefore felt more social and found it easier to stay in touch with people. He told me he was scared of having another depressive episode as he wasn’t hypomanic anymore. He also said that me asking him to reply faster led him to feel pressured and that his avoidant, protective and anxious traits blew the whole situation out of proportion and made him hide in his shell. He says these made him feel numb and that he didn’t understand his thoughts or feelings, but he was convinced changing his time management was something he couldn’t overcome and therefore we couldn’t be together. He told me once that his romantic feelings for me weren’t there anymore, and then he admitted that this was an exaggeration out of panic because he didn’t know how to explain what he felt. He said that the pressure made him realise we were going a bit too fast (although we already knew this but we were willing to work through it as we were in love) and that he thought the best would be to take a step back and rethink everything. That it’s not like his feelings for me were just gone, and that not all of them were. He keeps mentioning he feels anxious and numb, but does this mean there is a chance he could still love me but the numbness and his obsessive thoughts (as he calls them) make him believe otherwise?



It’s my first time dealing with a situation like this and the truth is that I am completely heartbroken. We had a beautiful, healthy and supportive relationship. Literally the happiest I’ve ever been with someone. I feel like he’s just too good to let go of so easily and I desperately want him back. I fell for him knowing he was/is bipolar and my feelings haven’t changed. We’ve always listened to each other and were very open about our mental health, but now that this is happening I need to know if there’s any hope we can still be together or if I should just give up. I want to ask him, but I don’t want to overwhelm him or make him feel pressured. I want to understand and I want to be supportive, even if it means I have to be more patient that I would normally be. If there is any hope for us I’m willing to wait and give him space, but if there isn’t I am gonna have to pull away for my own mental health. He has made it clear that we should still be friends and doesn’t want us to stop talking, but when I ask about his feelings he says he’s numb and confused so I am full of questions. These questions are killing me and I’m struggling a lot because my overly working brain keeps coming up with all these theories and thoughts and feelings. Could it be possible that this is a temporary result of his avoidant traits towards conflict (note: he doesn’t have an avoidant attachment style just some traits)? Could his bipolar have something to do with this? He’s always said that isolating himself has been a coping mechanism and that made him lose people. Could it be possible that the numbness and confusion will clear away with time and he’ll realise he still loves me? People tell me that he may have just been infatuated and that he may have wanted to break up from before, but I know that’s not the case. I’m a 100% sure in fact. This is all a result of a really bad and tense week, but is that enough to end his feelings for me forever? Please help me, and please don’t think I’m trying to pin it all on his mental health as I really don’t want to be insensitive. It’s just my first time falling for someone with bipolar and I just want to understand. Should I talk to him about it (again) now or give him time? What if giving him time kills any feeling he may (hopefully) still have for me? Or if I give him time and overthink all this while he actually doesn’t feel anything.



We’re now talking as friends btw."
4,I wonder will I feel anything today or will it be another grey day. Flashes of causing myself pain. Each day they get a little stronger. I can't stay motivated long enough to get help. All of my friends have given up on me and I don't blame them. I exist to provide for my kids but I'm slowly crumbling apart and someday nothing will be left. I'm listening to sad songs just to feel something and no tears come. There is a ball in my stomach that I want stab and tear open. I open my mouth but no words come out.

4,"I had to admit my 12 yo old after something very bad happened to her about 4 weeks ago. Of course, I wasn't told about it until 2 days after we put her in the hospital. She had become so unstable by the time we put her in she was.litterally fighting for her life for about 8 days. We were so discouraged at her making no progress to this point. The last 2 nights she said she is starting to feel a tiny bit of hope and feel differently than she had in the past year. We've been struggling to make very little progress until now. I'm so encouraged to her hope in her voice.  She's not crying constantly or pissed off at the world. She had also been misdiagnosed initially with severe depressive disorder when in fact she's bipolar like her mom and 3 sisters. Anyway, thank you for letting me share my glimmer of hope with you all. I know I rambled, but I need to share this for someone I feel.  Just be patient. It's a long process to come back to being functional again. It had our entire family very distraught. But that's slowly fading."

Well I had yet another fight with him. I came home from work. I work in retail. And apparently I smelled like perfume. I don’t wear any myself. I couldn’t smell a thing on me. He ordered me to take a shower immediate when we got inside. And when I tried to explain that yes we do sell perfume, and people are trying tester there and so on. He didn’t believe me, sayd thinks two minutes and get your lies straight and then tell me the lies.
When I tried to continue with the story that I work with girls and we have in the back bunch of old testers and it was valentines day and someone may have put perfume on, I don’t know. I really don’t know how I smelled. Never have I before smelled after work. He sayd if I don’t shut up right now he’s gonna get dressed and go outside. So I stopped saying anything.
and now I don’t know what to do. I already have strong anxiety and I know I’m not well,I’m not happybut I am happy with him, I never ever wanna be without him.
I’m just so hurt and confused. I’m hurt that he’s hurting himself by believing what he comes up in his head. I’m hurt that this hurts me. 
what advice anyone has? Anything?
Hopefully you had good weekend."

Hope you are all having a wonderful day. 

Do you remember what your first manic episode was like? What were you feeling at the time? What were you doing? Did you face any consequences in the aftermath?"
4,"I just got back from the hospital yesterday from having my first full manic episode. I have a lot of regret from spamming people and having absolutely no boundaries. And I did a lot of inappropriate things even in the hospital which is extremely embarrassing to think about.

Does anyone have advice for what to do after mania is over? What are some good ways to recover from something like that? Thank you."
4,"Hi all,

I'm new here and I've never done anything like this but I figured maybe someone out there is struggling with the same thing and can help. I'd like to provide some background as to what led up to my hospitalization and my journey after. I hope you'll have the patience to read through all of it. 

About a year and a half ago I was in my last semester at college. I was reading and watching a lot of mind expanding content, including documentary series about nature and religion and how everything is interconnected. I was taking a course called Psychedelic Anthropology where we were reading and discussing topics like consciousness and the psyche, neuroscience, spirituality, and the advantages of using psychedelic plants mindfully and intentionally. I was also taking a Movement course in which I was learning how to become embodied and listen to my body as well as my final seminar in Film Making. (I promise this all is important) At the time I was on Effexor for depression and was smoking a lot of weed. 

One night I couldn't sleep and I had the urge to return to a screenplay I was writing. I stayed up all night researching and finishing it. Throughout the next few days, I continued to get increasingly more and more euphoric and deeper into a state of psychosis. In this state I was experiencing what I called a spiritual awakening. Everything was significant and synchronistic. I felt the universe within me and me within it. I embodied God and had such a strong vision for unity amongst all people, especially my family. 

There's so many details I could go into, but perhaps they're not important. What is important is that this experience was so powerful and beautiful and sacred to me. However, I was very public about it- posting on social media, reaching out to family and friends, professors, and employers. I even got int front of two of my classes and ranted about my spiritual awakening and how we could all come together to put on a music festival/ form something called art church. It wasn't until I was on my kitchen floor seemingly ""giving birth"" and claiming to be the second coming of Christ that my friends called my Mom and my therapist and we all decided it was time to go to the hospital. 

While I was in the hospital I was still experiencing these intense synchronicities and experiencing myself as Christ. Every person and word being said, every painting, every picture, every song was somehow a reassurance of what was happening in my head. As if there was a very thin veil separating my internal experience and the external world around me. 

I was in an agreeable, happy, excited state until the doctor came in to speak to me. The moment I looked into his eyes I flipped and became very aggressive and tried to attack him as I believed him to be the Devil who was trying to end the world. I have never in my life been aggressive or over taken by anger. I was restrained, sedated, and locked in a room. I believed myself to have ""lost the game"" and that the forces of evil defeated me and the world was to end. The moment before I went unconscious from what I now understand was the Haldol, I experienced the universe coming to a single point. I was everything and nothing all at once. 

I was released after a week, but despite being on heavy antipsychotics I was still experiencing these synchronicities in everything- songs, books, billboards, conversations happening around me. What once was so comforting, reassurance that everything is interconnected and that God exists in all things and within me, now terrified me. In the following weeks after my hospitalization the intensity of the synchronicities decreased and somehow I finished school, continued to work, and live on my own. 

After working with multiple psychiatrists and trying multiple medications, now almost two years later I am on 125mg of Lamotrigine and stable. I haven't had another manic episode and only experienced one deep depressive episode around the 1 year anniversary of my hospitalization. I've spent this time trying to understand my experience both from a scientific, Western, medicinal point of view and a mystical, spiritual, Eastern philosophy point of view. 

I still see these synchronicities all the time. In a different way than before though. It's hard to explain, but I believe everything to be happening for a reason and that sometimes the movies I'm watching or the music I'm listening to or the conversations I'm having are exactly what I need to hear. I so easily find lessons and insight in everything. 

These synchronicities bring me comfort sometimes and sometimes they terrify me. I'm terrified that I'm losing touch with reality and that I'm going to go into psychosis again. I do believe that God exists within all things, including myself but I'm terrified to embody my own Divinity. I feel like I can't move past this.  I'm ashamed of having been so public about it all and I feel so misunderstood by those around me. I've never read about or met anyone who has had quite the same circumstance as mine. Sometimes I wonder if I am Bipolar or if it really was a Spiritual Awakening, perhaps both. 

Any reflections, questions, or insight would be so much appreciated!

4,"ECT was a lifesaver for me, many years ago, but it really did a job on my memory. And I have a lot of problems with my sense of direction, I can even get lost in someone’s house! I don’t know if that’s due to the ECT or the meds or just me."
4,"What was your experience?

I have been diagnosed with a mood disorder which I assume points to bipolar with psychotic features because I experienced psychosis two times over the past 11 years (2010 and end of 2020).

The second time it happened I was on sertraline without a mood stabaliser and a few weeks in I went into full blown psychosis and needed to be hospitalised. The doctor said it was because of the sertraline.

I know this might not matter, but I really feel I don't have a mood disorder but another psychotic disorder like schizophrenia. I do remember spending money, having lots of thoughts and ideas, trying to run away to America, etc but most of my time in hospital is blank. I just don't remember 90% of what I did. Is this quite common?"
4,"what are the risks of going off your mood stabilizers cold turkey? my friend did this completely cold turkey bc they were tired of feeling like a zombie, and i didn't really notice they were acting different until like 2 months later when i REALLY noticed. how long can it take for your symptoms to come back / worsen? is it the longer you go off your meds, the worse off you get or does it fluctuate?"
4,"Hey guys,

I believe my boyfriend is bipolar but does not was to seek help.

He is consistently feeling anxiety and stressed and is over drinking to feel better. He also appears to have delusions of people sabotaging his life. When he’s really upset he tends to try to contact my family or friends so that they can “confirm” the truth. This of course has my whole family freaked out.

I want him to seek help but of course I don’t want to force him or do something against his will. Can you suggest anything that maybe you’ve done to convince others to seek help or how did you seek help for yourself or what did someone do for you to convince you to seek help....

thank you in advance for your help!"
4,"I'm afraid that my ever changing moods are starting to really affect my relationship with my husband and family. Mostly my husband as he is the one who is with me most of the time. I am newly diagnosed and am just starting out on medication. I know it's going to be a slow process getting my medication right but I am so worried as to how long it will take. My husband seems quiet and off with me and I'm pretty sure it's because of my ever changing moods. He has been so understanding but I'm worried it's getting to much for him. But unfortunately I'm now spiralling from hypomanic to depressed. I'm blaming myself for putting him through this and putting our life on hold. But I just can't control my thoughts. It's so scary. 
I would love any advise or tips for partners of people with mental health issues. And some advise on how to handle life and bipolar."
4,"Hi all. Just saying hi to all the fellow bipolar kids out there! I was diagnosed about 2 years ago.. at 39 years old. My first marriage probably suffered because of undiagnosed Bipolar, ADHD and anxiety. But, I'm with a new guy now who has a bipolar brother (he actually suspected it before my psych did!) and so he's had years of dealing with it and has been the most awesomest guy on the planet! We are getting married this June (well, tried to last June but... COVID). 

I am on medication which is working well. And I am trying to start my own business on top of working a full time job where I am traveling to work each day (my guy and I work together), all while raising my 9 year old daughter who has ADHD and anxiety herself. We're just one big happy squirrel chasing emotional basketcase family! (groans in exhaustion)"
4,I been dealing with Bi-Polar type 1 and PTSD with delayed expression. I been wanting to go back to college for a career. Yet I have been told that most of the careers I would not be able to have due to my diagnosis. I been so confused and numb by how I am 31 year and have not had a job too many well since I only had a janitorial job until the virus happened and I had to move farther away from my job . is there any work I would be able to work towards a goal with being diagnosed with no polar type 1? I always have been interested in Cyber Crime Investigator .
4,Is there anything that helps with concentration? I can't make it through a book to save my soul. I seem to have a limit of an hour or so before I switch off. Attempts over a few days and then I give up trying because it just won't happen.
4,"I might have an opportunity to to try Spravato (for those who don't know, it's basically slightly altered ketamine administered as a nasal spray in your doctors office). My psychiatrist suggested it as a possibility for me, and we are weeding through the insurance red tape now. I found (very serendipitously!) ANOTHER psychiatrist that administers Spravato at his office who is literally about 4 blocks away from my normal psychiatrist. I'm leaning towards this as a posibility should all the cards fall into place. Has ANYBODY here tried it? At all? Know someone who has? How was your reaction? Terrible? What was it like? Was it worth it? And ultimately, did it really help? : /

4,"I do not start my first therapy session for another two weeks, but my moods have been significantly worse in the last few months. I have dealt with my mental issues on my own for the last ten years, but I finally sought treatment and therapy last month after seeing that little progress has been made in all that time.
I took a series of screening tools through my University, and found that I have generalized anxiety and symptoms consistent with depression. However, results also found that my behaviors are positive with bipolar disorder. Upon these results, I took several screenings on bipolar disorder and keep getting positive matches, up to 86% through one of the tools.

I will wait until my therapy session to talk more about it and see if these findings are accurate. I have found myself in severe highs and lows, sometimes simultaneously, and this has been a pattern continuing for quite a few years, but I am noticing the pattern getting more significant lately. I will feel overly confident and independent, but then a small, likely irrelevant thing will trigger me based on past traumatic events, and I sink into a feeling of hopelessness where my thoughts swirl my head and won't settle down. Then with time, I'm back into the confident stage after a period of feeling emotionally numb following my pessimistic episode.

Upon dealing with my mental stress and past events that have triggered my stress (bullying, manipulation, harassment), my support from family has not been super validating, which is why I decided to seek counseling on my own. In every situation, I am told that I need to forgive and forget what has happened to me, and to be the bigger person. This has not helped me in that I continued to be harassed and my anxiety has gotten worse, leading to my emotions being triggered by very small occurrences that might not matter to other people, including family.

Last night, I experienced a major episode when a family friend who had caused me emotional distress was invited over to my home. When I said hello and was met with little greeting, including an uncomfortable smile, I was weirdly set off. I escaped to my bedroom and uncontrollably cried, recalling what I had experienced months before with that person. I am currently living with a sibling, who witnessed the experience I had gone through and dislikes the way I was treated.

In an attempt to be calmed and seek help, I contacted my mother. I explained that I was not mentally prepared to be with this person and was triggered by the response I received from them. Her first response was that she did not understand why this situation was still a big deal to me and told me I was being dramatic. While my reaction seemed unwarranted from such a small instance, my mind went to flashbacks and I couldn't help but feel distressed. My mother also told me that I need to ""get over it"" at least 3-4 times, that what happened was 6 months ago, and that I need to stop telling my sibling how I feel about the situation as my ""negativity is affecting [my sibling's] perception of [the person].""

After the call, I received a text from my father, who said only this to me: ""Drop it. It's over. No one cares."" The uncontrollable sobbing and deep, heaving breaths resumed. I had always been afraid to tell my parents about my problems with bullying and trauma in the past for fear that they would not care or do much to help me. This led to resorting to self-harm and acting ""out of character"" in the past, of course neither of them know of my destructive behaviors. That statement basically solidified that I was right in that they don't care about my emotional distress, and that I just need to forgive whoever did me wrong and move on without accepting my true feelings. I wish it were that easy, and it's not for lack of trying multiple times over the span of a decade among different people.

I wonder if what I am going through will even be considered more so if I have an official diagnosis. I am sick of not being listened to or validated, and all day I have actively avoided my parents. I worry, though, that this counters exactly what they told me last night. ""I shouldn't hold a grudge;"" ""I need to get over it"" and not let it bother me, when I am severely bothered by the disregard for my mental health and minimal likelihood of getting better if what's happening is not addressed, rather than keep sweeping my problems under the rug, as I have been raised to do.

My distress lasted into the morning, but it has begun to fade away and now I am in the emotionally numb stage, hoping to get back into the optimistic stage. Although now I feel nervous, knowing I'm bound to plunge back into distress again at some point.

Anything helps. Thank you."
4,"My situation at the moment is one of mind shattering normality and perhaps mild depression. I miss my moments and periods of constructive inspiration. Many of those were actually very functional and beneficial to my work and those around me. 

After a relatively recent relapse ,with full blown mania, psychosis and such severe depression afterwards that I developed something called pseudo-dementia (which fortunately resolved itself after treatment), I am now ""well controlled"" again.

The problem is that all that I feel now is a numbness to the world, slight depression and non-stop anxiety. Apart from the anxiety, the world could blow up around me and I could not care less.

My psychiatrist is not willing to change my medication combination, because of the severity of my relapses (plus the catastrophic collateral damage assosciated with each relapse) and because the pseudo-dementia was a warning sign of damage to the hippocampus during my relapses.

To make things worse is that I resigned (24h notice) on impulse from work during my relapse and am now without work and alone 95% of the time.

I also have schizotypal personality disorder, so it is very difficult for me to form lasting bonds with other people. This form of communication is what works best for me, but because of the STPD I do not get beyond the first attempt at communication on non-mental-health social forums.

Can anyone relate? If so, how do you cope? Does anyone have any advice?"
4,"hey! i hope this fits into what this forum is for, i've never posted on here but i'm feeling very lost and i could use any insight / advice there is if people on here know more about bipolar disorder than i do!
so my best friend is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and went off their mood stabilizers cold turkey about 4 months ago, 3 months before they dumped me. basically, they had the idea of us moving to a different state together, where we'd know no one and have no job prospects or anything. it was a very sudden idea but as soon as they had it they were 100% ""let's start looking for places and move in 2 months."" in retrospect i highly suspect they were manic, but i didn't know much about bipolar disorder and didn't think much of them having it. i told them i wanted to think it over first, but every time we'd talk they wanted to research apartments immediately and wanted an answer immediately and would get frustrated when i wouldn't match that energy. eventually, they said they didn't want to make plans anymore because we had different wants, and assured me it wasn't a big deal even though they were giving verbal indications that they were upset about it, and the energy between us was very off. we had a few conversations about this, and none of them went well because i'd get anxious and repeat myself and they'd get really irritated at that and get visibly impatient. eventually, they told me they were setting a boundary that they didn't wanna talk about it anymore, i thought this was negotiable because the issue clearly wasn't resolved and it would've been fair of them to let me talk about it if i still felt the need to. so i communicated this, and they told me i needed to respect their boundary and were very firm that they couldn't talk about it anymore because it ""made them treat me like shit"" and it was draining to them. it turned into an argument and they told me not to contact them for a while, then a week later they send me a long text telling me they don't wanna be friends anymore because me crossing their boundary made them feel unimportant and we were sucking the energy from each other each time we'd miscommunicate. i am crushed and hurt and find them dumping me over a text very unfair and unlike them. i get that i shouldn't have pushed so hard, but i feel a lot of their reactions were more irritable than the situation called for, and i'm SHOCKED they dumped me over a text. we were the best of friends and this seems so abrupt and dismissive of the level of our friendship. i'm heartbroken and confused and any insight on this in context of them having bipolar disorder would be much appreciated! i've read that people with the disorder can get hyper-irritated at things at a disproportionate level, and sometimes they'll abruptly dump their friends then regret it when their state changes. also, if anyone has any insight on what happens if someone goes off their meds cold turkey that would be much appreciated."

4,"Anyone have any tips / insight on how to not take it personally when someone with bipolar says very personally hurtful things to you? My best friend said some very mean things to me while they were irritable and they were very unfair and harsh and things I was already insecure about. It was also relating to an idea that they had while manic that I didn't agree with, and I know it's common for people with bipolar to get hyper irritated when people don't go along with their manic ideas, so maybe that's why they lashed out. Is this common?"

4,"Hi all

I have felt suicidal since my first psychotic episode. It was very public and killed my career.

I’m tired of feeling low, ashamed and feelings of self hate. I want to be happy again. I really do but can’t see a way out.

Any tips would be welcome because as of right now suicide feels like the only option. I think of my family and how it would upset them. I have no quality of life anymore. I feel like a burden and failure to my loved ones.

Don’t know who to talk to or what to do. I’m have been looking at ways to take my life.

Anyone else feel like this after an episode? if so, when did things get better?

I can no longer cope."

4,"Hi everyone,
I was hoping to find some advice.

I am 32 and have been struggling with heavy depression in spells for the past 5 years, which has been getting worse and worse. I have had no reason to be, amazing girlfriend,family and friends - a very lucky man.

At the end of 2019 I had a really bad patch of extreme mood swings - no sleep , and I was given antidepressants which made me feel sick and worse but told to stick with them so I did.

I started having absent seizures at the beginning of January 2020 and I had to leave my job in March because I couldn’t cope. I lost my license for 12 months and I was put on levitracem for the seizures.

I started my own company 2 weeks later, just before Covid hit and we went into lockdown.
No work and no money.

I was still facing terrible mood swings and heavy depression.

I took myself to hospital in April 2020 as I was extremely manic and spent 5 days in there and didn’t sleep. I still wasn’t diagnosed with bipolar.

I eventually had to go to a private psychiatrist in July 2020 who diagnosed me with Bipolar passing the examination by 100%. I was given Aripiprazole which didn’t agree with me and made me feel sick and more depressed. I was told to go back after 4 weeks to review the medication but I couldn’t afford the follow up meeting. So I kept using it for 3 months until I couldn’t use it anymore and went back to hospital in September.
I was referred to a neuro specialist who changed my mood stabiliser to Limotrogine.
I have been waiting 7 months for my follow up in March, to be reviewed and monitored properly. As I’m still feeling very depressed and erratic.

There have been major delays in treatments the past year because of Covid which I have appreciated and been patient with.

I have been with my girlfriend for 3 years but I have deteriorated dramatically physically and mentally over the past year and a half.
I have had deep depression, unable to drive because of my absent seizures, no work because of Covid and I’ve put a lot of weight on. In between this I lost my job and my close uncle died of cancer.

My girlfriend has broken up with me because she says we want different things. 

She doesn’t understand bipolar, depression at all. And her words are I have no drive, motivation, I’m fat.

I have never been Horrible to her and always supported her with everything.
No arguments, shouting, horrible things being said.
I haven’t felt sorry for myself and I have tried to stay positive Through the past year and half.

when she split up with me by phone , I refused to meet her the next day to talk about it and sent her a nice email wishing her the best . I have cut all contact and not spoken to her for a week.

I am obviously really upset because I love her and hurt that she can’t see I’m unwell and in the process of getting better.

I am exhausted by everything and don’t feel I should be having to explain my situation to someone that should love me.

I feel I shouldn’t chase her or beg her but leave her to get on with what she’s got to do.

I don’t want to put my burden on her, and I want to focus on getting better.

Am I doing the right thing ?  Or shall I try and get her back ?"
4,"Hi all.

This is sort of a weird question but for a bit of context, my work doesn't have definite work hours so sometimes it takes until 1am or even 4-5am if there's a lot to be done.

I've been diagnosed with Bipolar 2 and was prescribed seroquel and the sedating effects of the meds never really left even after months of use.

My problem is, I usually take the med once I think work is done but sometimes, my supervisor suddenly calls for something after I've taken it. I don't usually get to answer because I'm knocked out at this point then I just say sorry the next day and reason out that ""I have medicine that makes me sleepy.""

He never really asked what sort of medication it is but I just want to be ready with an answer if ever it comes up again. So my question is, what sort of med can I ""mask"" seroquel as since I don't want my workmates to know about my mental health problems. Is there anything like maintenance meds that also cause drowsiness?"
4,"I can't seem to get ride of this depression. I'm a complete misery around my family just want to be left alone. I'm on 300mg quitiapine. 

I thought it was supposed to help depression. I wish my mania would return. Getting hold of nhs psychiatrist is vertically impossible at mo. Are there better meds for bipolar depression?"
4,"Anyone have it? I never used to have it but as my Bipolar progressed over the last six years or so, this 'thing' appeared to grow with it. Suddenly I didn't want to be around people, speak to people, be in situations where I might have to speak to people. It has grown into an almost uncontrollable beast to the point where it is stopping me from doing most things that involve situations in which I might end up having to speak with people.
I don't know if this is a part of the Bipolar, an adjunct to it, or a reaction to it in the sense that maybe if someone speaks to me for long enough or sees me over a long enough period of time, they'll see this thing peeking out from underneath called Bipolar. Maybe I'm even trying to save them from me? Maybe I've just got nothing to say? Maybe I find most people too boring and predictable? I really don't know.
I find it all really baffling how, in the space of just six short years, I went from socially okay, (not brilliant, but okay) to pretty inept. The problem is I also now rarely want to be around people because I'm so easily irritated by them, so it's not just a choice to make things easier, it's also a 'need' to not get ticked off by yet another thing. Irritability is a big problem for me.
Experiences or thoughts?"
4,"Hello all,
My wife has a diagnosis of classic bipolar 1. However, I'm trying to figure out what her sister has. We are pretty sure she has some mental illness. My wife thinks she is bipolar also, but she doesn't fully fit the usual criteria. She has had multiple episodes which fall into the classic manic criteria (both euphoric and dysphoric) and also mixed mania. But she has never really had what I would consider a depressive episode. The closest would be her mixed manic episodes where she would have moments of extreme emotional anxiety and sadness sprinkled in with her intense mania. At first, my wife and I dismissed the first two big episodes as postpartum psychosis since they happened after each of her kids were born. But then she had another huge episode in 2019 which was mostly due to overwork and work stress. Hence we can't blame that one on postpartum. When she comes down from these manic episodes, there is a time of melancholy as she reflects on what happens. But it is brief and then she wants to move on from it like it never happened. She never enters any kind of real depression. Her baseline is very emotional/social/friendly but a bit narcissistic and with a bit of a temper. In her manic episodes, this gets amplified 1000x. When doing some research, I found a bit of information about ""unipolar mania"" which seems to fit the bill. But the data on it is minimal as it is not commonly diagnosed. Just wondering if my sister-in-law does indeed get unipolar mania or if it could be something else. She is in denial that she has any real mental issues other than lack of ""anger management"" and some ptsd from past trauma. Even hinting that she may have a mental illness will set her off so she definitely will not go to a psychiatrist for a proper evaluation."
4,"Hello all,
Anyone taking Depakote/Epival DR tablets? My wife is currently prescribed 1000mg of Depakote DR (aka Epival in Canada). Her psychiatrist has told her to take it all at once before bed. I have always read that Depakote DR (this is NOT the extended release ER tabs) dosage is commonly split up into 2 or 3 smaller doses throughout the day. In the past her previous psychiatrist had told her to take half at night and half in the morning. I mentioned this to her current psychiatrist and she said that it is perfectly fine for my wife to take it all at once at night. I'm curious what others think and what others who are taking it are doing. I had also posted this question awhile back in the meds section but didn't get a lot of replies so I'm hoping more people see it here.

Thanks"
4,"I wonder what people make of this.  So last night, before I could fall asleep, I had yet another scene that I could see in my mind's eye.

I tend to experience things when I close my eyes.  Just at some times.  At the moment my mood seems to be a little high/low is what seems to  over it.

4,"anyone with bipolar have S.A.D. before they got bipolar?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_affective_disorder"
4,"I have been trying to reasearch the various trigger that can bring on bipolar episodes. One of the major ones is stress; when consistant mental pressure from life builds up, I can slowly feel myself either falling into depression or mania. However, in the run up to my latest episode, my life was previously uneventful. And, unlike most other episodes, did not build up over time, but rather came on very suddenly. I have been trying to track any changes that I have had in my life recently, but couldn't identify one. The only thing I came up with is that the weather had suddenly changed here in the UK. We had winter temperatures of -5 degrees celcius and snow for a couple of weeks and then suddenly it was Spring, +10 and sunny. This seemingly coincided with my episode. 

I looked into it and found that it is common for bipolar people to have sudden affective switches in Spring. Coming to think of it, the same thing happened in my first episode. I was depressed for a number of months between January-March, and then in April/May I suddenly became manic. Does anyone else experience sudden changes in their mood when the seasons change? If so, what do you do to prepare and mitigate against it?"
4,Hi! I’m new and I have so many thoughts/questions. My mind is racing and my thoughts are chaos but I think I’ve recently had a huge breakthrough. So here’s the deal. I’ve been in therapy a number of times over the years and I’ve seen a psychiatrist twice in my life. Once many years ago for PTSD and have now been seeing someone since last Spring. The thing is that I don’t think I’ve ever really been honest with any of my mental health professionals. I’ve always withheld a LOT of information. I don’t really know why I do this. I’m not trying to be intentionally deceitful but I think I’m just doing what I’ve always done in every aspect of my life which is trying to appear “normal”. My current diagnosis is PMDD because that’s basically what I handed to my psychiatrist. I started taking Fluoxetine in April which I believed to be life changing. I had energy and motivation. Every time I had an appointment I would tell my doctor how great I was doing and how much better my life has been. I’ve been self medicating for insomnia (unisom and cannabis) for years but recently I have had to increase these things and have now come to the point that even on massive amounts I’m still waking up for hours at a time and can’t shut my mind off. So I moved my April appointment up to this coming week to address the insomnia. I always rehearse what I want to say to my doctor in my head but today I started writing things down and it is literally pages and pages of mostly things I haven’t told anyone. I’m so embarrassed about hiding things all this time but I’m desperate for help. Seeing all of my concerning behavior over the years written out makes a bipolar diagnosis seem obvious to me but I still have the urge to rationalize each individual behavior. I’m 41 and my Dad wasn’t diagnosed with Bipolar until he was 60 but we all knew he had it all those years even if he didn’t. I just feel like I’ve been putting all of my energy into trying to control and hide my mental health because I’m so afraid of such a major diagnosis.
4,"Im not diagnosed w ANY mood disorder so far (diagnosis takes too long anyway), though both Anxiety and Depression have been diagnosed.

Does anyone know specifically what types of things could it be???

5,"I was talking to a coworker an amidst the conversation I was thinking to myself ""am I real?"" I don't even feel real.

5,"Hello, I have recently started questioning if I have OSDD. I joined this site hoping for support/advice/related experiences. Before I continue I'd like to say I cannot access therapy at the moment (I hope to go in the future,) which is why I'm here. I have extremely few memories from my childhood, and those memories feel like they belong to someone else, it is like watching someone else live their life in vr. I know I have gone through traumas, but I can't remember much from before 2nd grade. In second grade I remember ""waking up"" (it was more like coming to) in class, I was confused, I thought: ""where am I?"" ""Why don't I remember anything?"" ""I have to pretend to be 'P'."" It was odd, like I was an older person in a 2nd graders body, but ultimately as soon as those thoughts came I told myself ""I can't think about this right now, I need to focus."" Then the incident became a fuzzy memory as I got older. As I entered my pre-teens I started have gaps in my memory but it always happened at night so I thought it happened because I was tired. I also started to disassociate heavily, 98% of the time I was disassociating/daydreaming. Even for now it is a large struggle for me though I have gotten better at identifying my triggers. I spent the last 15-16 years of my life looking at myself through other people's eyes, and I had no idea who I was, it always felt like I was trapped in my own body. Everytike I look in the mirror it is never someone I recognize and it constantly changes. I talk to myself very often in my head, but recently I realized it seems like I am talking to other people. I also talk to myself outloud, have conflicting opinions/emotions/and aspects of my identity. I never questioned it because I thought I had many ""personalities"" within me and it was normal for everyone with my experiences. However, after stumbling up DID/OSDD half a year ago I have been realizing I have symptoms in common. (I.e my ""personalities"" are very similar, they change in different settings.) Anyways, what prompted me to seriously consider the possibility of having OSDD is during a recent disassociative episode I remember acknowledging myself as a different person. Idk if I am just faking it or it should be something to consider further and try to figure out with a therapist in the future.

Summary:
I don't remember my childhood and have memory gaps where I don't remember doing things. I disassociate a LOT. I don't feel like I belong in my body, I heard other people talking in my head, I recently I believe another person ""fronted."" I cannot access therapy/professional opinion at the moment and would like support/advice from other going through the same thing and/or if you think I may have OSSD."

I feel as though my mind is fully gone, and that I have perished too. ): I am still very much physically alive and safe, but any light and lucidity have left me, as well as my personhood ~ I feel as though all that has made me 'me' is gone, which terrifies me. I think I could handle this change if it were only I affected, or I had no loved ones, but seeing how greatly it inhibits me from being any bit of use or good to those I love and adore haunts me, and there is only so much I can bear. ): I have had episodes of sitting for hours in paralysis, coming to, only to discover that I can become so lost and so vulnerable. Much of the time, I liken myself to little more than a zombie, with my inability to think, act, be, communicate, or function in any capacity as a person. I feel so horrified at the lack of dignity that one sentient being could possibly feel, and how immensely much can be lost. I have let everyone down in my life and it makes my heart weep. I used to be vibrant, beautiful, kind and caring and looking back, I realise how precious it was that I could come across other gorgeous dearies and be loved for my priorly whole self, and whole-heartedly love in tandem. However, those days are heartbreakingly gone now, and I am nothing more than a mindless, demonic ghost. ): To continue to allow myself to deteriorate in my loved ones eyes grieves me so much, and deep down in my heart, I know that it would be best that I let them go, so nobody need be saddled with me anymore. I wish so much I could be a huggy ghost and just give everyone a big, big hug, I would weep and hug with every last bit of my strength, so, so happily! Or even better, send all in my heart, every dearie precious, every last bit of my warmth and my strength. <3 This idea has also held me for a while! The idea of focusing my warmth and my strength outward, this sustained me and kept me going for months. <3 Yet, no longer can I even do this, and this has signaled to me that my time with them may best be up. ♡ My mind has flown away, and my last act of kindness to those I love would be to fly away from them too {'': *weeps with my whole heart* ❤ 

Thank you so, so, so much for reading, and for everything. <3 Please know that your needs, wishes, thoughts, and feelings are so, so immensely important, and are worth every safeguard and care. <3 You all deserve the absolute best, the loveliest of sunsets and skies, and so dearly I wish you warm and sweet days ahead filled with all dear and relieving. <3 *sends streams and streams more soothing, supportive, nourishing, nurturing, and sparkling stars, embraces, cuddles, cutie hearts, and everything to one's cosy delight <3* ❤❤❤"
5,"Hi,

I'm new here and had multiple dissociative episodes in my life. Mostly when I'm confronted to specific triggers / conflicts / perceived threats. I mostly just zone out and quit talking, walk away (like literally leave work in the middle of the day and make up sketchy excuses afterwards), freeze...

I had therapy for a couple of things, but honestly few tips / help about the dissociative symptoms.

Anyways, that's my story, but I was wondering what was the actual difference between dissociation, depersonalisation and derealization.

Maybe it would help me make sense out of my symptoms ? 

Thanks in advance (:"
5,"Sort of the opposite of feeling as if I am not real, which I have felt for the majority of my life. I like to pretend sometimes that I am the only real thing in this world and everybody around me moves according to my design. It brings me comfort and a sense of control. I don't feel like this all the time. I'm starting to repeat the phrase ""nothing is possible"" so I can erase anything in my reality that gives me anxiety. If nothing is possible then nothing is real but me."
5,"I've had a little experience with the strange state of mind and mood called dissociation (or the other names for it). It's a hard thing to describe. The mind sort of just wanders off some place and this makes the current experience strange. I may have done this lots of times but can't recall much of it except for a few occasions. Sometimes the normal sense of what is real gets a little distorted, like things appear slightly smaller than they really are, or more distant. If it's mild it isn't that disturbing. Stronger senses of dissociation can be unsettling. I've experienced that 'surreal' feeling a few times when something bad or quite unusual happened.

How would you describe your experiences with this sort of thing? Is it frequent or just occasional? Does it last long or quickly pass? Do you try to get back to 'reality' when it occurs, or just go with the strange state of mind for a while?"
5,"trigger warning bc i also talk about eating disorders

I don't feel like I'm totally in my body. I feel like I'm slightly in my body but not all the way.

i feel like a childs coloring book page. 

the outline. thats me. 

the child came and colored me in, gave me life and soul, but colored out of the lines. thats how i feel.

like im a venn diagram. 

the one circle is me. my body. the other overlapping circle is where i feel. 

sometimes i look around my apartment and it doesnt quite feel real to me, aswell. like its all made up in my mind and that this is all in my head. 

i know it isnt, but its how i feel sometimes.


this happens most when im under a lot of stress. like this week ive been eating badly... and tonight i binged. the stress of binging... of breaking my streak of no binging..... 

im just upset with myself. i wasnt sure whether to post this in eating disorders or here because it has both :/"
5,"Does anyone else have one (or more) alter(s) who has a disability that no other alter has? ...or they have it to a more severe degree than others when they are up front in the body? 

Or is there memory loss between switching between this alter and others so others within the system don't realise that one exists or the disabled alter doesn't know there are 'others' who can do things they can't? 

Just curious how common it is after reading a genuine case in the papers about a blind woman who recovered sight in 8 out of her 10 alters.
and another who had a deaf-mute alter who was triggered by fear of having to undergo an operation."
5,The Universe feels fundamentally flawed. I can't explain it at all. I don't even think I know what I'm talking about? It's spiritual I guess? I just don't get it? But WHY does it have to be the entire UNIVERSE?! I've never even left Earth for freak sake! Maybe spirits can pick up on things the body can't??? :confused:  :confused:  :confused:
5,"ive only noticed now that sometimes i feel like im observing myself. that im doing things manually. i zone out of things and lose focus easily, and this also means that my memory is quite poor too. i cant drive as i cant focus either. i cant live without a task list and planning, otherwise id be an unorganised mess. how can i cure this? or is it just tiredness?"
5,"I've been struggling with not feeling like myself today. I've been ""zoning out"" a lot (especially while driving), not able to speak, not being able to remember parts of my day, confusion, not feeling real. I immediately think it's my anxiety, but this feels different than my normal anxiety symptoms. I've always felt like there was something more going on with me, but never could understand what was going on or how to explain it or talk to others about it.

My husband thinks I need to see a mental health professional, but I keep putting it off because I'm terrified.

Help me understand?"
5,"I have 'many versions of self' but have also come to realise that at least one is a completely seperate alter who can function alongside whatever version of 'me' is up front. ... so that means there's at least 2.... the 'me' and the one that is not any child or adult version of 'me'.  

They act sometimes as a mother figure/adviser and stay in the background helping via passive influence when I'm trying to deal with real life stuff and sometimes as a child/teen to match the age of any 'little' that comes out so they have someone to play/interact with on their level. They like to play 'twin' to my 16yr old and they can actually co-pilot the body together so they can interact as conjoined twins would share control of the body.

I mean technically  'you' could only be one alter at once right??? to be another you'd have to first 'switch' to them?  ...so if there's another 'up front' with you then they have to be completely seperate from 'the self' otherwise it wouldn't be possible???"
5,"hope a moderator see this soon. can escaping on the internet such as listening to music , looking at girls in bikinis and online window shopping be a form of maladaptive day dreaming?"
5,"My ex girlfriend went through having an abortion 7 months ago.

Since then I have tried asking her to go to therapy together to unpack it and talk about it. Her reasonings were due to covid and our lack of jobs, and her fear of her disapproving parents.

She shuts down the conversation pretty quickly and then moves on. She normally would never do this.

Further she hates talking about it altogether and thus I had stopped asking.

She had been binge watching tv shows and movies and focusing on her health which is great yes, but its as if she was not at all thinking about it and that is understandable but I just feel like sweeping things under a rug and disassociating are more damaging.

Out of nowhere 7 months post abortion, she told me she associates me to the abortion and thus she couldn't be with me any longer. Again disassociating from her trauma, which I understand despite it being hurtful since I was supportive of her. But again, it feels like she was pushing the very thought and ANYTHING, counting me, under a rug to not think about again.

Finally its been 6 months post breakup and I ran into her sister at a grocery store. After catching up, I asked her about her sister. And she said ""Funny you ask, we talked the other day about you. I asked her what's he been up to. And unfortunately she said that she hasn't thought about you, searched you, or any of that.""

This killed to hear because we had a long relationship and I thought I was special to her in some way despite breaking up.

I felt like she was trying to disassociate me from her mind and life, sweeping me under that big rug of hers and not thinking about me.

Does disassociation ever catch up to someone and then they need to handle all those things they have pushed down?

Would she ever stop disassociating me do you think? 

Can disassociation last a lifetime?

I would love to be friends just like we were before dating... but yah she doesnt want me around due to the connection, and seemingly she doesnt want me in her head either."
5,"Hi everyone!

I've had MD since I think 3-4 years old, when I met my best friend and we had a very toxic relationship. I did not have any other friends and spent time only with this girl. My parents were also very controlling and I felt trapped all the time.
I used MD as a coping mechanism. There, in the world that I created, I was the rebel with all the superpowers in the world, a superhero, an orphan with cool friends and amazing boyfriend/husband. My trigger was music + moving in some way, mostly jumping but I could also swing on a swing. Later I realized I am also able to daydream in any moving vehicle (car, train, plane) and also while walking - if I have headphones with music in, I am always at risk.

I tried to quit many times, but it's like an addiction. I also have diagnosed OCD, which makes me self harm, and also have intrusive thoughts, and anxiety. I take medication. However, MD doesn't go away.
Recently I made another attempt to stop. It's been about a week. However, I am facing the problem I face every time I try to quit -
See, when I want to daydream I get this light feeling in my chest, as though there is a bulk of light that is trying to rip my chest and get outside, it is an uncomfortable feeling and so far this bulk only goes away if I daydream. I do not know what will be as effective with coping with this light. I think it might be just all my emotions turned into a physical feeling, I often experience that my emotional pain turns into physical pain.
Did anybody have the same experience?
I honestly don't know what to do."
5,"Hi everyone. I joined last night out of desperation really. I was diagnosed with C-PTSD and DDNOS a few years ago now. My dissociative episodes were largely when I got triggered or felt extra anxious and would generally last less than a couple of minutes. My therapist said she usually realised when I was absent but not always. I had sessions where I had no memory at all of what we’d discussed. I’ve also experienced what I just thought were horrendous short term memory issues for years... as long as I can remember really. They’re so much a part of me that all my friends and family take the mickey out of me for being so forgetful. It could be whole conversations I’ve had with people but I’ll swear blind I have no idea what they’re talking about, or it could be really important letters I’ve received but said I haven’t received and then months later I’ll find these letters stuffed in bags/boxes or even under my car seat and then I start panicking that everyone will think I’m a liar and that I’ll get a reputation for being untrustworthy and unreliable. I’ve messed up on so many really important things this way and it makes me question my sanity. I feel so stupid.

Derealisation and depersonalisation are so much a part of my life I no longer question it. It’s just like it’s totally normal to me. Sometimes it feels like I’m floating above whatever setting I’m in and looking down on myself and whatever’s going on. Other times I might feel like everything is in slow motion and I get frustrated as I want to press fast forward. Sometimes I can feel like I’m watching a film in one of those old fashioned projectors where everything is jumpy, sometimes it’s silent, sometimes there are voices and sometimes I can see the lips moving but the sound coming out of them doesn’t fit the scene, e.g. I could be having a flashback to something not very pleasant but all I can hear is one of these people talking about making cakes. Again, it makes me feel like a total nutter a lot of the time!

I’ve not really spoken about any of this stuff despite years of therapy with many different people... one of which I saw for 10 years! I always just thought these things were just in my head, that if I said any of it out loud I would be locked up or dismissed as a liar.

My therapy sessions have become deeper and more intense recently and I told her something this week that I have never told anyone else ever and had absolutely no intention of doing so! The moment I told her I automatically regretted it and wished I hadn’t, not because of her reaction because she was honestly brilliant about it all and she even said what I was telling her made perfect sense, but just because inside I felt so guilty and like they would know and somehow get me back for telling. It felt like a massive betrayal and it’s really scared me. It’s almost like I’m waiting for that bolt of lightening to strike me and wipe me out! I know that sounds extreme and dramatic but that’s the only metaphor I could come up with for the severity of my fear at what I’ve opened up here.

I always felt different, even as a kid, never felt like I fit anywhere, I saw and felt things others seemed oblivious to and my behaviours were just kind of weird really. I’ve always talked to myself... had whole conversations not just like ‘normal’ talking to yourself. I role play every single situation in my head... my head is never quiet and peaceful, it always feels busy and loud. I edit myself the whole time throughout every single interaction I have with people. I am very measured in my approach and careful not to bring about any kind of confrontation or aggression. If I’m in a situation that looks to be going that way I retreat inside myself and it’s like a braver version of me comes out and deals with it. I am aware of one side of me who has been with me throughout my adult life and I call her by her name and I know she is the part of me that deals with things if I get triggered. Other than her I have no idea what this is or how many other parts there may or may not be but with her I feel safe. I trust her because she’s sensible and grown up and knows what to do and how to handle things. I even debated whether of not to change my name by deed poll years ago wondering if I was called ___ if it would help me to respond to things the way she does.

This is where this weird post is about to get a bit weirder! I have 2 friends with DID and although we’ve discussed my Dissociation and I have great relationships with many of their alters as well, I never once listened to things they said and thought “I’m like that too”. I don’t feel that way. I don’t appear to have any different voices/accents/languages/genders.I don’t think my demeanour particularly changed much as surely someone would have told me over the years? I’m not really aware of much at all, I only know I’ve been absent at all once I’ve returned and I never have any idea where I’ve been of what has gone on while I haven’t been present.

My therapist who has worked with DID a lot said she can’t obviously diagnose me which I’m fully aware of, but she said she believes from everything that is now coming out she believes I am towards the higher end of the scale. Just hearing that has scared me so much as it seems more real now. I guess when covid dies down a bit I’ll have to have a chat with my GP and see if I can be referred back to my psychiatrist. To be honest CMHRS here are pretty poor in non covid times... this could take a while and in the meantime I’m just stuck with this, not really knowing for sure what ‘this’ really is.

I’m too scared to mention all this to my friends with DID. It was never a train I asked to jump on and I don’t want our friendship to become just about this whatever it is. Plus, in all honesty, I don’t see myself in the way I see them. I just know I have absolutely no idea who I am and I’m really scared about finding out, and yet I feel I need to know. Does any of this make sense to anyone? Sorry for going on."
5,what do you think.....would they have some sort of connection
5,"is this an example of depersonalisation.....if you don't see your body as yours so it affects relationships cos you think 'they're not my sister/friend/brother they just think they have a relationship with the personality they believe occupies that body'??

so you're seeing the physical body as more of a 'transport vessel' like I'm just borrowing it to get from A to B like borrowing someone's else's car to get somewhere??"
5,"I know it sounds like a meme, but I feel like I'm living in a simulation. So many things to wrong in my life, but they're so specific. Like, the very worst thing that can happen, happens. For example, let's say I need a specialist, I find a local one, within a day or two, the specialist would have moved to another (much further) location. As it someone knew I needed them, and then made it more difficult for me to find a specialist. 

Another example is how I feel different from other people. I feel like I'm much more aware of my surroundings than other people. I feel like I'm much more intuitive than other people. It's like people miss obvious things that they should've seen. I'm not sure what a good example would be because it's just little things, but they're so obvious. I've vented about this before and people became angry at me because they claim those things are mistakes or ""brain farts"". And yes, I accept that people make mistakes, but I hardly ever make these kinds of mistakes because they're so easy to not make.

Sigh. I just sound like I think I'm ""superior"" or something. But that's really not it. I just make the best possible decisions to avoid mistakes. It's easy for me."
5,"Since I was intentionally initiated of DID alters by my abusers into my mind ever since early childhood, the storing of memories is completely different than adults permanently. Adults remember memories in fading effects, but when a little child was inflicted of trauma severe enough, it can fragment the mind, creating a time-warp effect. This was when my countless of multiple identities were created, each has their own distinctive biographical memories, experiences and personalities. It means, I am being a toddler, child, teenager and an adult at the same time.

The traumatic memories inflicted upon me were in an infinite series, that I would die by being overclocked in my mind, if all of my walls would be opened, turning from multiple streams of consciousness into a single stream, without anyone killing me nor myself committing suicide. Think about a low-capacity computer that is being overloaded. I have been through hell and back."
5,"if you have one alter who was the main host for a period of your life and had a RL friend in that period but then there was a falling out...how do you deal with it if that alter has gone inside and refuses to engage with the RL person? .. but other alters/hosts don't have all the information on the relationship or about the person (so they don't slip up by missing important dates or information etc cos RL person doesn't know alter they see as 'their friend' is a multiple?)

Telling the person isn't an option, things end up on social media too easily and we're an highly covert system (even family haven't been told)."
5,Sometimes I am thrown out of my train of thought and feel that all things around me are out of my hand. I am in MY body but it isn't mine in any way that matters. There are things bigger than me happening all around me and I am just an animal made aware of its existence.
5,"Discovering information about passive influence of alters has been the missing link for me. There’s no doubt whatsoever that many of my responses are influenced by my alters without there being a full ‘switch’ but I’ve never found literature about this until today.

Another member here wrote about it saying that passive influence is more common than actual switching and I have to agree, at least in my case.

There have been plenty of times in my life where I’ve acted totally out of character. Behaviour that’s completely uncommon for me that I’ve been most embarrassed about. Not to claim that all my unwanted actions were a case of passive influence but some, definitely.

5,"So I am under a lot of stress at the moment (university, lack of communication from uni, covid, worying about family and covid, i moved house, my grandma has been diagnosed with dementia, i am visiting family over xmas and have deadlines due with no support from university as it is closed etc etc) - and I think it has all built up until I am suddenly experiencing awful anxiety. Not only anxiety but I feel completely disconnected from the world. I feel like I'm not really here every day it's almost as if I am dreaming. I am staying with my Mum and I get so irritable when she talks to me, I can't concentrate on what she is saying and I just want her to shut up and I snap. She doesn't look real either. Then I get so upset and feel guilty and cry. Sometimes when she is talking to me I'm so out of it, I feel like I can't take in what she's saying. My mind is elsewhere. I'm thinking of so many other things I think. It all makes me panic, its so distressing. Before I came to visit I was feeling sort of stressed but stable and definitely not like this. I'm hoping when I go home that I will feel better but I am also worried that I won't feel better and will be isolated which won't help me at all.

Has anyone experienced the not feeling real and the extreme irritability?  I experienced the not feeling real when I was about 12 and was going through a lot of stress, my dad told me it was mild depersonalisation (he is a RMN) and he told me to lie in bed, breathe and repeat to myself 'I am really here' and in all fairness, it worked but it isn't working this time but it is a lot worse."
5,"Hey, my name is Remus and about 2 weeks ago I took too much of my thc edibles and got too “high” and now I don’t feel real and can’t sleep. It is slowly getting better but 2 weeks ago I was in a bad state. I kinda feel a bit high  all the time but I’m not. What is going on? It’s really scary and I’m struggling everyday. I’m having dreams about my high like panic dreams. Any advice would be greatful 
Many thanks"
5,"Ok so this has only happened a couple times. I'm stumped. I went on Google and took some dissociation test that was probably not legitimate but the questions did make sense and all of the things added up started to make a bit click in my head. I've always just viewed myself as forgetful, with selective hearing. Ha! I'm almost 30, female. I've had a LOT of negative things happen in my life. I don't want to go into great detail I want to make this as short as I can. From what I've heard from other people who have borderline personality disorder and from a lot of research...it resembles my problems more than any mental health disorder I've heard of. I have had a couple of ""episodes"". The first one: I am a nail technician, I was home doing my sister in law's nails. All of a sudden I felt I had no control of my hands. it was a struggle for me to make them do what I needed. I was twisting my feet trying to ground myself to make my arms do what I was trying to tell them to do. I didn't feel faint or anything like that but it scared the hell out of me. Second: Fast forward a couple months. I'm at home alone on the couch. I don't know if I was triggered by something on television but I all of a sudden felt like I was ""gone"" almost light headed. Everything almost gets foggy. It scared me so bad, I already have paranoia most of the time. So I panic I think I'm going to drop dead right there. I called my boyfriend and told him I felt strange and I was scared. He calmed me down and I was ok. Now third: This one was yesterday. Similar to the last I felt light headed and gone, everything got almost hazy. This time though I noticed that my hearing was different. Almost blocked. Again I think I'm going to die and call my boyfriend. I laid down and tried to calm myself and it eventually passed. I'm scared I'm having mini strokes or something, I feel like I'm going crazy. I'm terrified."
5,"Hello. I have posted on these forums before regarding depression and anxiety. My ordeal was triggered by one pill of expired SSRI medication. That night, I experienced severe nausea and headache but it went away the next morning. Five days later, the first symptom I experienced was intense derealization. It was very sudden. It felt like my surroundings weren't real and I wasn't absorbing them. Also the coloration of my room was off and dull and I began having existential thoughts about reality and existence. I impulsively began waving my arm behind my head, suddenly realizing all humans can only look forward and not backward and feeling intense discomfort over this seemingly obvious fact. I began staring outside my window looking at the houses across the street, trying to decide if they were real or just some simulation inside my head. I questioned reality. It was uncomfortable and disorienting. At its peak, I began questioning my memories and whether or not they were genuine. A few days passed and the derealization subsided, but those symptoms were replaced by intense anxiety, rumination, and depression. 

I'm convinced this is all caused by SSRI (anti-depressant) withdrawal. I've never had these symptoms before, except for moderate anxiety, which is what my medication is supposed to treat. All my symptoms seem to fall under SSRI withdrawal and even the timeline itself (5 days) follows from what I've read.

Are derealization and anxiety intertwined? I'm back on my medication, and my anxiety is ebbing, but there is a nagging feeling of derealization lingering in the back of my head. I stare at certain objects and furniture items in my house, just to make sure the derealization is gone. It seems like more of a fear or anxiety of derealization but I think there might be lingering effects until my anxiety is almost totally gone. 

Please, can anyone confirm if derealization is tied to anxiety and/or depression? The mind trickery on my memories is particularly deflating, depressing, and exhausting. Also, has anyone else experienced derealization or any dissociative disorder triggered by medication? I feel better now than I did two weeks ago, but I'm worried that this experience has left a permanent change on my psyche. Please, any information, advice, response helps. I've felt almost hopeless through all this."
5,is DID just daydreaming .....daydreaming in the sense that youre just not toally aware of the present and you just drift off in to dream mode
5,"Hi again 

I think I've posted before but can't remember?? 

I seem to have 'different versions of me' rather than completely different alters. but some seem to be able to 'sneak out' without the main host at the time realising. 

We are a covert system and seem to have had 3 main ANP's over our life (to deal with 'public life - going to college, work etc) but have others 'inside' that were originally remembered as 'imaginary friends' when we were younger.  

We had been fine but after reaching the peri menopause period of the bodies life and then being isolated for a year due to covid (and needing to shield) the regular host/ANP seems to have vanished as no longer needed (no work/appointments to attend for months) and we can seem to be an entirely different person everyday or change throughout the day. 

Is this a 'mid life crisis' thing? or related to the menopause?  or just due to the isolation? (we're hoping to return to getting out and about once we've been vaccinated). 

Anyone had this with more frequent switches at midlife/menopause phase of life? ..or struggling with similar issues as a due to shielding alone for a year etc?

Thanks"
5,"Good morning everyone, nice to be here.
I wanted to discuss an experience i regularly had as a child, by the way I'm now 49!
The experiences were extremely distressing and I guess I'm trying to understand what was happening. From my interest in MH and as a MHFA, and my subsequent reading, it seems a good idea to finally try and describe the experiences and discover what was happening to me.
Only at night as a child from the age of 6 or 7, I experienced a feeling of sinking into my bed, as if the bed was swallowing me whole. I experienced loud noises and parents who were trying to comfort me seemed to be moving incredibly quickly, even thought they were stationary. I lost sense of perspective, so my arms would appear incredibly long or far away. Some items would appear larger or smaller than they should be, so for example a parent may appear in the far distance even they were in the same room. The whole experiences were deeply upsetting as it was difficult to describe what was happening to me a child. I eventually out grew it, by my late teens early 20's.
Any thoughts on maybe what I was experiencing?
Much appreciated all,"
5,"Hello everyone! 

I'm new here but wanted to ask your thoughts on what I am experiencing. Of course I am right now awaiting for professional therapy to help me identify it officially but its too long from now for me to patiently wait and do nothing. 

To the point: I've been having toughts of other people (imaginary) in my life since very early childhood. I remember just very few exact moments for the every year of most of my life and not much more. Recently I've been having gender and sexuality crisis as well as identity crisis that's reoccurring since I think always. I always when I think or talk to myself and other voices (they do not come from outside the head but just like my toughts) I will refer to me as to ""us"". Sometimes I lose control of my body and it does things that I do not intend on doing and I can just watch from inside. Few months ago I started seeing this voices inside me as full on people with exact looks and personality and likes and dislikes etc. Few days ago I started being open to my friends about me feeling like other people every so often and since that time I feel free and great when I can refer to my names as to which person I feel like and I'm sure I'm that person. They (people inside me) can finally behave as they want and as they would like to present themselves to my friends and we are discovering new things about all of us everyday. Most of us have slight amnesia after changing the person controlling body (we remember like what happened in last few hours but it becomes more and more blurry and its always like watching a movie instead of your memories and after some time we almost can't remember a thing from the other person time out. 

Of course I DON'T WANT TO look for diagnose here. I just want some clues as to what it can be. Sorry for the editing I wrote it on the phone. 

Sending love to all of you!"
5,"TW // drugs and related trauma

Hi, first of all I've never used a forum before so bear with me. I'm nearly 19, have a boat load of diagnoses you don't wanna hear about and I don't wanna explain right now, but here's some context for my question.

In november 2019 I had a panic attack while I was high, having mixed substances, it lasted 17 straight hours and I haven't been able to feel grounded in reality since. I've been working on it with my therapist, but thus far I've been completely unable to stop the dissociation even for a short period. I've tried several different types of therapy and I'm not ready to give up yet, but I'm starting to lose hope, I can't quite remember what it's like /not/ being dissociated anymore. My short term memory and attention span have also taken a huge hit. I guess my questions are: is there anyone out there who's been able to fully recover from this type of constant dissociation? How did you do it, and how long did it take? And if you didn't, how did you learn to cope with it?"
5,"a lot of the time i look in the mirror and think ‘ that’s not me’ 

i don’t know who i am anymore. 

i have these worlds of make believe in my head that i go to when i’m sad and i don’t think it’s normal, i make up whole new identities and personalities for myself, it’s when i feel the most like me. 

sometimes i sit and cry because i remember that i dream of happiness and a happy family but it’ll never happen and i get sad because my life is so horrible that i have to make up a new one. 

i’m completely out of it. in public, at the dinner table, with people i know, i feel as if i’m faking it. 

like nothings real anymore, nothing i do or say is real anymore. 

and i just completely zoned out when i’m with other people, i’m so stuck in my own head. 

i usually spend most of my day writing, reading and watching tv shows that i love, i’ve completely lost my sense of self because the only thing that gets me through the day is the made up movies and tv shows and books inside my head and i find it so sad."
5,"Hello, I’m new to the forum, here as I’m experiencing dissociation as a response to childhood trauma. I’m pretty sure it’s dissociation as I often feel like I’m floating away from my body or behind a screen. My psychologist agrees with me and we’re working on this.
But lately it’s been getting much worse in frequency and to the point where I find it very hard to move during an episode and impossible to talk. It’s very scary not being able to talk.  I was hoping that there would be others around who have had this during dissociation who could offer their experiences - I’m feeling very alone with it at the moment!"
5,"So I'm not sure if this is depersonalization let me identify it moderators. Due to covid our health care in this state has become very poor. You only get 5 min video call which is a shame. So I find it hard to cope with reality at times. I have this different version of me I like better. He's a rap star, has girls ,jewelry and what every player in the hip hop game could want. However I don't impersonate him he just exists inside my mind. I don't even talk about him to anyone I know. Am I losing it at all? Or am I just coping with harsh reality in today's America? Am I ok?"
5,"Hello :) 

Around November I started meditating everyday- only for about 20 minutes- but I was happy and thinking it would be good for my health. I started to do guided chakra meditations and each time it would come to my third eye chakra, I was making the mistake (I now realise) of forcefully concentrating very hard on that area. It would kind of vibrate and feel weird in my head and after the meditation I would feel really dazed. After a few weeks of this, I noticed that whenever I went outside I was verry sensitive to light and my vision started to blur. Eventually I was getting this feeling all the time, even indoors, where I feel totally detached from myself. It's almost like feeling drunk all the time. Everything is so weird and it doesn't even feel like I'm living in reality. When talking with people I start getting really paranoid that I'm not making sense and I can't even focus on them properly. It's like I'm looking at the world from under water. I feel a pressure in my head and recently my ears have been constantly ringing. It's driving me crazy. It's been about 6 weeks now and I have these symptoms from the moment I wake up to when I sleep again so there's no respite. 

I have been to the doctor and had a comprehensive blood test but they couldn't find anything and she's reluctant to send me to a neurologist and basically told me to come back in a month if it doesn't go away. She mentioned depersonalisation as a possible explanation but I don't think I have been particularly stressed. The meditation thing I can see as quite an obvious correlation but of course I could be wrong and this is a random neurological issue- but maybe I triggered that with the meditation?? Has anyone had any experience with this or could offer any advice to me? I fear I will never feel normal ever again. 

Maybe I just sound like I'm crazy 🤪

Thank you for reading!"
5,"Hello 
I'm hoping to get some advise on what the name is of what I'm experiencing and what can be done about it as I am presuming it's not normal but o have no idea where to turn.

I'm an extremely passive person and usually avoid conformation at all costs. Over the years I have been working on this issue slowly.

However on multiple occasions when a confrontation happens which i am not expecting I seem to just zone out. A colleague even commented it was like I wasn't even in the room.  Afterwards I'm left with very little memory of what has happened.

 This occured yesterday however I can remember exactly what was said but did not stand up for myself as I ""zoned out"". I'm left absolutely infuriated at myself for this. What is happening to me and is there a way I can ensure I ""stay grounded"" and ""in the moment"" as to enable myself to act properly in future?"
5,"Hey guys! I'm new here - 21 year old college student from Minnesota! It's a relief to finally be a part of a forum and conversation with people struggling from the truly indescribable confusion and horror of dissociating. I began writing this thinking that I would try and get advice or solutions for my health but I think I can really only find answers for what happened to me in the physical health field. I think it's important for me to share my story and feel validated by others who are experiencing the same thing when doctors don't always believe me. I want to help others with anything beneficial I have learned the past 15 months in case that could make a difference in someone's life. 

Here's my story (I apologize for the length, I try and keep it brief but it always feels like I'm omitting important details):

I’ve been dealing with a strange and awful undiagnosed gut condition for the past 15 months. I took the last semester off from school but I feel like I haven't really been there since the first half of my sophomore year, before this all began. My classmates are going to be seniors in the fall yet I still feel like I should be in my second or third year because it's all just a blur of pain and depression. I have struggled with social anxiety since age 4 and had selective autism in preschool and kindergarten. It improved in first grade, although it wasn't until college when I felt comfortable contributing to class discussions or asking questions. I was always shy and introverted, and didn't have a huge amount of friends, but I guess I didn't realize how much of my behavior was rooted in anxiety. In 7th grade I lost most of my friends and also experienced bullying for the first time and this really set my anxiety off. High school I did well academically, but struggled making friends or joining clubs until senior year and I missed out on a lot. I was always extremely tense and never seemed happy but I never considered going to a therapist or taking medication when I now wish I had. Beginning college opened me up in a lot of ways and I finally initiated more relationships, but I didn't realize that my social anxiety/mild OCD was turning into more generalized anxiety. During the school year, there was truly never a moment when my shoulders were relaxed or that I felt I wasn't being watched and analyzed by others, and my heart would beat at random times. I felt unsafe when working a fairly simple office job at my school. 

This all continued to build up, and I finally experience derealization/depersonalization for the first time two Decembers ago. During winter break, I saw something upsetting on my phone that made me break down, and suddenly I felt numb and I laid on the bed for 3 hours, texting friends that I was scared and didn't know what happened. It went away, but a month later came back post wisdom tooth surgery when I was on antibiotics and had my most severe anxiety attack yet. I felt nauseous, had no appetite or energy, didn't feel like a human being or like myself, felt sad and confused. I then got a case of the flu which set things off even more. Since the flu January of 2018, I have had extreme stomach pain/burning/cramping/lack of appetite/acid reflux, and the worst symptom has been brain fog. My brain fog takes the form of extreme dissociation with no mental or physical health doctor has seemed to understand. My therapist believes my dissociation is all anxiety based and not related as much to my gut, while my GI drs know what brain fog is but have never seen it be so extreme as it is in me. My head and gut have become completely linked, I cannot have a clear mind or escape the feelings of depression when my gut is in pain. 
  
My condition got increasingly worse after the winter and I wasn’t able to function, I couldn’t think or do schoolwork, I had no emotional connection with friends or family and was scared and paranoid most of the time. While I have struggled with anxiety for a large part of my life, I had never struggled with depression before or had any serious health concerns. I developed some asthma when walking, I lacked the energy to do anything, and I was scared of all foods thinking it would worsen the pain somehow. I have been to multiple GI doctors, Mayo Clinic, Infectious Diseases dr, Psychiatrist, Neurologist, and physical therapist. All of my friendships are struggling or falling apart because after 15 months it's too exhausting and painful to fake my existence and voice and laugh with friends. I struggle carrying on conversations with my parents, let alone strangers at coffee shops, relatives, teachers, or friends.

I have been tested for truly everything - Celiac, Lyme's, Sjogren's, Diabetes, Multiple Sclerosis, had an endoscopy, MRI, etc. I am now on my fourth anti depressant, which is Effexor. I have tried acupuncture, massage, epsom balts, teas, walking, sauna, and have found no relief. The only things that have helped are Probiotics - they seem to get my system moving and create a reaction that clears my stomach for maybe a week, and also my mind (I can laugh again, make plans, listen to music) and suddenly my body gets used to them and I go back to the fog.

I've really lost hope and can't think of any other tests that could be done. Talk therapy and mental health strategies have not helped me because this is all rooted in my gut and not my mind (although I have developed depression on top of this.) I guess I'm wondering if anyone else with dissociation struggles has also experienced gut pain or IBS. I knew the gut and brain were connected, but it feels like my gut is controlling my soul a lot of the time. I want to go out and live a normal life but I just can't force myself to care about anything when this fog is surrounding me at all times, along with extreme pain.

Sorry again for the length of this!! It's hard to relive in some ways, but I also think it's important to put my words on paper as I really lack any kind of identity and solidifies that I still have a voice in a way. Any tips/similar experiences/coping techniques would be hugely appreciated, thank you :)"
5,"Dissociation 
“Disconnection and lack of continuity between thoughts, memories, surroundings, actions, and identity.”

Honestly I can’t say I can remember a time I haven’t had this. It varies in strength from each day but in reality my memories are depleting due to the fact that I’m starting a new chapter in my life. My surroundings are definitely different my actions are definitely different so that make my identity different? I feel like I’m starting to get a little bit better at this but the drastic changes I make throughout the day make me nervous. It’s almost like a dirty confession thinking about all the small mistakes or glitches that I can make changes to. Very tiring and stressful. But it’s like working a job, you’ll get satisfaction out of it. 

🌠🌠🌠🌠🌠"
5,"I know you probably get these all the time so thank you for your patience. In the last few weeks, especially after talking to someone I'm close with who's a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I've realized that I likely have memories I'm not remembering. I remember a handful of small instances of cocsa and one small event with a grown up family friend. But because of other symptoms I have it seems like there's stuff I'm not remembering.

Last night I was already not feeling good. My chronic pain was acting up and I was struggling with some suicidal intrusive thoughts. We were laying in bed and all of a sudden I thought of something (which I no longer remember what it was. I have this thing where I can temporarily make myself forget what I'm upset about to help me calm down but this time I didn't remember it later) and my anxiety spiked and I started feeling uncomfortable and restless. I felt dizzy and light headed and when I looked at my arm it didn't feel attached to me. Overall I felt really uncomfortable in my body and anxious....

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions and I'll try and answer. Thank you again for helping me when I know what I'm going through is nothing compared to a lot of you. 💕"
5,"Hello other person reading this, and whoever else  :)  

My version of reality is different to almost everyone I know bar one other person who has schizophrenia, his hallucinations are mainly external, whereas mine are internal usually.

I am aged 25, and actually think I'm happy for the first time in my life and wanted to post it. If you are not feeling it then I'm hoping I can give some advice/experience.

I have recently changed medications from aripiprazole 3mg to 2mg 
flupentixol (A LOT OF TIME PASSED BETWEEN MEDICATIONS).

After years of psychology, psychotic episodes and general day to day life, I have labelled myself as BPD (borderline personality disorder) and who knows (literally) what else myself could be classed as.

To date, I know in my mind is me, the suicidal/depressed personality, and the angry/rage personality, there are other personalities but at the moment I'm stable and unable to really specifically label the personalities in the corners of my consciousness.

I am hoping others who may have some insight into this could give me some advice on how to keep my personality stable enough to live a full life?

p.s. I switched personalities/memories/emotion sets several times writing this"
5,I've experienced derealization pretty consistently for about 6 years now. Recently it's been really screwing with my relationships. I have a really hard time making the connection that my memory of someone actually shows how they feel. I have a hard time seeing people for who they are because there's some disconnect in my brain. My memories of them feel completely separate to who they are and how they feel about me. Has anyone else felt this? It's making me incredibly insecure in my relationships and trusting that the people I care about value me.
5,"I get deja vu often. More so in recent years. I mostly enjoy it in a strange way and recognise when it’s happening and just go through the motions. Recently though it’s changed. There’s been a mixture between deja vu, my dreams and my real life. One recent event has really confused me and made me question the possibility of multiple realities. I was in the kitchen, making dinner and listening to music from the TV. A thought entered my mind. “I must get that CD from my mums car because there’s that one great song on there I like.” Then I thought, I don’t have any CDs in my mums car. I hardly ever drive it and have never left any CDs in there. I can’t even use them in her car because it’s a new car. The thing is, I can see the album in my mind, it’s red with a circle in the middle with cartoonish drawings. The song I like is on the 2nd disc about halfway down the playlist. In my reality I have no idea what album this is or what the song is but I have a memory of it and being left in my mums car. Any ideas what’s going on??"
5,I see fake ppl
5,"I’ve often questioned reality and the point of everything. I’ve studied the simulation theory for a few years and sometimes it comes up in my daily life. NPC’s are meant to be part of any simulation or game and recently I’ve met a few people that tick that box. I’m a delivery person and a regular customer only reacts to me if I use certain words, professional words maybe? One instance was I knocked on her door with a parcel and she answered with a smile and said “good morning”. Nothing wrong with that but as a scanned her parcel, the scanner froze so I had to reset it. I joked this always happens in the rain! She stared blankly and looked past me. I said it won’t take long to reset, again no response, just a vacant stare. Finally it reset and I scanned it and gave her the parcel. She snapped out of it and said “oh thank you! Horrible weather today isn’t it” then wished me a good day and closed the door! For those few minutes it felt like the world around me crashed and reloaded lol! There was a very strange vibe. I get those feelings of disconnect often, like the world is just a form of simulation and I’m lost in it. I hope that makes sense! Has anyone else come across a person like this? A possible npc?"
5,"I don’t see why I have to do anything for anyone, and yet all I want to do is make everyone happy. I think about doing things to myself, others, and even my surroundings. Nothing harmful but just to feel like I’m actually alive. Everyone I know and see are saying there sad but I feel so alone when I feel like this. I know it’s not just me but at the same time I feel like the main character and nothing at all. I feel like I’m losing myself to these negative emotions, until all that’s left is hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurt hurtttttt. My friends say I’m funny, but I can’t keep a steady weight. I want to feel pretty but I forget to brush my teeth and shower some days or eat or stop eating. Sometimes I eat until my stomach hurts other times it just hurts to eat or want to eat. I don’t think I’m fat. I’m really fucking skinny. I wish I could float away."
5,"Does anyone feel like you are just a robot without your self? Can you judge in the morning after sleep if you slept all night and slept or you have no feeling? Can you clearly remember what happened in the morning or, for example, remember on Friday what you did last weekend? Thanks (I write via google translator, so sorry for the mistakes)"
5,"I've been dealing with what I thought was Depersonalization Disorder for 1 and 1/2 years now. But in the last few months I have been at the er/hospital and thought I was having an episode and found out that my sugar was very low. I was told I was borderline hypoglycemic. At my last psych hospital visit, upon getting the results from my blood work they rushed over and made me drink about 6 cups of juice. I was told my sugar was 39. After drinking the juice it then shot up to 199. Here I thought I was just having an episode of depersonalization. So while in the hospital they were checking my sugar every 4 hours and whenever I felt funny. About 50% of the time when I felt like an episode was starting my sugar was in the 40's. 

Has anyone with Depersonalization ever also have hypoglycemia or diabetes? Also if you suffer from it you might want to have your sugar levels checked. Couldn't hurt right? I go to the dr today to discuss the issue and will update. Take care, Cyn"
5,"I'll get it out of the way and say that I feel bad ""using"" this forum as a tool to vent. With one thing and another escaping my attention this year, I don't have the same practice with my positive coping skills, and I don't have the same opportunities to safely socialize.

My main issue currently is stress, turned up all the way to panic levels, crying spells several times a day, feeling hearing seeing tasting STATIC. Racing thoughts, confusion, anger, hopelessness, I'm on track to go back to school in the Spring but I get so quickly and easily frustrated and vexed. I give up on projects and re start them two or three times in a day. Even today, I've made phone calls and filled out paperwork and made appointments and I want to feel GOOD about having accomplished anything at all, accomplished like I used to feel when I was doing good in my life like this. But those victories are short lived because in my mind the happiness at completing a task is drowned by this numbing dread that despite anything and everything I do, none of it is going to matter because I'm still like 8 people trapped in one body and we all fight all the freaking time anyways.

I'm feeling this rift between the different parts of what make me a whole person, and I hesitate to talk to anyone because when I talk about my... different selves, I just get this look, and people bounce.

I'm on track with my school's Counselling and Psych Services in the spring, I just have to make it til then. I'm getting my insurance worked out as well, that's my anxiety regarding going back to any Doctor visits, because I can't afford it until/unless I get back on Medicaid.

Tl;DR I'm a bunch of people who are stressed TF out and I appreciate y'all for being here"
5,"I mean, heard of an individual case. I almost wish I had one. Maybe then there could be a cure."
5,"Hi I wanted to know everybody's thoughts about this because clearly I cannot categorize myself as DID but still I do see some characteristics like DID in me. I have been even jokingly taunted by friends that I have multiple personality disorder because of how different I can be at diff times or that I am so lost or confused person (they have no idea I am struggling with dissociation).. however I don't have any blackouts (like usually how it happens to DID patient when a different part is taking over).. I just feel like I do have parts but not to the extent where I blackout.. it feels more like a context switch.. like suddenly I am on a diff wavelength on which I feel different, think different and talk differently and sometimes I forget what I was thinking just before the context switch.. I am still in the process of understanding what I am going through (well it took me more than 20 yrs to know that it is called dissociation in the first place).. I have recently even started talking to a therapist about this.."
5,"So, I’m diagnosed with bipolar 2, ptsd, anxiety. History of self harm, severe depression. I’ve never mentioned this other thing that I experience to doctors because I guess I’m afraid to talk about it. I don’t know, also it doesn’t happen very often, so I ignore it until it happens again. But it bothers me a lot and I dwell on it for a long time afterwards. At the same time though, I quickly forget what it really feels like. My memory of what actually is going on during the episode quickly fades away. The last time it happened a couple weeks ago I wrote down what happened. This is what I wrote 

in the bathroom putting hair up. All of a sudden it feels like the earth is very loud but muffled at the same time. Everything around me doesn’t feel real.it feels like my head is going to explode because memories or voices are going really fast in my head. So fast that it feels like the inside of my mind is spinning. Spinning and making noise at the same time. Then it stops almost as fast as it started. 

every time it happens my knee jerk reaction is that I HAVE to put music on. I need to have noise on to drown out what is going on in my head. After it’s over, I’m always tired. 

So what the fuck is this?"
5,"i hate feeling this way i am having newer and newer problems lately like i don't feel like myself everyday, i feel like everyone is against me, feeling like i'm not the person i am anymore i don't associate with my family because with trust issues i can't trust my own family or myself, what is the use of living if i problems for me just keep piling up i can't take it anymore i am talking to my doctor this month to maybe check me out again to see whats going on because i can't take it anymore i feel like i am going down a rabbit hole each day trying to figure myself out and i need to know what the meaning of my life is before i go to the hospital to get euthanized."
5,"Tough to talk about. 
Question - does early dissociation from traumatic events make it more likely to do the same with events older in life? I have other diagnoses so l’m asking to understand more about this aspect of my condition. I am not confusing them."
5,"I'm going to do the magnetic ressonsance, but am already scared, since the electroencephalogram, in which I allucinated, and to get to the clinic went through hell! First, I didn' t know were I was in a well knowed place, went to were I wasn't suppose to go and afterwards gave all my coins to the beggar who helped me take the ticket!! While doing the test, I talked to my mom and she answered, talked to the technician and uttered some noises. When she finished it, I asked her, ""did you hear anything from me, did I uttered a sound?"", she said ""no, it was all in your head"". I got home wanting to cry, but then I became emotionally numbed and irritated to every sound and vision. Went to my room and shoegazed for hours. I must wait for the results, but this doesn't seem like schizoaffective anymore."
5,"It was a mess yesterday! I had an EEG and I had to go to Lisbon. Things seemed fine till I got the first challenge. Buy a train ticket in a machine. Arrived at Lisbon and it was hell before I got to the clinic. Everything seemed like a dream and I was incapable of complex thought. Stopped at the wrong stations, had to be aided to by another ticket, tried to get one to were I was, etc. I saw the signs but couldn't get the meaning! As I'm diagnosed as a schizoaffective bipolar type for years, and took a lot of antipsychotics, I'm afraid of having other conditions."
5,"Firstly, I have no idea who I am but I assume this is the BPD. I know as a kid, the most I was ever in trouble for was chatting too much, I was blunt though not overly social which I consider down to my late ASD diagnosis. I loved and valued my friends over everything, I was daring, a bit of a prankster, mischievous etc. I was proud of my physical strength, creative and eager to face the world.

And now, I don't know. I often feel 'not human' making it impossible to talk to anyone new despite trying to make new friends, I constantly feel 'below' them and not worthy of talking to actual humans because themselves and their lives are so much more than mine. I turn it into a joke because I don't see any other way to deal with this.

I don't have many memories of my childhood at all. My memory is shocking, still. Remembering what I did even yesterday, takes a silly amount of thinking and trying to recall, and I still don't always remember.

I don't know how anyone sees me. I couldn't describe myself, physically or who I am inside, as a person. What makes me me. I look in the mirror and a lot of the time, don't recognise myself. I have no idea how friends, family, strangers or ANYONE would describe me.

When volunteering with the horses, up there I am quiet. They know nothing of my mental health, leaving me cringing when an overdose joke is made. I seem quiet up there, my voice becomes hard to use, I can't talk to people unless they talk to me.

I guess my family knows me as me, but whose that?

Drs, therapists, psychiatrists, I am so numb. A common feeling anyway (mixed in with the high and low swings of BPD) but again, I can barely use my voice. Therefore I don't get heard, or listened to. I remember telling once of an incident with a police and the nurse was shocked I had that in me. I don't know what I have in me.

I am different all day, everyday. I don't think I could ever describe myself, nor compare myself to 'real' people because I don't feel like one. aghh. My memory is non existent. Sometimes even big events escape me. Nothing is ever clear."
5,"Hi All,


First of all I'm new to the forum and If eel for you all going through your struggles. This shit is tough ad thank goodness for these kinds of forums where we can help each other (hopefully i can help people on here too).

So I've been really struggling recently with some symptoms which I will make a more detailed post about when I can get my head in gear to do so but I'd like to share one symptom which has been really hard for me.


Here goes...
I've been getting this feeling which comes on and sort of zaps me out of reality, where it's like I'm losing sense of reality o can’t process the reality around me, like I'm in the matrix or one of those robots in the show westworld which has malfunctioned and realised it may be a robot, and so now it can't make sense of anything.

I've looked into derealisation but it really doesn't feel like that as it doesn't feel like a dream and things around me don't look weird or fake...it's as if I can't understand reality or existence.

These feelings started in the last year...at first it was like brief episodes that I'd get at night when trying to sleep. I'd jump out of bed and try to ground myself in reality by looking at my surroundings or calling my mum...not sure if it helped but the feeling would disappear and I could understand the world and would get my awareness back...these 'episodes' got more frequent and longer.
I don't know what is going on and I don't even know if any of this is making any sense. I saw a phycologist for a cbt session and I think even he was struggling to make sense of it. IT's like a feeling of decreases consciousness or something. even while I type this I feel weird and ""out of it"" or disconnected or disassociated or derealised or whatever

I guess I thought I would write this to see if anyone else has felt anything similar?

Thank you all"
5,and sometimes I wonder if I actually do exist
5,"Ive been stuck on this for months now and i believe its actual nonsense but i literally cannot stop thinking about it cause im afraid of it being true in some way. Basically after a couple years dealing with depersonalization and derealization, i was doing better for a while then started having those existential thoughts again and also feeling like like im disappearing/not here feeling. Anyway the thought is wondering if anything actually exists... like i have comtemplated this day and night and the more i try to ignore, the more anxiety i get about it. The only relief i got was just chalking it up to nonsense and leaving it be but i keep getting reminded about it and how it so hard to even prove anything is real. Like would it be possible everything doesnt exist? this evolved in my mind to the question ""am i aware of nonexistent things? is anything real/existent?"" it doesnt make any sense i guess. Its gotten a little easier with time but i also feel like im going insane."
5,"I had an episode, only a few hours, of derealisation last week when I was somewhere I hadn’t been before. I have only had a handful of experiences of derealisation over a few years so consider myself lucky, but I noticed that each one of them occurred when I was somewhere new/with new people/in a situation I hadn’t experienced before.

I wondered if this theme is something others have experienced?"
5,"So i last month i experienced 24/7 derealization which was really hard so over time i developed these philosophical thoughts like what is existence? Do i really exist? Am i dead? What are humans? What is life after death .....
The feeling of detachment is mostly gone but it's still there is there way to deal with these thoughts?"

5,"Hello everyone, i have suffered from depression and crippling anxiety for a while now and i feel like things are becoming even worse as time go on and that thing will just go downhills until the end.

  I am a guy who never made real friends and just got his family to support him and even then i don’t really connect with them, i do love them but i can’t be honest or have a serious talk with them so at most we have small task.

The person i love the most in this world is my Mother, very recently her health really took a hit since she had a AIT (mini stroke) and a pulmonary embolism and is currently at the hospital and it isn’t really kind on me, without her it’s simply impossible for me to go on but i’m not here to speak about that even if it’s linked.

The type of anxiety i have could be called pure existential dread: i simply can’t understand the world we live in, or at least while i understand it i just can’t connect with it, because of that i alwyas feel this feeling of being crushed and had to develop way to cope with this, it’s about to get weird.

So some peoples to cope with illegal drug or alcohol and while i do like a drink i don’t have that kind of coping mechanisms, instead i tried for a very long time meditation and mental exercise until i was able to forcedly shut down everything which bother me, including things like fear, any bad feelings like some of my anxiety and even a great deal of my own emotions when i just can’t handle things

To do that i created my own variation of the mental vault which i a meditation techniques which is supposed to help deal with traumatic memories or bad thoughts by locking them away in a mental representation of a locked vault, i originally tried to do this exact method but it didn’t really work that much for me, while it did have some results it just wasn’t enough with all the things i have to deal with, so with time i started trying to develop my own variation (which isn’t really that uncommon since the whole vault idea is just the basic generic version of this exercise) until one day something just clicked, why should i try to lock away the bad feelings i have instead of just trying to destroy them?
 
The iron hands were born: the principle isn’t complicated, a lot of things in these kind of mentals exercise is just pure symbolism to help the mind accept it more easily like the whole Vault image because vault are hard to breach and you can lock things in it, i choose hands because of the symbolism of cupped hands which are often used to hold something fragile like a small animals you don’t want to hurt or something which would usually fall out like sand, so if my mental hands were holding something this way then it mean it’s fragile right? Next part was thinking of them as made of iron since it’s a resilient material which can be considered kinda crude or brutish (steel may be more resilient but you need to be more careful to make steel, it’s far less crude then iron and i needed something for a dirty job) so now i had cupped hand made of iron holding into things that i just had to try to crush.

Of course things didn’t quite work out as i intended since apparently the mentals represention of my worries and anxiety can’t simply be destroyed be me imagining hand crushing them, what a surprise!/s

While i didn’t create the magical solution to all my problems i did create the tool that allowed me to hold on as long as i have but not whitout it’s little side effects, when using this i do feel better but can only use this for a while before my mentals image start to crumble and it stop working and the side effect are something that i now start to feel: while looking/crushing my anxiety in my mind i feel more confident but also just colder to everything since it’s seem it have some things of muting effect on my emotions, it’s now to the point that i have to fake every emotion when i use this mental technique and it started to affect them even when i am not using it: i feel like the iron hands forget a body of their own and is now trying to kick my ass with great effects to leave only the emotionless husk behind.

if you found this weird then it’s ok, i just need a place to vent sometime, it make things easier."
5,Does anyone relate to this? Please help. For the last couple of months. I am scared of the very existence of my mind.

5,"Hi all,

I just want to see if anyone can relate to my issue as I am really struggling atm.

2 and a half years ago I had a pretty bad nervous breakdown Resulting in panic disorder, dpdr disorder and depression. I am just off my antidepressant meds now asmy mental health was in a bad way for almost 2 years straight.

mentally I am better. There’s no more panic attacks and I am more grounded and feeling part of the world around me again, however, I feel I haven’t physically recovered, which is something I haven’t heard about.

just a bit of background I was on sleeping tablets and xanex at night for a year to try sleep. It didn’t help much, then I turned to weed for about 6 months still didn’t help. Then I got pregnant and gave all that up and basically didn’t sleep much at all for the whole nine months. So I got why I was exhausted then. Now I am sleeping finally but I feel physically as bad as ever. My body aches so bad, legs pain, head hurts. All I feel able to do is sleep all the time which is so stressful since I have a new baby and am returning to work soon. I don’t want to live like this forever.

has anyone been through anything similar? Does this chronic fatigue improve after a long stint of sleep disturbance?"
5,"I can't see how CBT can treat dissociation (certainly in my case)?

Opinions?

So cbt changes the thinking process into more productive avenues while my dissociation is a switch, it completely overrides my thinking processes - ? - while I remain very articulate if task driven..? Like an autopilot that takes over when certain stresses flip that switch?

IIts that 'switch' that also gets flipped during episodes of eating (both are linked). In either case when that happens its like watching from the back seat, even emotions obviously expressed are not 'felt'?

So when there is a disconnect between action and reaction, how can cbt possibly help?"
5,"What I'd like to know is if DID goes with dissociating.
If you dissociate do you automatically have DID or are they separate. They are not together

5,"Does anyone else experience this too? I almost don’t mind having bad vision, because life around me seems like more of a blur. It makes it easier to retreat within and daydream, and it certainly makes reality seem less “real”. However, it isn’t always good because I struggle to feel truly present at times."
5,"So I've known my girlfriend for about 4 years now, but me and her had really been in a relationship from February of 2020 to September of 2020. The reason she broke up with me is because she said she was feeling empty and had mood swings on and off and said that she needed to deal with this on her own. That was when I found out that she had depersonalization disorder and bipolar depression. I always knew she was going through some tough times, especially with the abusive family that I've heard about her having to deal with them on a daily basis, but she never mentioned about having these mental health conditions until last month. I've always been worried about what goes on with her and I feel so depressed about not being able to actually be there to help her, implying that me and her have had a long distance relationship; now I'm really deathly afraid as to what is going on with her when she isn't texting me, always constantly worrying whether or not she is taking action on trying to treat her conditions, wondering if she is still thinking about me, and wondering if she is ok. It's killing me that I'm not able to help her enough. All I can do is offer her my love and support for her to be able to conquer her inner struggles, but I feel like it's not enough, especially if I don't know if she is taking any therapy and medications or not. Despite the fact that I know all of the available medications and forms of therapy for her to seek for her conditions and that I give her an infinite amount of love and support for her, I just feel like there is something else missing. If anyone has any idea on how I could help my girlfriend feel like herself again so she can finally feel happiness and affection again, please let me know as soon as possible. Give me any and every bit of advice that I may need to help her (aside from the available treatments that I already know about).
Thank you."
5,My very close friend has been suffering for a very long time with symptoms that I am pretty sure relate to depersonalization and derealization but her parents don’t believe in therapy and mental health struggles. She has never been diagnosed and I am in no place to “diagnose” her as I am not qualified and that would be extremely irresponsible of me but I need to help her. I don’t know what to do. I can’t tell her that I think she is experiencing this because I don’t know how she’ll take it and maybe she’ll think I’m invading her privacy so I don’t know what to do. Any advice would be really appreciated. Thank you.

how do you cope with this many things wrong mentally any advice would  be greatly welcomed mandy x"
5,"Hi all,

So.....things have changed dramatically. I have come off my AP (Risperidone) and I am still on Setraline 150mg. Apparently theres no meds to stop my alters and dissociating. I am in a year's waiting list for the dissociation clinic (Lucky me.. and thats only for an assessment.

Stress and Anxiety induces my alters and since Feb 2020 I have been dissociated clean if that makes sense but the stress levels have now rapidly increased. My boss has quit and another colleague is off, leaving me to take a load more work and having a 10% pay cut, with going without apart from Sertaline.

The only safe fail I have is promethazine, which sedates the **** out of me and I'm knocked out for ages.

Recently, I feel very close to dissociating but at the moment I can control it myself enough but do really worry what will happen if I do.

I told my wife to phone the crisis team and police if I do change though. 

My life has really changed, I have no access to money, I am getting divorced for financial reasons but my partner will be staying with me and controlling the money, she hiding the car keys and car documents. So if I do dissociate to an alter no financial damage can be done.

It's a really strange life at the moment..."
5,"Hi I was just looking for some advice really. Me and my partner have been together 20 years and a few years ago he changed and I didn't have a clue what was wrong. A few months ago we found out he has dissociation. The thing is every time he sees his parents he seems to change, his personality changes and he can become very angry.. this has been happening for a while now. He is very close to his parents too so he wouldn't go with no contact but every time he sees or speaks to them he gets triggered. Has anybody else been through this? or anybody who has any advice on the best thing to do?

Thank you"

5,"I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t choose to do it, it just happens. It’s like falling into my brain and being swept away with whatever I’m imagining. My mouth will move with the imaginary words I’m saying and my face will show the expressions. They’re usually conversations with people I know, but not always. Sometimes they’re faceless, nameless people who represent a type of person. I was at my best friend’s house and she asked if I was okay because she could see it happening. She didn’t know what was going on- I just said I was thinking about ignorant people. I kind of was. But I fell into it and didn’t even realize until she said something. I’ve heard of maladaptive daydreaming, but I don’t usually choose to do this. I just end up realizing it’s happening. A couple months ago, it was so bad I kept getting distracted from my tasks at home. I ended up just fidgeting and wandering from room to room until I realized it happening. Doesn’t last long, but they can happen often. I don’t think I’ve brought it up to my therapist yet. Anyone else experience this?"
5,"Hi there,

I am very new here...this is in fact my very first thread.
I have been struggling with depersonalization/derealization from when I was 15 (I had the first episode), but it was on and off my whole life (from when I was 19).
More precisely, I only had episodes of depersonalization/derealization which would scare me to death and I would panic, however I have always mange to distract myself (which in turn switched into the phobia of me staying alone, because I always knew if I stayed alone the depersonalization would happen). 

The past year it has buzzed during the sleep, like I would wake up at night derealized as if I woke up to the real world of emptiness and my whole was a dream, and that experience would scare me to the point where I would start screaming. 

Two weeks ago I got extremely stressed and started having an anxiety...though a week ago I woke up in the middle of the with a panic attack which for the first time in my life made me thoroughly think about my own mortality, which turbed my thinking into extreme awareness of the mortality, to the point where I started question what's the point of anything at all?
Then I started experiencing severe depersonalization and derealization and I am barely holding now. 
Please, someone that has ever gone thorugh the same tell me that I will not lose my mind...

So far I am only taking some Promethazine - antihistamine before a sleep (and I still wake up several times) or during the day if I feel I am getting an anxiety. I have had several sessions with a psychologist but I don't feel we are going anywhere with those sessions.

Please people let me know your suggestions or ideas, because by the end of the day I would appreciate an advice from a person that has actually expertienced this than a psychologist that does not understand how it is to be depersonalized. 

Thank you in advance,
Elena"
5,"Not long ago, I started at a new schooling institution (of which, is not relevant). The commute between this location and my home was at least a good 40 minutes - not something I'm used to. At all. For the last at least 8 years of my life it has been no less than five, so I knew that the new journey would be a..change. Along with the new schooling, of course. 
It would be surreal. And it was. 

But boy, did it hit me hard. For the first two weeks, my memory were barely functioning. It's like my brain just couldn't comprehend the existance of almost anything. Per day, (looking back, because in the state I was in at that time I could not have noticed for myself) I could remember a limit of three thoughts, or interactions. I would ignore anybody who asked me how my day was, not because I was blowing them off but because I simply just couldn't say. Was it bad, good? Who knew. I could only rely on how I felt at that very moment, but even that was hard to focus on because my eyesight would pulse and blur occasionally, making life feel like an illusion. 

Its been almost a year now. My memory has definitely recuperated, seemingly has fixed itself. But not completely. Sometimes I find myself staring at a wall, with my brain completely turned off; or I am fidgeting with something, brain still limp. Repeating things in my head, talking to myself, blurring vision, short attention span. Some of the things I have noticed. 

It's much more toned down now, but I feel for my own sake, I need to know. Is there something wrong with me, or is it nothing to worry about? And if so, what? I really have no idea and I don't want to google-diagnose, but I have nobody I am comfortable talking to (at the moment)."
5,"Hi everyone. I woke up Derealized on Jun 22 and had no idea what was going on. I then obsessed over and continuously researched my symptoms until I found out about Derealization. If I had to guess I would say it was triggered by many traumatic experiences and a panic attack I had while drinking Codeine. I’ve been around and sold drugs for many many years and never experienced a panic attack until I pushed it too far. That’s a short version of my DR story but the reason for my post is to get some answers about my recovery. I’ve gotten to a point to where the only time I feel DR is when I’m alone and can think. At work, with my girl or with my friends I have been able to live in the moment and very rarely feel it. I was wondering if this was a good sign or a bad sign. If it only happens when I’m alone now what should I do? As I’m typing this I don’t feel it too bad, but if I ever pause and think for a few seconds it’s like I can trigger it on my own, and the thoughts flood in “ I’m really alive, I’m really here, how am I controlling myself “ etc. and it causes some DR. I was wondering what I could do to maybe get over the last little hump of recovery."
5,"Hey all, I am not diagnosed so not 100% this is my problem.

But I do get really zoned out and in my head. Sometimes it is really hard to get out. Sometimes an argument with my spouse will bring me back. Is there a simpler way? How do y'all learn to start staying on the ground. Is there an easier way for me to come out of my head?

And has anyone else experienced this."
5,"It seems that I can't get over some problem overnight, so I try to cope in this kind of way. I just feel that people around my place can't be trusted.. fake rumors here, fake rumors there. Some people find joy in tormenting the feelings of others. I just feel so wronged by them. It's so unfair. I wasn't able to sleep properly because I really wanted to show those people that they're wrong!

I hate it when I struggle like this."
5,"Hi. How you deal when your brain is off? Last times my mind tends to be stuck or hyperactive, now that I think about it I ever be like that. I dont want to fall in drugs"
5,"I sometimes completely forget people I have known for months to years, this usually happens after a strong emotional experience with them before not seeing them for a long period of time. I either remember them in a tsunami of memories after a short period of time of seeing them in person again or it can take a long time if nothing triggers my memory of them. I have pretty terrible facial recognition and name recall, but it seems to be something beyond that. It can be like they've been completely erased from my memory. Has anyone ever had experiences similar to this?"
5,"There are times when I feel my mind taking a back seat to my body and actions. I do stuff that I have no control over, and all I can do are watch."

5,"I have a really hard time communicating because when I speak, I find that the I am detached from the words I say. In other words, I don't understand what I'm saying, even though I am technically speaking. This makes it so difficult to speak more than one sentence, because after one, I'm already lost. Anyone know what this could be?"
5,"I was diagnosed with Depersonalisation around October/November in 2019.  Depersonalisation is an anxiety disorder and a quite disturbing one at that. It can often leave you feeling detached from yourself and reality around you. Some people get Depersonalisation or aspects of it when they feel extreme anxiety, which could last a short while. But some people, like myself, can have it constantly for months, maybe years. I have seen some cases online where people have said they have had it for 10 years and it’s still going on. But you can’t let other people’s experiences of Depersonalisation distort your own view, because everyone’s is unique to themselves. If you have it of course.

Also, Derealisation is very similar to Depersonalisation, but I have not real come across any differences between them. I have seen two professionals in the process, and one diagnosed me with Depersonalisation and the other with Derealisation.

The Reason I writing this is for people who have been in the same situation with me. I had scoured the internet in order to find the answer to why I was like this and how I could get out of it so I could feel normal again, so I could feel like myself again. A lot of sites and people’s experiences were helpful and I suggest you read others stuff apart from this. But remember, everyone’s experience of this is unique to them, and yours is unique to you.



I’m going to start off with a bit of back story to myself. I finished A-level when I was 19 and when straight into University the following September. My first year of Uni was pretty amazing. Being free from my parents was excellent. I was a regular drug user in hash, coke, ket, nos, you name it, I have done everything. Even K-pins, which are for people with seizures. Drugs were fun no doubt about it, but in moderation and only if you feel up to it. But don’t do them too much, I can only express that enough. Don’t not feel pressured by people who do them a lot. Think about yourself first, rather than others. I also drank a lot, I think I developed a drinking problem, I would drink nearly every day, sometimes even in the morning. Which isn’t good at all.

Anyway, my first year at Uni is not important, what important is to know what I was doing at Uni, and how much I was doing it. Which was a lot. Fast track to June after my first year. Normal day in the park, drinking and smoking, when out later to mates bar. Was sniff coke in the toilets. Just seemed like a normal evening, wasn’t even going that heavily compared to other nights out. Went home kinda early to be honest with you. The next day I woke up, boom. That when it started. I can still remember the day exactly, which is common in a lot of cases. I was in bed and everything around me seemed so alien. I felt like I was in a trip. I was so scared and confused to where I was. I’m pretty sure I started drinking to try get rid of this feeling. Didn’t work. From there, I can’t remember too much, but everyday was the same. The constant dread of reality around me. I would look at myself in the mirror and not recognise myself. I didn’t recognise my parents, my sister or even my dog. I truly felt so alone and so scared. I had these constant racing thoughts which would overload my brain to the point I couldn’t think of anything else. The thoughts were mostly existential and about the universe. Questioning reality itself. They were constant, every day, every second. No break. No escape.

I’ve always had anxiety issues. I have even felt this way before, but only for a couple days and after that, I didn’t think anything of it. I had aspects of Depersonalisation in high anxiety situations, but just never acted on it because it only lasted a short while. If I or my parents had spotted it when I was younger, maybe my life would be different. But how could we have known what was to come. It’s a very rare anxiety disorder, which in some ways makes me feel special.

So back to my story. I had this job at a bar in oxford street. Was very busy and very stressful. But it was good to do something, get out the house and distract myself from my thoughts. I wasn’t drinking at this point. Which was good. But one day at work I was alone in the dry room (were you store the drinks) and everything was too much for me, so I backed a cider (my preferred choice of drink) and I felt someone normal. Well I was able to cope. I convinced myself I had a drinking problem (which was true) and the reason I was feeling this way was because of how much I was drinking. I connived myself I was an alcoholic. I ended up drinking constantly at work. Bring my own cider or wine into work until one day I realised what I was doing to myself. I walked out half way through my shift, never to return. I told my parents for the first time about how I was feeling. Was scary, but they reacted well and were very supportive of me. It didn’t change how I felt, or how I was thinking. But I was nice to get that off my chest. I stayed at home and played video games and didn’t drink at all. And then I started my second year at uni. This is were it really began to go down hill.

I was living in a 8 person house in a single bed room. I was a shit hole, but it was nice to go back t Brighton (where I go to university). I was weird because for the first week. I felt alright. I started drinking again, but I felt normal and okay. No idea why. But as soon as I felt good. I got back on the drugs and drink. And by the time Uni started, I was back to thinking my existential thoughts and questioning reality around me. It ended up getting top much, to the point where I dropped out of Uni. My mum was not happy, which didn’t help my anxiety and my Depersonalisation, but in the future we both agreed it was the best thing for me.

I started to see a therapist. We explored a lot about me. But the more we talked about myself, the more my thoughts started to get crazier. I brought up my sexuality in one session, which then lead me to question who I was sexuality even more. That’s when I was diagnosed with Depersonalisation, the first time I had ever heard about my anxiety disorder. I recommend getting a therapist is you have Depersonalisation, if not talk to someone you love or trust. It really is the best way forward. Rationalising your thoughts and getting them out there.

I continued with my therapist and I ended up getting a job at my dad’s work. With me out of uni, I was doing nothing with my days, which is bad. You need structure and to feel like you have a purpose in life. I was good, working. Again, it took my mind off my “crazy” thoughts. Then came around Christmas. Had three weeks off work. I was still drinking and using drugs like ket and coke. During Christmas I went up north to see family and was again drinking heavily for three days in a row. I really wasn’t helping myself. I was stupid. The only way I thought to have fun and talk to people was through drinking. It came to new years. I was going to go out and go out hard. In my head I thought you must, its new year’s. Wrong mindset for someone in the state I was in. I was drinking again and doing coke, which so bad for anxiety. But I just wanted to have a good time. The next day I woke up at my mates, unaware of what happen for most of the night. I smoked a spliff and drank remains of glasses of wine. My mate gave the rest of his coke and was doing that throughout the day as well. I had family over for dinner. At this point I really didn’t care. I thought I’m never going to get out of this state of mind so fuck it, lets go overboard. I started for the first time not to care about life. The next day I woke up, went shop bought a bottle of Lucozade and vodka, went back to Brighton drinking that on the train ride back. God I’m writing this now and thinking how much of a spanner I am, and thankful for the place I’m in now. Anyway, after I got back, I bought a bottle of red wine and drank all of that and passed out in bed by 6pm.i woke up at 3am, not knowing where the fuck I was or what was happening. I truly felt like I was going crazy. I couldn’t sleep and I was so scared by the environment around me. I kept thinking I was going to trip out. This continued into the day. My heart was racing and pulsating. I thought I was going to explode. I called 911 and went to A&E. I sat there for 5 hours, contemplating reality around me thinking I was in a mental institution. When the doctor saw me, she said nothing was wrong with my body. Heart rate was regular. And my breathing was good. He said I was having a panic attack. Though he gave me some advice, which till this day I’m sticking too. He said, set yourself a goal. An achievement, something to aim too. My parents picked me up that day and I moved back home. I just let everything out to them. Still didn’t recognise them or who I was at this point

I started work again. 5 days a week, 9am to 6pm. I stopped drinking completely and no drugs at all. Things started to get worse, mentally. It was so confusing to me, I thought the answer to fixing my problem was to just cut out the drinking and drug use. This is when I thought about killing myself, to end this horrible thought and escape from the scary alien world around me. I would be at the train station, thinking of ending it. One point I nearly did. Taking yourself is completely in your own hands, at the end of the day, only you can stop yourself. But it doesn’t end the pain and suffering, it only passes it on to your love ones. I didn’t want that for my family. I didn’t want to put that on my friends. It wasn’t fair on them.

I talked to my therapist about this. It took me a couple sessions to bring it up, but I am glad I did. Telling someone you want to end your self made everything so real. Me and my therapist also discovered that in all recent sessions with him, I felt so real talking to him. He was the only person I really have ever talked to about my feelings. You need to talk to people in your life about your feelings. Not so they can know, so you can put it out there, so its not in your head. The first time I talked to my best friend about I felt and what was going through my mind, I felt safe for once.

Though doing this, I was still having these crazy thoughts, but at a pace I could manage and control. I then went to go see a psychiatrist. She put me on an antidepressant called Sertraline. It’s is good, it has made a real impact on my life. But the one thing I will tell you now, which will have a real impact on you. I took the leap. I let the “crazy” thoughts come at me and I was brave, I wasn’t scared like I usually was. I challenged all those negative thoughts with positive ones. You can’t let your anxiety scare you, because then you live in fear of it the whole time and let it control your life. I used to not want to go out see my friends, not even my best friend. But now, I force myself too. I don’t force myself to talk if I don’t feel like it, there’s nothing wrong with a bit of observation. You must take this slow and know things aren’t just going to suddenly get better, it’s a process, a hard process which you have to endure. And while you are being brave and challenging these horrible thoughts with positive ones, you will slip. You’re not going to master your anxiety straight away. You can’t beat up yourself up about it, no one is perfect and its okay to fail.

So, it is now March 2020 for me, during the corona pandemic. And from using these techniques, I can honestly say, I want to live, I want to be happy. Even with all the shit that is going on with the world, I’m just being true to myself, being who I am, thinking about me and thinking positively. I still have these crazy thoughts, but I don’t get scared by them anymore. But they are coming less and less.



There’s a lot I didn’t talk about, because if I was to talk about everything, we would be here till the end of time itself (if time even is a thing). I still doing have Depersonalisation in my life. You can’t fix it. It’s not something that goes away instantly. You have to look after yourself. You must think about what’s best for you. As much I love doing ket coke and drinking, I have now cut these things out of my life. I can’t say I won’t ever do these things again, because I enjoyed them. But I will not do them as often I did. Not even close to. Some people can do these things, other can’t. and there is nothing wrong with that. I have only drunk twice in the last two months and have done any drugs since new year’s. I still smoke hash, but I have found that calms me down. But that might not work for you and I do not recommend doing it if you have high anxiety at this point (if you are suffering from high levels of Depersonalisation). Over the course of my Depersonalisation, I have picked up going to the gym and running. Like that doctor said, aim for something. I am now aiming to run a half marathon in May. From barely being able to breath, I can now run 9 miles with ease. Exercising wont cure your anxiety, but it will distract you from it.

I was very lucky, as I was born with a dad who has a good job. With his job he gets private health insurance so that’s how I was able to get a therapist and see a psychiatrist. For some people seeing either one of these two will be to expensive. It’s not fair that some people are born with more privileges than others. I suggest seeing a counsellor or Samaritans. Just letting out your emotions is key. Especially to a loved one.

Another big aspect of me getting to a better place was through meditation. This is about calming yourself down so you can think more clearly. I mediate two times a day. Start with guided meditation. Just type it into YouTube and you’ll be sorted.

Going back to researching online. When I first saw that people were still in a state of Depersonalisation for ten years, that really scared me. Thinking I could be this way for years and years terrified me. But that is exactly the reason why people are in that state for so much longer. Depersonalisation feeds of fear, it only makes it grow. You really can’t fear your Depersonalisation, you must accept that it is part of who you are. You can’t fix it, only accept and move one with your life. It may seem tough to think that, but it’s essential to.

Try to investigate your own anxiety a bit, it is so personal to you. My anxiety is based around what people think about me. I always think I’ve done something wrong, when I haven’t. or if I have, it’s not as bad as I thought. I shaped myself around other people, doing stuff to try impress them which just wasn’t me. Which probably why I accumulate this Depersonalisation disorder. but now I think for me and what I want to do. I do what make me happy.

Honestly, during the heavy stages of my Depersonalisation, it was horrible and terrifying. But now looking back on it, I’m glad I went through it. I used to be a heavily drink and drug user, did no exercise, didn’t really care about life, was always thinking of the future and criticising myself on my past mistakes. Now I’m fit and healthy, happy, making myself laugh, smiling and just generally feeling good. Now if I didn’t go through the Depersonalisation (which I still have aspects of to this day), I probably would be ruining my life without even knowing it. I now laugh at my mistakes and learn, i don’t feel bad for myself. I feel happy for myself.



This is so easier said than done. I has taken me 9 months to get where I am and I will probably still feel out of place time to time. But I keep being positive and knowing life isn’t out to get me, we weren’t born to feel this way. And that there are people around me, that can help me, I’m not by myself. I am not scared anymore, I took the leap and so should you. Depersonalisation isn’t a bad thing, it will make you your best self. Trust me.



If this has helped you in anyway, I’m glad.

I can recommend some way to help calm down your thoughts. Please don’t be scared, remember that’s the key to changing. I want to help. And maybe you can help me too."
5,"When I hit my lowest points during the day I will normally start to feel separated from myself and I can hear my self-talking etc but when I look at a part of my body it moves so slowly but yet I know that it's not. Then i can't really feel my emotions, i know i am sad but i justs feel numb. has anyone else felt like this ?"
5,"When I started having panic attacks, I would start to feel sick and get physical symptoms such as headaches, Pins and needles but that’s not what terrifies me the most about my anxiety. 
I start to feel like I’ve left my body and I’m not real, as though I’m dreaming. has anyone else had this experience and were you given medication just for this?"
5,"I've read things on disassociation before and it seemed like it was similar to depression in some ways. All I know is in certain situations, usually around people, but can be in isolation, I'll tend to wander off emotionally. It's like there's some kind of block or something preventing me from feeling, interacting, or engaging in any way. I'll kind of stare at the wall or the floor or something and I can hear people speaking but it turns into background noise almost for a short time, then I come back, and wander off again, and it repeats."
5,"I feel so weird. But not really bad, just like really bad derealization and/or dizziness? Yesterday I already felt like as though I'd forgotten my meds the day before, light headed, but I don't think I did. Then I had an argument with someone and I felt way worse and since then I feel this strangeness far worse than usual. Maybe I'm just coming down with something (hopefully not covid...)"
5,"When I recall it
It’s as if they go mad
And burn every painting 
Shatter every mirror I have
Tear their hair out.

Then try to tear my hair out
Calling “you liar, you liar”.

It’s only the truth.
Yes it hurts. 
But it better than delusion.

“Take it away they say
Hide it burn it
Take it away
Get it out of here.”

Somethings happen we can’t understand for years.

But such anger as this?

That says “anything but this
Just burn it get rid of it...” why?"
5,"Hello, no one relates to me when i talk about this issue. I remember having this episodes - I call them like that - from age of 13. First episode at 13 - I was walking down the streets with my friends and suddenly - I felt like really strange deja vu from something I probably dreamed (even that night) and like my dream is continuing. My state of mind and consciousness seem on some different level. I ""feel"" like ( right now at 24) I'm STUCK in 2009 or any other year that passed. And even remember/recall a lot of things from that year (I would  probably not remember in this state of mind right now or forgot them). The strangest thing is - Everything that happened AFTER that year I'm stuck (f.example 2009) I emotionally feel them again! Like my aunt died in 2010, but my mind in 2020 is suprised and shocked like first time hearing that news! It's unpleasant and overemotional experience every time. Like mixed deja vu, dream feeling and past feeling at once. It last for 30minutes to few hours. Than it's all normal again. I experience this once in 3 months probably. Anyone knows what is going on?"
5,"I suffer terribly from anxiety and sometimes I have this symptom, which I thought was dissociation?

I happens when mostly when I’m at work around lots of people, I know I’m at work, but my mind feels totally distant from what is happening around me. 

Is this dissociation?"
5,"Hey everyone hope you're all as good as you can be. First Post here, only recently got a diagnosis of BPD and PTSD and not a lot of help from the docs with covid. For the past 6 months could be longer my memory is so foggy I've been dissociating like mad. I mean everything just doesn't look real its like virtual reality I can see it but its not right somethings not right, I try and go out to clear my mind and breathe in the cool air and I feel nothing, its like a breathless breath, I can remember how it used to feel, how calming the outside used to be the breeze in my hair, down the woods the beautiful scenery but now when I go I feel nothing from it, it doesn't look like it used too, its like being in a dream state, like looking at a memory or something. The worst thing about it is the time I'm loosing sometimes I'll end of literally staring into the distance for what seems like half an hour at a push and I've lost 4 hours of the day. And I cant remember what I done yesterday, it hurts my head to try think about it, I've had to stop using the oven because I keep zoning out and burning things almost had a fire the other week. I've tried all the grounding techniques I've read online but none help none snap me back. I cant remember the last time I was in touch with reality. I've ignored all friends my hygiene has went downhill, I haven't been keeping up with housework, everything in my life is suffering because of it and I'm worried about whats gonna happen if it goes on any longer. I don't even know what I'm thinking about while its happening that's the worst part at the time I know I am daydreaming it usually starts when I stress over something, I ruminate a lot but once I snap out the daydream all recollection of it goes too, I've always felt depressed and anxious but I've never felt so crazy in my life, like i don't even know what I'm doing the majority of the time if I try remember I actually get headaches and anxiety attacks. Has anyone suffered something similar? How do you cope and snap out of it? I'm at a loss and its driving me insane the time I am here and able to focus
Thanks for taking the time to read ♡"
5,"I've been looking how to deal with dissociation. All I get are grounding techniques and how to bring myself back to the present moment. But often I don't want to be in the present moment! It's often unbearable. It feels like I need to keep on getting breaks from being, I can't stay in the present moment too long, as I'm getting overwhelmed and need to switch off, to simply.. rest.

My life is not bad, I've got much more than an average person, I don't understand why I feel so terrible unless I'm dissociated. On the other hand having memory loss, blacks out, no feeling of time, and not being able to explain to friends what just happened, is nothing pleasant.

How to fight dissociation when I still feel I need it to survive? And why do I still feel like this?"
