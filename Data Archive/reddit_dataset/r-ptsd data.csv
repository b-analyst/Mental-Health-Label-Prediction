April is a hard month.,2,mlql97,0,"I met my abuser properly on Saturday, 14th April, 2018 at my friend’s birthday party in my friend’s house. I first went over to my abuser’s house for the first time on Wednesday, 18th April, 2018 where he gave me my first kiss. I lost my virginity to my abuser on Monday, 23rd April, 2018. I attended a party on Saturday, 28th April, 2018 and loads of my abusers friends approached me and asked how he was in bed. My abuser then had a go at me, accusing me of telling everyone about us and threatening to leave.

Why didn’t I read that sign and just leave then.

Last night I had a vivid dream of the memory of Saturday, 14th April, 2018 - walking through the house of the party. I didn’t know I could dream of memories. This is the first time this has happened. I’m scared to go to sleep tonight.

Just now, I got a notification from Instagram saying “follow .... and other people you may know” and it was him. My abuser. I thought I had him blocked everywhere but clearly not. It’s taken my account this long to recommend him. Why now? Why after that dream? Why in APRIL of all months? Why? Why why why.

Do you ever feel like things happen for a reason and that coincidences are often too fucking coincidental to JUST BE coincidences?! Do you believe in fate? Do you believe in those horribly painful gut feelings that something isn’t right? I do. I really really do. Because usually my gut feeling is right and usually it isn’t just a coincidence.

I’m terrified to sleep incase I dream of a worse or more painful memory. I’m now scared that fate’s gonna make me run into him again soon. He only lives ten minutes up the hill from me. It makes me scared to leave the house. And when things like this happens, it makes it worse.

I’d like to disclose that I AM on the waiting list for a domestic abuse counselling thing. It’s not okay that this still kills me so much when he left over two years ago."
Part of me is dead TW: assault,1,mlp9oa,0,"I feel like the men who did this to me stole a part of me. They took a piece of me I could never get back

Loved ones hurt me not strangers. I shouldn’t be afraid of strangers hurting me because it was the ones who “loved me” that hurt me, not a stranger. There is no way someone who loved another could do anything like that to them. It should be a stranger who hurts someone like that. Friends don’t assault friends. Boyfriends shouldn’t choke their girlfriends unconscious. 

I am scared. I am tired. I miss therapy. (Mine is on maternity leave currently.) I am down."
Rant-this is why it’s not as easy as just asking for help.,5,mln7ea,5,"Last year was a rough one for me at work. Not to get overly specific, but I ended up in a few situations that have ended with me having severely impaired ability to do my job. Some days are good, some most days are really bad. It’s to the point where it’s effecting my life, my wife, and my work. My substance use has exploded, and is officially a crutch. Without sugarcoating it, I’m pretty fucked up. So I make the decision to go see my family doctor and have a conversation with him. He’s been great in helping me deal with my ADHD, and is usually right on the ball. My fear was that it would be downplayed, and I’d get the “you just aren’t cut out for it” speech or the “if you don’t like it find another job.” Needless to say, all my worst worries came through, and my doctor told me about all the mental health issues in his field. I believe this was a way to try and build rapport, but in the end it was extremely belittling. We talked about the need to build resiliency, which I’m totally on board with, but he refused to accept that I feel no improvement from online counselling, and NEED to talk to people in person. Now I’m just laying in bed, trying to figure what my next step is. I feel broken beyond words, and hopeless that there will be any improvement."
How do you handle elevated heart rate?,2,mlmvyz,1,"I have these mini attacks a few times a week. I'll just be laying around and then suddenly my brain drifts and im back there or ill be watching something and get triggered but it isn’t enough to send me on a spiral. Still i can feel my heart rate spike and my body go ""oh shit it's go time."" I am fortunate enough to have one of those phones where i can check my heart rate and stress so i get to understand what's happening and it isn’t pretty. During attacks it can be 100 to 110 bpm resting heart rate and at one point i had a particularly bad attack that left me ~140 for roughly 7 hours despite doing literally nothing.  

I know this is bad for me so I'm seeking help. How do you manage elevated heart rate during attacks?"
"dae overshare? if so, why do you think you do that?",40,mlmemh,33,"i’m not sure if ptsd correlates to oversharing or not. its a serious problem of mine. i want to stop oversharing but i can’t. i literally overshare to other people the way i talk to my therapist. that’s not good. that’s too much. i don’t know why though? what makes me overshare? i feel like that’s just me, but i didn’t always overshare, yk?"
Meth and PTSD,4,mllg9y,8,"So my history is simple yet it horrible, I’m addicted to meth, I have suffered from horrible psychosis and that psychosis traumatized me in horrible ways, last week I hallucinated one of the most horrible things in my life thanks to meth, I don’t wanna talk about it but I got even more traumatized, I’m on the point we’re I feel dull, I feel horrible, I feel depressed, anxious, paranoid without meth, I fear being alone, I just don’t live I survive, it’s been a very hard time living since this happened. The worst is that the desire for meth hasn’t disappeared but I’m sober since then. Any advice, I’ve suffered from trauma in the past but this trauma in specific has been the most intense of this kind, has took all of my desire to live and exist. I live in constant fear."
Does PTSD look different in men and women?,10,mlg5uc,5,"I read somewhere that women experience emotions of shame and guilt more often than men. Men have stronger feelings of anger.
Women are more likely to have agoraphobia than men. 
Is it connected to the nature of trauma the person experienced?"
Pressure from others just make me want to break down,12,mlf41h,0,"I try really hard, I'm an over achiever and I still get told I'm not doing enough. I have my limits and I already pass them which isn't healthy in itself and I know I should have my license and  ID by now but I'm tired. I work most days now. 

I need compassion, not hurt."
Just venting i guess.,7,mldgw4,2,"I'm male and 23. And now i realize more clearly that me and my 3 sisters where sexually abused by our father in our early childhood. I know because my sisters and my mother are now speaking more openly to me about those things. 

As my mother told me lately, she had been raped by him also often times.
I myself can't remember anything that happend to me or my sisters. It all comes clearer now but i had heard of those things a few times when i was younger. Though i didn't really realised it. Don't know how else to formulate it.

I did know and realised quite early however, that my family was a bit messed up and that my mother couldn't take care of her children properly. She was very angry with them often times. Also hit them and blamed them for the difficult situations we often found ourselfs in. She sometimes even punished us for our need of care when we where ill.

Still, this whole story about how this all came to happen and why there was so little help for us for so long and why many family members didn't ever talked about this or even disclaimed many of the terrible conditions we were in. 

Some parts of me say: ""is this all true? What when it is not. How am i to behave. How am i to go about every day live. What must i do to get my live together. Can i even do it? 
How hard must i try. I failed so often. ...""

I left ""home"" when i was 17, i lived in different places but barely felt at home anywhere. I quit different schoolings, now i work as a cleaner for about 5 hours per week.since nearly 2 years I'm in a sincere intimate relationship for the first time in my life and we are about to move together.I also go to therapie since about 3 months one time per week, which i think helps me. 

I just wanted to share a bit of my Story. It's also my first post. I don't really know what to expect of it.

Thanks for reading. I hope you are doing well."
Is it possible to get PTSD over things that don't personally affect you?,6,mlcwmc,0,"Before anyone says anything, I have A LOT of personal traumas too, so please don't attack me for this ""little; how tf is this affecting you lol"" thing.

I feel extra sensitive towards literally everything around me. I am talking about all the live footage of m\*rder and SA. I feel so traumatised by the YouTubers i grew up with; by the general community- the police etc. I feel so helpless; small; weak; insignificant. I feel like I am not doing anything even if I advocate, educate, donate... I feel so... dumb yknow... Like, if I couldn't help myself, at least, I wanna help others and I cant even do that? I am so scared of humans that I been so avoidant of everyone and I feel extremely alone. I just feel and see hatred and pain everywhere I go. Going by my day, knowing that someone got SA'd, someone got m\*rdered. That my best friend will never have justice. I will never have justice. Even if I am studying my dream major thinking ""oh i can at least help ONE person, at least ill make the tiniest change"", IT'S STILL Not enough. I feel so much guilt when I know none of this is my fault. I feel so guilty for what I been through, even though I know i deserve better. I don't wanna feel like the every single person could end up being evil. I wish i can trust people again, and be dumb and fall in love easily. It was so much easier to just- love and trust. My naive view of the world was so much better than noticing and feeling every little detail. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want to be free. I want to feel safe. I want to trust and love again. I want to be happy. I wish I can let go of everything and erase all my trauma. I don't wanna live like this...."
Do you disclose to employers?,17,mlc4ui,9,"I have an interview tomorrow and I’m wondering if it would benefit me to disclose to them that I’m diagnosed with PTSD and Panic Disorder.

I just have a lot of anxiety when it come to working because I will have panic attacks in public so I’m not sure whether or not to let an employer know."
My PTSD (If I can get advice I'd greatly appreciate it),2,mlbu54,1,"So some background my mom was mentally abusive, her ex-husband(stepdad) was 1 of 2 sexual abusers of mine, the neighbors daughter my ""friend"" who was another. Lately I've been relapsing so badly that im shaking, can't breathe but then i breathe in so much that it hurts to breathe in but i wont release the air, its gotten so bad that i can't talk coherently just choppy but understandable sentences, instead of usual 1 memory I've been getting every single memory and more that i forgot about. Lately I've been daydreaming so much, not only that but I'll be having moments where I'll forget who I am for like 5 maybe 10 seconds forget who i am what I'm doing but then I come back. Then there's times I'm so paranoid around people that I don't want to stay around them in school but I want to cry but can't so I panic. There's times that I have out of body experiences but my body continues to  do whatever I was doing like I'd be taking notes in class but then I'm out of my body moving in my memories and my body will continue taking notes fully and when I come back they're done. It scares me when that happens because I didn't learn anything but I copied and finished everything done, I've done it while walking as well while carrying a food tray and sat down at a table then snapped back and I looked at my boyfriend confused and asked how did I get hear this was in 8th grade I'm now in tenth and it's only gotten worse even though I've been better I was released from therapy. When my dad is left with my dad I get paranoid and sit there for ages to make sure she's safe and I know that's not healthy my still boyfriend from 8th grade I told him he ever hurts our kids I will leave him in a heartbeat and make sure he gets heck in jail because my mother stopped my abuse from her ex-husband but kept him in the house. I don't know what to do I've been so bad lately that its taking a toll on my relationship and though my boyfriend is so strong and has been helping me so much when i relapse(not usually this bad) I push him away almost ending the relationship for him to have a ""happier life and normal life"" though he said he's happiest with me and he said his life isn't normal that he's lives a great life and loves helping me he loves caring for me and helping knowing my family is not the best... but lately because my moms ex-husband isn't behind bars he still sees my siblings (which are his blood related kids, and the reason my abuse happened so long was because i believe if it happened to me it wouldn't happen to them that I was protecting them) Hes not behind bars he still sees them and lately my issues have been happening so bad that I'm somehow messing with my memories thinking I made them up, my mom used to yell at me that i was on her Sh\*t list and my aunt was on there knowing she hated my aunt and my mom said I was on there but it didn't hit me that she hated be till I saw the list a  physical list right under my aunts name so i knew my mom hated me, and well that aunt said in the beginning when i told my dad what happened she said what if he was brainwashing me which i know isn't true but her saying that made me start thinking i was making this all up that maybe i had a bad dream like the many I've had, I'm starting to doubt myself and I told my boyfriend and he said ""no, i know this happened to you with the great detail and breakdowns you've had the fear you show whenever your siblings are alone with your parents, as awful as it is I know it happened and honey I'm hear for you to vent, cry, and be listened and believed in I'm here for you.""  Many people at school and home life see me as happy but never see this side of me besides my partner, they don't see my paranoia, doubt, the struggle of remembering to eat because I developed eating disorders that I'm healing from, shaking, breathing, the forgetting who I am, and out of body, they never see all the memories that I live, yet they say I'm living the highlight of life which they aren't wrong I'm the happiest my entire life I've finally been happy living life not wanting to disappear or die, but everyone tries to make it seem like I've lived nothing. I overreact so much to little things but I can't control it. I don't know what to do I'm scared for people to see me at school when I can't control it. My family called me a chemical F\*ck up because I'm pansexual and nonbinary, they see that because I chemically have a difference that make me attracted to shes/hes/theys and thems to them all that I'm a screw up because I'm attracted to those and that they compare me to those who want equality out on protest for that when yes I want equality but I'm doing everything for them to not get angry for those out there when I have done anything. Just what can I do to calm down better to heal better to feel better and not doubt my memories, who I am, and everything in life. I'd like advice."
"My roommate got upset and started throwing what they had on them (keys, wallet, etc) last night and I dont see a reason to wake up today",6,mlb2k0,3,"I cant see her.

I cant. I mean, I reeeeeeally dont want to.

In my dreams, there are people who always want to hang out with me and there’s always something to do.

Jenn’s just gonna be sitting in the chair I like writing my cover letters in lookin like the dog that got into the garbage.

My dad used to throw things. Usually at my head.

Ever since I got in this one medication, everyone in my dreams have been So nice. It might feel all weird and I’m hardly ever doing what I want to be but I’ve never watched someone get so upset that they start throwing things in there.

It’s safe in my bed."
"If I have trauma, is it still valid if I don’t have PTSD?",2,ml9ud4,5,"I am 17, and I think I have been through a lot of trauma for my age (my mother tried to kill me so I was adopted by my grandparents, they died, I was manipulated and abandoned by my aunt, who threw me into an even more abusive home until I moved out at 16)

I have depression and anxiety, which I was diagnosed with when I was around 12, but this was before I went through most of my trauma and I have never been reassessed for any other mental health issues. What I find odd is that I don’t have any strong symptoms of PTSD, the only thing I can think of that could lead into it is I have really bad abandonment issues (I have nightmares of people I care about dying and I am paranoid that everyone I love will either die or leave me) But that doesn’t line up with symptoms of PTSD. I’ve only ever had a strong “trigger” once when I was around 13, I saw a scene of a hospital or something and I started crying because it reminded me of losing my grandmother, but this was before I was fully orphaned or went through any emotional or physical abuse so I don’t think it counts."
Hallucinations,2,ml9ktc,3,"I look at random people then I imagine them dieing in horrific ways , burning or other stuff .. I look at random places blink next thing I see is those same places exploding in chaos. This post is me venting so feel free to not comment. If the same thing happens to you , feel free to share how I can get rid of this as I can't control it no matter how much I try ."
I think I’m finally recovered! I never thought this day would come.,46,ml9ggg,2,"First of all, I would like to say a HUGE thank you to everybody on this sub. You all have been so supportive. We’re some strong people. 

I wanted to write this to share my story and hopefully give some people recovery hope. 

How did I do it? I wish I had a better answer, but time and realization. My PTSD lasted about a year and a half, which is lucky compared to some of the people I’ve seen battling it for 5+. By realization, most of what was holding me back from recovery was guilt and regret. I put myself in my abuser’s shoes and asked myself various questions in that position. I actually became angry at my abuser for taking my childhood away, which was a big step. 

I still get the occasional flashback, but they’re not the panic-inducing ones I used to know. More like bad thoughts. 

My advice to everyone here (based off my experience!) is to...
-be patient, give it time! 
-put yourself in your abuser(s) shoes if you feel guilty
-realize you are worthy of love, abusers have tactics to make you feel otherwise! 

And something that personally helped me...
-The second most recent episode of Grey’s Anatomy. There is some deep PTSD and life advice in it. 

Lastly, stay strong! The storm will eventually end."
Is EDMR worth it?,9,ml8ci8,10,"How did it work for you?

How long did it go for you?

Were you able to study/work while doing it?"
Mental Breakdown and it’s my birthday,79,ml87ob,9,"So, it’s my 18th birthday rn and it’s currently 3:59 am. I’m staying in a hotel with my family. I had a traumatic experience a few months back, and it happened  when i was sleeping over at a friends house. I have to share a bed with my brother in our hotel room and by no means am i in danger, but my brain keeps telling me the opposite. I can’t sleep at all and i’m current sitting out on the balcony, wearing a bath robe over my clothes to stay warm. I’m just waiting for the sun to come up, but i really need help. any words of wisdom are much appreciated."
Trauma(may or may not be CPTSD/PTSD) and ADHD Symptoms,1,ml84fm,1,"I've always thought I've had ADHD but recently I started going to a psychologist who suggests it might be trauma and I'm just really confused. 

Has anyone else thought they had ADHD but it was a trauma response? And also why and how did you realize it wasn't ADHD(aside from being diagnosed) 

I display very strong symptoms of ADHD and was wondering what made everyone else confirm it in their heads whether they had ADHD or not(again aside from the diagnosis) 

I also am not asking this as medical advice or a diagnosis, just as wanting to know others experience with this.

Also another thing to note is that while the trauma was trauma it wasnt anything that was extremely intense. Like at all."
why is my PTSD so bad from nonviolent sexual assault?,8,ml568a,12,i was groomed for ten years by my step dad and assaulted multiple times nonviolently as a preteen and teen. i feel like im being so dramatic by having such a severe mental challenge. i mean it didnt happen more than a few times. it was nonviolent. i was older. how come i am so ruined? with such serious mental patterns will i ever *truly* get better? (please dont tell me to go to therapy. i am in therapy and have been doing CPT for a while.)
Sometimes I feel like I feel like a fake- like I need to prove my PTSD.,68,ml3g35,7,"Then I remember every night of my life that I can’t sleep because each noise has me under the impression someone has come to kill, kidnap, hurt or rape me.

Trauma- possible cPTSD if not likely,1,ml3dpy,1,"General TW- talk of trauma, gender, sexual characteristics, depression/suicidal, intrusive thoughts, and the general content could just be overwhelming for some 

Also sorry it’s so jumpy I’ve been writing this during a panic attack for 30 minutes and I still feel awful. 

I (m17) have a lot of trauma I’ve been through that was consistent for my entire life and I’m still honestly not out of the woods even now. Its probably resulted in cPTSD but I’m undiagnosed so it’s only possible, thought I think likely. The only thing is it’s not typical trauma, nothing bad happened to me physically, there were no isolated events, it was just consistent and there all of the time from day 1 of my life. I am intersex (XY with internal testes and ambiguous genitalia) and when I was born I appeared more female than male so they had sent me out that way and I was raised female. I was called a girl, people called me she, I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair until middle school, people thought I was biologically female, and I had to use the girls bathrooms and changing rooms. Of course I had the perfect storm of things going on that made me seem like a typical female (gynecomastia and pseudo-menses), yet I was not because I am male. From as young as age 5 I remember always telling people I was a boy and I kept begging to be referred to as such. I told teachers and other kids I had a penis but my parents thought I was girl. I was ignored, dismissed, and laughed off. My dad was nice enough to hear me out to a degree and let me do cub-scouts with my brother, participate on boys sports teams, and took me out to do typical father-son activities but he still called me his daughter. It wasn’t enough. I broke down in health class multiple times because I had to attend the girls portion of the class. I skipped gym all of the time because they wanted me to change in the girls lockers, I just walked the halls and hid around. I used the boys bathroom whenever I could in public or at school and while that was relieving it didn’t do much to curb the damage done. Eventually I just stopped going to school most of the time because I knew I would be perceived as female and I couldn’t deal with that, so I stayed home. I was miserable all throughout middle school and most of high school, which I dropped out of because I was tired and ready to move on to better things (yay for early college I guess). In 7th grade my parents actually started to listen to me (mainly my mom) and took me to a doctor who suggested I might be transgender. It made sense at the time so I just went with it, even though it felt off and not right. I was put on hormone blockers and stayed on them until the end of my freshman year of high school. I gained a lot of weight and because I was barely starting puberty my voice was still high. I looked androgynous and sounded like a girl. People who didn’t know me gendered me correctly which was good, but most already knew who I was so I was incorrectly perceived. My freshman year I remember a junior guy gendering me correctly and consistently in my civics class and it was probably the thing I looked forward to most cause he would talk to me about typical boy shit like boners and sports, and it was finally someone seeing me for my real gender. Then of course a classmate who knew me told him I “used to be a girl” and he kind of stopped talking to me after that. Never gonna forgive that classmate that’s for sure, since she was wrong and he was actually right. At 14 and 15 I still sounded like a 12 year old boy (which of course 12 year old boys sound like girls) so that sometimes set people off who didn’t know me, but most of the time I was just assumed younger (which I guess in terms of pubescent stages I was, so I’m not offended by someone thinking I was 12 at 15, especially cause they gendered me right). Thankfully that’s not the case now as I’m finally going through puberty (started at 15 when I started testosterone replacement therapy). I look and sound like a normal guy my age now. I only got my intersex condition confirmed a few months ago which is good to finally have knowledge of but also now I’m stuck with everyone I knew before thinking I’m a trans guy so that kinda sucks since I can’t explain the reality of the situation. That’s how it still kind of lingers but at least I’m not viewed as a girl anymore, at least not to my face...

TL;DR - I was raised female as a biological male with an intersex condition and it was traumatic

Now onto how it’s affecting me currently. Of course I’ve been horribly depressed for a majority of my life because of the trauma I went through but after dropping out of high school and getting away from the people who gendered me incorrectly I started feeling a lot better. I finished my GED, started community college, started working out, got a job, things were good. Even during the beginning of covid it wasn’t unbearable, things were fine until around December I would say. I also have OCD so that also plays a part in this, it may even be trauma induced I’m not sure, but it went from manageable to hard to manage in that month. However since the beginning of the year it’s gone from hard to manage to crippling, on top of trauma attacks and loneliness with no outlets to vent outside the internet. I’ve developed something akin to body dysmorphia is the only way I can really describe it. I can’t look at my face or body without thinking I look like a girl or a young man who looks like he used to be one. I can’t hear my voice without thinking it sounds like a girls voice and in my head my inner voice still sounds like my pre pubescent self. Objectively speaking I look and sound nothing like a girl, there’s no “tells” that I was once perceived as one and theres no indication that I’m biologically female in any way. But my mind says otherwise. It says that my ambiguous genitalia are normal for a female and that my penis is just an enlarged clitoris. It says my testes aren’t actually there and I’m just wishfully thinking because I don’t want to be a girl. It says my gynecomastia is normal female development and not abnormal male breast enlargement. It says I’m biologically female even though I am objectively not. It tells me I look female even though I objectively don’t. I can’t be around women or trans guys for long without getting uncomfortable because of those sort of thoughts, it’s triggering. Looking at photos of myself or hearing voice recordings from before I started puberty is triggering. Those triggers and thoughts send me into a panic and I break down and cry just hoping it’ll end and that someone might be able to help me but nobody ever does. I just suffer alone with nobody to talk to. I’m constantly paranoid that people view me as female or that they secretly call me “she” behind my back. I’m always afraid people don’t actually view me as male and that they would lie if they were asked. I was constantly dismissed and ignored as a child when I told people I was a boy and I just get so overwhelmed by how I was never believed and nobody addressed my concerns until it was far too late to undo any damage. It wasn’t fair and I get so angry sometimes and shut down over it. I always have the urge to cut off everybody I know currently and rebuild my life as I want it so I don’t have to doubt how others perceive me. I’m constantly obsessing over and checking my body to make sure I’m still male and look male and because of my distorted perception and intrusive thoughts most times acting on those compulsions don’t even help. My perception is so warped that it’s basically in another reality and the paranoia is getting to me. Most days I don’t even want to speak or be looked at by anyone, not even myself because I’m so scared of how I’ll be perceived. Whenever I get triggered and panic I feel physically sick. I can’t whisper or speak quietly because it sounds like a female voice, why I really don’t know but it’s probably because most guys revert to their falsetto when they speak quieter or whisper since it uses less of your vocal chords. I have random crying spells brought on by seemingly nothing but just remembering the past and those intrusive thoughts. I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual just to try and escape them. This trauma has ruined me and I can’t take it anymore. I’ve been rapidly declining for weeks now and I’m approaching being borderline suicidal because it’s gotten so bad. Things have gotten bad again and I can’t even tell anybody because they just wouldn’t get it. I feel so broken and I need help but I don’t know where to start. 

TL;DR- I’m suffering too much and just about ready to let it all go"
Does anyone else self triggers themselves?,3,ml31je,1,"I know it’s not healthy and that it only makes me feel worse but usually at night, I’ll actively seek movies/episodes of shows/poems even that i know will trigger me and make me feel like shit.. 
I’m not sure if it’s just a way of self harm, me trying to actually feel something after feeling numb all day or me trying to prove myself that I’m okay enough and i can stomach it without getting triggered. 

Most times i just end up getting triggered, feeling sad and crying myself to sleep. It’s all my fault tho.. i wish i could forget about and stop harming myself but I can’t.."
"Panicky Feeling | TW: Manipulation, Toxic Stuff, Etc.",1,ml2rmj,0,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that I'll spoiler this post to make sure nobody gets triggered or anything, so there's a warning for mentions of manipulation and some generally toxic things. I'm also new to this subreddit and currently suffer from PTSD and such.  
Anyways, it was about 2-3 months ago (or more) when this happened. I was talking with a few friends over like, text and stuff (these friends are online, not IRL) and all the sudden they started talking about a guy who I'll call S. S used to be nice, but after a while he began to turn into, well, an asshole. Being passive-aggressive all the time, generally saying some shitty things to people who didn't do anything, and overall being very toxic and manipulative, etc. Of course, I was best friends with S and I didn't let go because I was fairly young at the time. S, therefore, was shitty to me and others and being generally toxic and what-not. Yadda-yadda, the friends that were having a conversation about him went through a similar situation with him. During this time as well I felt guilty about what S did, regretting some of my actions and how I treated S despite S being the cause.  
So yeah, friends were talking about how much of an ass S was and, all of a sudden, I got shaky. From what I remember I was shaking, could hardly breathe, and I couldn't calm myself down. I also got a feeling of guilt hit me like a truck because, you know, S. It took me about 30-45 minutes to finally calm down.  


Does anyone know what this was? I think it might've been a normal panic attack but I have no idea what actually happened. Was it a PTSD attack, a panic attack, or something else? To those who give advice thank you so much in advance."
"All traumas from my entire life CW: S*xual abuse, Neglect, Verbal abuse",2,ml2d6r,0,"Repost from r/CPTSD

So I just for the sake of needing to get it all out because I tend to not be able to, I just wanna list all i've been through from childhood to adulthood. I'm a gay male with DID btw.

\*Ages 3-5: I can't remember a lot, from ages 3 and I assume even before I would neglected, not physically, but emotionally by my mother and my father had abandoned me as a child and would be completely neglected via not being hugged or comforted ever and being forced to ""Cry it out."" I would be sexually abused at either age 4 or 5 by two men whom I still can't remember who had forced themselves on me and hurt me and as a result I would be very frightened and unable to attend pre-school initially because I would cry and scream and hurt myself so much and be so clingy that I couldn't attend my first one.

\*Ages 6-8: At these ages my mother being sexually assaulting me, forcing me to shower with her in which she would expose herself to me and make me touch her body. At this age as well if not sexual abuse by her I would be forced into emotional incest, being forced to comfort her at the same time as she was assaulting me because she would cry about being a bad mother and I would be forced to play the role of her husband and tell her I loved her, gave her back rubs and hugs. My grandma who has bipolar 1 like me began to stop taking her meds every now and then and became extremely abusive as well verbally and she and my mom would neglect me or constantly insult me every single day. I would begin to start showing more signs of sexual abuse such as bedwetting and other behaviors. As well I would be constantly bullied by students. At this time I had also protected my friends from a robber and hid them as a man stole my brothers items. As well at this time I told my mother I wished to die to go to heaven where it's safe in which she laughed it off and walked away.

\*Ages 9-10: At this time I would be harassed and bullied by students and then my own teachers as well as my mother and grandma and grandpa who was a drunkard. My mom became boyfriends with a man who would also terrorize me, I was witness to him smashing a chair into his brothers head repeatedly and had to be the adult in the situation and protect him by stepping in front of him and saying ""You wouldn't hurt a child would you?"", then afterwards bandaging his brother myself. I would be witness to his cocaine addiction and him coming home cracked out and scaring me while he was having bad trips. Him threatening to kill me or beat me, and other stuff of that nature. Being around my mother, him and his friend mocking and yelling at me while they were drunk and I was crying, and telling me intimate details of sex life and how they were selling drugs together to addicts. I was repeatedly told that I was a bitch, always complaining and the abuser.

\*Ages 11-14: I would be forced to move into my grandma's house because of my mom's frivolous spending, in which every single day I would be screamed or tortured by my grandma, grandpa, cousin, aunt, sister, and mom and be forced to pick fights with every one of them and be harassed by them. My memory in general is extremely poor but I remember extremely little of the sexual abuse when I was younger and this period as well. My mom broke up with her boyfriend after moving in as well. During this period I would be routinely mocked in a group by most of my family members as I cried. I was forced to go to therapy because I was a ""problem child"" and in those therapy sessions my mom would talk to the therapist and the therapist and my mom would never allow me to talk during sessions with two therapists, with both therapists the only listened to my mom's needs and wants and never gave any advice other than ""Go do breathing exercises I guess.""

\*Ages: 15-17: I was living in an apartment with my mom after she moved out, in which she would refuse to sleep and go into psychosis and terrify me and abuse me verbally every day and act even more childlike than she already has throughout life. At 16-17 when I entered high school my mom's ex-boyfriend dumped his ex-girlfriend on us and she lived with us for two years in which she stole from us and I barely had any food to eat, she shouted at me and was also an addict. Was forced to endure my mother's psychosis even more and was not allowed to sleep for two days straight because she would wake me every 30 minutes on the dot. At age 15 I had begun to engage with older men online for sexual gratification and was at 17 groomed and sexually abuse by an older man. Due to my feminine appearance and desire to shave being called the T-slur by my mother and was insulted for my sexuality and tried to be convinced that I was straight.

\*Ages 18-19 (Now): I still live with my mother, she still shouts at me and nowadays I am more or less her caregiver, she has refused to allow to get my drivers license, refused to allow me to be independent, and generally keeps me in the house the most of the time and still hurts my feelings. I am currently in therapy for my trauma."
My future mother in law triggered my ptsx and Im afraid it will happen again.,4,ml1zyf,1,"I've always thought that my boyfriend mother has been very similar to the behavior of my abusive father. But, I always brushed it off because I figured she would never behave to the full extent in front of me. I've heard stories from my boy friend about how she has controlled him through the years and suffocated him with her control to the point of severe depression. She took him to therapy and spoke for him the whole time. She had the therapist make him a schedule that she approved and forced him to follow. He was only allowed to do school and therapist/mother approved activities. 

She in more recent years yells at him to do chores the minute she says it even if he's in the bathroom it doesn't matter. 

I've never liked her but always respected her to keep peace. I always assumed if I kept up that behavior it would be fine, but today I realized I was wrong.

My Bf and I came home from rock climbing and where starving so we where excited and thankful that his mother had made rice. The only problem is it had cilantro in it and I don't like cilantro. However I didn't want to say anything because I wanted to be a good guest. My bf knowing I don't like cilantro started suggesting alternative meals. Once his mother heard this she started yelling about how ""We should be grateful for her for providing for us"" and just eat the rice.  Once the shouting started I was immediately teleported back to being a child where my abusive father was yelling at me the exact same phrase as he tried to force feed me food, after I told him I was full, he'dthen raise his hand and hit me.  I felt like I would collapse, so I ran to my bfs room and laid in bed frozen. Once I was sure I could suppress my panic attack I went back to the kitchen and told my bf I was leaving. My bf walked me to my car and the minute I left his house I broke down. I almost collapsed to the floor and was in tears. He comforted me until I felt safe to drive and I explained every thing to him.

I just feel so ashamed for letting this happen to me. I felt helpless and scared after teaching myself how to be brave for so long. I'm terrified this will happen again but rn his parents house is the only place we can really spend time together. My house is overcrowded and I share  a room. His house is much bigger and easier to be alone in. I just feel lost and scared that this will be a regular occurrence."
"I would like to share my story, and hope it helps.",3,ml13yj,3,"Vet with a bit of success.

Hello everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve taken time to respond to other post, offer my support and suggestions.  

I feel like this is the moment to share my story.

I’m a 36 year old veteran of operation Iraqi freedom. Ever sense I left theater I was never the same. After a tour in Korea I took alcohol to a whole new level, and after I departed serving. I just got worse. 
Now there were some ups. I created a business, I had two beautiful daughters, and met my soul mate. 
All of that being said I still couldn’t be happy. 

In the past year and half to two years, I have completely hit the bottom. Had to pivot business just so it could survive. Had a long up hill battle and was drinking myself to sleep. Oh and that soul mate? I became emotionally abusive, she took care of me, loved me unconditionally. Picked me up off the floor every time I was that drunk, and stood by my through every single suicide attempt, and I destroyed her, and I destroyed her life. 

In this warpath I discovered a brewery of other veterans. This guys had found treatment. Unfortunately it’s treatment that the VA doesn’t cover. So after another complete slip I dove into my pocket and paid for treatment.

I was not happy about doing some “hippy shit” these guys and this Dr put me on clinical ketamine treatment, meditation, and journaling what I’m grateful for. The first treatment was a horrible experience with amazing results, and it didn’t take. Sober for a few days and back to being a miserable asshole. 
Reason why? If I told you something would you listen? And that’s exactly why. I had more important things then to follow up with the personal after care. 

So it goes 4 treatments later. I finally get it. I’ve been sober, I’m journaling, and I found the cause of my diagnosis. Fear, when we crossed that berm we were all scared to death. It’s only natural. But there were more deep seeded issues outside of Iraq that I discovered in treatment. 

It goes without saying, you’re a special kind of fucked up to sign up in a time of war, or a special kind of stupid? Either way, Iraq and alcohol were just the icing and sprinkles on that cake that was my life. My childhood of abuse and abandonment was the cake itself. 

So what do you do? How do you “fix” it? 

You forgive and you forget and you love. In my case I had to start with my mother on Easter Sunday, I wrote her a polite beautiful letter, no passive aggression, no questions as to why. I thanked her, I wouldn’t be where I am today had this not happened to me. I told her I loved her, wished her no I’ll will, and hoped she had peace. 

We can’t change the past, we can not change others, sometimes we can’t changes the situation that may or may not be from the cause of our own actions. How ever we can change ourselves, and I’ll say that’s been my uphill battle all along. 

I never forgave myself, I never loved myself. 

So what do you do next. Well I wrote 18 year old me a letter and said the same. 

Keep in mind when you dig down deep in that heart of yours and truly forgive someone, this means you forgive them. You’re done bringing up the story and situation. You find love in your heart and you drive forward. 

I feel as if a 10 ton ruck sack has been lifted from my back. After doing this. I’ve let go of all control, people around you might hurt you, that was never their intentions. So let people in your life, and love them.

Most of all love yourself

This isn’t the last chapter of my journey. Here shortly I’ll be given clinical psilocybin, MDMA, and DMT in one weekend. 

If you’ve read this far please feel free to ask me anything. I hope if you’re hurting you know you’re not alone, and I’m sure my actions might even work without drugs."
I'm not sure I can handle this anymore,1,ml0gh7,3,I think I am arriving to the point of finding acceptance in suicide. Like this is all just to much and I'm not sure if it'll get better. If I will get better. My emotions and depression are just way to much. But I think I am ready to let go. Which scares me although I think it will be okay.
Anyone else feel triggered by Easter?,20,mkz76x,7,It always seems to bring up a lot of my charged feelings. Even more so now that I no longer consider myself ~Christian~. Anyone else?
"I think on some level I expected my PTSD to just...... go away, once I was in a relatively safe and stable situation",15,mkyjtk,6,"Like, I've been biding my time all these years, believing deep down that a magical ""someday"" would come...... fantasizing about ""someday"" when I had freedom, when I was safe, when I was stable and surrounded by loved ones and had prospects and goals and a Life. And that when that someday came I would finally be free of my PTSD, too, it would simply end. Because what was there to be afraid of any longer?

That someday is here. And my trauma hangs over me like a spectre, just as much as ever. Hahaha...... it feels like, now what? I fought and worked and clawed my way to this place, and now I can finally Live, the future is finally in front of me....... and I'm absolutely haunted. So now what?

In the past, the thought of carrying this horror and pain Forever, the knowledge thatPTSD was something that stayed with you forever, gave me so much despair that I wanted to die. But somewhere along the way, I found a little hope, in that fantasy that someday once I was free to move towards the future and build a life, that I would also be healed of that pain and trauma. What now? I'm really going to be like this for the rest of my life.....? ....."
Hi all,2,mky3r0,0,Hey everyone. I just joined because my husband of 10 years has PTSD. Things have been a roller coaster for the last 3 years since he got near deathly ill. I'm trying to piece together our lives and need some support and possibly another viewpoint.
Is this what’s it’s like,1,mkwvpw,2,"Had a seizure while driving and totaled my car, don’t remember much but the last couple nights of rest I’ve had intense memories of me during the accident. Am I having ptsd?"
Psychiatrist told my husband to “try some breathing exercises and go for a walk” instead of prescribing,1,mkw6w8,5,"Long story short, my husband’s psychiatrist wouldn’t prescribe him a medication he’s been on in the past (in another state) and told him to “talk to his therapist, do some breathing exercises, and go for a walk”. There was an event this weekend that triggered an episode for him and he’s been a wreck since. That’s was their response to it. If that shit worked, psychiatrists wouldn’t have a job anymore. What the hell do we even do at this point. 

Anyone else being failed by the system?"
My first PTSD attack. What should I do? Please don’t read if you think you might get triggered.,17,mkuwl5,2,"I’ve only really done a little bit of research but I need some advice on where to go or what to do. Or even just to know if someone else has gone through something similar and has some pointers. 

My attack last week
I was stilling with my wife scrolling through Netflix and she wanted to watch an animated short story. We read the synopsis and can tell it will be a sad film. I was slightly joking and said I’ll go grab the tissues cause my wife easy cry’s over things. I on the other hand haven’t really cried in just about 10 years at the most I’ve gotten a little watery in the eye but have not shed a tear in 10 years. It’s kinda strange but I just felt like what I’ve gone through in the past wasn’t nearly as bad as what I’m experiencing now and so I never really got sad enough to cry. So sometimes my wife would try and watch sad movies to see if I would shed a tear. Well about half way through I let myself get wrapped up in the feelings too much and couldn’t stop thinking about what happed 10years ago it just flooded my mind and I couldn’t stop crying my body broke out sweating like crazy. All of the pain I thought I wouldn’t have ever have to feel again just came back like I was there again 10 years ago. 

What happed 10 years ago and what happened 20ish years ago. 
So 10 years ago coming up on the exact date my stepdad killed himself in our back yard with a shotgun. The rest of the family wasn’t home at the time and when we got back we were wondering where he was. I thought he had gone for a walk to clear his mind cause he was dealing with a lot of issues that were happening all at once. I walked out back and saw a blanket behind our woodshed. I just saw the edge of it but I assumed maybe he was working on something back there and I just let him be cause if he was back there he probably wanted to be alone. I went back in the house told my mom that he was out back and probably just wanting to be alone. An hour went by and I just had the worst feeling of dread that something was wrong but I kept brushing it off. My dread was confirmed when my mom ended up walking out back and finding him there. I remember her screaming and everyone rushing outside. She covered him up with the blanked he had laid out she didn’t want us to see and I’m glad I didn’t. 

20 years ago
This pails in comparison to the pain I felt when my stepdad died. But when I was about 6 or 7 my parents got divorced. It was for the better because most of my  memories from when they were together were just of them fighting and yelling. My dad abused my mom from time to time and to this day I have never seen him sober. He kind of a functioning alcoholic so you really can’t tell when he’s drunk. The only way of knowing is counting the number of beer bottles he’s had that day. I used to think that my parents divorce never really effected me but looking back I know it did. I grew up without a role model I was alway angry and people often didn’t listen or pay attention to me. So when my stepdad came along it really changed things. He was a better father to me than my real father and I really looked up to him. That’s why it hurt so badly to lose him and i lost the one person I looked up to. Years later I found myself secretly striving for the approval of others and I think it became I didn’t have anyone to look up to and I wanted someone to be proud of me. 

My life today 
I didn’t think anything in my past had too much of a negative affect on who I am today. But I’ve recently been having some small amounts of anxiety and have also developed a hiatal hernia. Doctor told me it was rare for someone my age to get one. Most people get them from obesity or having extreme anxiety. I don’t feel like I have extreme anxiety but I did have one panic attack last year. And now I had this PTSD attack I really don’t know if all of this is related or not thought. 

TLDR 
This started out as me just wanting to get some advice on what to do but I ended up telling my story and kind of venting. I’m truly sorry if this trigger anyone I kinda was getting a little watery eyed writing this."
Resources for overcoming trust issues?,2,mkuaa2,1,"Hi friends,

I have PTSD from when I was a kid, from long-term stuff that happened with people my own age. I'm in my 30s now and I've realised how hard it is for me to form and maintain friendships due to lack of trust. Whenever someone reaches out to me, I feel like they're bothering me and I get angry and judgemental. I don't have this problem with romantic relationships, strangely (maybe because I never had those when I was having problems).

I've been going to therapy for the better half of a decade and it's helped a lot. I'm just wondering if there are any books or resources anyone knows about this topic that might help me. I lost a few close friendships over the past few years and I'm sure my behaviour towards them was a major contributing factor.

Thanks so much for your advice."
I hope they drown in misery,4,mkt9dm,0,"They tried to prevent me from making it out by locking me in a room to keep me out of school, torturing me and leaving me to die, destroying my homework and burning my books. They believed that without an education, I would have nowhere to go and be their human punching bag forever. My only memories of school are my books burning. 

Now I'm in a fantastic relationship with a wonderful, loving man of 5 years who recently proposed, attending a first rate university. I'm at the top of my class and year away from graduate school. I'm experiencing everything I've ever wanted after living in fear for so long that everything was all out of reach. Despite a hundred thousand obstacles at every single step of the way, I've made a fuck ton of money. More money than they've made over the course of their lifetimes combined. I just booked a nice vacation at a gorgeous seaside villa to celebrate getting vaccinated. Which, of course, they don't believe in. I have the freedom to do whatever I want and go to wherever I want. I have a new family now and they aren't part of it. I adore my friends and would do anything for them, and they would do the same for me.

They're stuck in miserable dead-end minimum wage jobs at 60 yrs old with no savings, no education, no retirement fund, no employable skills, no job history, no friends or family. Both their healths are in the gutter and their bodies are rapidly deteriorating because they don't believe in science or nutrition or medicine. Meanwhile, I'm in the best shape of my life. I play beach volleyball, run half-marathons, do competitive fencing, and lift weights. Their lungs look like swiss cheese, but their denial was so strong they continued going out in public, knowingly endangering other peoples lives even after their COVID diagnosis. Their cars are falling apart and mechanics are bleeding them dry because they don't have the know-how to do routine maintenance themselves. They enjoy their own ignorance so they can use it to blame everyone but themselves.

Fuck yeah, I *am* vindictive. Sometimes I feel like my sole purpose in life is to become so successful that they hate how miserable their own lives are. I hate them and want them to suffer the same fear and humiliation that I did. They're going to die as alone and unloved as they made me feel for two decades. Nothing would make me happier than if they died surrounded by nothing and no one.

Anti-science anti-education people make me fucking sick. End rant."
Newcomer,3,mksjaf,4,"Hi guys I just joined this subreddit because I’m not sure if I have ptsd or some form of c-ptsd but I just know I’m scared and anxious all the time. Honestly after doing research I finally feel like this is my illness. I’ve been previously diagnosed with depression and generalised anxiety disorder, but I think my trauma lead to my depression. Although I haven’t been through much I was bullied severely as a kid and my parents were constantly fighting and violent, now I have frequent nightmares and I’m extremely scared of any form of sexual intimacy. How do I stop living I fear? I have a therapist but I don’t know if I should change one that is a trauma specialist? I’m new to all of this so any advice would help . I just want to know that I can get over this because I’ve been through so much and I’m just tired"

Sleep: Nightmares and Gasping for air,1,mkqk6l,0,"Hello all, After being in crisis and the intervention of my local CMHT, I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. I have since been engaging with my local CMHT and psychiatrist through a trial and error in regards to medication that aided in managing various symptoms I was having. 
One symptoms I was really struggling with was a lack of decent sleep. Sometimes it was a combination of being unable to settle to sleep, other times staying asleep due to nightmares and at times a combination of both. Due to restrictions and concerns in regards to sleeping medication in the UK, I was on a short term course, which I used as and when I felt I needed them, these ended a longtime ago. During my last appointment with a psychiatrist I spoke about anxiety like attacks/symptoms I have recently began experiencing at night when beginning a sleep regime (tight chest, difficulty breathing, sweating, uncomfortably warm) and that I was still having nightmares and often waking, choking, gasping for air and in a panic. I often managed to ground myself and 'ride it out' before trying to go back to sleep.
Recently these have began happening more frequently, however, it is no longer occurring when asleep or have been for a little while, but as I am drifting off to sleep, the in between stage if this makes sense. I have feeling that I am unable to breathe, cannot breath as if my throat is blocked and when I try to wake, I struggle. I feel as if I wake, but I am still somehow dreaming, but now I'm  in my bedroom, in my bed still unable to breathe. I then panic, fantastically trying to sit up, which is when all of a sudden I experience a pulling back to reality and actually wake in a panic, gasping, heart  pounding etc.
I was wondering if anyone else has or does experience this? If so how do you cope, strategies you have in place? Due to UK lockdown I have to see what appointment I can get to speak with someone as it seems to be happening more frequently, since initially calming down so any tips would be appreciated.
Sorry for the long winded post and hope it makes some sense."
RELATIONSHIPS,9,mkotn4,3,I'm fine until I get a partner then I regress and I start to act unhealthy and show more signs that I wasn't ready. I keep thinking I'm healthy then once I date I am awful about it. Help.
Anyone else experience emotional numbness in relationships?,9,mkobj8,3,"Hey ya'll! This question is prompting my first post. I've learned a lot from reading this sub and I'm excited to be a part of this community. 

I F(24) have C-PTSD. I'm a survivor of several different types of abuse as well as several high trauma situations.  I have been in therapy almost constantly since early highschool and I've overcome a lot. I'm decent at symptom management at this point and to be honest I live a relatively joy filled normal life. The final frontier for me in overcoming my trauma is romantic relationships. 

My first relationship in high school was super toxic and ended with him stalking me. Since then I've worked to  overcome my tendency to sabotage relationships before they start and my habit of putting up walls of being very emotionally hardened and uninterested.

However, I've noticed a pattern in my relationships that I'm not quite sure what to do with. I want to know of anyone else has experienced something similar. 

Generally when I meet someone and we start going on dates it's fun and exciting and lighthearted. The first couple weeks are just enjoying learning about someone and having fun together. I'm a very enthusiastic and fun type of person and it's easy for me to drag people along in my excitement. Generally I'll really be into someone at this stage and be excited for the prospect of a relationship. 

Then around a month to two months in the other person will express their affection/ liking / desire for commitment. Then my heart goes stone cold and I lose all emotion. Generally around this stage I'll find myself wondering if I even liked the other person to begin with. I'll pull them apart in my mind and find every single thing about them that isn't perfect. I make a mental running list of reasons we wouldn't work. All the while mentally and emotionally distancing myself from them. Then by month three they've become an enemy and a threat in my mind and I break up with them. This has been the pattern in every relationship. 

The weird part is.... It seems so real? Like It doesn't feel like I'm intentionally sabotaging. I genuinely lose all feeling for people as soon as they express interest in me. I'm about a month and a half into a dating relationship and I've been so enjoying getting to know this guy. But last week he asked to make it official and I've spent the last week feeling totally dead toward him. No positivity, regard, liking left. All I can think about is the few inconsequential things I've noticed aren't awesome about him and playing out an eventual breakup. 

I don't want to ruin a potentially good thing. But I don't know how to move past how emotionally stone cold my heart always becomes at the first sign of commitment. I'd love to learn from other people's experiences! I hope this was all clear and relevant."
Yes or No on visiting trigger location?,7,mkn7oe,10,"Some years ago I suffered a near-death experience in a local hospital, namely being fed solid food after being injected with morphene. I promptly choked, blacked out, had to be revived. That was probably a trigger event in my diagnosed PTSD.

Now my wife needs to go to the same hospital for a heart procedure. Friday I took her there for a pre-op test, and as we walked down a hallway all the old memories/fears came flooding back.

Now she goes in for the procedure Wed. I feel I should really take her and be there for her support, but just don't think it's wise. Should I feel like a heel in arranging someone else to take her, or is my own protection more important?"
How do I get over the PTSD of this?,5,mkkvea,5,"I’m 25. I’ve been having nightmares here and there of the guy who had stalked me, harassed me at work(he was a customer), and threatened my family and I. I was on high alert for 2 years, staying hyper aware of my surroundings when I left work to go home, and when I would go to any store. He was a complete stranger who became obsessed with me and told me repeatedly I’ll leave my boyfriend for him. That event took place 2018-2020, it stopped when he was finally arrested and jailed, and I have a 2 year injunction put on him now. I quit that job because it was triggering working there where employers made me feel stupid for calling police on the stalker guy. But it’s not a worry for me anymore and I don’t think about it daily. I have no triggers that triggers these nightmares I randomly have here and there. I had a great weekend so I don’t know why I had another nightmare last night.

The nightmares usually consist of him breaking in my house & trying to grab me, or he’s outside trying to get in the house. He never looks away from me and stares intensely just enjoying my fear, even though I usually push him out or my boyfriend beats him up in my dream. In real life, he never broke in my house or tried to grab me, it’s an irrational fear that manifests in my nightmares.

Besides the nightmares, the only other ptsd symptom I can think of is startle responses. If someone is at the door or I hear the door handle jiggle, I get really scared and my heart starts beating fast. I usually don’t answer the door if I’m not expecting any company. I always make sure doors are locked.

Is it possible to get over this ptsd? My family thinks I’m overreacting so I’m thankful for finding this sub."

I know alcohol is bad and was killing me; but.........,39,mkj80t,24,"I have  been sober for 3 years, 3 months and 25 days. I started drinking daily in 2003 when I was 37 years old. I drank 4 - 8 beers a day (and would drink more on weekends my husband and I would go out to the bars.) When my liver started acting up and more importantly, when my behavior started to get really bad (I have pretty bad CPTSD/PTSD/anxiety, bipolar and seizures) and I was arrested (I was charged with resisting arrest - no other charge), I got help for my ""alcoholism"" and have been sober ever since.

I went to rehab and then to an IOP program for trauma at a behavioral health hospital for about 6 weeks. I have been seeing a therapist, psychiatrist and regularly go to see all the specialists I am supposed to.

Lately, I have been getting REALLY frustrated because the medications I am given for the seizures/bipolar have horrible side effects (like constant, crippling stomach pains, hair loss, weight gain, insomnia, etc) that can greatly affect my health. The new Ambilify I was given, can CAUSE diabetes.....and I already have high blood sugars WITHOUT the drug. The Depakoate can cause LIVER disease....well, I already have that in the form of a fatty liver (my ammonia levels were so high around the time I was arrested that I was acting psychotic). I have terrible GERD symptoms and have IBS (""slow transit C"") and these medications make the pain worse. With topiramate, I lost 40% of my hair! I had to stop the Ambilify because of the CRIPPLING nausea and stomach pain....and why the heck would a prescriber give me a drug that CAUSES restless legs when I already have that (and am restless in general)?

I started to think: why is everybody telling me that staying off alcohol is so much more healthy and ""better"" for me when the medications I have to take to medicate my ""conditions"" actually make me more ill than the alcohol did?  I self medicated with the alcohol and while I know my behavior was not great and I was slowly killing myself (and all of my interpersonal relationships) - I am STILL doing this, only not through alcohol anymore, but through the side effects of the medications (and my mental illness that doesn't seem to get much better with medications - only the seizures stop with medication).

Now, I do not long for the days of sloppy, not even for the ""good days"" of drinking.....but yet, alcohol seems to me still - to be the best medication I have ever used to stop the ""symptoms"". I even was more social (yeah, I know about lower inhibitions, impulse control). My alcoholic mother and I talked about it. SHe is 72 and I am 54 years old....so we are not so young and have had a few years to learn certain things.

I don't know what I am really trying to say here, but it has been bothering me; all of these side effects and how some of these strong anti-psychotic (and convulsant) medications can actually CAUSE medical problems like liver failure......just like alcohol......and yet I am told taking the medications is GOOD and drinking alcohol is BAD - yet I scream at my husband while on the oxcarbezine more than when I did when I had that once in a while black out rage......

and anyway, isn't Depakote supposed to HELP constant hiccupping and not CAUSE it? ;)

Thanks for letting me vent, I guess."
PTSD(?) from too rapid SSRI withdrawal,3,mkj2p5,2,"Am I only one in the world who has got a PTSD from too rapid SSRI withdrawal and subsequent psychiatric treatment? I withdrew from Paxil (generic) 40 mg in two months, after 20 years of use, as instructed by my GP. I was (and still am) experiencing 
protracted withdrawal and was having panic thoughts, anxiety and  irritability. I started acting impulsively and almost lost my self-control, which ended me hospitalized. I also had some kind of serious allergic reaction from surface disinfectant but nobody believes me. Everything that happened was diagnosed as a relapse.
And of course, Paxil (generic) was rapidly reinstated in addition to antipsychotic. I've been having many functional symptoms to this day of which many have already been improved.

My blood panels, ECG and head MRI came all back normal.
My biggest issue currently are total loss of emotions, anhedonia, apathy, anxiety attacks and brain fog. Propranolol is of great help for my anxiety. I'm currently having a job but don't have any interest nor excitement towards it anymore.

I'm not sure if I have a PTSD or perhaps some kind of a brain injury.
All GPs have classified me as ""depressed"". Does anyone have any ideas how could I possibly improve my situation? Thank you for all answers."
Trying to explain myself. The split,8,mkiejp,2,"I need to explain myself somewhere , mabey here someone will understand. Hamid.
I met a doctor today to undergo a simple but painful procedure.I have done it before in the past  I know why I am afraid. The necessity of it helped my overcome the fear. Before my appointment I saw the doctor  I  was appointed to be kind  to an elderly patient. I appreciated it and when we met shared this. 
In short I explained I have post trauma, non-related to the  small procedure (as if something is really non related). I asked to be in control, he understood and respond attentively. 
He was professional but not cold hearted like I am used too from doctors and caretakers. 
He then asked my age, when I said 47, he looked up brightly and complimented, really you look alot younger. 
Thats when I broke down and burst into tears infront of this man. Apologizing multiple times of course. I was disappointed I couldn't hold myself together.

The split
....
So half an hr later this is what I analyzed.
I have developmental trauma through neglect during infancy. 
As a baby I call out for help and it didn't come. 
The Doctor's regoconition and adressing  my request for help, obviously overwhelmed me, I somehow could not believe the reality of the present because of my traumatic disbelief.
For me, When he mentioned my age, he saw the man in front of him, yet I was alsothere as a year old lnfant.
To me this makes sense. 
Does it to you?

Heart racing after eating,24,mki6py,28,"This has been happening on and off since last fall now. But most times after eating, my heart rate shoots up to 120 and I have to take deep breathes in front of a fan and drink water to slow it down. It usually 30 minutes to an hour.

Panic after sexting,6,mkdvxm,4,"I'm just so frustrated it feels like I'm losing my mind over things that are supposed to be fun.

I suffered a bit if trauma in highschool in a very bad relationship, and it's left dating and sexual activities scarred and I just can't seem to move past it. It's been over 6 years since I got out of the abusive relationship and I just a year or so ago started dating this really really wonderful man.

Ive been in therapy almost 5 years trying to work through my trauma but it still just hits me out of nowhere. Sometimes the triggers don't even make sense . I was having a fun conversation with my love (video call cause ling distance etc) and he asked me to flash him, I was hesitant but thought why not. And immediately I felt strange, which turned into what I think was a disociative episode. It's like my brain just stops working and I'm swallowed by paralyzing fear.

It feels like I ruin everything with my panic. This sort of thing happens so often when trying anything new. Things that should be fun just aren't. I don't know what to do. I just want to live a normal life. Has anyone else felt anything similar? I feel like I'm going crazy..."

Preventing PTSD before it happens?,1,mk9nvh,3,"Last night, I experienced a traumatic experience. I have come to realize that the details aren't particularly important - I think it suffices to say that my central nervous system was kicked into a very agitated state with every possible ""fight or flight"" response activated. Actual physical harm was possible in the situation and I had real reasons to fear for my safety, though I am not 100% blameless or even close, I could have been assaulted viciously. I had intrusive thoughts about what happened last night, could not unwind easily and generally felt miserable, in a state of hypervigilance.

This morning, I woke up feeling much better but I found myself feeling extremely angry and irritable later on. I found it hard to concentrate on things I needed to do, had intrusive thoughts, was jumpy, felt anxiety etc. I've dealt with panic disorder in the past (thankfully muted to the point of being a low-lying thing now - haven't had a panic attack in a year or so!) - this is very, very different. I feel like I am exhausted while also being on extreme overdrive.

Since it has only been one day, I know that I am not experiencing PTSD - these problems would have to persist for a while for that to be the case. However, I want to do whatever I can to sort out what I am feeling now so it doesn't happen - does anyone have any tips or advice or tricks or insights? I'd appreciate anything you have to offer.

Does anyone have tips for controlling nightmares?,2,mk9e7j,1,"Hey y’all!
I’m at the point where I have nightmares at least once or twice a week. It usually begins with me reliving my trauma (r**e) and then the majority of the dream is me feeling super depressed because I feel like I can’t talk to anyone. When I wake up I’m still depressed and feel gross from the dream. 
I’m kind of unsure what to do because I don’t want to go to sleep because I don’t want to experience the feeling of reliving my trauma. I basically stay up watching Netflix until I can’t hold my eyes open anymore. 
Any advice or tips would be welcome. 
Thanks!"
Is anyone here diagnosed with PTSD but doesn't have all the symptoms?,9,mk97e3,10,"Trigger warning ⛔


This will be long so if you can please answer to my question I'll be thankful. I really need some answers. 

I was subjected to female genital mutilation (my clitoris was partly removed) when i was 10 years old (I'm 26 now), in my country most girls go through this horrible experience.
I don't want to be diagnosed with PTSD because i don't want this to be the reason of my suffering with depression. 
i remember the day in details.
I don't usually think about it but when i do, i feel the hate burning in my chest, what in hell could possibly drive educated parents to commit such an awful thing on their child?  And why did they chose to wait until I was 10?  Why didn't they just cut off my flesh when I was an infant and got over with it? 
my body, my privacy and my dignity all have been violated.. And the worst is that i have to remember, for the rest of my life, every detail of that fucking day and the days followed. It was like ""chopping off part of my genital"" wasn't enough no, they forced me to let go of all my needs of privacy untill the wound finally healed. I was left with nothing but feelings of humiliation and embarrassment. 
Whenever i think of that exact moment.. The cutting, the bleeding, the stitching.. I feel discomfort through my private parts, my muscles contract and my whole body shrinks.

My parents are educated they have no excuse, whither they purposely intended to limit my sexual desires and thus ensuring that their dearest reputation will not get tarnished, or they just didn't question the norms.. it makes no difference.. what matters is that they wanted to be socially accepted. they chose to submit to customs. They chose themselves over my health, over ME. and i hate them for it. 

The thing is, i don't believe this interferes with my day to day life, (I've had too few sexual experiences to know if it's affected), i don't think about the event much, i don't have nightmares.. and i don't have problems with remembering important aspects of that day. 
The only reflection it has on my life is that I've some sort of hate towards my parents. 
I've been struggling with depression for i don't know how long, recently diagnosed with bipolar II. But i believe this has nothing to do with what i experienced. 
My therapist asked me whither i went through any traumatic event,  i cried while telling her the story, i haven't talked about it to anyone before. We're to have further talk about it next session. 

Is any of this sounds familiar? Could someone go through a trauma and not develop PTSD? 
I don't experience panic attacks, nor uncontrollable flashbacks. Is the absence of these two symptoms means i don't have PTSD?"
Random paranoid episode,5,mk82je,3,"Has anyone been triggered by no apparent reason?

I have been battling with PTSD ever since I was around 13 years old. I'm now 19. My worst year was probably 2019, but since then my symptoms have decreased. I know I could be even better if I went to therapy (The last time I went to see a professional I was 16) but I have been able to manage this thing fairly well. Then suddenly, a month ago, I had a paranoia episode. I was supposed to go out with my friends, but all I could think of was that I was going to die at any second. I was shaking, barely walking, looking for potential threats that didn't exist. Walking the street I saw a police officer and even though we were not doing anything wrong, I was sure the police officer was going to kill me. I can't even express how sure I was that this was going to happen. Hours later, as we were having diner, I wrote a long, goodbye text message to my mom and my dad but luckily didn't send it. I couldn't enjoy the night. I felt miserable. Once I got to my home, alive, I couldn't believe it. A voice inside my head even tried to convince I was actually dead and just wandering around. I know how ridiculous this sounds, but there's no way to express how I felt. Almost like a soldier walking through a mined field, so certain of my imminent death. 

The thing is, nothing triggered me. At least, nothing I can remember. I was totally fine until I wasn't. When episodes like this happened to me in the past, there was always a trigger, a perturbing image or another crappy experience. But that day, there was nothing. And the next morning, I was totally fine. Before, my crazy, I-am-going-to-die episodes lasted weeks.

I'm worried about what this may represent. Although my night was ruined, I'm more worried this could happen when crossing the street (In the past, my paranoia almost caused me to run into moving traffic) or when having an important meeting. Perhaps even during an exam. I don't know if I should contact a therapist again, as I'm actually better than before. I don't know if I should seek help because a single, isolated episode. Anyone has had experiences like this? What do you advise?"
AOE get trauma nightmares once a month without any triggers?????,14,mk7lcd,6,"I get nightmares about my trauma once a month, like when I wake up I KNOW it was about what happened. I get nightmares where I feel helpless, scared, frozen more frequently but idk if it's related to my trauma. But the nightmares where I KNOW it was about my trauma or seeing my abuser I get once a month without any triggers.

If I get badly triggered, I usually have nightmares for a few days back to back and then it goes back to being once a month. It this normal??? Could it just be anxiety and not PTSD??? Cause I've read that people with PTSD have a few nightmares every week. I don't know if it counts for me because it's only once a month without any triggers."
I feel like I was toxic to my ex with PTSD...,3,mk7dqw,13,"I just got out of a 6 week relationship, not long I know, but regardless I fell hard for this girl. We had been talking for a few months before getting together. She had C-PTSD, and I accidentally triggered her multiple times. It was never my intention. The last time was the last straw, and she blocked me completely. 

Whenever she would let me know of a trigger, I wrote it down and did my absolute best not to do it again. She had told me that feeling like she was in trouble was one of them.

The incident that led to her blocking me was because I asked her a question, but I phrased it wrong and she felt like I was accusing her. I can give more details if needed. 

I don't really know what exact advice I'm looking for here. I just want to know if I was in the wrong, and if I was being toxic, and I figure the best people to ask are those who have PTSD themselves. The guilt is killing me and I don't know how to move on."
Flashbacks of beautiful memories,2,mk5qor,0,"Hey people.
First of all, I was never diagnosed with PTSD mostly because I thought my flashbacks were due to my anxiety and they're normal. Now I understand it might have been the other way around.
Anyways, I've come a long way in the past 8 years or so and now I am at a really good place mentally. House, dream job, family, time, money. Everything is there and I worked so hard for it all.
However it seems like the flashbacks have persisted, instead they are mostly beautiful memories, like the first day in daycare (ok that one was a tiny bit bad as well), tons of memories of me playing with my friends including the songs we used to sing etc.
I am used to terrible flashbacks and I've developed a mechanism to get out of them relatively effectively but in this case I obviously don't have to.
Anyone had any similar experiences? Does it mean I'm finally losing my marbles completely? Am I getting better? None of the above?
I'm confused. Thnx."
Could have my severe mental breakdown triggered PTSD?,2,mk5apj,1,About a week ago I suffered a severe mental breakdown after i had been released from the mental hospital. It was so severe I ended crying screaming and literally thought I was going to end my life right there. My parents weren’t very helpful either as my mom and stepdad were part of the cause of this mental breakdown. I’ve been having flashbacks from that day and My anxiety and paranoia have been through the roof lately. I’ve become extremely distant from my parents and have developed a sense of numbness and dissociation. That event has been haunting me ever since and anytime i remember it i go into complete panic mode
Has anyone overcome traumatic fear?,3,mk32pv,7,"Hello, I will keep my story very short. Basically in the past 3 or 4 years I have had 2 nervous breakdowns. Before I had them, I wasnt taking care of myself and was extremely lonely. I am aware that is my trigger. However, the straw on the camels back was migraines I had where I couldnt see - normal that I get those every few months but for some reason, when they happen when I'm already anxious, they absolutely send me over the edge, I start shaking, feeling cold, crying, thinking I'm about to die. I now have what I beleive are flashbacks, overthinking, hypervigilance, over focus on what has happened with me. I am recovering but have days like this where I feel so worried. Has anyone overcome their issue around PTSD, and have any recommended therapists or approaches or modalities? 

Please any advice someone, thank you."
My wife was diagnosed with PTSD and she's having difficulty coping,3,mk1lkf,4,"My wife was diagnosed with PTSD after she watched her mother attempt suicide as well as some other childhood issues and she's been having a really hard time with accepting the diagnosis. But now it seems like everything that ever happened to her was a trauma. Such as that she never got to go to Disneyland even after her dad promised her they would go or that her friends never asked her to go to the skating rink. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I'm trying to be supportive, but I'm not sure if I should point out that those are normal life events and yes they're sad, but not major issues.

Thinking about how I didn't recognize the effect trauma has had on my life,1,mk1lbx,0,"Please let me know if this doesn't belong in this sub! This is my brain dump and questions I ask myself, mostly a vent post, maybe someone can relate to this train of thought?

Something happened when I was 12 that was fairly traumatizing and caused me distress for years after. I didn’t start acknowledging it as traumatic until I started seeing my current therapist. I recently looked at the DSM-V symptom list for PTSD and found that based on what I remember from ages 12-14 ish, I fit all of the symptoms and then some.

I continued to have all of the symptoms for a few years (2-3 after it happened), but they’ve slowly gone away. It's been much better since the parent that acted as a trigger for me has moved out and we've stopped talking.

10 years later and I still have the symptoms that overlap with GAD and MDD (which I’ve been diagnosed with). My therapist has been urging me to see it as a result of what I went through, which has been difficult. For the first time in my life, I’m seeing the avoidance I have always struggled with as part of the coping mechanisms I developed then, when my only tool was to avoid so as to not acknowledge my own powerlessness. I’m still too afraid to move, I have an overblown avoidance response to everything new, I can’t cope with the constant feelings of failure and stress… I look at myself then I look at my friends who have been through just as much and more and wonder why I am  so paralyzed.

I used to think of myself as self aware but it feels like my brain is hiding things from me. I can't remember a lot of what my early teenage years were like. I don't even remember who I was - me at 12 feels like a stranger.

I never got formally diagnosed of course so I don't know if I really had PTSD then, but I'm just thinking about how deep the scars of trauma run. It's black and white thinking but I weirdly thought I had healed and I sometimes wonder how it’s possible that this thing that happened might be continuing to derail my life, even though I never think about it, and would've never noticed it without someone else pointing it out. Or rather, I would never have realized there was an option to not be this way."
Don't have motivation to do vital routines,1,mk0t2m,2,"Dissociation has been killing me. I feel indifferent and forgotten. Brushing teeth or showering for me equals to climbing a mountain. How can I get better? Medications, stimulants, drugs? I never did any, but I need help badly.

My mum called police because I was suicidal,113,mjyk2u,90,"And now I just want to die even more. She could have just sat down with me and talked but instead she got angry and threatened to call emergency if I didn’t stop being emotional. 

It’s 1:30am and I’ve taken valium because I can’t sleep but still all I can think of is the image of this massive hulk of a policeman standing in my bedroom doorway decked out like he’s ready to beat me up.

What happened to me.,2,mjw8cs,0,"Back in November, a stupid small word triggered my current downward spiral. I caught myself early, got myself to a doctor, and got myself on the waiting list for therapy.  Something I never did in the past. I would allow myself to just fall deeper and deeper. I had managed to cope for so long, but that stupid thing in November toppled me. I was at an appointment at my daughters' school with a support staff member, and he was helping me with what sort of things to include in the personal statement. 

He made a small comment saying that he knows I have past trauma and maybe I could include that. Honestly innocent enough, but it was the spark. I had never ever told anyone, so how could he know? Who told him, how did he find out? My head was racing my heart was thumping, and I couldn't stop the panic and fear rising in me.

If I exclude the beatings my sister gave me on a daily basis, it is nearly 15 years since it happened. Looking back, I cannot believe how stupid and naive I was. I was going away for a few days. I had a large bag with several changes of clothes. I was wearing a brown knee-length skirt and a pale cream/light brown blouse. I was 17. I was struggling with my bag, and took a break, and sat down outside shops in the middle of town. Two guys came by and made a comment. I didn't think they were talking to me. I got up to leave and they offered to help, they took my bag and started walking. I followed and was talking. went through an unused bus station. one of them hit me so hard I fell. I didn't even fight back. Which made them angry. So they tried to strangle me with my bag.

I left home a few months later. My mum didn't notice I was struggling. My sister was beating me, my mum didn't care. I eventually got in a relationship with someone. Moved in with him. He was so nice at first, so kind and caring. but it changed. He would start with name-calling that he'd excuse away with him just being silly, and I was overreacting. Then controlling who I could see, who I could talk to. Then he got physical. Always saying he loved me and was sorry later, and that he didn't mean to. He was drunk or stressed or angry.

During that relationship I was having nightmares nearly daily, I eventually learned to hold them in, to not react from them when waking because if I woke him he would hurt me for it, or force me to have sex with him. 3 years I was with him before I attempted suicide. I ended up moving back to my parents' home. I kept having nightmares. but they slowly reduced. I would keep seeing things in my head. Seeing them, feeling them, hearing them. 

Years later, I had my daughter through a difficult birth.  2 years after that her father and I split. I ended up suicidal again, but not in a physical way. I couldn't deal with the memories, I just wanted to erase them. I was in that way for a few years. By the time my daughter was 4, CMHT and CRHT (Crisis response home treatment team)were involved. A psychologist said during a visit that he believed I was showing symptoms of PTSD. He told me that I had to tell him what happened in order for him to diagnose me. He was rude, showed no compassion, no kindness. he was a harsh rude man, and I did not feel comfortable talking to him. He did not believe me when I said my daughter was my staying power and said I had to promise him I would call the crisis line, or he would hospitalise me and get my daughter taken from me. 

After about a month and a half of a shit cmht. I was forgotten and slipped through their cracks. I worked on myself and slowly got better. I did so well (had a dip in 2017 with depression and anxiety) but I did pull myself out... Until he said trauma. I am spiraling down all because I was scared of how he could know. I never told anyone. I had written to a friend once who said I was lying, I was too ugly how could anyone even want to go near me. But I had never said it out loud. 

15 years on and they were still controlling me with fear, still suffocating me. All because I never told anyone. I finally told someone. I finally said it out loud. There was no relief from it. It didn't ease the pain. But I am hoping that in the future it won't cause such a crash because now I've said it, it's out there, it cannot be taken back, it cannot be erased. But it can be worked through."
Has anyone here been through an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)?,5,mjvaj6,6,"I hope this doesn't count as soliciting medical advice. I'm aware it might straddle the edge on that.

My therapist recommended I might want to look into an IOP for a few reasons (psychiatrist availability and therapy more than once a week). I have an intake appointment on Monday, and it was mentioned by the admissions staff that the intake appointment will likely be 2 hours! 

Does anyone have experience with these intake appointments? What are they looking for, exactly? 2 hours seems like a really long time. From what I understand it's like an interview so they can decide on a plan of care for you? I've done inpatient before a decade ago but never anything outpatient."
Feels strange when i wakeup,13,mjtga7,5,"every morning i wakeup and feel like ""oh, im me"" and it feels new and odd and unpleasant. i dont know why this is an emotion i experience because who else would i wake up as? but i just feel so disconnected to my self and overwhelmed and i dont know..like ""ah, i exist and there is this large large mountain of things i, the person who is me, has to deal with and absolutely has no choice but to deal with"" and it feels unpleasant and surreal every single time. all i want is to have my own house or apartment or something n enough money that i can be free to hide in my own house n heal n take my time. just feel like the best metaphor is im drivin a janky car with 2 wheels missing and half a steering wheel and no turn signals but somehow im supposed to use this car to drive a thousand miles which just seems like such preposterous bullshit and completely unlikely that one would ever accomplish such a feat. im fucking tired and i jus wanna rest for a long time cuz how am i supposed to fix all this shit if im so exhausted but how am i supposed to have the freedom to rest the way i need to if i dont fix all this shit first and get my own house n financial freedom first?

"I need support/advice, I have a serious conflict with my neighbors and my ptsd has become wrapped up in it.",3,mjs9qo,8,"For the 6 + months since they have been trying to pick a fight with me. Calling me names, insulting me, slamming doors, refusing to lock the door (intentionally leaving it open bc I asked them to lock it) kick and stomping at my exterior apt walls. I tried to leave them a note, and they torn it into pieces. 

I've been trying to ignore it, but a few months ago I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't sleeping, I was triggered 100% of the time by them yelling, stomping, calling me names every other day.
They've continuously escalated their hatred toward me, calling me crazy, saying ""cuckoo, cuckoo!""

I'm not 100% innocent.  I've snapped at them and threatened them, cursed them out and slapped my door back at them. I try not to, but they get me so angry and triggered sometimes I get angry back. I struggle to sleep bc of them. I'm scared to run into them in the halls.

I've been too afraid to tell my landlord becasue I'm scared he'll think I'm crazy and side with the neighbors; he's kind of a slum lord, not very understanding. I'm scared to call the cops becasue they are so violent in my city. 

I'm in trauma therapy rn, via telehealth, but my therapist doesn't want to keep doing treatment becasue he says I'm in too triggering an environment  with the weekly antagonism I face and my apt isn't a safe space for therapy.

Things I feel like I have to be willing to give up thanks to my abusers.,2,mjptn5,1,"My upbringing. My heritage. 

My father has a weird fascination with our last name. It’s a fairly common last name in Germany that also happens to be a Pilsner beer sold exclusively in Berlin. It’s honestly kind of subpar, but the man knows absolutely everything about how it’s been produced to the history of the feuding breweries, and has an entire room that is essentially a shrine to our German heritage. Fun fact: when I did my 23 and me, I’m only actually like 10% German. We’re Irish. Like stone cold Irish. 

My father also has a weird fascination with children, which is something that I chose to selectively forget until a couple of months ago. I remember a lot of things that I wish I didn’t about that now, and as a result, I have done absolutely everything in my power to rid myself of anything and everything that is tied to him. Including my last name. The man has a way of slinking into my life, trying to find ways to keep me tied to him. He had access to my bank accounts, my life insurance (which was sketch because he never told anyone he took it out on me); I look a lot like him too, especially now that my hair is short. I can’t change the way I look, but I could work my fucking ass off to finally separate myself financially. And I have. I took myself out of the family AT&T plan; I closed all my old bank accounts (which is a bitch to do by the way), I moved so he doesn’t know where I live. The only thing tying us together now is our heritage, our name. I don’t necessarily want to go through all of the trouble of legally changing my name because it’s a lot of paperwork and just work in general. New credit cards, new license, new everything. And that’s absolutely terrifying. But not nearly as terrifying as what he’s done. So what am I willing to give up? Honestly everything. Coming into treatment, I felt like I was going to the extreme by doing all of this, but the longer I’m here, the angrier I get—and it’s good anger. The kind that fuels you to be proactive rather than just sit and take it. It’s just a name, I get that. But it’s also not, and I get that too. I’ve tried to associate the other amazing people that share my name, because there definitely are some dope ones out there. But there’s something so liberating about breaking the ties that bind. 

“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.” 

My father isn’t the only toxic person who tries to cling to me, and he won’t be the last. But the difference is that I’m no longer afraid to lose things. I want to make space for new things, for better things. So what am I willing to give up? Absolutely everything."
"DAE ""make up"" personalities in your head to deal with abuse",6,mjp5xv,6,"I remember I would conjure up another personality to take some of the verbal abuse I received. When it happened, my world would get blurry, I felt very spacey, and sometimes my body lightly sways. I would imagine up a tougher, more hardened version of myself to receive trauma, and I would imagine they would be there in my body while I watched from the sidelines. I (?) would think ""I have to keep (my name) safe, this is my job, I have to do this."" They would also sometimes offer comfort to me when I was upset. But only sometimes.  
Does anyone else experience this as well?"
Do I actually have PTSD?,1,mjozn9,2,"I live in a suburban town in Wisconsin and recently had to go into Wauwatosa to get a vaccine. On my way there I got cut off and was almost side swiped and almost pushed into the median. Out of habit, I waited in my horn and the aggressive car full of people all turned around to flip me off. They proceeded to move to the other lane to let me pass them but I was uncomfortable since they had intentionally slowed down 20mph and I was afraid of what they might do. I made a quick turn to get away from them and as I was turning, I saw them do a u turn back towards me. They tried to hit the back of my car so I had no other option than to run stop signs and make quick turns to outrun them. At one point, they caught up to me and as they almost hit me, I quickly turned into a small parking lot. When I pulled in, they passed me on my left and threw their drinks at my car. When I quick backed up to get out of their, they stopped their car and two or three of them got out and started yelling at me. Now this might not sound bad to most of you but this was the first time I have ever been chased in a car where I was unaware of their intentions. In my mind, I thought I was going to be shot. Now every time I see a car that looks the same as that one that chased me or see a car start to come up behind me fast, I almost have a panic attack. I haven’t been able to sleep that well since it happened. Would this actually be PTSD?"
Back home where a lot of my trauma happened and struggling- anyone else?,1,mjouqk,0,"TW CSA and abusers

I recently discovered my CSA, and am home for the first time since I realized. It happened right down the street from my parents house, and from the little I remember (thank you dissociation!) it was horrific. I feel like just being in this town gives me a trauma response. 

My uncle also moved back into town. He has always hated me because I am close with my grandmother and until I was born he was “her baby”. He managed to call me a doucebag today in front of my entire family and no one said I word. I’m supposed to just put up with it because my uncle has severe bipolar, but I’m so sick of this. He has done a lot of fucked up things, and yeah calling me a doucebag isn’t really that bad (although I had barely said a word to him at that point so idk how I could have been being a doucebag). 

My mom is a whole other can of worms, she’s also bipolar (which is fine!) but insists that the diagnosis was fake and that she just has depression. Which also is fine, it’s her life, except she isn’t getting any treatment currently so she is all over the map. I forgot how stressful it is to not know what you’re walking in to- she can turn on a dime and often shifts throughout the day. To cope she and my father just drink, which only makes everything worse. 

I’m sorry for coming on here and venting, I just wanted to see if anyone else could commiserate. I do so good with treatment when I am in my apartment, but it feels like 10 steps back when I’m home."
Has anyone been able to reverse their lack of empathy?,3,mjojs7,1,"Part of my bad PTSD habits has been watching gore. I realized a few days into it that it was becoming an addiction, and I stopped. My therapist told me it was a controlled fight or flight response but in a safe environment, and that’s why it’s addicting. Amygdala etc.

Recently I’ve noticed I’m incredibly apathetic and emotionless. I hate it. I feel psychopathic and part of that validation comes from the gore I could watch. I wonder if I could hurt someone, and it scares me when I think I could. I never had those feelings before the gore.

I know this is part of the amygdala being fucked: sometimes working too much, now not working enough. I just want to feel normal again, not trying to push the vague thought experiments if I could inflict violence on others. I have OCD like tendencies that easily consume me—I don’t want this in me.

I’m willing and want to get all the help I need. I know it’s not normal. Has anyone else gone through this?"
Wrf is wrong with me?,2,mjo6e0,0,"One of the major traumas in my life was from a few years ago when three cops beat me in my underwear in my own living room and then tased me when I was on the ground. My heart was beating so fast and erratically the ambulance said I was actually missing beats and were worried but the cops didn’t care. I spent over three weeks in jail for something I didn’t do, feel free to mock me or call me a liar for that too cause a lot of people have already. I’m now stupidly a criminal justice student and with a lot of the courses especially the one I’m on now it triggers memories of everything that’s happened nonstop. I wonder just what the hell is wrong with me, why do I do this to myself. It’s bad enough I can’t go any real time at all without thinking of something that sets me off without being reminded of it."
Just wondering if this is actually valid enough to have exacerbated my ptsd,1,mjnurb,2,"After years of yourself being threatened with someone else committing suicide, and them bringing a gun in the house to make their threats more powerful, would someone attempting to kill themselves in front of you and play dead for thirty ish minutes cause a trauma reaction?  I've spent this whole week in a trauma reaction, and i just want to know if by remembering this am i overeacting to what happened?  I was young and they had previously made me swear not to call their dad or the cops in that situation and I had never been in that situation before, (I'd been threatened thoroughly but I've never seen someone die, fake or not) I jusy thought they were dead and panicked and didn't know what to do.  I was very young and very stupid I thought I couldn't break their loyalty or it would make things worse for them.  

They were obviously fine and had been faking being dead afterwards.  But they let me sit there and bawl and panic over what happened while they pretended to be dead.  Thinking back on it, and knowing what I know now, there was no way they could've been injured especially not fatally or to make them lose consciousness.  I've done the same to myself in attempts after seeing this, it won't even put you to sleep.  So i know they were playing dead.  Would this cause a trauma response in someone?  Even years later? 

I've been having to barricade my doors at night.  This is not the only thing they've done just the latest my brain has started to remember.  I just want to know if I'm overreacting.  I really felt like I watched someone die that night and I'm sorry, I was just frozen.  I was young and I didn't know what to do after making all those promises.  I vaguely remember calling their dad but idk if that actually happened it's been so buried for so long."
"I've gotten this far in life through how well I repress my feelings, and now it's what makes me hate myself the most",3,mjnbxo,1,"I grew up in a dangerous home and no one ever caught on. For as long as I can remember, I've been dissociated from my feelings. It's not that I consciously shove them away - I just don't realize they exist, and as a result I don't feel the need to talk to someone. And then I'm blindsided by breakdowns.

I didn't open up about the abuse until freshman year of high school, when I was in my first relationship and they saw my body bare. Since then I've been trying to heal slowly - I've been patient, bc I know being oblivious to my emotions is what's kept me alive through the years.

I'm 21 now, and with a partner who's very emotionally conscious - they've got a lot of hurt of their own, make art about it, and spend lots of time pondering their emotions. When I have my breakdowns though, I can tell they get frustrated at how little I understand my own feelings. I pointed it out once, and they apologized for the fact that they unfairly expect me to analyze my own feelings as much as they do with their own.

I spend a lot of time thinking, I really do. And yet when I look inwards, I'm often met with a brick wall. It makes me feel all the more stupid and shallow when I inevitably hit my next breakdown. I feel like such a fucking imbecile.

I've felt all the more frustrated with myself since that incident with my partner. I know they didn't mean any offense by it, just the implication that I think less on my feelings makes me feel like I'm a dumbass who doesn't know how to self-reflect. I can't write heart wrenching poetry, I can't make surrealist art, I can't do anything productive and meaningful because I don't know how I feel. I'm fine until I'm suddenly hiding and crying in the closet without remembering how I got there.

Never mind the catharsis of being able to express myself, I just feel like a fucking piece of shit idiot who's been going to therapy for nearly a decade yet can't even catch myself before I break down : )"

Beekeeping as therapy for PTS,3,mjmvoh,1,Has anyone tried beekeeping as a form of therapy?
Psychiatrist 👩🏼‍⚕️ Says My Toxic Abusive Mother is the Cause of All My Trauma (I’m a 24F),6,mjlqwp,1,"So I only recently in the last 2 years was diagnosed with PTSD and all my triggers are caused by my mother (whose house I’m still stuck living in but I’ll get to that later) I cannot be tapped on the shoulder because my mother used to do that before yelling at me or screaming go in my face, I cannot be touched on my upper arms or neck, and if someone touches me on my back I freak out because she used to push me down the stairs in the house (that I still live in) now onto the (TW) now this next part I’m not sure if she ever intentionally or unintentionally did these things but it happened often enough that I told my psychiatrist and now I’m telling you all, I’ve never told anyone else any of this and I’m not even sure if there’s a statute of limitations on it or not because it started when I was 15. So what would happen is I would be in the kitchen or the basement making food or doing my laundry 🧺 and she would just brush up against me my buttocks the side of my breasts my psychiatrist has told me to practice NC even though I live in the same house as her still. I’m not entirely sure if her actions with the brushing past me or up against me was ever intentional or not but I do know the financial, psychological and physical abuse were intentional as well as the denial that I have any chronic illnesses. So I guess the point of this post is since my diagnosis 2 years ago I just need reassurance that I’m not the only one feeling the way I feel on a day to day basis."
Is it normal to feel happy after being diagnosed?,11,mjlayo,7,"Recently my therapist told me I have PTSD (which wasn't a diagnosis I expected) and at first I was kind of sad, but the more I research it the better I feel. It's like I finally have an explanation for all the  behaviors I used to constantly beat myself up over. I'm genuinely looking forward to doing more work to identify my triggers and learn to manage them. I even feel kinda compelled to tell the friends and family I'm close to so that they can better understand me. The only thing I'm sad about now is that I went so long without knowing what was going on with my head."
New member,2,mjksqg,7,"I have Chronic PTSD from life long trauma in my childhood, a severely broken family, and adulthood trauma. 

One of the biggest issues with my condition is trust with women. 

The two major women in my life, my mother and grandmother have given me good reasons not to trust them, and by them being the main women and the toxic women I've had in my life, it screwed my trust for women... My mother was narcissist, drug addict, and a whore and my grandma was a religious narcissist control freak... 

One reminder from a woman I'm with and it triggers me and my trust for them is all screwed up...

For instance, I'm 32 the woman I'm with is 23. She is still full of energy and likes to get out and socialize, while I on the other hand do not. Her mother reminds me of my mother and has shown me things to make me believe that, so I don't trust her with her mother. I don't trust her around her friends either... These people do not like me and tell her she can do better and to leave me alone. Due to a broken family past, I'm not a family oriented person, and do not see the importance of family gathering or any of that, and my trust issues go through the roof when she does this family function bs...

I'm old school and believe my relationship should be based on old school morals, rather than this confusing and destructive moral set we see today... I believe in old school teamwork and stability, the man should provide and protect while the woman cooks and cleans... I believe the only family we need to focus on is ours and building it... Instead, she is interested in drinking, slumber parties, and get togethers with these women who not only do not like me, but also women that I do not trust and as far as I'm concerned and learned, birds of a feather flock together...

Her on the other hand, does not have a clue what that means and fights, argues, plays victim, and gives me a guilt trip when I try to get her on board with this... She says I'm controlling, but when we first met, I told her bluntly about my condition, symptoms, and where it all comes from... I figured we had that understanding and she would support me... However, just like a lot of women I tell this too, at first it was all support, but in the end I'm a monster or controlling...

Recently, my relationships go for 1-2 years before im fed up with repeating myself, my concerns, my issues, and reminding my condition is chronic and the only way to better it is from real support. I feel like I'm constantly punching myself in the face and giving myself triggering flashbacks when I do that...It's like you tell someone you have PTSD, and now they think your stupid... 


Maybe I am controlling... If I am its for the right reason as far as Im concerned...I don't ask her to do anything illegal or immoral...

This relationship has been going on 1 year and 6 months just like this, and I'm ready to call it quits and just focus on bettering myself to be better for someone else in the future...

But when I try to move on, she either uses suicide or pregnancy as a way to stay in the picture...and honestly the girl needs help and guidance and I try to give her that, but after 1 year and 6 months of trying, constantly repeating myself, and fighting over it, I'm tired of trying to help someone who can't help themselves or don't want the help...especially while I'm struggling trying to help myself to better health...

I told her she is contributing to my PTSD and thats the opposite of what I'm looking for from anybody at this point in my life..."
Comparing yourself to who you were before your trauma / Mourning who you could have been without trauma,164,mjjau5,25,"TW: childhood sexual abuse

I know it's unhealthy to keep wishing that some things didn't happen or complain about life being unfair, but goddamn is it unfair sometimes. it's pretty useless to mourn the person you could've become without the trauma because that person simply doesn't exist. I just still feel envious sometimes of everyone who hasn't experienced sexual abuse. 

Before I was abused as a child, I was a lot more talkative and extroverted. The year after the abuse happened teachers started expressing their concerns to my parents, that I am unassertive in class, too shy, etc. What would my life be like if some horrible things never happened? I know I need to stop thinking about it. Today is just one of those days I feel angry again that I am one of the many unlucky ones who were born into a dysfunctional family. I have done some EMDR therapy and made tons of progress already, have a loving boyfriend now, but I still get setbacks. I know it's all part of the recovery process, but today I just wanted to express my grief. I feel unable to talk about this to people in my life, because they wouldn't understand. 

I wish I didn't have to get triggered during sex. It's so maddening. I feel angry that I should even have to remember horrible events of the past. If I never got abused these flashbacks wouldn't have to happen... Sometimes you think you're making progress and doing well and then those traumatic memories just punch you right back in the face :D. Oh well, I shouldn't beat myself up about it. I can't do anything else but surrender and accept my past, unfortunately."
My boyfriend supports and handles my PTSD better than anyone ever in my life except for one thing [TW: yelling],14,mjiyer,3,"We’ve been together for a year. He does almost everything right. He is incredibly generous and loving. If I have a flashback for any reason, even during intimacy, he holds me as does whatever I need at the moment. He deals with my night terrors every night with nothing but love.

But he still yells sometimes at me when he’s mad. Raised voices are by far one of my biggest triggers. I ask him to stop, and he says he comes from a loud family and can’t help it, but will try. When he raises his voice I always start to shake and tell him not to, and he feels bad. But he still does it most of the time when we argue. I have told him many times, if you have a problem or are angry at me, you can tell me with any words. Even if they hurt my feelings. Put me in my place. But just please, please don’t yell it at me. We rarely actually argue anyway. 

I can’t logically react once I’m set off.There is one thing that will trigger a flashback in me 100% of the time and he is very careful not to do it. Raised voices are my second biggest trigger, I will start to shake and be scared 100% of the time, and it triggers a full flashback episode like 50-75% of the time. 

He says he is “trying” to stop raising his voice. I don’t get why he has to “try”, is it not possible to just like... not yell at your girlfriend with trauma? He’s never experienced trauma, but how can he look at me shaking like that and then do it again the next argument? 

I’m just lost, I don’t know what to do."
How do you successfully date?,2,mjgljg,3,"I have hyper vigilance and I can only sleep alone. Lately I've had to deal with guys who get hurt feelings when I don't want to sleep over, don't invite them over my apartment or want to become a part of their life early on, and it makes them think I just want something casual. When a guy doesn't go at my pace I start to resent him and disparage him in my head and sometimes out loud, by accident. I try to explain how I feel to them in a simple way but I'm always scared of over sharing and they just brush me off. They're not really interested in hearing about some random girl's issues. 

Guys ask for Instagram and social media which I don't have and they don't know how to respond when I can't give them my profile. Sometimes a guy from online dating tries to invite me to a party when we barely even met, and I'm so suspicious of people who invite me to parties or to meet their friends. Then when one tiny argument comes up, those same people are willing to throw me out like garbage and never speak to me again. How can they have the audacity to invite me into their life and pretend like they wanted me? I wanted to be open to letting people in again but every time I try it takes too long for them and they become tired of me, I start to resent them for being all the same and I can feel their annoyance with me. It's exhausting trying to be happy around somebody all the time. No one wants to be around a miserable person but I'm not happy when I feel pressured at all. How did you find someone who respects you and your boundaries who you can feel safe around?"
"Hello, i used to be manic and i waved to strangers on the street but now i’m scared to",2,mjg246,7,"(Hello, I’m also looking for support about ptsd but there’s only the one flair) So long story short i was manic, and the highschool thought i had to go to the hospital to get medicated so my mother tricked me into going, once at the hospital the mental health act was pulled on me and i didn’t go peacefully, so i was tackled and held dow by two RCMP officers and one of them, a fat pig had his knee on my neck and i had to negotiate with him to move his knee from my neck to my head as i was afraid i was gonna die, when i was fighting i was yelling insults at them but with the pathetic mans knee on my neck i could barely talk and breathing was hard, so i had to start saying stuff like “don’t kill me, do you want to kill a 16 year old?” Anyways at first i thought it was the meds i’m now on that was making me more anxious and insecure, but now i’m starting to think it’s the ptsd, maybe i connote being the things i did when i was manic with the trauma from the police incident, i used to think i was unbeatable and then i got beaten, and maybe that’s why my confidence is gone, i used to explain that i was trying to build community when the strangers on my block would respond, but now i don’t feel like i could do that, i miss being manic, also i was never a danger to myself or others, i was just really really happy and confident, and i bet to edgy in my artistic expression, but now i know, god i’m insecure though."
Wondering if anyone else goes mute like this?,6,mjcza9,3,"It tends to happen when I'm out in public. I have really bad anxiety linked to ptsd and I'm not great in social situations, so I tend to get overwhelmed really easily... But even so, it seems to happen out of nowhere. One minute I'll be feeling mostly fine, if tired and stressed, and a little uncomfortable in public. And the next I'm completely overwhelmed and physically can't talk, and feel so disconnected from everything. I've even had to go as far as to learn basic sign language and teach my fiance basic signs so I can still communicate with him when it happens. And it lasts well after I leave the stressful situation, sometimes hours before I can talk anywhere above even a whisper, again. I'm wondering if anyone else deals with this same thing, if you know what causes it, and if you maybe know any way of limiting it or stopping it?"
Need help/ advice to cope with a year of systematic harassment by my neighbours.,1,mjba84,12,"Hi, I'm here for advice and to hear some thoughts experiences of other's. I hope you can help me with my story.

I try to keep it short to not bother you too long but it won't be a short read. Thank you in advance. 

So I'm living on my own for about a year and a half now. My moving out experience was not the best to this day. My first landlord had driven me into psychotic breakdown. I knew this feeling I had it multiple times during high school and even in middle school. I moved out that day. I then lived on the couch of a friend of mine for 2 months until I found a hippie commune by chance. I lived with them for a month but they hated me. I finally found my first own flat after this month.

My moving in experience was quite pleasant, I thought I would finally have my own home now and can finally rest and get some peace.

Everything was OK until Covid struck and I started to pursue my hobbys because I didn't had to work. It involved manual labour. I was constructing a electrical boat in the basement and some components in my flat.

Turns out my neighbours don't like people who do things and don't live of social welfare. (it is in a low income area). And so two of the people in the house one of them directly under me decided to use their plentiful free time to turn my life into living hell.

One day I got a letter from the neighbour under me which was more of a rant with more expletives than words. Followed by a letter by the landlord saying I should stop making noise. (he accused me of absolutely ridiculous things if never done). Shortly after that I got a letter from the landlord again threatening me with eviction. I was stressed at this point but this freaked me out and put me into a never ending state of fear of being evicted within 2 weeks without warning. This would be terrible in the current housing market. So I lived in fear of this happening from then on to today. 

But wait there is more. 

One evening I was working in my basement when my neighbour under me and his friend came into my basement and threatened me there. They wanted to beat me up and they thew my tools around. They where harassing me to no end and then even a other neighbour a I was friends with and saw the thing happening. They followed me to my car outside and threatened me there also.

I was completely done after that but I but I had to return every day to this place because it was my house after all. I had terrible fear of runnig into them. I stopped looking in the mailbox because I didn't wanna run into them. I didn't left my flat when I knew one of them was in the hallway. 

I noticed the first physical signs of this by sweat and a racing heart while walking to my door. I was looking over my shoulder and only wanted to minimise the time being in the hallways. My heart beats fast only typing this. 

But the worst thing, and that's why I'm turning to this sub is my neighbour under me started punching against his ceiling thereby my floor whenever I did something he didn't like. 

In the beginning I didn't even understand that he did this on purpose. I thought nothing of it, I looked at it as random noise which happens in big complexes. But he didn't stop and soon he was pissing me of. Months of this went by and it went from disturbing me to stressing me. Stressing me hard. I'm at a point now where it ruins my mood multiple days after each incident. 

The most concerning side effects for me is that every time something rumbles, either at work or at home or anywhere and the ground shakes a bit it gives me the same dreadful feeling and it throws me of into a state where I'm just so filled with stress hormones that I need a minute or two just to be functional again. That's where I hope some of you can tell me whether or not this is PTSD typical. 

I'm also starting to measure elevated blood pressure even though I'm super sporty. I also feel tired often and most importantly I'm having trouble concentrating on things. Another thing I can't explain to any doctor is that since this I'm more and more starting to feel unwelcome in my own skin like I'm just remote controlling my own body. Besides that, only little amounts of caffeine and alcohol or any mind altering substance kicks me of my feet. I was pretty tolerant against this in the past. 

I have only a few days ago signed my new leasing contract for my new flat in a single house at small village outside of town. I'm so incredibly happy about this. 

Can some please tell me if the above mentioned symptoms will go away after the move? My doctor performed multiple checks and didn't found anything wrong with me so I think they are related to my experiences and are of psychological nature. Has anyone had similar experience with the symptoms mentioned. 

If you are still with me thank you for reading this far. Please tell me if things are gonna get better once I'm out of there and what I can do to feel better again. I just don't want to be bothered by thoughts about my neighbours anymore. These guys have ruined my mood and my health for every single fucking day since a Year now. 

Thank you"
NSFW - deep depression when I orgasm?,62,mjapck,29,I’m sorry this is a strange question but I keep noticing it and I don’t understand it or know what to ask really. Whenever I get there I just feel so sad and feel trauma resurface. I’ve been sexually harassed before but it’s the trauma from the abuse in my family that feels like it invades my mind when I’m doing that. I’ll reach that point and feel good then all of a sudden I remember getting beat or hear all the yelling in my head or I’ll just hate myself or something. Does anyone else experience this? I’m sorry I know it’s a weird question to ask but I don’t know how to talk to anyone about it really
Avoiding a very specific trigger,6,mjajv4,2,One of my triggers is the song that was playing when I regained consciousness during the event that caused my ptsd. I get very anxious when listening to music in the same genre if I haven't made the playlist. I tend to avoid listening to the radio and such. Hearing it triggers major flashbacks for me. I play in a softball league that plays music on big speakers very loudly. The whole time I feel like I'm on the verge af a panic attack worried this song is going to play.  The guy that runs the league is a really nice guy and I think that if I could explain in the right way he would agreed to not play it. I just don't want to get into any details but I feel like he would need to understand that it is more than I just don't like this song. I would rather email him than talk in person.  Does anyone have a suggestion on how to go about wording this?
I can’t sleep anymore.,7,mjaadm,6,Is anyone else experiencing this? I can’t turn my mind off at all.
Looking for something,1,mja257,0,"I (28f) never realized the domestic abuse I witnessed and was apart of as a child (9-17 yrs old) would result in me having PTSD. I was always under the impression I was manic depressive and had anxiety with small bouts of depression. 

I didn’t start addressing my struggle until recently and going to therapy for the last 3 months and being on medication for the last 2 months has been extremely helpful. The initial reason I started going to therapy was I noticed the things that happened to me as a child, those feelings and emotions I experienced I was bringing into my marriage. Not cool. I needed and wanted to get it straight. How do I deal? 

What triggered this? My upstairs neighbors. It’s not a matter of being on the 1st floor, it’s just the shit neighbors who live upstairs from me. The banging around from their toddler, the hard walking mother and the occasional fight with the father are setting off major triggers. I own the condo and bought it about Sept ‘19, these guys moved in Nov ‘20 as renters. Needless to say it’s been a long 5 months. I’ve spoken to my husband about moving - he’s not budging. I can’t blame him or get mad at him. Who knows how long these guys are going to last here? Why give up on an asset for temporary happiness? Which brings me to my next point. 

Happiness is an extremely emotion we strive to live for when in actuality we should be looking for contentment. He says “they aren’t the problem, you need to stop kicking dirt over your problem and start addressing it.” Talk about tough love, but he’s right."
Complex PTSD Workbook,3,mj910q,17,My therapist recently changed my diagnosis from PTSD to Complex PTSD and recommended that I purchase the Complex PTSD Workbook. Has anyone here used that workbook before? I’d love to hear what your experiences were.
Ptsd freak out,21,mj62po,4,"I just had an outburst because things got to overwhelming and I'm super embarrassed.  I normally can handle myself well and remove myself when I feel like things are gonna trigger me but I have rare times I just can't.  They usually happen when I am alone but sometimes they happen in front of my bf, I'm guessing because we have a very close relationship and I can let my guard down.  The thing is, idk how to communicate what just happened or explain to him why I freaked out cause the reason seems so fucken stupid and I just acted like a two year old who didn't get the chocolate bar and threw shit and themselves on the ground. I'm super embarrassed and scared to come out of our room and go talk to him."
"Why does my mother not believe me, my psychiatrist, or my therapist when they diagnosed me with PTSD?",20,mj5mfx,21,"Not going to get into my past experiences, but my mother doesn't believe my doctors and mental health team when they diagnosed me with PTSD. My mother says that since I was never in war I cannot have PTSD. What should I do or tell my mother?"
PTSD nightmares,3,mj559d,2,"So I went to a psych ward back in December because my mental health got terrible. I’m currently in therapy although I do not a have a diagnosis. They are leaning towards c-ptsd but have also mentioned BPD and bipolar 2. I know nightmares are common with ptsd and I was curious if any of you could tell me about your experiences with it. My nightmares lately have been too much to put it simply. They’re all very real feeling and don’t feel like normal nightmares not to mention I don’t dream like normal in these nightmares. I almost always dream in 3rd person and didn’t start dreaming in 1st till these nightmares. They give me that nasty anxious feeling in my stomach and the Adrenaline from fight or flight reflexs. When I wake up I realize it was a dream but I’m always disoriented and have to tell myself who I am, where I’m at and what I’m doing. It’s almost like I have to remember the last 2 years of my life to figure out what just happened."
Does this sound like ptsd,3,mj41bh,7,"When someone is falling asleep, just as they transfer into deep sleep but hear explosions, bangs, loud pops, knocks, etc. which wakes them up. This is increased when they are stressed. Also loud sounds like trash trucks in the am makes them wake up almost panicked. Always around 4 am. Truck runs at 4 am, before that their father (who fell often after 2 strokes) would wake up at 4 am, and they would also hear the neighbors phone alarm vibrate up stairs at the same time. This didn’t happen until after basic training. Loud pitched whistles followed by explosions from 9 pm to 6-7 am. Always waking up as they hit deep sleep. Never completed basic."
"I feel livid and sad hopeless at the same time,",3,mj30bg,0," 

I could write a book about my life, however to spare the lengthy post

I don't know how to keep being alive. My life has just been one domino effect of bad ever since I was 17, and im 27 now.

I've been in the wrong spaces for such a long time, not intentionally but it's like the first bad situation somehow led to another that led to another. I've had two traumatic relationships in my life, both being with co workers. the 1st was when I was 17/18 years old, fresh in the work world working at a fast food. The guy was 21 and due to low self esteem from being ghosted and then finding out the person then chose another girl to be his gf, right after ghosting me ( we were talking and flirting heavily for about 3 months), I stupidly accepted the advances of a guy who wasn't my type in the first place. He was always very persistent in wanting my attention and when he spoke about how good I look and how special I am, how much better I was than other girls, how he doesn't know how a guy couldn't want me etc. I finally fell for it. We went out for about 4-5 months, and towards the end of it, the truth came out. The mother of his child was pregnant with another child, about 6 months along, so basically when he and I first got together, even before sex happened between us, she was already 2-3 months pregnant. Of course he didn't disclose this until later. I think he said something along the lines of not believing that she was. Although I should've ended it right then and there, it took me a few more weeks to do so because I was attached to him by then and he told me so many lies about him saying my name in his sleep and he loves me etc. etc. he told me there's no such thing as fairytales and that he's no good, and he told me the lies I wanted to hear. This was the first guy I had ever been with not just sexually but ""romantically"", I never had a bf before and I had been so hurt by being rejected from the first guy ( who honestly was like my dream guy at the time, he was in college, kind, large vocabulary, creative and the one I originally thought and hoped would have been my first bf) but the lack of closure of rejecting me made me wonder what did I do wrong, etc. and I beat myself up everyday even until now for ""falling"" for the 2nd guy because he negatively changed my life and he wasn't even my type or someone I was initially into. After we broke up, about a few weeks later, the mother of his child gave birth ( I was aware he had a daughter but being stupid and not in the right mind I believed that he wasn't with the mother in that way it was just co parenting), and she and he started harassing me, calling me, texting me, etc. it was awful. Right before that started, about a week prior and maybe like 3 weeks after we broke up, I had found out I contracted an STD from him. To my knowledge a condom was always used but I guess it didn't matter. Being blindsided by that, then being harassed and cursed out by both of them, all while still working at that toxic job and trying to finish up my 2nd semester of college, was unbelievably hard. I spent about two months dealing with that on and off until I was able to find a new job and quit immediately. I didn't think it would get worse, so when the first curse out happened, I didn't quit because I thought that was it. But it continued even though I never provoked back... never opened my mouth to argue back because I realized arguing back with someone like that is like talking to a wall. Maybe my lack of arguing back made them more upset so two weeks later, it happened again etc. After I quit, he did contact me again one more time two months later out of the blue to curse me out. I had his number blocked from months prior but for some reason you're able to still get voicemails.... Out of curiosity I listened and I'm like you're the desperate to get the heat of yourself that you're going to say you never wanted me and that I'm basically some hoe who had nothing better to do... I haven't heard from him since but there's more to write. That one year of my life working there I'm still in shock to it to this day. And that was the start of the spiral."
I can’t figure out how to make friends?,3,mj2wfr,1,"I wish my flair could be the shrug emoji

Anyway
I know people that I want to be friends with
And like we are
But aaaaanytime anyone tries asking about my life I kind of shut it down reeeaaal quick. Not intentionally either, just like I manage to totally redirect every time without even thinking about it. Defense mechanism? Perhaps?
OR
I put a lot of effort into getting to know someone and they just don’t pay me any mind at all so then I’m like... sad? Because they don’t want to know me?
But also I’d probably shut them down anyway so it shouldn’t matter?
But then I’m just cycling in loneliness 

So I know a lot of people but nobody knows me
And I don’t know if I’m okay with that lmao

Does anyone relate? Or like... know what to do with this kind of feeling? It catches me off guard every time"
What would you do?,1,mj2dy1,1,"I was diagnosed about a week ago now, and understanding that I have PTSD has made me realize why certain things trigger me. 

Tonight I was out with a friend, and she’s a bit of a hot head lol. Someone yelled at her while we driving and she slammed the vehicle in park and tried to get out and go confront the person. My abuser used to do this, and when I looked at her - all I could see was him. Out of reaction, I grabbed her and begged her to stay in the vehicle. After we were away from the situation, I started sobbing and aggressively cracking my knuckles/rubbing my hands (this is what I do when I’m uncomfortable). I don’t think she understands the way these situations cause flashbacks and triggers. 

How do I have a conversation with her about this? I don’t want to get in a fight with her, but I want to her to know why I got upset so quick. It find it embarrassing to talk to someone about these things, and I don’t want it to be. 

Any suggestions?"
Do I have PTSD?,1,mj2ctb,3,"For some context, I'm 16 about to turn 17. I feel like I had an alright childhood for the most part. My dad wasn't around, I haven't seen him in about 6 months, and I only see him a few times a year because he's addicted to crack cocaine. My whole life I thought his name was X, but turns out it was Y when I looked at my birth certificate at 14.

I live in a tough neighborhood. I have had more than 10 of my good friends/aqquaintenc's die from gun violence, my family has been shot at, my house has been shot up more times than I can remember. I think it was the 2nd time that I had gotten up from bed to get something out of my closet, then I heard shots that I thought were coming from the distance, then they turned into loud blasts and a bullet went through the spot where I was standing at where if I was right there, it would've hit my head/neck.

I think the worst one was when I was sitting in my living room reading malcom x, and my mom came in to talk to me. She moved from the spot she was standing at in front of the door, and not even 5 secs later, my door was hit with an ak-47 from close range, flying straight through the door, hitting my water heater so we had no hot water for a good 4 months, we're lucky that only a piece of something hit me in the arm only to scratch me. 

I can't sleep at night. I'm always thinking about one of my best friends, who wasn't gang affiliated or anything, who got killed by people who were in his house. I have had times where I stayed awake for more than 48+ hours. I went to sleep at 12:30 in the am yesterday, only to wake up 2 hours later due to nightmares. 

I've had nightmares since I was 10 that had a countdown, yes, a countdown. It would start from 10 counting down, the numbers huge with a flashy background. Most of the time I couldn't wake myself up before the countdown went off, which would result in some of the most goriest things I didn't know where possible to even think of. They've come back worse than ever.

I don't usually believe in online tests, but I've taken more than probably 50 tests which all say I am at high risk for PTSD. 

I have had a few gfs in my life, the last one broke up with me because in her words, I was too emotionally withdrawn. I wish I had a better social understanding of ppl to start a conversation, or in terms that ppl around me would say, ""shoot my shot"", but I just can't bring myself too. Every gf I've ever had asked me out, I've never initiated anything in my life.

I am on probation for shit that I don't really feel safe talking about, but I will say that the police that came said they found a pound of something, but when I got out of juvenile and went to court, my judge found out that the charge wasn't put in what he read my case file out of. We've never actually seen what they found, my mom requested body cam footage which they never gave, and that has really taken away from me what shred of justice I thought my community could ever receive.

My birthday s in like a month, but I really don't have the motivation to do anything for it. I just want to stay in my room with my thoughts most of the time anyway. I don't think I will ever be the same, jovial kid I used to be. Ever since I got out of elementary I wasn't good in school.

I could say a lot more but idk. I just don't. I don't know what I want anymore. Everytime something looks like it s gonna be a little fine, something happens. I'm tired of looking at the national gun violence memorial, news, and shit everyday just to see if someone I love or have had some kind of relationship I had with die. 

I went to one my closest friends funeral, and I couldn't even look at his body. I knew he wouldn't look the same."
"New here, really mixed feelings. Does it ever go away?",3,mj1efw,2,"Just recently diagnosed with PTSD due to known (and some previously unknown) repeated childhood trauma. I was smoking weed for a really long time to numb everything, then got diagnosed with CHS, had to quit, and I wasn’t fully realizing what I was numbing. I thought PTSD was just for veterans who’ve gone to war. I didn’t think that what I was experiencing was classic PTSD. I’ve been experiencing symptoms since I was 12, that I can remember anyway. Caused a lot of issues in my teenage years and young adulthood. Got addicted to all sorts of substances to make it go away. Recently sober and all of it came back and it’s just really been a rough trip. I just don’t really know where to go from here. 

Does it ever get better? Does it ever go away? I just get so angry out of nowhere for what seems like no reason. I’ve had a hard time identifying my triggers with my therapist. He says it goes away mostly eventually but idk, looking for anecdotal experiences. I’m just so confused and frustrated and just trying to learn as much as I can"
Help My Abusive Parents are Going to Move Close to Me (NEED ADVICE),5,mj1d4w,6,"My hard work finally fucking paid off. I've dealt with multiple mental illnesses, suicide attempts for YEARS due to their abuse. I almost dropped out of high school multiple times, while working full time to support myself and be independent of my abusive parents. I got into a great uni and now am FINALLY moving out. I'm finding a place, a new job and can FINALLY be away from them, and I don't have to live in fear.

However today my mother bragged about how they will be moving soon and my dad pipes in saying the area which is close to me. He says it's not ***that*** close but it sure is as hell is. and I also don't give a shit that ""it's not next door"": i already don't feel safe, and now idk how i ever will. It seems I'll never escape them. I want to scream so badly, and I honestly can't breathe.

I cannot handle working, recovery, school, AND living in close proximity to them; constantly in fear. I need help!! I've considered a restraining order in the past  (after some awful shit that landed me in the hospital) but i don't even know how to start that process.

I don't know what to do please someone comment something because I can't stop freaking out.

**edit:** I forgot to mention that even if i did get a restraining order, my parents would not follow it. They do not give a shit about the law, and my mother doesn't even think she does anything wrong half the time. "

Anyone else super struggle with dissociation?,20,mj1aor,10,"I dissociate insanely badly (to the point I’ve been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder). My friends are used to it at this point, and honestly it was “just a weird idkwhattowritehere thing” until my therapist caught it. Anyone else?"
Over time,2,mj18we,0,In 2013 I was in an accident involving an SUV and a train. A friend of mine was killed and in 2016 I really felt like I was good. I felt like I had recovered just fine. Mentally and physically. Starting in 2019 the troubles came back. At times worse then they were. The night terrors are real. The feeling of doom. I think that’s how I’d describe it. It’s back and it’s worse. I have no clue why 7 years later I’m actually having more trouble than I did just a few years after the accident.
I feel wrong for feeling better,18,mj0mf7,11,"So I started an antidepressant a few months ago and it really helps. However, it feels weird that I'm starting to feel more apathetic about the trauma. In a weird way it feels like I should have to feel horrible to prove what happened to me was real? I don't know how to explain it. It feels like my brain is like ""oh gee, you don't feel horrible now, so it really must've not been that bad."" My emotional memory is just 75% blah now. Maybe I'm just overthinking it."
PTSD and the way I think,7,mj0fwh,6,"I found out that PTSD alters your brain physically, if they take scans of your brain before and after your brain is not the same. all I can think about is that I can never be me again and I feel pathetically upset about this. how is it that some part of me wants to act like I was before, but then I can't do it, I can think it but I can't laugh like I used to, I can't crack jokes, I can't hold a conversation? I don't understand who I am anymore? my nightmares haunt me, my wounds feel fresh.

Can you have PTSD if you don't remember?,8,miuhof,18,Okay I'm going to keep this short and simple. There was an incident in which I was assaulted but don't remember. I know I was assaulted because I was found in the street covered in blood and had to go to the hospital. Can you have PTSD from an assault that resulted in a TBI and therefore have no memory?
Why am I like this?,67,misppk,19,"I always feel like that nobody understands me and I don't understand anybody. It feels like I have a completely different logic and I see things different. I suffer from PTSD and I wish I could think like everyone else. I feel so dumb, lonely and misunderstood. I'll turn 18 in August and to be honest, I sometimes feel like I'm stuck in the age before I was abused by my ex-step-brother and in the age where my other traumatic events happened. I also sometimes don't feel like myself, sometimes I have like another personality, which doesn't fit to me. I also don't really wanna talk with my therapist about it (I don't know why).
I wish I would be normal and have a normal life.

"Carbs trigger flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety ?",7,mih9xm,4,"⚠️ As it was pointed out to me, this post might be triggering to those with ED


Hey, 

So i noticed something pretty damning for me that I want to share. English isn't my language so bear with me.

Carbs have been my main (if not only) source of food for years.
2 months ago, I did a long term fast for a few days, and noticed very encouraging results on my ptsd symptoms such as nightmares, flashbacks and anxiety. They weren't completely gone but wayyy toned down and actually manageable. Then when i started eating again, i focused on healthy food, fibers, healthy fats proteins and the improvements i had noticed were still there.
A couple weeks later, I had a slip up and started eating junk food again. Bam, the anxiety and flashbacks came back with a vengeance.
Did another prolonged fast, which calmed the symptoms a bit, then immediately started eating a diet mostly consisting of bread and cheese (i am a frenchie after all). You guessed it, symptoms came back like crazy.
So I did a third 4 days fast again, ate healthy again, symptoms gone.
Just yesterday, i had a binge of junk food and now i'm feeling like shit, flashbacks won't leave me alone.

Doing research, I couldn't find any study or evidence of the correlation between a high carb diet and ptsd/cptsd although there's a link between it and symptoms of depression/anxiety. 

But from my short term experience, the correlation is pretty damning. It's obviously not a miracle cure, nothing is, but it is really a huge difference.
My symptoms can be very much debilitating and with fasting or low carb diet, they are very much manageable.

I really suggest all of you to try avoiding carbs for a week and please if you do, share your results.

**tl;dr** : Carbohydrates might play an important role in cptsd/ptsd symptoms and avoiding them, in my experience, alleviate those symptoms greatly while high carb diet makes them worst."
"Bad health after leaving an abusive partner, PTSD?",21,mih71d,16,"Hello, I don't know anything about PTSD, but a friend of mine has talked about that, she thinks that all my physical symptoms are maybe linked to my past relationship. Sorry, I'm not a native english speaker.
So, I met this guy, he was my neighbor, we felt an intense connection directly. He tried to understand me, he was so lovely. But then he became really weird, I was not myself anymore, I was his property, I coudn't wear what I wanted, couldn't think a certain way. One day I was the purest angel on earth and the other day I was the worst piece of shit of humanity. Those were his words. But I stayed, because I thought he was right about me, that I can't live without him, that I'm crazy. I was gaslighted for six years by my ex partner. And I realize all of this only since the begginning of the year, thanks to my therapist. I left him last November. My health was not good last year, especially when the lockdown came. I was stuck with him. I was constantly feeling a pressure in my back, stomach. I was losing appetite and weight. Since I left him, I feel calm and I feel pretty. I know what I want. I know that I deserve better. I finally know that I didn't deserve that and that's not my fault. But my physical health is terrible. I have ZERO energy, ZERO endurance. I have so heavy acid reflux, sometimes it can be like that an entire day. I feel something stuck in my throat constantly. I see a doctor every week, I tried medication, strict diet, meditation...What is weird is that I'm not feeling anxious that much. Even if sometimes I cry and I'm fed up with my loneliness. I feel psychologicaly better than when I was with my ex. But my body is stuck. I can't breathe well. I can't sing anymore. And sometimes I will have these nightmares of someone that want to poison me, or to suck my blood...I cannot see his face, but tonight I felt so bad in my stomach, can't breathe and I saw my ex's face in my dream. I don't think of him that much during the day. But it feels like my body and my nightmares are talking ? Are all my physical pain linked to that traumatic past? I feel so stuck..."
I have ptsd from an online controversy i had to deal with how do i forget or move on?,1,migd3w,3,"ive had to deal with a minor but very personal controversy that whenever i think about it makes me feel scared, miserable, depressed and filled with regret and despair. i feel like even after separating myself from it from them i cannot escape, i get a horrible feeling in my chest my spine and gut like a cold unsettling feeling whenever i recall or see pictures or hear someone talk about the person i have attempted to forget about. i am convinced i have PTSD and although it isn't PTSD of something like war or an attempted murder on my life it still greatly effects me and im scared it will haunt me for the rest of my life. my hands are shaking and trembling just typing this post. ive tried to forget and remove any means of hearing reference from them But it isn't working for me how do i stop this PTSD induced nightmare im living in how do I forget and move on!?!"
The rubber band Technique,1,mifuds,1,"I found a way that might help hopefully get a rubber band and put it around your wrist like a wristband now when you get a ptsd attack lift up the rubber band and let go and let it slap you.

This is to get the attention off the topic of raging to focus on something else or get relief. I probably wouldn't recommend it for someone who does a lot of raging though"
is survivors guilt really PTSD? or am i just overthinking my trauma,7,mif37u,5,.
When life is a trigger,13,miblmo,27,"After some journaling, I have ask myself; how can I heal in an environment like this? Where, no matter how hard you avoid it, brutality and violence and pain is a constant; where mass murders are committed almost daily that require us to constantly be on guard and looking for an escape route? When every single time we look at our phones, or tv, or go to any public place with the news running constantly showing nothing but terrible things? When real life is literally nightmare fuel and the injustice and pain and turmoil of the world is just fucking icing on my already fucked up cake. 

I can’t go to the grocery without paying attention to the exit signs and making an alternate route to get out. I am constantly making a contingency plan in my head of what I’d do if shit went down at any moment. 

My PTSD is already moderate but the society we live in amplifies it. I don’t feel safe in my mind and I don’t feel safe in the world. 

It’s not as easy as just turning off the phone or tv. It’s everywhere. Plus, being informed and aware of major issues is important to me as a person so I don’t want to tune completely out. 

Is healing possible in such a sick society?? :/"
Officially diagnosed with ptsd,3,mib2as,1,So its been thought that i might have ptsd in my family for a very long time now. Since about 2015 my fiance thought this. I had already been diagnosed with depression and anxiety for a few years now. Today is the day ptsd gets added to the list and now im on prozac
Tired of fighting my triggers,7,mib0t1,1,Does anyone else just get to a point in therapy where you just feel like “this is it”? Sometimes I feel like there is nothing I can do to move past what happened to me. I made progress in therapy 4 years ago and then made some last year- but I am still so affected that I don’t think I’ll ever totally move forward. It can be so exhausting to explain it to people in my life and I find myself that isolating and just dealing with things on my own is the best way for me to cope.
I’m SICK of avoiding things because of my triggers,9,miae0q,2,"There’s a new show that came out that’s been highly recommend for me to watch. It has amazing ratings and people around me can’t stop talking about it. Naturally, I’m interested. But guess what? The show is about suicide, which is my biggest trigger. Now I can’t watch it, because I know if I do, I’ll be setting myself up to have a major issue. It sucks not to be able to enjoy things because of your PTSD. So many times I’ve wanted to watch a movie, read a book, etc. but couldn’t because of my triggers. It’s horrible to avoid these things even though they pose no actual threat, and I know that. But I also know that I can’t control how my brain reacts to certain themes and stimuli. I hate having to alter my life for such a stupid reason. I’m so sick of having to sacrifice enjoyment for avoidance."
Holidays are the worst,4,mi9vzf,2,"My PTSD is related to being abused in my childhood. I was pretty much being abused as long as I can remember but there was a time where it wasn’t that bad and I also didn’t realize it was wrong so I was fairly happy and enjoyed holidays like any other kid. Now every single holiday I’m just reminded about how I don’t have the family I once thought I had. And I just get flooded with painful memories. I feel so alone. 

I have a civil relationship with my mom even though she did a lot of really fucked up things. And on a day to day basis I am able to interact with her and see her and feel totally fine and even *good* about it. I don’t hate her. She was a victim of abuse herself and I don’t forgive her for the things she did but she isn’t an evil person. 

But on holidays it pains me to see her. I feel kind of bitter? I’m supposed to go to her house for a family dinner on Easter and it’s a few days away and I’m just a wreck. I bailed on all of the holidays last year except Christmas and on Christmas after everyone left her and I both ended up crying. Even though she’s part of my pain, she also went through the same thing as me so we’re kinda in the same position. It really hurts her when I bail on holidays and I feel extremely guilty. But I’m really not doing well mentally right now and I don’t know if I can go through with it. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to just tell her the truth and tell her how terribly I’m doing but I don’t think she’ll get it and just be mad at me and when she’s mad at me I can’t handle it because I feel like I’m back in the times when she was mad and drunk and crazy. So I feel like I have to come up with a lie but I don’t want to lie and it bothers me that telling the truth which is that I’m a fucking broken ass person will anger her. I hate being someone that’s unreliable and bails but fuck I’m sorry I just can’t deal. I hate when people get mad at me for being shitty I KNOW I’m shitty and I already feel like shit about it, you know?"
Does my ex hate me now or forgot I exist?,2,mi9ra6,0,"My addict ex and I were together for 6 months during which he asked me to marry him. But he was trauma bonded/addicted to his ex. They’re both drug addicts and he’s an alcoholic as well. Up until a few days before we broke up (when I began seeing signs of being devalued), he was as loving as usual. But I also started noticing signs of him relapsing back to her. Long story short, we ended up in a huge dramatic mess and they got back together. He hasn’t hoovered me this time like before. Does that mean he probably hates me now?"
What to do when people don’t understand your PTSD,3,mi8wuz,1,"Long post warning...lol

First time posting anything here...so here it goes. I am a child abuse survivor who came from a home where my dad was an abusive alcoholic. When my mom and I left my dad we went to live with my granny. Eventually my mom succumbed to the pressure of being a working single mother who was in and out of court (with dad) and became addicted to crack/pills. As you can imagine my granny and my other grandparents(dad’s parents) ended up taking care of me. 

I ended up having a successful run during my teenage years and college years and I thought the worst was behind me. Fast forward to the present, now that I am an adult my PTSD has reared it’s ugly head. I’ve had hard times holding jobs and fostering relationships with those outside my circle of close friends. 

Now I’m in a position where I work for a very conservative government organization, and my PTSD symptoms interfere with my interactions with contentious people and controversial issues. Recently I have had panic attacks where I have locked up in situations where I could have easily been in control of. Currently my boss has been understanding of my PTSD but he’s the type of person that his mood depends on the day. I began seeing a psychiatrist for medication when my job performance began to slip up. My PTSD improved for about 6 months but I’m beginning to regress. 

I am about to start therapy to begin to work through my trauma. My boss has recently told me that if my performance begins to slip and they will begin the process to terminate me (saying ADA reasonable accommodations are becoming a burden to the organization). 

What can I do to make him understand what I’m going through? He’s the type of person that if my PTSD was caused by combat there would be no issue, however it’s caused by child abuse so I should have just got over it a long time ago...ugh rant over."

Meds and PTSD: successes and insights?,1,mi849d,5,"Hi all, just wondering what people’s experiences of taking meds for PTSD are? The main things that control my life are dissociation (but I’ve always been stuck in my head even before this stuff) and hypervigilance, sensory overload/response to touch. Don’t really have nightmares or full on flashbacks etc just heaps of mini triggers. 

I don’t want to get flattened out or numbed, but it would be amazing to not have my threat response going all the time. Any anecdotal experiences appreciated before I speak to my doctor."
I'm mentally struggling,2,mi66p0,2,"TW: Sexual assault, harassment, and abuse

In November, my assaulter broke the NCO and was given a warning by the police. New year's eve he broke it again and got arrested. His wife has been harassing me multiple times a day since Jan 2nd. Part of my daily schedule is now screenshotting her messages and sending them to the officer in charge of this harassment case. There is a court case set for july but she refuses to stop.

I’m tired of being told that one day I will help make the world a better place with everything I’ve learned.

Right now, I just want to live normally without PTSD and all its whack symptoms breathing down my neck every minute of the day.

Diagnosis: PTSD,13,mi3wxa,2,"Hi everyone. New here. I recently had a neuropsychological evaluation for what I went into thinking I have ADD/ADHD and came out with PTSD. It crushed me like a can on recycling day. The last couple of days I felt like I was sitting at the edge of what I call ""the black hole"". Teetering on falling into deep depression (diagnosed also + anxiety). 

I went through a lot of emotions from rage, crying, laughing, feeling like a joke, pissed off.. I rather the doctor had said I have nothing then tell me I have PTSD. My brother, after coming home from 2 very long tours, he has PTSD. I shouldn't be told I have PTSD. I have not experienced anything close to what he experienced or any severe trauma related situation. I was super close to just canceling all of my doctors. 

I took a day and half off from work. Couldn't get my mind or my body to feel like it could get through the day. I took the day to rethink all of this. How the doctor got to that conclusion. Finding out more about PTSD. That it can be experienced by all sorts of people not specific to Military or severe trauma. 

Saw the psychiatrist today. She is going to help me find a new therapist as the last one was more focused on ADHD. I explained my feelings around the diagnosis and I'm glad she understands I'm confused but willing to work on whatever I can to feel better. 

In case your wondering why confused, it's because I went in thinking my actions/reactions were very closely related to ADD/ADHD. Now, I'm thinking ""well now you have to get to know yourself and deep dive to find out who this person is."" There are things deep, buried, not thought of for a very long time inside of me, but I feel better. I feel better I have a diagnosis, something to work with and hopefully heal from.   

Thank you 😁"
Again and again and again... I wonder if things will change... (TW: Unsure.),1,mi2bcv,0,"No matter how hard I try... Its happening over and over. First... I will have different types of flashbacks, and... While having those, I will be weird, struggle to breathe. I will just want to cry and scream and I wont even be able to do this much. Then I will caught up in an emotional flashback... Which feels like itll last forever. Now Im in despair and scared. I just wanna die and cannot do it. Cause other people wouldnt like it if I were to kill myself... I know this will pass.. Well...I dont actually know. It feels like it wont ever go away. And why should it go away? Itll come again and again... I dont want to try anymore. I want to try no more. It is not working. It wont work. I hate that I have to live for others sake."
Alcohol and PTSD?,19,mi1806,45,"If you're using alcohol to just relax like 2-3 times a week, isn't it okay to drink alcohol while undergoing PTSD therapy?

I got a call from my psychiatrist earlier today and they said they won't be able to start PTSD treatment unless I stop drinking since it interferes with the therapy somehow. I asked how and she said it messes with the memory forming procedure. I didn't talk further since then I'd be labeled a suspected alcoholic.

As for why I drink, I simply love it. I just really enjoy drinking and not caring for a while. My mind is always at 100% and it's tiring so 2-3 times a week, I drink like 3 malt liquors and just play videogames which I can't otherwise since I feel guilty for playing videogames and I do need to do that to distract my mind.

The moment she said it, I felt annoyed because now I would probably put a strain on my daily life as I tend to get more and more aggressive because of my mind being overactive and I don't really want that. I also don't want any medication they could offer since it always makes things worse for me.

Sorry if it all sounds incoherent together but I am feeling weird about it. I guess I'm asking you people since I would like to know some more reasoning behind it."
"Thought I was progressing, then the nightmares came back",29,mi0r32,3,"TW: sexual assault and abuse

I've been getting help for my PTSD for about 2 months now. At first I thought ""wow I'm so proud that I'm making progress and can do normal things throughout the day without going in and out"" ""things really do get better""

Then life went ""oh, you really thought that? hahahahaha""

Because although the days were starting to settle, the nights were getting worse. I can't tell if I'm dreaming or having a nightmare, and I mean full-on reenactments of what happened. What he did. Repeated moments of terror, repeated again, and again, and again in a single dream. I could feel the hot liquid that was poured on me, the pain he made me feel as he watched, the powerlessness all over again. I'm waking up every single hour of the night. 

These other realities had cockroaches flying into my bed and engulfing me from inside out, the other ones were me being intimate with my boyfriend, until he suddenly morphs into my rapist. I've had dreams of glass being used to carve out my spine while I could feel all of it. The other ones are just me watching myself sleep from the corner of my room. In every dream, I beg to die. 

I feel pathetic, and I'm pissed that I feel pathetic. But the good news is I'm pissed off instead of sad, so I've got some more energy to face this bullshit and have my life back. Fuck you PTSD, fuck you insomnia."

Trauma surrounding sexuality and my girlfriend,0,mhvqap,4,"TL/DR how do I come to terms with my girlfriends questioning sexuality? 

Together since Sep. 2018, known each other since 2011. So this isn’t an issue in terms of sexuality for her (21F) she is free to be herself obviously but I (21M) can’t seem to come to terms with the intimidation I feel from her not being straight; it stems from a fear it feels like. Nobody is fully straight whatsoever, I think it may be caused by thinking about her having some spontaneous experimental experience behind my back because of how “unsure” she is about how she feels about women exactly.

 I just hate that I have such mental chatter and clutter when we talk about her questioning sexuality and I definitely get triggered by it; but wtf? My mother wound is not healed but I’m just having a hard time understanding myself with this situation."
How can I work with PTSD,16,mhsben,9,"A trigger for me is feeling like I'm going to be attacked. It's hard for me to be alone with men I don't know or be alone closing up at work. My job requires me to sometimes go to people's homes. I don't know until I get there what the people will be like (I talk to them on the phone and get a sense first, but you never know). I've showed up a couple of times to houses in which single men lived or there was supposed to be a couple and the wife was too busy to be there. If I didn't do this I'd have to be in a shop and closing up late at night alone. I stay up at night dreading work when I have one of these triggers. The benefit is this job is pretty flexible and I am able to set my schedule a lot which help deal with PTSD, but my job is also the source of a lot of triggers. Is there any way I can get through this? Getting another job right now wouldn't be a feasible option. I'm in therapy but I feel that I'm at the tip of the iceberg of recovery. I also feel like I'm letting my coworkers down because I'm not performing well when I am working. Should I talk to my boss about this? I'm a contract employee at a small business. Benefit is the boss really cares about employees, but I'm not sure how I can reconcile this."

Stalked,6,mhnc9o,6,"Hey all!

So I was stalked from the time I was 13 until I was 24 and moved away. I have no idea who the person was. He just like to watch me, he would knock on my window or throw rocks. If the window was open I would hear him breathing. A few times he came into the house, once when I was home and in the shower but I only heard him I didn't see him. I'm fairly certain he used to steal my underwear and hair brushes as those things were always going missing. So now it's been 10 years since it's stopped and I'm still terrified. Especially at night and when I'm alone. I feel exhausted. I'm mad and upset at a person out there who I don't even know for doing this to me. Everyone acts like I should just get over it and like I'm being dramatic for still having fear. Idk what to do, I know it's a long shot but has a anyone else experienced something similar? If so, what did you do to feel more secure and to feel safe again? Thanks for reading 😊"

Not sure if this therapist is the right one for me?,16,mhi0sw,6,"I feel pretty confused and lost after my meeting with my therapist today. I started therapy last September because I lost my partner last May and I was in such a bad state that I thought I'd need to do something and seek professional help. 

It's not my first therapy, I had two before because of anxiety disorder and depression. Now this therapist diagnosed me with PTSD. I was sexually abused as a child and lost already three of my closest family members, so the loss of my partner triggered the worst of the worst in me. 

Today for the first time I wanted to talk about my childhood abuse and my therapist just told me I was very past focused mentally and canceled this topic. Another time when I wanted to talk about my grief he told me to look to my past and try to find out where I felt similar when I was younger. 

I just find this so confusing. It's the second time I try to open up to a therapist (didn't talk about the abuse in my first therapy) but it seems like this topic gets avoided. I brought this topic up today because I had a dream of the person who abused me three nights ago and this lead me to experience flashbacks and sleepless nights afterwards. I'm also feeling quite tired honestly on the thought of fighting to get heard by a therapist when it's already very hard to talk about this to anyone at all and I'm just not sure what to do now. I'd appreciate any advice."
"Non-con fantasies after assault (TW: SA, kink, self hate)",6,mhgacu,4,"I know that some survivors feel ptsd, some feel hypersexual compulsions, and many people feel both. I'm kind of headed that route.

I'm actually less kinky and sexual now then I've ever been though.  I was sexually active a lot after some sexual assaults I'd experienced as a child growing up.  I was down to explore things but ""rapeplay"" was a hard boundary I couldn't cross.  Anything too close to it would upset me.  I was into playful wrestling, pain, and consenting power struggle play -  not rape play.  Ever.  It made me sick

That changed when I was violently raped walking home.  Sexual interest has become more vanilla and gentle in the kind of things I like now.  More than ever I want validation, eye contact, body being worshipped - romantic sex.  Kink has lost most interest for me and my pain tolerance dropped dramatically due to ptsd causing me a LOT of health issues.  I am preferring the more romantic and gentle parts of sex now more than ever.  My partner has depression and my other two partners are separate from me due to Covid so I barely have it anymore, 

BUT this doesn't apply to porn.  I almost only get off to rape porn now.  And get turned off when she is written to start liking it at some point.  I only get off if it to be violent throughout.  And I'm not even fully comprehending it when I'm reading the hentai or watching the gruesome scenes.  I'm not imagining what happened to me or even what is happening in front of me.  Just numbly getting off with no thoughts during at all.  Just numbness and disassociation from every feeling except barely registering the porn itself and how my vag feels.  If I feel anything during it is usually disgust.  Sometimes anger if something shitty is said toward the victim in the work (which is ridiculous all things considered) or if I DO think about feelings of my own attack it is the fear and pain (when that happens I get teary eyed while I get off).

I have no interest in playing out the fantasy with anyone though.  Even some kink has become off limits now that I used to like.  So exploring this more physically isn't an interest for me.

I feel gross.  I KNOW this is normal.  I logically do.  But I still don't even feel right bringing it up to my therapist yet since I don't even know how to begin to answer her questions on how I feel about it or during.  It is numb.  It makes no sense.  It isn't like when I used to get off to old memories with former flames or imagining the exciting first times with my partners.  These ""fantasies"" are just how I masturbate now.  It has become a physical need and a chore instead of an enjoyable stress relief like masturbation used to be for me.  One more thing that bastard took from me that night.

And on top of it all I barely like touching my genitals anymore since I feel ugly to myself now so it is back to wrapping my legs around one another and doing a humping motion to get off like I did when I was like 8 or some shit.  It feels silly and Ii fucking hate myself"
What breathing technique works better for you?,2,mhg1l4,3,"Hi, breathing techniques just seem to make me more anxious (aware of my body and anxiety that is running through it) but everybody keeps telling me to do them. What works for you?"
Explaining your triggers after you've already blown up at someone.,6,mhf67v,7,"Hi everyone, 

I had a fight with my bf last week where I got triggered and attacked him verbally. We've only been dating for seven months. It was our first real argument I was drunk and waaaaay out of line. I had a hard month and I was coping by drinking and hiding that from everyone else (I know, if I drink when I'm sad, I'm gonna have a bad time) I didn't disclose that I was in a lot of pain and I was just trying to make everything perfect  and easy for him and I denied my own needs and feelings in order to do that. We hadn't spoken about triggers or what it looks like when I'm triggered and I'm sure it freaked him out a lot. He still hasn't spoken to me after the fact but I'm hoping he will. 

How have you talked to your SO about your triggers and how you behave when you're triggered? I don't want to seem like I'm excusing my behaviour, I very much take responsibility but I think it would be helpful for him to know that the response was a trigger response and that is why I was so forceful and mean. Then he would know that it wasn't his fault and that I wasn't trying to hurt him. 

It was a big wakeup call for me too. I stopped drinking the next day and immediately started reaching out to friends and family again. The shame I was feeling about things before when I was hiding it is what caused me to stay silent and then blow up in the first place and I'm trying to be less ashamed and more honest about the many dark spots inside. It's fucking hard though. 

So I guess the advice I want is how to navigate this convo with my bf without coming across as making excuses for myself or making him feel bad for saying the thing that triggered me. It is my fault because he didn't know that might happen and I want to convey that."

I feel like my life is falling apart and I really need help,7,mhc41u,0,"Hi

Before I start I want to say I see two therapists, and starting group therapy soon. It doesn’t seem to help but I am still sticking with it because it’s better than nothing.

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. I had a lot of child trauma (TW)- sexual abuse for 5+ years at a very young age, messy parents divorce and a mentally ill parent, extensive bullying and an eating disorder. 

My problem now is how hard it is to let go of people. I was going through a messy break up and started clinging to my ex boyfriend from high school. Then, the boy I recently broke up with started to “get better” and wants me back and is being nice again. My problem is that neither of them will stay in my life if the other is there. I know it sounds simple to say “just be single and focus on yourself” but I physically do not know how to do that. Any chance to have physical comfort from either I will and do take and I’m lying because I don’t want to lose either of them.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I don’t know how to take care of myself and I’m terrified from the second I wake up in the morning to when I go to sleep. I’m doing therapy and on antidepressants I just don’t know how to let go of either person it’s unimaginable pain to think of losing someone or not having access to someone.

What should I be doing? I feel like I’ve never been in such turmoil or pain. I’m disoriented all the time, stressed, sad and I can’t take being alone. I don’t know what to do and I really really need help"

I don’t feel ok,6,mhbc78,2,"I got physically assaulted last summer.  They tried to rob me which was why they attacked me, but I started screaming for help and eventually as more people came out to help me, the guys who tried to rob me left in their stolen getaway car. They threw me on the ground and everything.  I was so scared they were going to get my house keys and go to my home since they would know my address and now have access so I held onto my purse and phone and  and luckily they didn’t take anything.  But I have never been physically assaulted like that in my life. My arm was badly bruised. They attacked me on a busy street in the middle of the day.  They were really really bold. 

Fast forward to now.  My friends think I have ptsd.  I dunno. I’m scared of everyone and extra jumpy and easily startled.  I jumped at my own shadow the other night. I’m super alert of my environment.  Any group of people, I get anxious around even if it’s out in broad daylight.  I can’t sleep through the night, I’m constantly waking up or I go to bed so late cuz I can’t fall asleep so I’m always tired. I have nightmares frequently. At least 3-4 times a week. I’m scared to leave my apartment sometimes. My stress and anxiety is really bad. 

I went from feeling safe to suddenly not and still not.  I don’t have a sense of safety anymore.

I started talk therapy last summer after my assault but I dunno, I feel like it’s not helping, at all.  According to my friends and boyfriend, I overreact to small things.  I saw a car the other night in front of my house 5 am, driving slowly, stopping in the middle of the street, reversing slowly, stopping for a few mins as though waiting for someone, driving forward, waiting, reversing, waiting, for ten mins up and down the street.  I tried to take a photo of the car in case any crime happened, but my dumb flash was on and I panicked since I was at the window and then I spent all early morning in bed anxious about whoever was in the car and how they’re coming back to hurt me. I know it sounds dumb, even as I’m typing this but I dunno, in that moment, I was in distress.  I’m sure most normal people would have just gone back to bed and not think anything, but because of my thoughts and feelings, they think I have ptsd.  

But my boyfriend thinks I can just snap out of it.  No one seems to understand and then I just sound crazy.  My therapist has been on vacation so I haven’t brought this up to her yet but like I said, I really don’t feel like it’s helping me at all. Sometimes our conversations are just me talking and her agreeing with me and then that’s it.  Like ok, I need something more like homework or something to work on"
"Starting Zoloft, and taking a sedative for anxiety and dissociation",1,mh9swd,6,"I just saw this psychiatrist for the first time. It wasn’t really what I expected, the meeting was really short and only lasted about 10 minutes. It was basically a “yeah sounds like depression and anxiety, here’s a low dosage of zoloft and a mild sedative. A nurse will check in in two weeks, and I’ll see you in three months.” I kind of expected that he would at least be a bit familiar with my file, or know about my ptsd diagnosis and problem with disassociation. I briefly described the dissociation and I don’t know if it’s my fault for not telling him enough, since I know I will need to start advocating for myself, but it just didn’t feel like he cared at all and he described it as a “could be worse, not that bad” situation. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone has had any bad or concerning experiences with taking sedatives to help with a dissociative episode... He told me i can take it up to three times a day, whenever I feel like I am going to have an attack or am too nervous to leave the house, or am scared. ...I’m just looking for some reassurance that it won’t make the dissociation worse, I suppose."

Fear of trauma therapy,5,mh617z,9,"Hello. About 2 a 3 months ago i got the diagnosis of PTSD. I’ve had it for a while now. I really want to get rid of it, but i have a big problem with opening up, about basically everything around my trauma. Also with talking about feelings. Lately i have big trouble with doing to most normal things. I was inpatient when i got the diagnoses and my therapist there said i could (and should) do intensive trauma therapy. No mention of EMDR. My biggest problem, fear for this therapy. I feel like i really cannot do this, because i have this big problem with opening up. And what if the therapy doesn’t even work?

Did anyone here ever experienced this? How did you get rid of the fear? Did you do the therapy? Did it work?

thank you for helping.

Reminders of trauma causing sleep crying and sleep talking?,96,mh5ugx,25,"I’ve had a few traumatic events in my life and over the past year.

I don’t usually talk in my sleep or cry and have had one occurrence of me hysterically laughing myself awake and one occurrence of me getting up and standing at the side of my bed while I was asleep. These are rare and happen in clusters and then disappear for months. 

Does anyone else who have experienced trauma and/or other mood disorders (I am also bipolar) experience sleep disturbances after a traumatic event or when they are reminded of these events?"
Feel like my life is in its final chapter (repost from r/depression),21,mh4my0,11,"I just don’t know anymore

I have severe clinical depression, PTSD, my kidneys are failing, and my liver is swollen; in other words, I am slowly dying very painfully. Oh and did I mention I suffer from seizures and that I have tremors that are getting worse? I can’t even take anything for the pain because I am a year clean from opiates and want to stay that way. 

I barely get out of bed nowadays, I just lay on my bed on my phone, or on my laptop. I fight feelings of suicide daily, I think about it all and how I could end my mental and physical pain; but I could never put my family through that. My best friend committed suicide, and I remember how hurt I was and how it affected his mom. The several times I have tried I got “lucky” or chickened out.

I see a psychiatrist but I am unable to tell her what most of my PTSD stems from as they were illegal and she would be required by law tell the police. Although she does help with my other issues. 

I feel worthless, I have no motivation or reason to keep living; all my closest friends are dead, I barely have any true friends now. Something has got to change. I am numb, I have been conditioned to be emotionless, but I still feel anger and sadness. I have been faking my happiness around my loved ones for so long that I no longer know which fleeting moment’s of happiness are genuine. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I went to prison for 5 years for selling 9 ounces of coke to an undercover cop in a sting operation. I did/saw things in there that no human should ever witness. It definitely added to my PTSD i have had since I was nine. I have quit selling and using drugs since but I feel like selling drugs was the only thing I was REALLY good at; and now that I have stopped it has left a hole in me. I got kicked out of my house at age 14 and selling drugs is what had supported my brother and I until 2013. I sent my brother through  medical school, paid for my mother’s cancer surgery, bought cars for my brother and I, etc. Besides fighting I feel like selling drugs is the only thing I am truly good at. Alas, I definitely don’t want to catch another case and go back to prison; and I promised my mother that I would quit and that I have done enough for her and my little brother. 

So at this point I have been out of prison for about 2 and a half years. Sometimes, I kind of wish I was still in there for the camaraderie; but then I remember how bad it was in there and change my mind. I hate myself for some of the things I had to do in there. My PTSD is so bad at this point I sleep with a knife, if I could legally own a gun I would definitely be sleeping with that as well. I constantly wake up screaming and my night terrors are so bad that at this point I try not to sleep longer than 3 or 4 hours a night.

"I can't stop dissociating, help me",10,mh24o6,5,"I can't stop. It's been like this for years but it's gotten to the point where I'm near constantly dissociated. Doing something repetitive makes it worse, I can't go on walks, etc. I just want to be one with my body again. I don't want my body to feel like an object I'm forced to care for.

What to do when society is too rude and it triggers you?,0,mh1vzo,0,"So my spouse is the one with PTSD.  And... I feel helpless.  Not because I'm unsupportive, but because society seems almost *purposefully intent* on triggering my spouse as much and as frequently as possible.

Some examples.  We go to the store, and accidentally don't realize someone's on line.  They procede to berate us, turns out they're a Karen and the situation immediately triggers my spouse by reminding them of their abusive parents.  Another example: spouse is just minding their own business at the mall food court, when a maskless person comes and stands not 10 inches away, refuses to social distance, and begins spewing insults when asked politely to step back.  Another example:  crossing the street, two cars in a row decide to turn on red while we're crossing and both miss us by inches.

All this happened in the span of one week.  One.  And my spouse is now nearly too terrified to go outside.  At all.  And it's not just this week.  It's *every* week.  It gets worse?  Of course it gets worse.  My spouse doesn't even feel safe *at home* because our landlord has made a direct request of my spouse to marry a random Pakistani guy to engage in Green Card fraud.  Doesn't matter that we have it on recording and are going to take this landlord straight to the feds for prosecution.  The problem is that the trauma is done because my spouse is a victim of relationship abuse and attempted arranged marriage.  Our landlord has done other things but I'm not gonna spend two weeks listing it all.  So my spouse is too afraid to stay at home OR go out.

What do we do?  We can't avoid existence or society forever.  The standard ""cut toxic people out"" advice can't apply here since it's apparently the entire planet.  And these things don't impact me the same since, well, I don't have PTSD.  But they *devastate* my spouse.  Every single one does.  And it makes my spouse fear that everyone is going to attack, everyone is going to betray, everyone is going to bring pain.  And I can't even say that my spouse's fears are entirely unwarranted at this point.

What do we do?  My spouse is in therapy once a month for financial reasons, and even this is a *major* improvement since historically they were terrified of therapists (Munchausen by Proxy as a child leading to abuse via therapists).  But the therapy can only help just so much.  How can I, as a spouse, show that the world might be crummy but isn't.... I don't even know how to word it?  Totally unsafe?  Worth running away from?

Sorry for the long post.  I am at a loss.  We have made so much progress, but it is lost immediately every time some bozo from Main Street decides to jab at my spouse's very fragile recovery.  I can only provide so much protection from the world, and don't know what to do."
Ex boyfriend (that I live with) is deliberately triggering my sexual abuse related PTSD (TW - sexual abuse),30,mh1l4k,8,"My boyfriend essentially coerced me into sex a few weeks ago which ended our relationship, however I’ve been unable to move out so I’m stuck in the house with him. He was very apologetic at first but has gradually turned back to his old self. He will do things like grope me when I’m not expecting it, look up my skirt, be clearly checking me out and looking at my breasts/bum and when I catch him be like ‘sorry I just can’t help but look’. Yesterday was the final straw when I asked him to stop and he said ‘it’s just that outfit on you, it’s so sexy I can’t control myself’. 

He knows I’ve been raped in the past and that I feel uncomfortable in my own skin at the best of times. He knows how this behaviour makes me feel because I’ve told him countless times and even cried in front of him. He always apologised and gives me all of the ‘I hate myself, I always ruin everything’ but it’s like a flip switches in his head when he feels turned on and he loses all respect for me and my boundaries whatsoever. 

I’m pretty sure I’m living with a dangerous man and currently can’t get out because I have very little finances and my parents aren’t the most welcoming of me. 

I’m constantly triggered and I can feel a surge of anger building inside me like I’ve never felt before. I don’t know what to do for myself or how to make this stop apart from sleeping in my car which would mean dropping out of university and leaving my job. I’m so depressed and scared and furious and lost and I wish I could just fly out of my body because I don’t feel safe in it."
Can I blame this four letter acronym for coming off as an idiot?,4,mgyx5s,2,"I'm sick of saying/typing PTSD.

He just assumed I wanted to be a housewife. I just got my first job.,51,mgy45f,19,"Early on in our relationship, he asked what my dream job was. He kind of pressured me into saying I wanted to be a housewife, and throughout our relationship, that was just what he pushed on me. That I was going to be a housewife, that I was going to sit alone in the house all day doing nothing except waiting for him to get home. All throughout the relationship, it felt like he was pushing me to be dependent on him. Well, it isn’t much, just a part time position at a camp in town, but I got my first job. He made me think I wouldn’t be able to, that I would be dependent on him forever. I feel like I’m taking a step in the right direction."
Dealing with seeing abuser.,5,mgxb1t,1," I got out of an abusive relationship two years and it took me a year to even realize that it was abusive. We still live in the same small town, and since then I have done everything I can to avoid them, they are blocked on everything and their friends are also blocked. 

I may or may not (I’m still not 100% sure it was him) saw my ex at a local restaurant and I freaked out afterwards. Now I see him everywhere, everywhere. I just want to be able to go out of my house again without seeing a white guy and think it’s my ex. And overtime I think I see him I have to try and calm my anxiety. 

I just don’t know what to do. I keep trying to talk myself down from it but it’s really hard. I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m looking into moving but that would be months away and would depends on jobs, and for the time being I don’t want to be stuck in the house more than I already am. 

I don’t want to give him the power of making me afraid to go to the grocery store, but I’m not sure how to stop that."

How to not feel resentful of your friends,59,mgw1c4,16,"Hi everyone, 
I suffer from PTSD brought on from sexual trauma, and I seem to feel resentful of my friends who haven’t experienced sexual assault. I used to force myself to be a sugar baby as a form of payback for not being a good person, and I thought I was over this stage of my life. But sometimes, I can’t help but look at my friends and feel jealous that they haven’t experienced what I have.

What is the best way to support someone with PTSD (very close relations),15,mgvwff,3,"Hi Reddit,

I am asking for some advice on how to best support someone with PTSD and high general anxiety. This person lives with me so they are with me all day (work from home due to covid).

I would like to give some details into the dynamics.

1. They easy get triggered with negative thoughts and their mood changes from happy or neutral to bitterness and resentfulness within a flash
2. Part of their resentment and PTSD is from external sources and part is from myself (failure to support them earlier). They said they can't forgive me.
2.a. They had depression in the past but now is much better (Im not a doctor so I can't say the symptoms are not present anyone only that it is much much better than before)
3. It seems that very minor issue can trigger an explosive angry reaction where all rational is thrown out of the window. I believe these minor issues triggered some resentment or past anger. As the days go by new mistakes becomes new resentment so it seems the floor under me is getting smaller and smaller. Also I feel like im walking on eggshells everyday.
4. Tensions flare almost every day or nearly everyday
5. They have hard time making decisions and ask for confirmation which takes its toll on me. I am one of the only people in their support network so sometimes it becomes overwhelming. This is especially difficult when I work from home, get distracted from work all the time. Sometimes I have to take days off to help them stabilize.

I'm looking for best advice on how to support them and what NOT to do so I don't trigger them further. I do feel like this is a low low place and i'm looking for ways to make it better."
When the traumas never stop and you never get a respite,76,mgq1w8,22,"What to do when your lifestory is too heavy to unpack? I would love to know if some of you can relate as I feel very alone in this right now.

I lived through all of the big T and little T traumas listed in the DSM-5. Even my birth was traumatic. From day one, I experienced death, violence, self harm of all kind, easting disorder, insecurity, no emotional support, sexual assault. Live threatening illness, chronic pain, sleep disorders, extreme loneliness. Loss of career. Homelesness. Mental and physical disability. Literal torture at the hands of people I trusted. Undiagnosed ADHD didn't help my self esteem.

I knew pretty early one that I needed to work on myself if I didn't want the trauma to bit me in the ass later in life. But with life going its merry way and traumas never stopping, it would always come a time when I needed to push things under the rug so i could focus on life itself. For exemple, I had to stop EMDR because it made my panic attacks and chronic pain so much worst that I couldn't work anymore and I needed the money (to get therapy...).

Every time a chronic trauma stopped, a new one would start. I am 32 years old and I can count on my hands the amount of months they wasn't a big trauma happening in my life. There was always a new thing to heal from while I hadn't fully processed the last one. It is becoming increasingly hard to talk to my therapist about one specific topic and hoping we will see the end of it.

Can you guys relate? I cannot be the only one. Did you find a solution? How do you cope? How do you keep some sort of joy in life?

I was in and out of therapy from my whole life. I took every med under the sun. I do my best, I listen to my doctors. I stay healthy as much as possible, exercice, never did drugs or gor drunk or anything like that. I try to build a support system, a better one that the one imposed to me during my childhood. 

I hope one day, it will be enough."

Here are some websites I use to avoid triggers in media,16,mgj6bl,3,"*  https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ | This website has a catalog of TV shows, movies, etc. and details whether or not it has SA in it, as well as the level of it (whether it's discussed, off-screen, on-screen, etc.) Some of the entries have spoilers in them. Oftentimes they give exact timestamps for when it takes place if it does occur in the show. The Sopranos, for example, has the episode and begin and end timestamps for when SA occurs. Sometimes they mark things as having SA in them when it isn't triggering for me personally/isn't as bad as they have it marked (I look up shows that I have watched sometimes), so they seem to err on the side of caution. An example entry would be: the climax of the movie has a man floating away on a balloon as his dog snickers gleefully.

* https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ | This is a website for parents mostly, but the way it works is they have an ""A Lot or a Little?"" section on every entry that denotes the level of violence, sex, language, drug use, etc (they also have a Positive Messages category -- like I said, it's for parents lol). One can click on each icon to see a more detailed explanation. SA is usually under ""violence"". This site is far less spoiler-heavy. An example entry would be: a man floats away in a balloon with a dog. This is far and away my favorite.

* https://www.doesthedogdie.com/ | This one has a wide variety of categories for potential triggers. It began, as the site name implies, as a place for users to say whether the dog dies in a movie, but it's since expanded to include triggers, such as SA, emetophobic triggers, arachnophobia triggers, and the like. They also have potential triggers for gender dysphoria, discrimination, and abuse. Because it is user-curated, there are a *ton* of spoilers on this website. An example entry would be: at the end of the movie, Jackson floats away in a balloon that he crafted with metal and helium, bringing along a dog he met in the second act, while the dog laughs happily."
Need coping tips,7,mgisos,3,"Ive been dealing with ptsd since childhood but only recently have been diagnosed and able to acknowledge it at 21. I've been in college for 3 years and navigating that while unknowingly navigating ptsd, so its been a slight shitshow. Eventually I've realized my biggest problem is that I get triggered, a flare up happens, and I dissociate and become dysfunctional for a time. This happens somewhat often as theres a few different events that play into my triggers, so triggers can be a bit widespread. Its incredibly frustrating and difficult because I'm an engineering double major. I went into the field knowing I had the capacity to grasp the subjects but didnt realize how bad ny mental health was, I thought I only dealt with run-of-the-mill anxiety and depression. I also live on my own with no roommates so my cost of living is bs. The system I have going right now has it so I can't make enough during the school year to pay for all my expenses, so I use tax returns (US) and summer jobs to build up my savings for the school year. Its really stressful but it's the only way I can live alone right now, which is very important to me. It will be like this for the next 9 months at least (in the middle of a lease). So I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking to get out of this. I think its 1 part wanting to vent to a group of people that might understand and 1 part looking for ways to improve my coping and general quality of life. If you read this through, thank you very much."

"Exercise, Insomnia, Aches - CPTSD and PTSD",3,mgf2w3,3,"5 years ago I was attacking the gym 5-6x a week and eating a ton and was generally happy.  

Then I began long distance training, lost weight, casually smoked marijuana, and then got slammed with a stalking incident that caused PTSD and compounded my CPTSD from childhood (shock and attachment traumas). 

I developed brain fog, GERD, insomnia, fatigue, etc.  I was trying to lift 4-6x a week to get my strength back that I lost prior to distance training and it seemed to make it worse. 

So I stopped training for a year.  The past month I began training again and made the bone head move of lifting 5x a week. The catch is my strength was coming back but knee pain and a ton of body aches most in legs and it’s seemed to cause insomnia and anxiety spikes again with some fun added in the form of hopeless despair. 

Has anyone been an athlete and experienced this? Any science to what’s happening and how to remedy ? Seems similar to overtraining syndrome but caused by mental stress as well."
Talking to my dad about my PTSD,4,mgdkkx,1,"Last night I had a bad flashback, and it made me feel really unwell and weak that I didn’t feel able to come to school today.

It’s not that I don’t want to talk to him. I do. My dad is a lovely person but I find it so difficult to tell him things. It’s extremely uncomfortable and I feel as though he wouldn’t understand. If I told him I had a flashback he would probably not realise the severity of it.

I can still visualize him dead in that room every single time I walk past it. 

My doctor responded by taking me off Xanax, saying I don’t need medicine and that I need to “deal with it” and not let it consume me. 

It’s gotten to the point where out of sheer anger and rage, I feel like going after people... this desire to cause harm to myself and others.. it’s not normal and my doctor doesn’t want to hear any of it.

Since she doesn’t believe in benzo drugs (or most drugs period) I’m stuck on lexapro, and that medicine is making me more and more irate and irritable by the day.

Is what I experience a flashback?,2,mgcb4h,2,"TW: PORNOGRAPHY DEPICTING MINORS, PANIC ATTACKS.

Hey there, folks. I’m very new to this subreddit, by only a few minutes. I’m not too familiar with ptsd, but I’ve been diagnosed with it. I would like to know if my experiences are flashbacks, and if they’re not, what they are. 


Let me explain what I saw. when I was 12, I had my first experience with Japanese porn, both in animation and in comics. Some of that came with extremely violent depictions against women, some of them my age or younger. Due to my morbid curiosity as a child, I would read or watch them. Of course, I would read things depicting people my age 98 percent of the time. The comics depicting anyone younger were viewed solely for curiosity. My memory is hazy about how I felt during the time. From what I remember, I felt nothing. When I realized what I had really been looking at that entire time, I was inconsolable. I had panic attacks almost daily, and constantly beat myself up for even looking at things like that. It was terrifying.


Now for the actual question. I sometimes remember specific comics I have seen in the past. They are very clear in my mind, almost as if I had just seen it. It almost feels like it’s behind my eyes, but I can’t really see it. I begin having a major panic attack, and I begin hyperventilating. I don’t know how long they last, but they scare me every time.

These events transpired many years ago. I’m almost 19, yet I’m still scared sometimes when I read manga. I keep feeling like I’ll turn the page and see something nobody should see. And for anyone wondering, I have never been attracted to children; I never will be. I even avoid them since they make me uncomfortable. Babies are cute and all, and toddlers can be nice, but they scream too much.


Thank you for reading. I’m so confused, and I want to figure out what these actually are."
It's just hit me how young I was during my trauma,138,mgc7dw,18,"Today is my nephew's 12th birthday. I was watching him play with his 10 year old brother and suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks that I was even younger than them when I was groomed by a paedophile.

They seemed so young and innocent playing together, it shocks and sickens me how someone could even think about taking that away from a 9yr old. I loved High School Musical. My room was pink everywhere- the walls, carpet, my bed etc. I doted on my Siamese cat, Lola. I loved my two pet rats but was allergic to them. I used to excitedly wait for my dad to get home from work so I could play on the PS3 with him. I would go for walks with my nan on the weekends along the beach, and run off and twirl towards the sea to feel free. 

Then that October I met someone on MSN who I thought was 13... and it escalated from there. My innocence was ripped away from me. From then on, all I knew was fear. Anxiety. Crying. My mum couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I kept it secret for all these years, terrified whenever the phone or doorbell rang that it was him coming to get me. To tell all my family how disgusting I am. 

It's never hit me how young I was before. This is the first time my brain has actually allowed me to think about all of this."

Never ending construction,3,mg6iky,0,"So I’m curious if anyone else lives in a state of constant actual home remodeling/construction.  I’ve been in my home 10 years and for all of those years at least 1 room hasn’t been finished and for the last 4 years I’ve been without a normal bedroom.  I’m watching Reign Over Me (probably have watched this 10 times) and just now putting together his construction of kitchen with my constant construction.  Also, my therapist mentioned that she herself has been in never-ending construction.  Is this just like a physical manifestation thing?"

Medical trauma?,3,mg5lr9,3,"I have sensory processing issues that my parents weren't aware of as a child. I was wondering if anyone here has ever experienced trauma as a result of invasive medical procedures, either in general or as a result of dissociating through the process? 

I had some absolutely insanely violent responses to shots that went well beyond fear or discomfort; multiple nurses noted never seeing anything like it. It was akin to an animal or alien going full-on apeshit over getting injected. It didn't help that they felt forced to resort to using force rather than love and distraction. I still have severe needle and injection anxiety due to the flashbacks alone. 

I also had a bladder procedure very young that I feel may have resulted in some damaging confusion around my genitalia and sexuality when I was too young to process. As a result I've nearly had a phobia of the bathroom in general, but that also ties into some other trauma I already knew about. Having multiple people operate ""down there"" under lights on a table at 4/5 years old and never feeling like you fully understood first can do some seriously weird things to your brain. 

At some point in high school I developed an aversion to dentists that lead to me completely abandoning brushing my teeth or dentists ever even crossing my mind; I'm wondering if I had a bad experience while knocked out for stuff with my braces. I had to be convinced by multiple people to get my wisdom teeth out, and it is taking an army and a half to get me to go in for a gingivitis cleaning and to brush my teeth even semi-regularly, due to a phobia of being on nitrous around people I don't know for maybe this reason and definitely other reasons. 

After college I broke my collarbone in multiple places and had to get surgery. My anesthesiologist made some highly off color sexual joke about anesthetics right before the surgery, well too late to switch doctors or something. Until recently I'd blocked the entire experience out of my memory (granted I was on a lot of pain meds because I had to wait for surgery over a weekend). I'm not saying that I know something happened to me while I was under, but having to go under after that was damaging as hell and will always make me wonder, and has produced hospital and anesthetic phobias.

I'm trying to put things together and I'm wondering if my SPD made these things extra scary for me to the point of causing traumatic attachments to certain things. I have DID and am uncovering lots of new things and alters as I start looking at things like this, my school experiences, and anything else (like car accidents) that some people consider to be ""a part of life"" but for me were just full-on mind-shatteringly awful. For example, for me it was never ""just kids being kids""-- every time a kid was mean to me it felt like a heartbreaking, traumatizing experience. I know I may be ""overly/highly sensitive,"" but I think some things that were just not ideal for others may have been actually traumatizing for me as a result, and that I'm damaging myself by pushing it aside.

idk what to title this TW: MENTION OF SUICIDE,4,mg3qsc,1,"i’ve never thought i had ptsd. and then on november i got into a car crash. quite literally changed my whole life. the paramedics told me they didn’t know how i survived 
anyways. i went down hill from there. got into alcohol and messing with my perceptions. and then unfortunately leading to multiple times of attempt of suicide 

anyways at the beginning seeing a white car coming at me would scare me. just the flutter of my heart. and getting anxious to drive with other people. and when i get comfortable driving i’ll randomly think of the crash and panic. 
last week, same day i got let out the mental hospital, i heard a car crash literally on the same street i was just at. less than a mile away. i heard the crash and that was so horrible. the sound of metal hitting metal. and screeching sound of the tires. and then finally seeing all the lights from police and ambulance. after that i was scare to drive for the night. and then today. i heard the screeching of tires close to me. and it set me off. not like physically . just internally. and yeah i don’t know if that counts as ptsd. or idk"
Follow up to previous posts,2,mg1nph,0,"So I got a new therapist and psychiatrist last week. They were pretty concerned so they had me come in at the end of the day just to make sure I'd be good for the weekend and until Wednesday, my next appointment.

It wasn't really a big therapy session just discussion. He did give me buspar, which I'm still not sure about but I know it's only been a few days. I guess I'm used to the quick acting ones that are controlled. I get it and I'm definitely not going to ask for them or even mention them because I don't want to get in trouble again. 

Hopefully things will get better. I'm still unable to stop the panic but am down to one, maybe two panic attacks a day. Sunday is going to be REALLY hard since it's Easter and a major trauma holiday for me. 

I'm not sure what to mention on Wednesday about it. Tell her I'm probably going to be miserable and be in a full blown state of panic all day? I know it's going to be awful. 

I'm excited to see her though. This will be the beginning of EDMR for me, too. I'm glad to have been encouraged, again."

New Diagnosis,15,mfzm6n,4,"Hello - I’m fairly new to using Reddit but figured this might be a good place to go. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to an abusive relationship that ended over 5 years ago. I’ve been struggling for a long time, and decided it was time for help. I didn’t think PTSD is what I had, but it’s so relieving knowing what it is so I can take the right steps to heal. 

I guess I don’t really have a question, but will likely post any I come up with here. 

I start therapy next week and I am honestly pretty nervous (a little excited too). I’m scared to relive that part of my life, but I know it has to be done. 

This seems like a very safe space to be, and I’m sure y’all will be hearing from me again.

PTSD Reassurance,1,mfxwyp,6,"Hello all,

I just realized I had PTSD and I am so happy I sought out therapy for it.   


It's been on going for 8 years and I guess I just realized I was raped on different occasions by different men. This would explain a lot of my behavior (outbursts, aggression, irritability), specifically when I am in a committed relationship. This is all so new to me in terms of a diagnosis and I suppose I am scared my current boyfriend will abandon me and run away because of my PTSD.

Tauma Bonding Dreams?,3,mfvy92,0,"I have so many trauma bonding dreams with D/s feels, why? 

All of my dreams, as long as I can remember involve bad people trying to hurt me or others. If the bad people are just hurting others, I chase them the whole dream, trying to stop them before they hurt anyone in an endless anxious cycle unless it's like most of the dreams in that situation where they thenbcome after me for ""getting in their way"". If there's something traumatic about to happen but a victim hasn't been chosen, I volunteer so no one else has to go through it. But once the bad person tries to hurt me or I volunteer and they do the bad thing, I feel super connected to them. 

It feels alot like dropping after playing with a DD where I feel like I need my top like they're my safe person and everything is OK just by them being physically present or hearing their voice. The feeling is similar. Only, I've had this stuff happen in dreams since I was a toddler (For about 25 years,  now) So why is this happening? Any thoughts?"
I think I’m experiencing PTSD?,1,mfv88a,2,"Just a trigger warning, I’m about to mention sexual abuse. 

So basically, when I was much younger I experienced sexual abuse, an older man groomed and raped me at a very young age. I did struggle mentally with it obviously, and now 7 years later I thought I was fine cause I didn’t get too triggered by the topic. But I’ve discovered recently that if a guy starts touching me I freak out. For example the other day a guy at work started poking me and mucking around and I lost my shit saying “Stop touching me!” And he didn’t realise it was serious until I stormed off crying. Everyone was pretty shocked (no one knows what I went through) and I feel as though this wasn’t a normal reaction. Am I suffering from ptsd? Should I seek help? Was this reaction very extreme?"
How do you deal with people invalidating your emotional support animal?,8,mfuhsr,3,"I know that this has been over saturated with a lot of people claiming their animals are emotional support animals so they can take them on planes or live with them, but it’s hard for me to explain to people that my dog has actually saved me a few times from self harm and suicide.
It was a long process for me to get her registered and I had to plead my case to my therapist because usually he is skeptical of giving people the ok to register their animal. 

I feel really stupid and weak when people poke fun of my need of having my dog and sometimes I wish I could be strong without her all the time. The reality is some times it’s so bad that I just need some support. Quarantine obviously has made my ptsd and depression more constant in my life. 

Does anyone have any advice or tips to just ignore these people? My therapist told me to tell them to fuck off inside my head(not out loud). 
Thanks everyone"
What is going on with me? Can anyone relate?,37,mftb5a,14,"I just feel so tired all the time. I feel like I'm just dead, dreaming, or just exists. At this point I can't even tell what's real or not. I can't even remember what happened a day ago or last night. I don't understand what's going on at this point. All I understand is to keep my siblings happy even if drains the life out of me, and to protect them from father no matter what. I don't know if this could be depression or the effects of the ptsd. I don't even have any interest in anything anymore or things I like. I find my self laughing at the worst times. My parents aren't the best people. When they get like they do when their mad or upset I laugh hysterically. I think I'm going insane.

I never like saying I need help or I'm not okay. I don't talk to people about things like this. I keep it all in. I'm scared that someone might judge me or hurt me again. I know it's dumb. I just don't know what to do. I need to stay alive for my siblings safety. I don't even know if anyone cares about me. I sound so dumb. I really sorry. I don't even know what's wrong with me.

Can trauma cause physiological trauma responses within the body?,47,mfrhkz,21,"So my dad is my traumatizer and he started beating me before I was even potty trained. I remember that because after the first beating I remember running to the bathroom and sitting on my potty chair to hide from him. The first beating he counted out to 14. He always counted our beatings. And I remember he used a thick leather strap. And I know I was quite young because my mom said I was fully out of diapers by age 3. Well as I got older I started locking myself in the bathroom, I’d even try to pee so I’d have a legitimate excuse to be in there. If I peed I wouldn’t flush I would lay down on the floor and stay there until he gave up or I fell asleep. Sometimes it would get me out of it. Sometimes he would still beat me. I did this even until I was a teen. He always laughed at me for doing it. I remember that by the time I was a preteen I actually would have to pee at the sight of his belt. Now as an adult if I feel anxious or overwhelmed I suddenly have an urge to pee. I don’t know if it’s coincidental that I just happen to have to pee very badly when I feel things are getting on top of me or if I’m quite anxious or if it’s possible to have a physiological response like that over trauma. Any insight? Ty"

I can't have sex with my partner of 3 years because of life long sexual trauma- our sex is is so inconsistent (5+ month dry spells) and I feel like I am holding them hostage and like I'm a broken failure and partner,19,mfjje0,17,"Well you guessed it- I have long history of SA and CSA  to the point that I have a severe dissociative disorder which is ruining everything for me.

*I would like to start and say:* I ***know*** this isn't my fault. I ***know*** what happened to me is not my fault and healing takes time. I would also like to note, my partner has **never not once ever** pressured me, or guilted me into trying/actually having sex, or tried to make me feel bad about this. They are more than supportive and understanding, but sadly that does not override basic human, hormonal needs.

My main issue is I feel..broken. I feel selfish and like there is nothing I can do. I am in intensive therapy- have been for years, and despite this person being the love of my life, our sex life is inconsistent. Everything they bring up how much they are hurting I feel broken.

I don't remember all of the details of all of my trauma (mostly the childhood shit) and it makes me *angry* that some asshole did something to me as a kid that I can't even remember and it is running my life. It is causing someone I love so so so much pain.

I can have sex but its usually with about a 5+month buffer in-between. Hormones exist (we are both middle age grown adults), and people need sex- my partner has been nothing but patient with me, but they have gotten to the point that they have turned *off* the wanting sex part of their brain off. They have essentially ""programmed"" their brain to not want sex because it hurts them too much. To think-that someone is reprogramming their brain for a basic human need that I am very rarely capable of giving makes me feel helpless.

We are going to try and plan nights for sex (as our therapists have suggested but we never tried) but I don't know how to not feel guilty and angry at the situation that is my life and the consequences of trauma. *And we have also tried finding them a ""sex buddy"" or being in a relationship to no avail.*

I don't remember all of the details of all of my trauma (mostly the childhood shit) and it makes me angry that some asshole did something to me as a kid that I can't even remember and it is running my life. It is causing someone I love so so so much pain. I want them to live a full, healthy, happy life because someone this age shouldn't have to put up with my shit.

TLDR; I feel like a broken human for not being able to give the most loving, supportive, understanding partner the amount of sex ( let alone any) they need. I am angry at my circumstances and feel helpless and wish this person could be with someone ""normal"""
Relationships??,7,mfhsmf,3,"So I was dumped by my ex boyfriend a few weeks ago. And I feel so used and violated. He talked so nice to me and made me feel so safe and after he got what he wanted he just dropped me. And I'm wondering, when will I get into a normal relationship? It feels like I'm stuck in this loop of mean guys or guys that I constantly sacrifice myself for and I don't get anything back in return or if I do it's more abuse. I feel like I can't trust but when I take the chance to trust I end up trusting the wrong person. I just want to have a relationship where this isn't an issue.

My worst fear came true,0,mffjoo,6,"I'm very sorry, but this is gonna be long. I just really need to get this off my chest. Please, don't read it if you're sensitive to stuff about dead bodies, death, or abuse. I don't want you to get hurt. 

I am currently 18 years old. My trauma goes back to when I didn't even know what death meant. When I was little, my grandmother used to tell me about how her relatives and people she knew died. Some of them were very disturbing. I remember feeling chilled to my bones when she told me all those stories. I didn't think that it was what caused my trauma until a few days ago. 

I remember being unable to sleep every time I saw a horror movie or something similar. I usually tossed and turned for an hour or two before I could finally fall asleep. But then it worsened as I got older. I have no clue why, but for a while, I was really into watching videos about creepy stuff like the most disturbing stories about how people were murdered. And because of that, I saw the picture of a brutally killed person that I really don't want to explain for everyone's sake. I had trouble falling asleep for months. I was shaking like a leaf every night, and I keep having flashbacks. It eventually stopped, but it was a torture. 

And then, last year, thanks to a history book, I saw even more. At least thirty bodies in a single picture. I still haven't recovered from that one. I keep seeing those people even though I don't want to. I have no control over it. 

Despite that, I started to feel much better with time. I still had some flashbacks, but I could just push them away and get some sleep. But six days ago, my worst fear became true. I saw a dead body in real life a few meters away from me. My grandmother who lived with us (and told me so much about death as a child) passed away, and my dad found her. I keep hearing him cry (she was his mom, so obviously, he cried even though he hated her for things that I'll explain below), and yell, ""Your grandmother died!"". It just keeps ringing in my head. She always woke up early in the morning, but that day, we got worried when none of us had seen her leave her bedroom. She was feeling a bit tired the day before, so my dad assumed that she was just sleeping a bit more. Still, we agreed that one of us should check on her. It was either me or him because my mom was at work and my brother was sleeping. When I heard him, I immediately ran there to give him a hug (despite not having a good relationship with him. I'm not heartless) and that was when I saw her. She didn't pass away in her sleep. She was far from peaceful. She wasn't even lying on her bed. It was a terrible sight. I didn't cry, I just felt shocked because she had good health (we'll find out later today what caused her death). I was shaking the whole day. No one expected this to happen. I had to call the ambulance, and they came, then told us that she'd been dead for about eight hours, but they couldn't take her body. We had to call her doctor, who was unavailable and arrived way after the funeral home. We were in the same house with a corpse for 15 hours. Very disturbing, and I hope that it will not happen to any of you. 

I'm not sad that she passed away, I just feel traumatized by seeing a corpse. She was my abuser. She hit me multiple times, choked me, locked me up in the house as a child, threatened me, and forced me to do things even when I begged her not to. That's why my dad hated her. We had a terrible relationship, and she suffered from dementia. Living with her felt like a never-ending nightmare. And now that she's gone, that terrible memory of seeing her body keeps haunting me. She keeps abusing me even after her death. The first two nights, I waited for the sun to rise, then I slept a little bit, about three hours in two days. I even went to a therapist who taught me a few things that could help (I can tell if you want. It was very helpful in my case). I finally slept very well last night, but now it's 4 am, and I'm feeling extremely triggered. I'll try to fall asleep again, and if it doesn't work, then I'm just gonna watch a movie for children and wait for the sun to rise. 

I'm not going to her funeral because my dad doesn't want me to get even more traumatized (which I really appreciate. Thanks, dad.) My parents always tried to protect me from things related to death (never took me to funerals, only to the important ones like my grandpa's, great-grandma's, and my classmate's mom's), and I avoided it as much as I could, but it seems like fate is playing a dirty game with me. 

I hope you all can sleep, tho."
does anyone else here who had their traumas as a teen/adult feel like they're kinda back in time or feel like they're the age of their traumas at times (not talking about flashbacks)?,146,mfe7tv,30,"I've noticed really recently that I do that sometimes and it kinda scares me.

 like sometimes I will be confused about the year for ex, like I won't fully believe its 2021, I'll feel like it's the year of my worst trauma. as in I'll feel like it's not possible for the current year to what it is bc in my mind there's still a few years between *now*  & 2021 while also knowing it is 2021. Its like I'm simultaneously back then & in the present. sometimes I'll even accidently put that year in dates. 

I also feel the same for my age at times, like I'll know how old I really am but I also feel viscerally like I'm the age of one of my traumas and my current age is so old and far away, and that it's impossible I'm that age bc k still have a couple years before I'd be that age. like I really feel like I'm split. 

other times I'll completely act & think for a few minutes or a few seconds like how I did at those ages. it's super visceral and freaks me out so much. or I'll even think or very strongly feel like I'm those ages (still with awareness mostly that I'm not. but sometimes there's no awareness for a few seconds.. )"
I was just diagnosed with ptsd,6,mfe253,3,"Hi! I’m a 17 year old woman and I was just diagnosed with ptsd.

Is this trauma?,8,mfcqe1,2,"12 June 2018: I was 11 years old. That morning I had a seizure. I wasn't conscious while it happened and only remembered before and after but my dad is the one that saw it all. I went to the doctors and they couldn't find a reason why and said 'it's is probably just a one off it can be quite common'. I had a heart test (I can't remember the exact name of it I think it was EEG or something) just to make sure everything was normal. And it was normal. After a while we just wrote it off as a one time thing. My parents were quite worried and I didn't leave their supervision for a while (school was an exception) but eventually as I got into high school I got my freedom back and started going out with my friends again. The seizure didn't really scare me that much because I believed it was a one time thing and i would be fine.

Late October/early November 2019: I was 12 years old and on holiday in Fuerteventura. The last day of the holiday I woke up and my dad told me I had another seizure. This time it was worse because after the seizure I couldn't breath properly and my dad had to breath air into my mouth. It kind of affected me a lot more because we still couldn't find out what it was and I was scared it was going to keep happening. I had a brain test (I think it might have been an ECG but I'm not sure) and it came back normal. So because my parents didn't know the cause they started ruling out every possibility. I had to go bed at 10am every night; I had to wait 5 mi utes after I woke up to get out of bed: I had to sing when in the bath just so they knew I didn't drown (I started having showers because singing with them there made me really uncomfortable); I couldn't have coffee at least not very often; I barely got any time to hang out with my friends outside of school; my mother got an app on my phone that tells her where I am; she also got a camera in the living room and there was probably more things that I had to do but just can't remember. I felt like I had no escape or freedom for such a long time.

I'm 14 now and I have quite a bit more freedom but I'm still kind of haunted by the idea of seizures. For example, most mornings I will spend a while being scared to get out of bed in case I have another seizure, every time I go a little bit faint or dizzy I panic and even every time I just feel a little off. Sometimes I can make jokes about seizures and sometimes it doesn't bother me even when other people do. But when it's talked about in depth I can't handle it. The other day I was talking to my friend on a call and he asked me about my seizures and what actually happened because he wasn't that educated on it. At first we were making a few jokes about it, I was a bit uncomfortable but It wasn't anything too bad. Then I decided to explain the story about it and tell him how it happened and stuff. And I started okay and a little bit into the explanation I started getting a lot more uncomfortable and that was gradually growing until I was getting near the end and it was terrible I was shivering I felt like I was going to cry I was breathing heavy it was really scary. Another time that was worse than this was about a week or two ago, my mother had saw someone have a seizure in a shop and when she came home she was talking about it loads and really loudly and she kept mentioning it and she would call her friends and talk to them about it. I remember she was on the phone to her friend Ann and I was upstairs and she was downstairs and I could hear her excited lain every detail and I couldn't take it I was on my bed crying hugging my leg chewing on the duvet. I honestly couldn't compose myself. I'm even shivering now just writing about this.

I don't want to be that person that has to leave the conversation whenever someone mentions seizures. Because it's not like I can escape the word, I can't just erase it from existence I'm going to have to face it one day and I wanna be able to face it strongly and be able to feel confident talking about it.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this on I just didn't know what else I could use. Also, I'm sorry if this invalidates anyone in any way I just want to know if what I have experienced is trauma or just me overreacting about it all."
How to manage/prevent PTSD attacks?,1,mfbp9w,4,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2017 following a pretty bad car accident I was in in my freshman year of high school. For the first year after the accident, I was having chronic migraines and constant flashbacks, as well as having moments where I would randomly feel like I fell or got hit in the side, even when I was standing up straight or lying on my side. I had nightmares too, always about an accident but never the same one, and occasionally involving family members. When I got in a car I would get extremely anxious, and even had panic attacks sometimes when I felt cars were too close to us or coming too fast. The same thing happened for the first little while after I got my driving permit. After about two years I started getting it a bit under control, until I was in another accident with a really good friend of mine, this time as the driver, which added a whole other list of problems, since I started feeling guilty about the possibility of hurting her, as well as incorporating that accident into my flashbacks and dreams. After about a year from that my issues started becoming less severe and I thought I finally had a hold on it. Recently though I’ve been having issues again. Within the last 6 months I’ve had 5 pretty bad panic and anxiety attacks from close calls, two really vivid nightmares where I woke up drenched in sweat, and a few weeks ago I blew a tire on the highway and felt like I was about to have a heart attack. My flashbacks haven’t been as bad as they were in the beginning, but they’re definitely still there. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to do anything about getting this sort of stuff under control?"
Can’t laugh the way that I used to cw: sexual assault,3,mf8rfk,0,"Ever since workplace harassment which bought up memories of rape when I was younger, I can’t engage in banter the way that I used to

I don’t really know what to do"
I’m so mad at myself TW self harm,1,mf74ir,0,"I had made it six months without hurting myself and ruined that last night during a flashback. I don’t even remember doing it but it’s very obviously self inflicted and intentional.  At the same time, I am feeling better than I have in a while and I really missed the pain. Is that weird? I was really addicted to cutting for years and I want to go back and don’t at the same time. I’m also trying to figure out how/if I should tell my parents. Sorry I rambled. Any advice would be appreciated"
Biggest advocate in my support circle is ignoring me because of an argument and doesn’t seem to care how much it hurt,2,mf44az,2,"In all honesty I just need a safe space to get this off my chest. I had an argument with them it was over how they were talking about finances not about spending or lack there of just that I didn’t like that way they spoke about it like I find that make much of a difference.  They got very angry that I just wanted them to stop downplaying my roll because as many of you with PTSD know, it’s difficult and agonizingly hard to get through days sometimes so it was important that I was able to have some semblance of independently helping .That was all I asked and then I was gaslit into being told that I’m just angry and want to guilt them and hold it over their head. Wouldn’t let me finish a sentence or explain and just the more I tried to calm them down and explain that they took it wrong, the more they dug in. 

Then I was told that my anger issues and when I asked for context ‘oh well you’ve done it in the past’ and this is you looking for conflict. I started to break I was already very upset and regretted speaking up and they pushed me further and further to the point of me admitting self loathing. I was thanked for ruining their morning and they just left me there distraught, crying and trying not to disassociate. I spent the day hating myself and wishing I’d never even spoken.  
They came back at night and acted like nothing happened. No acknowledgment, no apology and even now not speaking to me and won’t acknowledge anything."
Is being diagnosed with PTSD helpful?,1,mf2gzj,3,"I know for sure that I had ptsd in my childhood. If i were to get diagnosed, what would the real world consequences be? What type of medication is offered? Is it in anyway helpful to be diagnosed?"

A while ago I did some acid for the first time I don’t remember how long ago this was as I’m terrible with dates and don’t like thinking back on the event I had a bad trip where I thought I was dead 
Every now and then I have a dreaded feeling that I’m still in that moment where I’m dying and the present such as now is my brain trying to process death and come to terms with it 
This panic attack is by far the worst I’ve had and I’m wondering if this is how ptsd starts sorry for the lack of punctuation and commas any discussion would be appreciated thanks"
My mom told me recently about something that happened in my childhood I hadn’t realized I repressed,10,mf1o0z,1,"Growing up my dad was an alcoholic and he was addicted to pills. He also has severe bipolar disorder and wasn’t treated at the time. The memories I do have are of him being really drunk and aggressive. My most clear one being him beating the ever living fuck out of me when he got home really late, drunk and I just wanted to say hi to him. 

The memory my mom told me of was when I was about 5 my dad was pointing a gun at my mother and threatened to kill her, all of us kids watching. Instead of shooting her be shot at the ceiling. I am terrified of loud noises and guns. Especially scared of gun shot type noises 

I didn’t realize it was so repressed. It’s really been messing me up since she told me of that."
I have ptsd from domestic abuse. Now I am homeless.,162,mf192c,40,"I am a 27 year old female and I was in an abusive relationship for three years. I want people to understand that the PTSD caused from my abuse was so bad that it resulted in several health issues. I was so sick that I was unable to work a job for months. I recently could not afford rent and now I am living out of my car. 

I wanted to share my story because I want to feel seen too, just as much as anyone else. Domestic abuse survivors are not taken as seriously by the judicial system and SSD, but the lasting affects of my abuse has ruined my life all the same."

I have no childhood,122,mezufh,21,"Whenever my friends tell me about something funny that happened when they were kids, or when they talk about their old friends and old hobbies, I realize I don't have any good memories from when I was around that age. Playing around, exploring my interests, being able to be naive and carefree  - I didn't get to have any of that. A lot of the time, I find myself being frustrated by children and teenagers acting like, well, KIDS. I'm angry, not at them, but at the fact that they were spared and I wasn't. Maybe that makes me selfish, but I can't help but grieve the person I could have been."
Anxiety is only a way of how your nerves system is communicating to you,1,mez9ni,1,"Hello folks today I wanna address the main reason why the majority of people experience Anxiety on a daily basis or from time to time .. what you have to know in first place is your nerves system / unconscious mind can't talk to you in English or in a clear language so that's why when you're being exposed to a trauma of an emotional pressure because of a problem or an accident, the body starts to generate Anxiety and other physical/Emotional symptoms just a way to get rid of the shock and the Emotional conflict that you faced when you had that event happened to you .. so instead of focusing on medicating your anxiety or other symptoms you should get to the cause which is gonna be stored Inside your body, I suggest that you guys start processing your berried Emotions and energy coz that's the only effective way to discharge the pressure of Emotions that keeps torturing you by experiencing a range of different symptoms such as : 

- lack of focus
- panic attacks
- insomnia
- feeling tired all the time
- failure in Relationships because you can't maintain a stable Emotional connection
- getting lost in your aggressive thoughts 

So on and so forth as I said before the symptoms are wide different but most of the time the cause is the same which is trauma. 

Hope you guys got some value from this post, if you wanna know more be free to ask :)"

I had an episode for the first time in months,3,mexm46,2,"TW 

I was triggered by a situation in which I was stranded with a nearly dead phone and no safety items (ie knife). My mom offered to call me an Uber but the thought of being alone with possibly no communication and no weapons for an hour sent me into straight panic. I collapsed and hyperventilated and when I was told this was really my only option I ran around frantically trying to find something to protect me. I was screaming. When I realized my mom would be able to track my ride I was yelling the route (I knew it by heart) over and over and said if the driver veered off the route whatsoever please do something. She’s helped me out of an episode before so she knew how to calm me and was calm herself, but the whole time I was freaking out until we found another option in which family would drive out to bring me a key at 2am. When they showed and knocked on the garage as planned I opened the garage door literally wielding a hammer ready to swing even though I knew for a fact it was them. The once confident and self sufficient woman has been absolutely destroyed (and partly rebuilt). A few months ago I was having episodes daily and have recently gotten them down to 0 within like 2 months, I’m even better than before the assault. But it just goes to show it’s a constant battle. I legitimately thought I was going to have to fight for my life if I got into that Uber. 

Anyways, thanks for letting me vent. I’ve had a rough week and damn cherry on top."
Teen years slowly beating me to my knees,6,mew9y6,3,"I really don’t want sympathy people have a lot worse problems than me but I feel like my childhood was stolen from me I never got to be a normal teen and I really wanted to vent I’ve never got to vent before :

Age 13-14 I suffered severe depression for reasons I can’t speak about but I didn’t even want to do anything I was so down I couldn’t even smile. Constant anxiety and random breakdowns.

Age 15 I got forced in gangs issues in my area as I’m not from a good town and I was forced into it. I really didn’t like it I really wanted to focus on my education but I couldn’t constantly getting kicked from school for stuff I was dragged into. And my grades fell no matter how hard I tried.

I met my Gf at 14 but at 15 we was really close she made me happy and I could open up to her. She helped me get through my problems and I slowly distanced from my old friends.


16 me and my GF had safe sex but she got pregnant we was that unlucky 1%. Her family are crazy strict and would throw her out forever I had to sort her a abortion so she didn’t end up homeless. 
The guilt was so heavy I felt like i ruined her and the babies life. Her abortion messed up we was that 1% again she stressed so much and was on medications and had a seizure. She suffered memory loss and brain damage from it and forget who I was for 2 days her memory is still recovering right now. All this while trying to focus on my exams to stay away from the streets and I feel like the one person who was there for me I destroyed her life the guilt is too much."
I don't know what to feel. CW:violence and NSFW,2,metwp3,0,"I feel numb. I feel like this shit should make me feel something, but every time I think about it, all I feel is something boiling under the surface. Like I know I feel horrible about it, but is muffled. For context, I was sent to long term residential treatment for a number of other issues, and it wasn't the best fit. I had to witness things, and experience things no one should ever have to experience. Almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day, I would be threatened, attacked, or watch someone be attacked. Every once in a those incidents would be more than just someone going off, and the staff ""taking care of it"". Sometimes they wouldn't get there in time. I would see a friend get socked in the face while sitting peacefully. I would wrestle to loosen the grip of an attacker's arms around a friends neck. I would sit and listen as window's shatter, and furniture is broken. Seeing people try to kill each other day after day, for almost two years. And sometimes they got close. And when no one else is around, it all fell on me. I can't tell you how utterly helpless I felt. I clawed and pulled, but it wasn't any use. I can't imagine what would have happened if the staff hadn't arrived in time. What would I do with myself. But this shit was a every fucking day thing. It feels so normal, but I'm so scared of being in any situation like that ever again. A girl went crazy at school a couple weeks ago and I just blanked. I spaced out, and before I released it was over. I don't know what to do."
My Dog's Barking Triggers Me,4,met6zx,2,"I will preface this with my trauma has nothing to do with dogs themselves or anything related to animals.

I have been DXd with PTSD for over a decade and have received therapy off and on (poor, sporadic health insurance access, little to no community resources at times, etc) since I was diagnosed. My PTSD continues to be disabling, unfortunately.

I have had my dog since she was a puppy. She will be 6 in April.

2 years ago I had surgery and had to leave my dog with someone. When I got her back, she was reactive and barked at everything, generally anxious, and did not respond to most commands. She is now unable to go off leash, walk in public areas, is scared of most common noises, and barks l at random times for no apparent reason. I have gotten her the best trainers I can afford and she is on meds, but experts in dog behavioral health have said they haven't seen such a severe case of anxiety in a dog, and she is probably as good as she can get at this point. She functions throughout most of her day and isn't a bite risk, but she still gets triggered by things and struggles to calm herself. 

The problem is that her barking triggers my startle response and I'm now hyper aware around things that may startle her, and around her. I know it's not her fault,but it still triggers me. For instance once time I set a book on the table and it made a weird noise and she barked in my face and then cowered and hid, and now I'm hyper vigilant about anyone setting a book down. 

When she barks suddenly, my resulting panic attack can last 1-4 hours. Sometimes she does it in the middle of the night, even just 1 sudden bark can make me spiral. It isn't a continual bark like how some dogs bark at a window, it's a couple of full volume scream like barks and then her being extremely scared/anxious.

I live in a studio, so I can't separate her from me, and I can't afford to live in a different place, and she can't do doggy daycare etc.

My partner suggested once that I rehome her, but I cried for hours thinking about it. I've worked on my startle response for so long and she's undoing every small step I make in it. And I fear that I'm making her worse, too. 

What would you do in this situation? Is anyone else triggered by this kind of thing? Were you able to fix it? My therapists said the flooding is really bad for me but I just can't imagine rehoming her. 

(Not looking for advice on dog training/vets because again I have those, lots of second opinions, she's on meds, we follow reactive dog protocols, etc.)"
"Do you think that the people who are most resistant to PTSD, are the ones who have been exposed to the most mild/moderate trauma, without having destroyed their psyches in the process?",1,mep4qd,3,"Personally, I've noticed that many people who have been scarred/overtly damaged through experiences, are people who have suddenly been placed in extremely tough situations which they previously never had any experience with.  Once, I worked under a late middle aged Russian foreman who had gone through so much shit in his life, that no matter what happened to him, he would always just say ""well, I guess it's just another day in paradise"" and pull out a flask of vodka from his pocket, take a shot, and get back to whatever he was doing.  

Back when I was teenager and my early 20s, me and my friends did all sorts of stupid stuff.  We would go swimming during wind storms in huge waves, go exploring forests during the coldest nights, got into brawls, and explored everything we could find, and saw plenty of crazy stuff.  There wasn't really any purpose behind it, we just wanted to prove ourselves, and we got injured constantly, but never seriously.  We also all worked in heavy construction, and were placed in various dangerous situations constantly, but learned to navigate through them, and utilize adrenaline to our advantage.  Ultimately, it was all stupid stuff, but I feel like doing all of it at a very young age mentally prepared me for even more situations that would come later.  For example, when I had a bunch of guys try to break into my house, I didn't freeze up, I kept a cool head, surprised them, and they all ran out asap.  When I got into a car accident (which miraculously, I got out of without a scratch, I was rear ended and then t-boned as it pushed me into incoming traffic) even a passerby who witnessed it was mildly traumatized, but I got a ride, and went to work right after.  I've been in plenty of those types of situations, and I blame my ability to keep cool on going through so much stupid shit when I was young (which, while dumb, may have been a blessing as well). I'm not saying I can't get traumatized, I certainly can, but I feel like my threshold would certainly be higher than that of people who have never faced a life/death situation, and were suddenly face to face with one without warning."
THC gummy/spouse's hurtful remarks,14,meortz,8,It's my second day eating a THC gummy to help with my C-PTSD & anxiety. l was feeling liberated of my anxiety and overall amazing until my husband very rudely commented/mocked me while eating popcorn.

Want pain,3,meo3r5,0,"TW: self harm
.
.
.
.
It's been a few weeks since I gave in to the urge to self harm. Today something happened that was really triggering and I noticed myself willingly trying to dissociate. Then I felt very childlike. I survived most of my childhood that way. I also used self-harm as a means to self-soothe. The urge came up really intense and I was able to ride the wave for a bit and try to work through what was happening. When I had just hit a low and started feeling depressed I thought I had moved on but every object I looked at had the potential to be something for self harm that I wanted to use. Benign things that I wouldn't even think about. There's a part of me that knows that if I just did it I would feel better and the intensity would stop. But I want so badly not to do it anymore. Yes, I am in therapy."
I am making a book about my PTSD,8,mems58,3,"Hi :) I’ve experienced a lot of childhood trauma and I wanted to write a book to help with my healing. I was wondering if anyone had any quotes I could include in it?
For more information, it’s about experience physical, verbal and sexual abuse by my mother"
"I feel such horrible envy towards people who had a ""normal"" adolescence & teenage life",160,mejeo5,21,"It doesn't help that I grew up in a sheltered & privileged suburb where it was assumed that bad things just didn't happen to us. No murders, no robberies, not even petty theft. It was the sort of place where kids took AP classes and went to Ivy League schools. Nobody got pregnant, or fought in the hallway, or dropped out. Most of my peers really had the ""ideal"" teenage life you see in YA books & movies like *Love, Simon,* etc.

I remember almost nothing of prom, graduation, senior year, all the milestones that mark ordinary teenage life—it all feels foggy, like it was happening to somebody else. I've left the room when my friends were chatting about their first love/first kiss/losing their virginity (which are also topics that I can't deal with), because how could I tear apart their normalcy with my own story of rape and emotional abuse in my first relationship at 15, and the broken dysfunctional relationships that followed me into adulthood? How am I supposed to talk about the parents & teachers who didn't know what was going on, the school counselor who assured me that the abuser was ""very fragile"" when I tried to tell her what happened, the friends who tried to keep their friendship with them, so that I no longer felt safe in my group? I still can't trust any authority figures or institutions today. Nobody has your interests in mind—you must fight tooth-and-nail to get what you need, and I don't have any soft or safe places to land.

I can't touch any positive YA books/movies like the aforementioned *Love, Simon* because it's too triggering to be reminded of what I missed out on, especially if they include relationships or supportive parents/friends. The last time I tried, I had these horrible vivid flashbacks that incapacitated me for the entire day. Those stories make me feel so alone, abnormal, and ashamed. I only feel less alone when I read about, like, children or teenagers who experienced fucked-up things that they bear the consequences of for the rest of their lives.

Before I was 15, I was normal. I had a good childhood. I was supposed to be an ordinary teenager who grew into a well-adjusted adult, but what happened to me then broke my life. I honestly want to scream whenever people act dismissive of stuff that happens in your teenage years—flippant statements like, ""Don't worry, you'll look back in five years and laugh!."" Life doesn't fucking work that way. For better and for worse, what happens when you're young ripples throughout the rest of your life."
Does anyone elses PTSD mainly hit at night?,29,mef59t,24,Mostly my PTSD hits when im sleeping and/or at night. It makes me cry a lot and sometimes even makes me vomit in reaction to the PTSD. But mostly in the day time im normal. It doesn't affect me at all. Does anyone else have this type of experience? The times ive smoked weed before going to bed I haven't had any symptoms so maybe it'd be good for my PTSD.
"Trying new self-care, like a massage, but I'm scared...",1,meeaec,2,"I'm a very tense person often stressed, love to weight-lift (contributing to muscle soreness), but I am trying to relax more.

I am not good with others touching me, sometimes even getting a hair cut is too close. I have struggled with complex PTSD for sometime, just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences.

Feeling numb,5,mebjys,5,"I just feel so numb right now and im kind of freaked out. Without going too much into it; this morning i went out of my way to do something nice for a person i care about and was basically rejected.

So im really hurt by the lack appreciation and i feel really dumb for even trying. At that point im really sad (like crying in the middle of the street sad). Ever since i got ptsd ive been really sensitive and gets excesivelly sad and upset about the smallest things.

But then something in my head clicked. I just thought to myself ""fuck this, im so done with this im quitting right now i dont have the energy to care anymore"" and since then i havent been able to feel a thing. Im completely numb. I can feel something heavy deep inside, like all my sadness is in there still but i cant get it out. And im a bit freaked out. Is this normal? Is it healthy? I know normally i would still be crying and sad about it. I want to cry but i cant. Im not happy im not sad i just cant feel a thing."
It’s like I’m still there,7,mealm4,0,"I just heard a song that brought me back to the traumatic event and I broke down, I’m not okay. It’s been so long since it happened but as soon as something like a song playing or seeing an image that reminds me of it, it’s like I’m still there, helpless. It  feels like it happened yesterday. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop."
PTSD and Gunfire,6,mea2jb,0,"I had a lot of shootings on my street. I was right there for two of them, only feet away. One of them, the shooter shot into a crowd. An almost mass shooting but he only injured one person. I remember  six year old girl who was under the gun as fired. She shook for about an hour afterwards. She just kept staring at me and I stayed with her. It fucked me up I think. PTSD for two. I felt this close bond with her since. She is a teen now. I think she has some major undiagnosed PTSD as well. We both freaked out a couple of summers ago when saying hi.

The other was so close I didn't see the gun and somebody had to tell me it was a shooting afterwards. Happened on my front lawn.  A couple of murders as well. I wasn't present for those though. The police policy for witnesses in reality is fuck 'em and leave for dead. Somebody was lining me up. He is now dead (murdered).

There were two I didn't see. The effect seems to have been worse. Hearing and not seeing the shooter was unnerving after the others where I saw everything.

Too many calls to 911. I cant talk on the phone now. I have to see who I am talking to. The suddenness of the phone ringing. Don't want to answer.

I seem to very sensitive to loud or certain types of noise.

I had to protect myself in the context of the neighborhood. I dont fuck around now. I think that I have been left with too much residual intensity. I am always ready. I think I scare people sometimes. I know who to move and what to do. But its so hard tempering my responses.

Grocery store line ups are something I have worked hard at.

I wish I was in the army and had the support of an organization and had some buddies who understand because they went through the same things. And an environment with discipline and order as an antidote to PTSD that military culture has embraced. I despise sloppiness.

The cops dont experience shit. I have watched them roll in and by that time, things have slowed down, but they think they're it. Their procedures are abusive and they dont give a shit.

These events had nothing to do with me. I was just a witness who was angry at his street being shot up. I told a neighbor about this and he said to me, ""if you there, it happened to you, you were effected."" Hmmm really, I thought. I tried for so long to think that nothing happened to me.

Chasing somebody with a gun is no big deal as people cant shoot behind them. You just have to worry about how you take the corners.

Then I saw the news about Parkland shooting. It triggered me. Then there were two other mass shootings as well. The news is hard to watch sometime. I unraveled.

But by the time I had figured that out I was being antagonized by my other neighbors who seemed to spot the PTSD that I hadn't recognized yet. They took advantage. Then it was too late. I moved away. Fucking pussys who hid in their apartments while shit went down, telling me how things are going to be,...

Not before I didn't leave the house for about a year.

Keep your PTSD as much of a secret as you can so as to avoid provocation.

That Marine who shot up a country bar. I had a feeling that somebody was driving him nuts just before.

I always thought about buying a gun and hunting. But now, I hate the fucking things. The noise isn't worth it. I cant watch certain films.

I remember the smoke rings from the gun and have thought about the concussive impact of the sound on the human nervous system, especially under emotional duress. I wonder if repeated exposure to gunfire causes a type of CTE. Not in me, but I think it explains a certain type of idiot out there.

Supporting someone.,7,me9oud,2,"Hi there,

I’m currently trying to support my girlfriend who is really going through a tough time right now in regards to working through trauma that she has experienced over her life time. I experience mental health issues myself, I’m trying to find a good balance between looking after me while also supporting her. I’m unsure as to how to support her as best as possible. She doesn’t have a great support network at home with her family, I don’t feel as if she is safe there which in turn causes me to stress out a lot. I hope that after her current in patient stay that she will engage more in therapy to unravel some of the trauma that she’s been exposed to. I know it’s going to be a long road and that she will eventually come out the other side. I just want to know if anyone has any tips on how to support someone while also supporting yourself?"

"I don't understand grounding, and doing it makes me feel less grounded. What am I doing wrong?",4,me84b0,7,"My therapist is trying to help me work on grounding skills, but I don't get it. I'm very aware of where I am and whats around me, but when I try these relaxation and grounding skills I feel less connected and it makes me panic like I'm loosing control of what's around me. I don't understand how this is supposed to help."
I Feel like I'm tripping and insane,2,me6arw,2,"Sometimes the event never happened, sometimes the event did happen but he's \~TRIGGER WARNING\~ not dead, or he's dead but he's here in spirit so I keep talking to him, or he never existed and that's why I'm still living in my hometown right now, or it's 2009 and everything up to 2020 was a dream cause it's still 2009, few days ago I was a preteen again. 

I went to go get some hotwings at a arcade/pizza place and when I was in the arcade all the arcade started morphing into the arcade my dead loved one and I frequented...UH OH!!! And I just started SPRINTING out of the place, almost pushed this lady over she wouldn't freaking move. When I came back for my hotwings after hugging some rocks I found, everyone was looking at me weird.

I drove past a trigger and just started screaming and had to pull over the car. Was so panicked and worked up I fainted on the steering wheel.

I went home and my mom said my name to me and I was SO CONFUSED. Who is that? Is that me? What is she talking about? Is that really my mom? What is this place? I wandered into the backyard and curled up in the dirt near some rocks to ground myself. Cause that's what I do now, I run and I find rocks and I curl up in them to try to ground myself.

Today I was so exhausted from not sleeping the day before and the CONSTANT trauma response. You guys ever feel like you're in Flight mode but for THE WHOLE DAY? I'm safe and cozy in bed yet my body aches, chest pains, headache, SO TIRED I couldn't keep my eyes open even though I just had the 8 hours of sleep."
Why do I feel like people dont value me if they want sex?,23,me64r7,11,"I have been diagnosed with complex ptsd and I feel as though this is related to it.. as soon as someone gives off the vibe they want to have sex with me instantly I feel as though they want to use me and that my feelings don't matter. This is regardless of whether I wanted to sleep with them too or not.

What could be going on here??"
I need help.,1,me4ddr,2,"I’m posting this because I think I have PTSD caused by being cheated on by my long term partner. I want to move on so badly, its been 2 years and but it still feels fresh, I have nightmares about them cheating, I am constantly scanning for threats in our relationship and I don’t have anyone else that I can currently talk to about it. If anyone has any tips on how to manage the symptoms or wants to talk to help distract me I will happily talk about anything. It would mean so much to me right now."
Car anxiety,1,me352l,2,"So I need to make a quick disclaimer here. This is in absolutely no way bashing my significant other and is not meant to be hurtful in any way shape or form. I am looking for genuine helpful critique and answers to my problem. 

My partner is about to be 23 years old and is still unable to drive. He saw a really bad car accident before we got together (back in 2016) where a car was t boned and the driver was killed. He was walking on the side walk a few hundred feet away when this happened. I know that he feels shameful that he isn't driving, but I feel like anytime I mention the idea of learning to drive he pushes the idea away even though he wants to learn. I feel at times I've become subconsciously resentful as I'm pretty much the person who drives him around to and from work etc. I've had to rearrange my schedule to make car pooling work since we first started dating which is going on 2 years. What I'm getting at is I want to be able to help him through this driving anxiety to help him have that independence and i'm wondering if anyone else has any sort of experience with this type of trauma and what could possibly help to get him on the road??"
Flashback 😩,7,me2jd6,3,"I just got home from my mothers. She somehow tripped stepping over a baby gate and slide on the kitchen floor, smashing her head. She has a mark on her neck and is limping a bit, but she’s fine. I made sure she was okay before I left. She laughed it off. 

I’ve been panicked ever since it happened. And that was 2 hours ago. I just realized....it is throwing my back into a flashback...seeing my mom on the floor like that...injured...all I can think of was the abuse I used to witness when I was younger (and endure, but that’s a maybe i guess). I just can’t explain it. Like, I’m certain that’s what triggered me ..."
Feeling like I'm being touched despite no one being there,2,me29xu,1,"I was molested by another student in high school 8 years ago. The person was not punished and I have not been able to move on despite how long it's been. I have thought about contacting the police but have decided not to due to lack of physical evidence. I know their name but that is all I have. 

Recently I have felt like someone has been touching me even though I'm alone and no one else is in the room. It's very discomforting and I don't know what to do about it. Any advice?"
Experienced a recent traumatic event. I don’t know what to do.,5,me29j7,2,"Yesterday I experienced an event that has really shaken me, so much so that everything I do in some way reminds me of something my “person” did to me yesterday. Even turning on the TV, driving in my car, anything I experienced with them. This was not a trauma that stemmed from a romantic relationship. It was a family member and completely out of the blue and I did what I could to try to prevent it when something happened the first time.
Anyway, I am just stuck in feeling like everything is a reminder of their house, their hobbies, likes and dislikes, eating meals...I can’t stop and I hurt badly. Nothing is working to distract me."
Support groups for recovering from PTSD from an outside experience rather than caused by codependency or relational issues?,2,mdydek,0,"I posted in AlAnon asking this which turned into an interesting discussion. 

I have ptsd from a series of traumas by someone who abused me. It was someone on the psychopath spectrum and if you have any idea what that’s like it’s basically a very complicated boils frog type of abuse. Point is, my experience was not predicated by me choosing a bad person (this is a well known and beloved “good” person and no one knows their secrets) but rather by a traumatic experience. 

So I have a great therapist but would love to have a support group for others who are navigating the symptoms of ptsd. Whereas most groups focus on recovery of codependency and attraction to abusers or combat ptsd. I just want a group to help support recovery of the weird symptoms like dissociation, jumpyness, just how your brain is after that. I think it would be helpful. 

But every time I try to join a group they try to convince me that I had some sort of codependency issue which for me isn’t the case. The groups cost money and there’s not a lot that apply to me since they are very focused on their childhoods or processing their relationships. 

Is there a type of group that could help me with the trauma symptoms? Not like cPTSD or having relational issues. Just the day to day symptoms of paralysis, feeling small, etc."
It's heavy when you can't help.,9,mdwt7o,2,"My girlfriend is at a psychitric hospital...  nearly 6 months now. I don't know what meds they give but she's worse then when she came in. And the EMDR treatment... I think those people are incapable.

She was okay, then one EMDR treatment and she was fully reliving her trauma. She couldn't even speak. The weeks are full of therapies. She doesn't get rest after the EMDR treatments every week. She barely sleeps.

Now she hit a point where she's deciding on the big descision because the fear is to great to bare and she mentally tired because of all the treatments.

And I.. I can't do a thing.. I can't hold her hand or give her a loving kiss, I can't shout to the damn people there that they are hurting and breaking my girl!!!

Just a vent post.."
Advice/Opinions,3,mdviru,2,"My therapist recommended we try EDMR therapy. I’m not sure what it is besides the details she gave me. As well as, she said it would be best if we wait until I complete my first semester of grad school due to its intensity. I’m quite nervous and just wanted to see if anyone had any thoughts on it or wanted to share any advice."
Anyone here got ptsd due to workplace trauma (harassment) or bullying.,10,mdv6ol,16,"
There are many articles out there claiming bullying and harassment if were severe or lasted long enough can lead to PTSD symptoms.

I myself experienced lots of harassment for years which I thought was very traumatic. 
and I did experienced symptoms of ptsd for years.

but sometimes I question could it be GAD (generalized anxiety disorder)
but what makes me think it is ptsd are all the many symptoms of ptsd I experienced which I know many people can’t relate to.

people invalidate harassment and bullying so much which makes me believe I’m exaggerating sometimes. I totally understand there are people out there with more sever and horrifying traumas. I don’t mean to compare my trauma to someone else’s."
Anyone else feel like something horrible happened every time the phone rings?,171,mdv1wt,32,"When my phone rings, my anxiety shoots through the roof. Especially when I’m at work. I put my location on with my immediate family so they know when I’m at work and just to text me with direct communication. I’m convinced something really bad happened to someone I love and someone is calling me to tell me. Help?"
Heart racing when I have to go to bed [TW: CSA],9,mduq97,4,"When I have to go to bed my heart begins to beat fast. I have a hard time relaxing. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest last night, I counted roughly 90 bpm or so. 

I noticed I've been avoiding bed time for as long as I can manage... I've been up late recently playing videogames or browsing Reddit to delay my bedtime. By the time I decide to head to bed, my boyfriend is usually asleep so I try to be quiet and relax best I can so I don't disturb him. Last night I couldn't even lay down long at all, I had to sit up and calm myself because I was so on edge. Eventually I did fall asleep, but it takes a long time.

When I was little I was molested by a family member at night. I have distinct, vivid memories of what happened. Smoking weed to avoid dreaming has helped, but it sometimes ends in me sobbing at the memories that play in my head because I begin to feel the emotions that I typically try to repress, then passing out from exhaustion anyway.

I don't know how to deal with the avoidance. I am non functional right now. Even typing this out is making me feel anxious. I have methods to distract myself while laying down to sleep but the whole idea of going to bed is nerve-wracking for me. I'm in therapy for my PTSD but it's hard. I am so tired."
How long does therapy for trauma last?,9,mdua8h,5,"I’d be interested to hear how many months/years it took for people to successfully complete therapy for trauma. I just started and we haven’t even began any of the trauma related work, so I’d like to know what to expect!"
"NSFW post, please read at your own discretion. My dad is in the story",10,mdu3bg,14,"Hello, 
I’m sorry I’m new to this subreddit but I wanted to ask for advice cause I don’t know who else to ask to. 
So as I marked in the title this post is gonna be nsfw, since I’m gonna talk about masturbation, sorry if it’s awkward. 
So whenever I jerk off, in the middle of it, my mind just projects my dad being molest. But like, I don’t have any actual memory of him doing awful stuff to me but still sometimes I have to stop jerking of cause I’m too disgusted. He has been inappropriate back in the years and I’m gonna list them: he was occasionally touching my butt or awkwardly caressing me. He walked in the room while I was masturbating when I was 12 and was irritated and told me to stop “ruining myself”, or when I was like, 14 he randomly told me for example that “one very erogenous part of the body is the ears” and that made me feel awkward and stuck with me, these are the only things I remember. He a lot of times has treated me like a female and not just his daughter. He is a rather old-style dad and he’s also a bit sexist. But again, these are the only things I remember. Yeah so he has been inappropriate but like, not that much to traumatize me but still, every single time I jerk off I have this OCD thing where I picture him... I can’t even say it or think about it. I’m disgusted and ashamed every time. I can’t stand when he touches me (appropriately, just in general), like I can’t hug him or even stand close to him or have a normal conversation. Is this anything related to ptsd? Or is it just me or just ocd? Is this a thing to share with a therapist? Or will it go away? What are your opinions? Thank you, I’ll probably delete this post after a while cause it really makes me uncomfortable"

Feeling Disgust??,3,mdsrpv,3,"Hi fellow survivors! I’m a 21 year old female diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, anxiety, etc. I have a symptom that’s been very difficult to describe and I’m wondering if anyone feels the same way? After I get really upset or triggered by something, or if I don’t act out on my anger, I feel absolutely disgusted. It’s not like OCD, where I feel the need to immediately clean myself or something. It’s like I physically feel disgust in my entire body. I feel... dirty? Like there’s dirt under my skin or I feel nausea, but not like I’m going to throw up. It’s so hard to explain. It almost feels as if I’ve just been raped or violated? I wonder if these feelings are related to humiliation or a trauma response. Does anyone else get this way? :("
Anyone have experience traveling with a Psychiatric Service Dog?,10,mdsjx8,8,"Hey everyone! I've been a part of this subreddit for a hot minute but this is I believe my first post. But I wanted to come to you guys to ask if any of you have a PSD for your PTSD, and if so, have you had experience traveling specifically by plane with one? The FDA just passed legislation so airlines won't accept ESAs anymore, so now I'm having to do more work to make sure my doggo is certified. 

I am a student who is planning on studying in Spain for a few weeks and I absolutely need my little man to come with me. I struggle immensely with sleeping and staying focused, and without him I don't think I can do it. My school hasn't dealt with this a huge amount and the program coordinator is a sweetheart and working with me and his colleagues to figure out how to orchestrate this, but I'm new to this and have no guidance from my school on what steps I need to take to prepare.

Causation or Correlation?,3,mdgohe,2,"TW: brief mentions of abuse

Anyone else have a really bad string of luck, and fall into this cycle of abuse by meeting new people? I was nearly assaulted at the age of 14, and about six months later later I made friends with an upperclassman (conveniently the same age as my other abuser) who slowly began to overstep boundaries to coerce a relationship, then resorted to emotional abuse via threatening his life, blaming me for his problems, and berating me for living a ""comfortable life"".

Ps, that life fell apart with a parent falling terminally ill shortly after, and he tried to rekindle relations and pull me back in, but I informed him that he couldn't guilt trip me anymore and I had responsibilities to take care of.

Meanwhile a female toxic friend was leading me on a wild goose chase, frequently ghosting me, putting us in situations where I *had* to buy things for her, and forcibly severing or damaging ties with our friends. Woohoo, I had to leave again, but that wasn't all. Then a classmate essentially attacked me for impulsively laughing at his friend suggesting that we were a thing, and started stalking me for the last few weeks of our junior year, so I had to consult teachers and counselors to ensure I never had to see him again.

Three years later and I'm sensing a pattern of always running into the most toxic people, and it's difficult to pinpoint whether it's simply coincidence or a matter of having bad taste in friends, specifically as ""damaged"", angsty, controlling and explosive people.  Is this a pretty common thing for survivors?"
I feel completely stuck and pulled in thousand directions,8,mdfvts,1,"My friend recently committed suicide. Its reminded me that though I have largely worked through the desire to end my own life I am just so sick of constantly being in emotional pain. I'm sick of constantly flirting with homelessness, I'm sick of having days where I soil myself awake and sober because I can't find the will to go to the bathroom even though theres nothing more in the world I want. I'm sick of having a day where I only spend 20% of the day being in existential turmoil and suffering being a ""good"" day. 

And I am sick of wanting to get better, to take responsibility and have ownership of my mental health and feeling like I can never gain any traction and that I have no support outside of friendly words from others. I want to get better to be better to be kinder and more capable of supporting others and contributing to my community and society in more positive impactful ways. I avoid clouding myself with substances, I don't physically self harm, but I need serious intervention in my life, I need health insurance which my mental health is a serious impedement to receiving due to its effect on my ability to work.

 I don't want to die, I don't want to take my own life, I want to live but at the same time I want to feel like I can live a life worth living which I don't think I am at the moment. I want to feel like my struggle and the faults I exhibit wouldn't only lead to me being reviled by others I get close to as being undeserving of understanding and forgiveness. I just don't know what to do or where to go, I feel like I'll never escape the gravity of my suffering."
SHOCKED at how much better things have gotten...,119,mdfpuq,27,"I can’t go back in time and say this to myself, so I’ll say it here: PTSD does not have to destroy your life.  You aren’t broken forever, and you aren’t a burden to the people who love you.  Things have the potential to get, not just better, but truly GOOD again.  
I didn’t think I could ever be ok, much less happy, after what happened to me.  I thought I would always be frightened and angry and out of control.  
I am astounded to find that I was wrong.  
I’m not an optimistic person.  I am sardonic and sarcastic and I struggled with depression before I ever encountered trauma.  I tend to roll my eyes real damn hard when people start talking about hope and light and healing.  
But, you know.  There IS hope."
I feel like my PTSD is going to start slowly ruin my life,7,mdegua,2,"Lately my best friend has been ranting to me about his relationship with his boyfriend, who’s going through a lot at the moment, and he talked to me about how his boyfriend because of this couldn’t provide as much love, as the BF’s mental health was in decline. This reminded me of my abusive ex, who did something similar to manipulate me into caring for him when in reality he was fine, which really got me scared for my friend, and I got very scared and went to his boyfriend and took out all my emotions on him. Now they’re both (understandably) angry at me and the boyfriend wants nothing to do with me and my best friend is angry at me and I just feel lost now."
A solid month into trauma anniversary and I'm over feeling my feelings,8,mdedz6,3,"I realized through some crisis therapy that I am experiencing a trauma anniversary from an ongoing traumatic experience lasting 8 months (but more like once a year for 5 years). I've had at least 1 but up to 3 full on panic attacks every day since 2/28. I've spoken to countless people. I've made another post here. I'm reaching out to all the professionals I have access to for medical help and I'm at a loss. I'm tired and in physical pain. My therapist today told me to just lay in bed and say my affirmation when it happens because I need to feel my feelings but...I'm kind of over feeling my feelings? No I do not want to hurt myself. Yes I have a prescription for an anti anxiety medication and no it does not stop my panic attacks. Neither does hydroxyzine (likely because I took benadryl from 2012 to 2020 to sleep and at one point, under dr orders). Am I unreasonable in wanting more medication or medical help? My therapist didn't really seem to think we needed to talk again soon so she scheduled me out for 2 weeks. I guess I just feel like no one really cares about my trauma or gives any cares to my current experience."
"[TW: child sexual abuse, suicide, general abuse] It's impossible. I give up.",29,mddtby,8,"I give up. I have completely given up.

A month ago I was chatting in a group with friends, generally having a good time. Out of the blue, one of them sends a video of a boy (2-3yo) being ""ground on"" by two older women followed by one of them touching his genitals. On video. As he tried to stand up and leave. 

Immediate rush of emotion. Vomiting multiple times. My friends start calling me retarded. I plunge into psychosis. Intense shaking. Hallucinating. A sudden and complete recollection of a deeply buried memory very similar to the one in the video that they thought was funny. And laughed at. And laughed at ME afterward. To this day the most I got out of them was ""sorry you threw up."" I am no longer friends with these people.

To this day, I have been treated like this. People I thought I could trust being told about my experience. ""Haha, life can be fun when that happens!"" Being told to check my testosterone because I don't feel sexually or even romantically without feeling sick or flashing back. Seeing people saying ""female pedos are queens."" 

I give up. Completely. It is impossible to live in a world like this. No matter the meds that doctors are gonna pump into me, no matter the therapy I go through, the world's perspective won't change. I will still see things like this and I will still flash back. I will still be laughed at for it and I will still be told it was a positive event. And possibly worst of all, I will always remember the event and everything surrounding it. I do not trust anybody with anything to this day. No matter what I do, how I try, or who might be there, I will always be hurt by everyone I meet. And I am not going to live in a world where it is allowed and supported. God has put me here for the sole purpose of hurting me and I am not standing for it anymore. I hate everything and everyone."
Wellness or Retreat Center for PTSD?,2,mddjn7,8,"I know this is a long shot, but I am not having any luck on my own...

Does anyone have any experience with a wellness retreat center for CPTSD? I don't want to do talk therapy or go to a traditional place. I have not had any success after years of talk therapy.

I don’t want this to become a new trigger,6,mdd8pp,2,"Hi, currently in a bit of a panic.

I went to bed and my mind started racing on my trauma with no apparent trigger, and once I started crying I became acutely aware of the fact that I was laying on my back, as I was during my traumatic event. I started thrashing around a bit to try and shake the feeling out of my body which didn’t work, so I’m currently sat bolt upright in bed scared brainless to lie back down.

Along with being super shaken up by this, I’m also really annoyed at myself that something so small as lying down effed me up so badly. I’m also annoyed that I’m annoyed at myself.

Does anyone have any advice? Is it normal to be triggered by certain body positions and if so how can I work around something as commonplace as laying down on my back?"
"I am trying to understand, please help me...?",6,md9ly5,1,"She tells me she has PTSD but is this all really possible from PTSD or could it be something else altogether?

She loves her family but also is fearful of conflict with her parents. So as much as she loves them, and is willing to do what they ask, she will go out of her way to ensure they are not angered.

This ""going out of her way"" has entered our relationship.

We started dating at 24, and now were 29.

When we started dating and still to now she needs to ask to use her parents vehicle because she still has not got one yet due to focusing on school and not work.

She has a curfew living at home, and she follows it very closely. She has never slept over at my house and any time she has been like 30 mins to an hour late her dad will blow up her phone, and yell at her for disobeying his house rules... despite her age. This has affected us because she has slept over maybe 5 times in the years together, but she has to lie and say she slept over at a friends house.

She and I lived together for 3 years during college. She made me agree to never tell her parents that we lived together and so any time I speak to them about college I had to lie. She was paranoid and worried that they would disown her because she was living in sin (catholic) since we were not married. So for 3 years, anytime they came to visit I had to move all of my stuff out, and further continue to lie.

One time her dad mentioned that I should lose weight because I look unhealthy. I shrugged it off, but what annoyed me more was that she didnt stand up for me since she was at dinner and heard that be said. Her siblings told him to cut it out and such but she didnt. She just apologized for her father and said ""thats how he is.""

She and I have sex, and she is very worried they will find out, not just like caught in the action find out, but even birth control wise. Her sister was on birth control for period pains and her mom found out and forced her to get off of it. So in the years together she and I do NO form of PDA in front of her parents.

She got a tattoo and has to wear make up to hide it for fear her parents will yell at her.

Finally, this has been a huge mental struggle of mine. I have been in therapy because of this. But she got an abortion, our contraception failed. Her fears of her parents finding out came up and she felt depressed, numb, and even suicidal. She didnt want them to find out about being pregnant out of marriage, and so she went ahead with it. She was very much against the idea but her fear of her parents outweighed her wants.

Further and sadly, she blamed me for her abortion months later. I talked with my therapist and they mentioned how she is projecting her wishes to keep our baby and since we weren't married, she blames me, despite her clear reasons being her parents.

I understand the red flags here. I do. 

But I want to understand what is going on with her. I wish she didnt have so much paranoia and didnt let her parents affect her decisions so much. 

She doesn't see how unhealthy her fear of her parents is, I brought it up once around when we had an abortion and she almost left me because it was as if she couldn't face the truth.

I've managed my BPD well after years of intense therapy and stability in life.  Three time domestic violence survivor.  Relationship with mother tarnished along the way.

First attacker was my highschool through college boyfriend.  We were pretty serious for 3 years before the attack.  He cheated on me then attacked me when we fought about it.  Married her and had two girls. We broke up shortly after my parents began their divorce after 28 years of marriage.  Just a really shitty time in my life.  Pretty traumatizing and that whole year kinda spiraled into 15 years of self destructive instability.

This morning I woke up to a message on FB from him.  He clearly wants to apologize.  I look at the calendar and tomorrow marks 5 years from my last and most traumatizing life altering attack.

So I woke up to the sound of two dogs yelping in pain from bark suppression devices.  I have two dogs that I was snuggling with and it was incredibly difficult to hear that they believe my initial complaint was a noise complaint and have chosen to further torture their dogs because I called the Humane Society.

And after four months working with the same 6 people I've now been reassigned and am floating from worksite to worksite.  So my life has kind of upended and my regular comfortable supports and distractions have now been taken from me.

I'm so shook up.  All the flashbacks.  It was suppressed pretty good for the past 6 months?  And we all know I won't be able to shut them off.

I also have to decide whether to respond or not.  Because that is going to weigh on me.  A basketball has been tossed to me and I gotta decide if I'm gonna play or if I'm going to decline the challenge and walk away.  I want and deserve an apology but he will never deserve forgiveness.  I wonder if it's completely self serving now that his kids are dating age and he knows what he did was fucking awful.  And those memories fucking flood back.  I can't forget it.  I wish I could have a lobotomy.  Forget my past completely.

Fuck PTSD.  I'm so sick and tired of living with this.  Fuck all the ones that contributed to my trauma.  Fuck em all.

I am not a native English speaker, so I tend to watch shows with English subtitles for the hard of hearing.

My Experience w/ EMDR and steps on how to do it at home,3,md325n,3,"I wanted to share a blog post I recently wrote about my experience with EMDR and an in-depth guide on how to do it at home for small ""t"" traumas. I found that out of all the trauma healing methods I tried, hypnotherapy...somatic therapy, talk therapy, this method was the only thing that actually made me take a step forward from my trauma. I felt trapped in a loop for a long time, but when I tried EMDR it sort of""opened the door"" to allow me to move on from it. I obviously think it's very beneficial to work with a therapist as they will be able to make sure you complete the process and don't get overwhelmed by the memory, but if you have some difficult memories that you can think of without completely breaking down ( I will sometimes do it on my own with memories from high school that bother me a bit still) I think this type of therapy could really help.

Has anyone abandoned themselves?,27,md15ql,20,"Sorry this is so long. 

I have severe complex ptsd from an abusive childhood, being raped by my mothers friend and resulting DUI, pregnancy and adoption at 21, trauma from a workplace incident, homelessness, multiple abusive partners, and a gun put to my head. I am terrified of people and their judgment, their intentions. I am afraid to know anyone in absolutely any capacity.  

My mother was physically abusive, yes. But emotionally... think The Still Face Experiment meets Mommy Dearest. She hated me. And she made sure I and everyone in my life knew it. She is the devil, she just doesn’t know her name. I lived with my father most of my life, but my father hated children and didn’t want any, and he also let me know. “Children are to be seen and not heard..” “Women are to be seen and not heard.”

I have had a lifetime of people telling me who I am and who I’m not. I’m not even mad, I just feel disposable. It’s deeply ingrained in me that I don’t matter. 

Studies show that so much damage can be done before you’re 3 years old. If that’s the case, then I was broken - physically and emotionally - before, during, and after I had a chance to figure out how to find myself, to socialize, to even regulate emotions. There is no pre-trauma to get myself back to. Just levels of messed up. So who the hell am I supposed to be now? 

Therapy has not worked for years now, and it has actually has gotten worse. I compartmentalize (too well), freeze and dissociate. I can’t seem to make it connect. I’m just completely indifferent to myself... like I’m working with a hollow soul. 

I’m not sure if anyone has been in this situation, but if you have, how did were you able to find yourself? How do you actually make yourself care about yourself?"
Just processed my first traumatic memory and am struggling,3,md0iud,1,"So after a year of therapy I finally started to process one of the most horrific traumatic memories. We literally covered the first few seconds of the event and how I felt. Next thing I know I'm there at that time and totally overwhelmed by extreme  bodily reactions. She bought me back to now.
 It was honestly the most strangest and scariest experiences. Like flipping from place to place in a time machine. Anywho I guess the point in this post is I'm really struggling physically I feel like I've been hit by a truck and psychologically I'm just in a head fog and not really there. I didnt sleep at all last night. I know this is supposed to be a positive thing but i feel soooooo terrible since therapy. Is this normal and how do you cope with this, and how do you make  yourself go back to therapy to do more when it makes you feel so bad?"
"My parents abused me, but I love them . Should I face them about my trauma ?",48,mcusok,12,"here is a link to my experience (first part) (also sorry for the typos)

I am 23, I am diagnosed with ADHD,PTSD, and Bipolar.

Most of the trauma and my BP trigger came form my childhood. But, I never told my parents about my diagnosis nor about how I feel. Despite everything they've done to me, I still really love them . I don't know if I should tell them because I am afraid that that might hurt them, they are old and my mum has heart problems, and I think my dad is depressed. I don't want to hurt them even more.

But, the things is they are too invoved in my life for my age, and they are very ristricting. I have found a group of friends and a life style that helps me, and I don't want to give it up. But sadly they won't aprove of it. (they are quiet religious and I am not). I am tired of living a double life.

Should I face them about my trauma and my lifestyle choice ?"

I never would do that to anyone, EVEN AT 11. I never had the urge. I was taught not to take advantage of people, especially family, and so was he. I was taught to not touch private parts, and so was he. 

People need to stop justifying my abuser. I feel sick."
Has anyone ever told you that you “manufactured” your repressed memory before?,11,mcqbaw,8,"Since I remembered my first memory while high, ten years after it happened, someone said I manufactured it in my mind. I am going through another self-doubt spiral now"
I've been exposed to death at a very young age ( very graphic NSFW ),7,mcq893,2,"Growing up my mom had dogs and my grandma had cats. I was around 6 or 7, 80 or 90 lbs when it happened, but I was home alone and the dog started fighting the cat. This dog was in kill mode and wasn't going to stop. I remember trying to stop it and screaming for help crying so much. I watched the cat die the fear in its eyes. It shit everywhere crying for help pleading for me to save it. I looked it right in its eyes when it died. It wasn't ready to die. The dog ripped its neck out. Looking back I think I made it worse. The dog probably thought the cat was attacking me or something. I don't remember to much about what happened after. I didn't get comforted, Noone told me that I was going to be OK. I can still smell the shit and the blood to this day. I watched many more cats die as i try to stop the dog. They never got rid of the dog or helped me. I shake so much when I hear dogs fight. My grandma just got a new puppy. I live with her while I'm going to high-school. so I had to deal with the new puppy. My grandma had to pretty old dogs that were on their last legs. They were very territorial over food and the puppy wasn't having it. When I say puppy it was like 7-8 months but it was still huge. They fought I had to help break up the fight and the puppy ended up killing the one of the dogs. The other older one ended up becoming the head honcho so naturally the puppy challenged and injured him to the point where he couldn't use his back legs. We had to uthnize the old dog, but for some reason we kept the puppy. Thit isn't the only source of trauma but it is a big one. I just needed to vent about I."

Advice on supporting my new husband?,16,mckmke,23,"
Hello everyone. I got married almost a month ago, my husband has PTSD from military service as a corpsman imbedded with a group of marines. He hasn’t shared much and I don’t ask. He has some quirks that I’m familiar with from my fathers PTSD from Vietnam. Viewing entrances/exits in restaurants with back against the wall, anxious about new environments and new people, keenly observant at all times. Generalized anxiety, though some of that is just him not necessarily related to his diagnosis. Looking for advice when or if he gets triggered and I’m there. I’m familiar with de escalation tactics like staying calm and addressing immediate problems to attempt a resolution. I just want to know how to support him effectively and make sure he feels heard and seen. Please note we got married quickly, thus the questions. No major symptoms have presented yet but I want to know some tips on supporting him when it occurs."
I (24M) was a hooker when I was a teenager,107,mcfm05,24,"It's just something that got brought up at one point in my therapy and it's been bothering me ever since. I remembered that, of course, i just chose not to think about it, almost as if in denial. 

I might've been like 14 or 15 at the time. I'm not even sure if it counts as abuse since I chose to do that. And the reason I did it was that I needed money. And attention. And apparently hypersexuality is a symptom of repressed trauma.


Now, I don't mean to be disrespectful to sex workers. But all I associate when I think about being one is my disgust with myself. And feeling so dirty. But hey, I can't blame anyone but myself and I know that. I wish I knew it at the time but the things I used the money for: those ballet lessons and the food that made me bulimic, they really weren't worth it. And I really wish I could turn back time because it just makes me feel like I'm broken beyond repair."
How do I stop being hostile to other people?,3,mcfkx0,9,"Basically, I was abused in the past and it is hindering my view of other people a lot. I see them as all evil or cowards. I feel like they owe me mountains of gold for all the hurt which happened to me.

I'm stuck in a situation where I want to love other people but I am afraid to be hurt again. I'm stuck between wanting to give, and needing to receive. 

I just want a clean sweep, and have a mind full of love, but I am aware that scars cannot be washed away with just one wave. I don't have friends because I either push them away or lock my heart to everyone. 

I know that I have anger and bitterness inside of me, but it just sucks to be misunderstood. To be called nutty, a bad person, because you're scared to be hurt again.

When these aggressive episodes happen, I am genuinely terrified. I turn into a screaming child needing help and other people don't understand because they are not used to it. I need people to hug me, to comfort me, and it makes me even more aggressive that other people start to call me crazy or a troll. 

I am in genuine distress during these episodes, and it's like other people see me as being hostile, but I don't have logic in these situations, I am just totally afraid. 

Any tips?"

Sharing my experience for anybody dealing with suicidal thouaghts:,9,mc2uyq,2,"I know this is long but I lived through so much in my short little life, and I thought I'll share my expeirience.

I'm 23 btw , I had ups and downs in my life but I don't think I'll make it to my 40's. I don't even know if I want to. I think of suicide very often, I lived through 3 suicide attempts one of them made me hospitilised (the 1st at 16 and two at 20).

I have child PTSD. My parents fucked me up too much:

They physically abused me :They hit me often leaving bruises and (they even kicked me when laying on the floor). and my mum chocked me sometimes with her robe's belt or with her hands.  I remember my dad telling my mum to ""hit anywhere but the face, because people can see the marks"". My mum even poured hot spagetti water at me when I was around 14-15  (I started working out and I was taking pictures to track my progress my mum thought I was sending ppl ""revealing pictures""  :D). When I was around 4 -5 she grabed me by my ankles and dangeled me head down from our 4th floor-appartment's balcony, because I had a dispute with my older sister ( n I should've only obey my sister and respect her cause she was older than me).

They emotionaly abused me: Whenever I cried as a child my mum would hit me because ""my tears bring bad luck"".Till my late teens they wouldn't allow me to vist friends, let my friends visit me, or let me go anywhere with my friends, because it's  a waste of time and I should be studying. As a teen my parents ""nicknamed"" me the HOE because I wasn't relgious enough for their own taste. My mum always told me that since I was born her life went downhill and she regrets having me. My parents faught often, and I remember one time my mum filled up a glass with the dish water ( it contains dish soap and bleach) and thretened my dad to drink it, while me and my sister were watching.

They neglected me: my father was always on his computer always absent. My parents work 8 to 5 and my sister also studied on the afternoon, and I as said I wasn't allowed to hang out with friends, so till I started middle school, I spent around 5 hours daily alone.

I ended up developing child PTSD and Bipolar :3 (my sister wasn't as abused as was but she also had her fair share and ended up having anxiety disorder and having dependacy issues or sth she's nearly 30 and can't do anything by her self like go shopping or go to the doctor, etc...)

I also live in a 3rd world country ,where harrasing women is ""normal"" and the woman is viewed at fault cause ""she is wearing inappropriate clothes"" (whatever that is). I survived a rape attempt ( about last year) and actually got raped on the second one about 3 weeks ago : I was drunk and sleeping, I woke up at him taking off my cloths, I ordered my body to move or scream or to say something, but I couldn't I just layed there, he raped me and all I could do is cry and all I think about is that this is all I am good for a hole to fuck (I know I am worth so much more <3), he finished on my chest, he wiped off his cum and left the room. I don't know if he said anything, I didn't hear. I didn't feel physical pain, I didn't physicaly feel anythning. I wasn't in my body. I felt like a toilet and toilet don't feel (he used me cleaned me and left like a toilet you use it, flush and leave). There are no signs of resistance (cause I didn't move) I wasn't a vegin to start with. I had no proof so in my crappy country I can't do anything about it  (cause middle east yey!! I might even get shamed for it).

But I'm still very much alive though because First,at 14 I met a girl who told me that all of this is fucked up and not normal and told me to dare disobey my parents even if they will hit me, and face them. She is my best friend and my baby <3

And at 22 I finaly seeked professional help. Finaly got diagnosed, which helped understand myself better and helped me accept myself.

I came to understand that suicide is just me not thinking streight. There is one thing that helps me whenever I'm too down, it helps think streigth and clear. It's a book, and saved my life way too many times. It's the myth of Sysiphus by Albert Camus. Please make the effort to read the first few chapters at least. I swear it's great.

"" There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. ""

\-Albert Camus-

Another thing that helped me a lot, is that I stopped living to acheive something or to become something or someone and started living for pure curiosity.

And lastly : ""Maple leaf falling down facing front facing back"" -Ryokan- like a falling maple leaf, life follows a pattern. No matter how much a maple leaf want to fall at a diffrent spot, it will always fall in its destined place in the pattern. The leaf is fallig so it might as well enjoy its fall. In a less romticised way (if you are more into science n stuff) always remember ""\[According to the theory of spacetime\]The future already exists, the past is still happenning"" - Rudy Rucker- . So don't think much about it. Somewhere in a distant start you are already older, whatever what you are going through in a distant star it is over, in another one you are already dead.

With BP,  I know that depression is chronic and is comming. But still good days too will come and no matter how few, they are worth it.

Seek help, Talk about your problems, stay curious, learn as much as you can,read as much as you can ( It rally helps), don't think about the distant future, live for yourself and for your own good and remember that YOU ARE THE CENTER OF YOUR LIFE, and in your own life the only thing that truly matters is your own good."
Title,2,mbzz9b,2,"*Excuse my grammar, English is not my first language.*

I'm a teen writer currently working on a romance/tragedy novel. And one of my characters, Albert, is diagnosed with PTSD. I wouldn't normally ask for something like this but since I don't want to disrespect people that are struggling with traumas, I need to learn more about PTSD. So I want everything to be realistic and not like just how I imagine you people. I need someone to help me understand how it really works. I might ask questions like ""if blah blah blah happened, do you think it would do blah blah effect?"" 

I don't want to trigger anyone or make them feel unsafe so only dm me if you're ok with talking about such things. I'll try to avoid asking personal questions. It's ok if you want to leave in the middle of a talk. It's also okay if you don't want to answer any question in that moment. Is there anyone willing to help me understand it better?

Relationship help,7,mbzdl1,2,"———TW SEXUAL ASSAULT MENTION———


Hi everyone. This is my first time posting to this sub and I’m a little nervous. But here it goes. 

I 25f have been in a relationship with my girlfriend 27f for 8 years. We met on Twitter and fell in love and we’ve been living together for about 6 years. She’s amazing. Kind, funny, optimistic, empathetic. Just everything you’d want to find in a partner. 

But our relationship has always been a little weird because of me and my trauma. I was sexually assaulted about 2 years before I met her and it has caused a lot of sexual difficulties for me. I don’t really like to be touched. Even though I want it from her, my brain just never lets me get there. We’ve never had sex. We just had our first kiss 6 months ago....7 years into our relationship. Even though I’ve wanted to kiss her from the moment I met her. I just always second guess myself and it turns into self hatred because I know she deserves someone who can not freak out when they touch her. And I know it hurts her even though she tells me it doesn’t. We’re unbelievably close in every other way than sexually or intimately. And I want that. I just don’t know how. And it hurts. 

I’ve been in therapy for years but I just can’t bring myself to bring it up and face it. I know I need to for myself and for my relationship but I can’t stop myself from avoiding it. 

She’s the love of my life. We’ve been through so much together and I can’t imagine my life without her. If anyone has delt with something similar I would love to hear from you. Xx"

My geometry teacher was the main reason I see myself as a good-for-nothing bitch and have traumatic flashbacks whenever I'm reminded of something familiar,0,mbvsbz,0,"When I was a junior in high school, I had the worst teacher I've ever witnessed (I'm not going to tell you his name so I won't be sued). He was a math teacher from what I remembered. I had him the year before and he wasn't too bad. The next year, I realized his true colors. He acted like some smartass know-it-all like he expected us to know shit and calls us students morons whenever we do something not good, especially me because I was the worst performing student in his class (there were only five of us). Everyone else got A's and B's, while I got D's and F's, and I always got grounded for bad grades. What's worse is he would usually get off-topic with almost everything ranging from how all modern cartoons suck ass to fucking Bob Ross! It doesn't even help that the other students also want to get off-topic, and I'm the only one who wants to get my fucking work done! What's worse is that he adds the most stupidest questions on our quizzes like what year did the Rick Roll song come out! I tried to cheat my way out of one of them and I ended up getting a zero, sent to the principal's office, and got grounded forever! And everyone told me I deserved it. And I was in a Christian school. If you tell your successes to him, he'll be like ""whatever..."", but when you dare to tell your failures to him, he'll laugh at your face and respond to how dumb you look. Whenever he has an opinion, he will shove it down your throat and force you to like/hate X or else you're a loser. If you try to counterpoint a flaw in one thing he likes, guess what? He instantly makes a comeback with how stupid you are into hating/liking a show/movie he likes/hates. Only he gets the right to have an opinion while everyone else doesn't!

He acts like he knows everything and when any of us students try to counterpoint his perspective, he would tell us how stupid we are. For example, when he said that voice actors for the Powerpuff Girls were 12-year old girls. I tried to tell him that they were voiced by adults back in the 90s, but he kept saying ""they're adults now"". I'll have you know that I watched this show a lot as a kid and I knew they were voiced by adult females back in 1998, 20s and 30s respectively around that time! Also, how the fuck would E.G. Daily gain talent that easily as a five year old voicing Tommy Pickles from Rugrats?! That's not how voice acting works! Sure, maybe they were voiced by kids in international dubs, but if you're referring to the English version, no, that's not true. Mind you, my teacher was born in 1990, he actually grew up watching that show enough to know what the characters' voices sound like. It's one thing when you haven't watched the show and don't have a clue how old the actors are, but it's another when you watch the show pretty much your whole life and decide to think the actor was a child when it wasn't logically possible.

It has been several years already and I still get horrible flashbacks of that horrible man. He was the main reason I fucking hated Bob Ross (and I'm glad he's dead) and that Rick Roll song. He was the main reason I have traumatic flashbacks every night. He was the main reason I despised math. He was the main reason I act so pessimistic and see myself as a good-for-nothing bitch. Sometimes I wondered why he never got fired in the first place.

Edit: I'm having to post somewhere else because I got a lot of hate in my previous one. Also, keep in mind this is all my opinion. I don't want anyone calling me a cunt (or any other insult) like they did on the last one, or else you will be reported."

Write about PTSD in Paramedics."" Big mistake. I'm 2 days into writing and I feel like I've been gut punched. I guess that coupled with the recent mass shootings (considering I've run more than a few shootings like this) dredged some things up.

Christians, my dad was the pastor. And the man who did it was an “uncle” in the church. They were upset when I told them what was happening. Confused. It couldn’t be true, I was making it up wasn’t I? And then I was confused. Because the uncle had said it was a pretend game, we were pretending to be a husband and wife. So maybe it didn’t happen? That’s what pretend meant right? I was pretending. It was okay to pretend, my parents said, but don’t say lies for attention. I was still confused about pretending being lies but I cried and said sorry, and they forgave me.

The abuse continued until my kindergarten teacher caught me trying to teach two other kids in the class how to play that pretend game. I remember my mom had to come in for a teacher meeting with her. As they talked about it, my mom looked at me with tears in her eyes, ashamed. I thought she was ashamed of me; ashamed that I had played that game. It was a bad game. I hadn’t known. I had thought it was pretend. I didn’t mean to be a liar, to be a bad person. 

My parents were upset and started praying all the time. Then my siblings got mad at me because dad and mom were making us spend all of our time in prayer because I was crying all the time. I had to stop crying, they said. I wasn’t a baby anymore. And I did. Because it was pretend. It didn’t really happen to me. It was just my shell. When it would happen, I would turn my head to the side and stare at the bookcase by the wall and pretend that I was tiny, small enough to open a magic door hidden in the bookcase. And inside, no one could touch me, no one could find me. It was my secret place, that no one could hurt me in, and I could stay as long as it hurt, as long as I wanted to. And when I came back, the pretending was over and it hadn’t happened, it didn’t bother me. 

I would escape that way a lot over the next few years. In church, when I didn’t want to hear the words condemning me to hell. At home, when my parents yelled at me for not paying attention and day dreaming. The days went by easily, but I was terrified of the night. The night brought nightmares and I would cry and scream. Loudly at first. My parents came to me the first few nights and held me. Then they grew tired of that. I started going to their room at night, but they soon grew tired of that too. Then, so I didn’t make anyone upset, I perfectly crying silently. I wouldn’t sniffle or they would hear it. I would let the snot cover my nose and hold my breath and I hope I wouldn’t wake up in the morning and have to do it again the next night.


Eventually the memories became stories. But a bad story. My parents would get mad at me if I told that story to anyone. Because what would people think? They would think I was a liar. That story was a secret, and if I told anyone I was a liar. It was all very confusing to me, but I couldn’t get angry because then my parents would get angry too. They stopped spanking me after I cried hysterically and vomited at the mere threat, but they’d still spank my siblings when they got angry, even if I begged them not to.


After a while, my angry feelings confused me too. Why did I hate my mom so much? Why did I think she hit me and abused me? Why would I tell my first grade friends at school that lie? I remember clearly the moment I stopped being mad. I think I was around 13 and I was in a rage yelling at my mom for no particular reason whatsoever, and I went into the next room and I heard her crying and telling my dad “I can’t deal with her anymore.” And immediately all the anger left me. Because if they got angry, they’d leave me too. And there was no real reason to be angry, it was a pretend game. Why would I be mad at my parents over something I made up? Why would I be mad at my parents when I was the one who lied and told these bad stories?

Anger was a bad feeling. I didn’t ever get angry again until that night that I found out my husband cheated. Sure, my sister would yell at me for stealing her clothes, but I would never yell back. I never got in fights with my friends at school. Not even with my husband, who was also my only boyfriend (if that can even describe someone my parents introduced me to and I got engaged to only 3 months later.) I’d say sorry, and stay silent until they forgave me. Sorry was a magic word, it made it so that everything before it was an accident, more pretend. 

Eventually, the anger went away because I was just happy that people let stay around them despite what a bad ugly disgusting liar I was. I finished high school college, dental school, and got a good job. My parents were really proud of me. I was well behaved, a smart student, a doctor, and I married a good man from our culture that they approved of. Secretly though, I wished to be dead every morning. I hoped to find out I was terminally ill, or to have the courage to walk in front of the bus before school, or to drink a bottle of insecticide, or to swallow a bottle of a pills. But everyone probably felt that way. Nothing that happened to me was that bad. People had said sorry, I wasn’t mad anymore, and no one else as going to leave me. But as my husband pleaded he was sorry, I felt that frightening anger again. There was no amount of sorry that would make it an accident, that would make it pretend, that it would make it a lie. 

The past year has been the hardest of my life thus far. Rebuilding my marriage, my memories, myself. Still lots of nightmares and flashbacks. But I am in therapy finally, realizing that maybe everyone doesn’t feel this anxiety, this constant dread, all the time. Maybe there was a little hope for me. Maybe I won’t have to pretend anymore. 

TLDR: my husband cheating on me triggered memories of my sexual abuse for years by an “uncle” in my fundamentalist Christian church as a child"

Nine shootings and five attempted murders,0,mbq9e8,0," 

At least a decade ago, I quit my job at the bank(s) and took my shot at writing full time. Got serious, developed some good habits, worked hard. I started off as a premise addicted tangent junkie. But I finally narrowed down my projects to just two. One serious screenplay based on a Shakespeare play. Another a commercial property (romantic comedy). Just those two.

Taking on Bill proved to be a journey. I remember at one point, my project hit a wall a fell apart and having to start over. I knew that it would take me at least two years to get back on track. Never felt discouraged.

Set up the master bedroom as my office, bought good chair with the walls lined with books from my habit of over-research. Woke up at seven every morning. Always in the chair at nine, even if it was only for forty five minutes. Kept regular hours. I would walk downtown at eat in the food courts of the office buildings that I used to work in. I never really quit my job, just got a unpaid one.

My Mom died and left me a little inheritance, spent it on the writing. Even got a gig post office to support my ambition. That lasted a few years.

Margaret Laurence said that ninety percent of a writer's job is looking out the window. Always a observer and on the look out for good scene, that's what I did.

Nine shootings, including five attempted murders as well as murder and a manslaughter conviction, some police brutality as well my own arrest for aggravated assault my neighborhood transformed from to worlds most perfect little ghetto to the most violent spot in the city.

We made the national news at one point when a fourteen year old fired a 9mm into a crowd. Only one injury, we chased him down, but the cops took all the credit. I remember him squinting as he pulled the trigger, the cartridges flying through the air. The long pause waiting and waiting for the police to finally come, the ETF dude pointing his machine gun at me as he rolled in.

Then the yellow tape, then the media with their ridiculous factual reporting. Going to the community meetings afterwards with our local councilor using the event for his own personal political gain.

A few more lies later, because it didn't stop there. The cops were too afraid to get out of the car and would just take off when things got hot.

Then kid across the street was shot by his best friend. His friends all sobbed like babies. Then the FAS kid tried to kill somebody on my front lawn. I was in my office pulling up the blind as that one unfolded. I didn't even hear the shots. I was responsible for his capture. His mother was a real trip. Thought she was breaking bad and heading for the big time. She had weaponized her family. Did they kick her out? Nope. I had to co-exist with her for several more years. More story there.

Then the cops tried to frame somebody and left me for dead.

And my arrest. I was in the cells for night and got quite the legal education. Huge fucking legal bill and fifteen months of lost writing time. More shootings.

All through this I told myself that this wasn't my scene and I was just an observer. I kept going with my two projects. The story of my street, Project Three was something to be pursued after I had completed my first two projects. If ambition is men put their pain. I put it into my writing. I did that. I ran out of money and got a job in warehouse working the nightshift to support my writing. I started going in circles. Then I couldn't do it anymore.

Nobody tells you that you might have PTSD until you get into fights with the ladies of the gardening committee. I didn't leave the house for about a year until a friend came and got me. I packed up and moved back west. The cowboy has left the ghetto. I am now living in a homeless shelter somewhere near (but not) Montana. Getting along with the Indians just fine.

So, Project Three is where I am at. I feel that I am too close to events to write about them properly or objectively or with any sense of proper structure. But that doesn't stop me from constantly thinking about them. I despise cop shows. I want destroy the genre. Fuck Dick Wolf and his fascist apologetics, oh, Claire, how could you? The media with their set piece narrative. Hard to watch films with firearms now. The Mayor even came down here and got his picture taken and took credit for something that never happened.

Left out all the racism. And there was plenty of it. The George Floyd protests were difficult for me to take in. There is the other form of police brutality, not showing up."
I don't know what is up with me,1,mbpjdk,0,"So I had a lot of stuff that happened to me as a child that led me to being more isolated from other people and ended up becoming independent when I turned 18.

"Feeling guilty when seeing childhood photos because I didn't ruin my life, I ruined hers.",40,mblza8,7,"Does anyone else feel this way? When I see childhood photos, when I spend time with my parents, old friends and family, I feel so overwhelmed with guilt. I see myself as a little girl and think, ""who could she have been if it wasn't for my depression, anxiety, self-destructive tendencies?"". Would younger me be proud of the woman I am today? I don't think she would. I wish I could apologize to her. I wish I could do something but I can't change history. My PTSD is very bad lately. I can't shake these awful feelings."
Realized my dreams are actually nightmares and now I'm rethinking what's normal,109,mbk1t4,20,"I was diagnosed with PTSD last week, which didn't surprise me - I'm a survivor of child sexual abuse and spent 25 years living in shame from that abuse. I went to a psychologist for an ADHD evaluation and instead got diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Since then, I've been thinking about something the psychologist pointed out.

He asked me if I have nightmares and my immediate reaction was no. But then I started thinking and remembered that sometimes, I wake up afraid and crying and can't remember the dream. And then there's also this weird thing about me and my dreams where I'm always being chased or hunted, but those aren't nightmares because I have them all the time and they don't make me afraid. Possibly because I never get caught. I just can never escape - I always have to keep running.

He called those nightmares. I talked to some friends last night and they agreed. And now I'm recalibrating what a nightmare is, because..... they're right. Which means that my ""dreams"" are mostly nightmares and have been for 20+ years and I never knew it. Because I didn't know what a nightmare was and thought these were normal.

Can't help but wonder what else is PTSD that's just been normal for me."
Has anyone remembered a memory at least ten years later? Does this mean it’s a false memory?,13,mbj37x,9,"I have been struggling with a repressed memory of getting molested, which I remembered at 18.

Someone on reddit told me this memory was false because I remembered it so late. But, it’s very distressing for me and I get very nauseous when I think about it for a while.

PTSD and ocd after a scare,3,mbimjn,3,"Hi everyone

I really need to talk to you guys or someone and would love for you to share your experience with me.

a few months ago I received an indeterminate hiv test as part of a routine check up. it was a patient intake check up with a new doctor and he delivered the news via the phone and then instead of finishing the algorithm of testing to rule out or confirm infection, he totally abandoned me . 

unfortunately due to insurance and stuff like that it took a while before I could see another doctor and by then I had completely freaked myself out googling and was in absolute state of confusion, not to mention, I'm a very low risk individual. When I was able to see a new doctor he just retested me in a different lab and it was negative. I was in so much ptsd that I made him retest me in a second lab as well which also ended up negative and considering me being so low risk and my ""reactive test"" being such a low positive (1.2 signal to cut off) the doctor thinks I'm totally fine. through out this whole process I was obviously in so much anxiety and panic and I kept telling myself that life would go back to normal after the next negative test but it didn't. My brain doesn't seem to believe my negative tests and I don't know what else to do, a part of me wants to keep testing over and over again and even do more complex tests that aren't fda approved yet but the logical side of me is trying to stop this madness and there is also that fear of what if!

I'm currently seeing a therapist who is focusing on fixing the underlying ptsd issue but the ocd and anxiety is killing me and I don't know what to do. all the ocd programs say I need to face the anxiety and don't react to it but I don't know whats real logical concern and whats ocd. I also read too much google and it's all very confusing now. I don't know what to do and how to handle this. At this point I've tested negative in 4 different labs and the only test I haven't done is a molecular test that isn't fda approved which is why I'm hesitant to do it. also with the way my brain has handled everything I feel like even if I do that test as well and its also negative like the other ones it still wouldn't satisfy me. 

Have you guys gone though a similar situation? what helped you?"

734 days and still here,18,mbfevr,3,"Day of reflection.

It's been 734 days since I was but a few inches from taking my own life.

I don't share this for pity, for forgiveness, nor comfort.

I share this today, a day of reflection of colleagues, friends, and family lost due to Covid (in the UK)

A day I aimed not to be here for 734 days ago. Little did I know what I faced beyond that day.

At the time, very little mattered. I had a sense of clarity and peace I'd not felt for a long time. I knew what I wanted and how to get it.

I didnt bargain on being interrupted though.. and then I thought better of it.

Very few people know of this.

But a few days later I ended up in hospital speaking to a lovely friend from the crisis team, someone I still to this day catch up with.

Anyway I'm jabbering on.

I guess this in summary was to tell you a tale of a dark day, 734 days ago that I thought would never brighten.

A day where all hope seemed lost.

There was no future.

But here I am.

Still here.

Still breathing.

Still being a human, making mistakes, over thinking, feeling the waves of anxiety under my skin with every heart beat.

Many aren't, and I don't want anyone to think how I thought that day, but that's life and I can't stop that anymore than I can stop time marching forward.

But it can get easier.

734 days on.

So months after I finish therapy I’m waiting outside a lecture hall and I think I see him. This happened a lot and it never was so I just tried to remind myself that I was safe and there’s no way he’d be here. 

But it is him and I feel sick because he sees me. He walks up to me to say hi for some reason. I feel frozen but I don’t want to be frozen because that’s what happened when he hurt me so I take a swing at him. What I don’t realise is I’ve lost control of my limbs so my hand just sort of moves in slow motion and he grabs my wrist and laughs at me . This really set me off and I said something like “don’t fucking touch me” and ran behind a wall, sat on the floor and had a panic attack. After like 10(?) minutes I try and tough it through my lecture but I just couldn’t. I went home, got in bed and immediately started drinking.

I think I need some advice from other folks, because I'm unsure what to do. 

For some background, there was a shooting at my high school and during the shooting the fire alarm went off, now I'm heavily triggered by flashing lights and fire alarms. 

So, I work at a museum that children come to often, and at least once a month the fire alarm goes off. This is really triggering for me and I have to stop what I'm doing and go outside, even if there's nothing wrong. For obvious reasons I'm constantly on edge, especially since work is already stressful due to people getting upset with staff because of our covid restrictions. Not only that, but last Thursday someone ran past security at the entrance and started a fight before running out of the building. I've felt very unsafe since finding out about this incident even though we have brought in officers.

Not only that but today there was a mass shooting an hour away and now I'm way more anxious.

"I want to explain to those I know what PTSD is and that I have it, but how does one do that casually? Is that even possible?",10,mb18k1,4,"Sometimes, a co-worker, family member or friend-who-is-more-of-an-acquaintance will ask me: Hey, you go to therapy right? 

A subsequent question usually involves me explaining why, and I always find my explanation to be on the, well, honest side of the spectrum. But it always leaves a cold air in the room because explaining that your life is basically a clusterfuck of trauma is not really a water cooler conversation piece.

So, any tips? I’m curious to hear your light-hearted conversational strategies. 

Also, sidenote: I play the “that’s none of your business” card if I don’t want to talk about it, I don’t feel forced by others to explain myself."
Classes (idk what to name this),2,mayz0v,2,"I have ptsd from csa that I literally just found out about since my brain repressed it until I was told about it this year. anyway I told my professors that I can’t get my work in on time rn cause my brain is literally mush from ptsd and I got a therapy note too. I I can’t seem to do anything productive except maybe like a max hour of work. So one of my classes ended today before I got to turn in the rest of my work and I failed it since I got three zeros in. I need this class to graduate in a couple of weeks, so I emailed my professor with my remaining essays and apologized for my lack of timeliness. Idk I’m just really frustrated with myself for not being able to succeed. PTSD has already taken so much away from me so fast and to have it take my graduation away makes me feel like my abuser and the ptsd won, if that makes sense."

She called out of the blue, and I answered, I actually answered, she was so proud of me and I was proud to..

i'm losing // TW,1,mauquq,0,"I found out I have diagnosed ptsd last year, due to sexual assault and childhood neglect, plus severe blood loss twice in my life. These things have caused me not to trust anyone, and I don't. I was sexually assaulted by my sisters ex, and in August by my sisters current boyfriend. I have been in a relationship for a year, and he has been amazing, but the dissociation and trauma is making me lose my mind. I can't stop screaming if someone is outside my window or someone walks in, I can't stop the panic attacks and it is so so hard to stop myself from giving up or harming myself. I feel like I am too weak to not harm myself. God,, and I have anorexia and every day I find myself more and more vile.

What do you guys do to relieve the paranoia and panic of a ptsd episode?,63,mashwt,38,"I haven’t really felt ptsd this badly in a while and it’s killing my appetite, I can’t sleep, I’m paranoid and irritable. It feels like 2019 is happening all over again for me and I mean 2019 not 2020. 

I still have a hard time talking to my family and friends about the details of what happened (it took me a year to tell my family that something even happened to me). I just feel like I’m isolating myself with what feels like a secret. It’s kept me from making friends (I just sorta shut down as a person because I can’t open up) and honestly I’m so over having to deal with it alone.

Update: feeling better now. My best friend suggested I try to figure out how to fix or deal with ptsd episodes. I’m a little hopeful that it was just a one off situation but I guess I’m not guaranteed that. If anyone knows how to cure ptsd let me know because I’m in some denial that this could even happen to me. I always thought if I believed I was fine then I was fine, end of story.

I was able to reason with myself that enough has changed. I’ve taken measures in the past few months to keep my location a secret (basically went through all my settings to blocked some people from seeing my snapchat story and instagram story)"

Trauma/PTSD"
"17 year old post leg-brake, i think i have got ptsd but I need answers",6,manqvg,2,"Ps - sorry about how long I’ve made this post 

What has happened:

when i broke my leg it was on a football pitch and when it happened my shin bone was snapped and while on the pitch could see it poking against my skin from the outside, my first instinct was to move my leg back into place into its natural position which i did. I then led there for about 2 and a half hours waiting for an ambulance. During this time I was very very calm, people were shocked at how relaxed i seemed and i know this is just how i work and that my personality makes me this way. however something to note on for later is that i was very cold during this whole time waiting for the ambulance, i was shaking almost the whole time.

First panic-attack in hospital:

a couple days into the hospital stay i woke up in the middle of the night out of a very intense scary dream, i felt insanely warm all over my skin, however all my tempatures were fine. I was in panic mode and i felt very confused, scared and overwhelmed by whatever i was feeling (now knowing these may be symptoms to what i soon to find out could be ptsd). 

leaving home and resting at home:

the first night back i stayed at my grandmas, downstairs on the sofa. I woke up in the middle of the night to be shaking and very scared and in a very strange mindset that i have only witness once before which was the other day in the hospital. I was yet again panicking and unable to comprehend what was going on and i desperately needed comforting and relaxing. I now started to get concerned, seeing in trend in this happening in the night when trying to sleep or waking up from sleeping. I searched for answers online but my first conclusion was that the codiene I was taking was giving me bad side effects, i then stopped the medication after this episode.

the next episodes:

i have now made it home and i feel like everything will be more secure and better as i feel more comfortable being in the familiar surroundings. during the nights at home i have had multiple panic attacks, they have happened every night to some degree and before trying to sleep i have had no success due to the very intense hot/cold flushes i have been constantly having no matter what i try to do. when i have managed to drift off asleep after hours of trying i wake up in panic mode, i lose all my rational thinking in which is something i depend on for mental security, i get very scared and its a very intense feeling, its almost as if waking up into this state is like a filter over my entire mental arithmetic. Last night was the worst tho, i woke up in this state, i was shaking very intensely (this is now correlating back too me being on the pitch waiting for the ambulance), i had a desperate need to get out my bedroom and sit in the toilet, Ive tried to see why this Could be but i think it may Be for a sense of security. I am now on the toilet after a very dramatic time from my bedroom - bathroom, i am now very very concerned about the state of my leg, i am paranoid about if my broken leg starts to shake it WILL hurt it to a degree that was unrealistic for just intense shaking, i am sitting there on the toilet While my mum tries to help but i am in tears at the fact that my leg might shake and it might damage it, this was very abnormal for me, i never cry, ever, i just never do. I took around 10-20 minutes too cool off after this but still with the continuing effects of the intense hot/cold flushes, these flushes feeling very clammy and the cold ones making my hair stand on end and give me goosebumps.

i am getting more and more convinced this is PTSD the more i read and find out, i guess i have more material to go off when i try sleep tonight. I am really looking for clarity here about what’s going on.

i also have one important question about what kind of PTSD is this, and how long does this kind of PTSD tend to last."
Polyvagal Theory,9,mambdr,3,"[https://youtu.be/ec3AUMDjtKQ](https://youtu.be/ec3AUMDjtKQ)

In a letter my counselor wrote for me, ""PTSD can alter and impact relationships, it can eliminate someone's concept of self and can result in poor self-esteem with depression, anhedonia and feelings of being ""stuck."" Don't discount, or let others, discount your feelings. I was misdiagnosed and thought for 24 years my feelings were normal, and they became my normal. I genuinely have seen both sides of wondering what PTSD must be like and now knowing what it is like by being able to look back at the results.

If you have felt like, or feel like, a bag in the wind it is that ""stuck"" feeling. Although I have made many decisions in my life, I only did so when presented with choices. I had not been actively setting my own course. It may not be able to control the symptoms of PTSD (Difficulty falling or staying asleep, Irritability or outbursts of anger, Difficulty concentrating, Hypervigilance, Exaggerated startle response), but you can actively make choices.

I know that I will never be free from the symptoms, which is very difficult to accept, but each time I make a conscience and active decision despite the symptoms, however small, the satisfaction I get from that small success gives me a sense of calm or momentary break and I feel good for once. While the feeling doesn't last I know that I can do it again.

Every long journey starts with just one step and any long journey can be made step by step. Don't look for the destination, it may change, but watch each step you take and know that they add up."
"seeing my abuser daily (tw/sa , abuse)",1,majaxl,3,"i could really use some advice or support. i was in an abusive relationship over quarantine where my boyfriend physically, emotionally, and sexually assaulted me. i stayed in the relationship until he dumped me due to fear & manipulation. i have reported it to the police & our shared school. i have been doing online school due to covid but i will be going back in person later this week, along with the rest of the school. over the past few months people have found out and most have taken my abusers side. i have been cyber bullied to the extreme caused by my abuser spreading rumors. now i have to see my abuser every day along with people who won’t even listen to what i have to say. i am terrified. i have expressed my concerns about him possibly harming me as he typically carries a small weapon (that he has used on me before) but the school continuously reassures me they will do their best to protect me. i don’t feel safe, but i refuse to stay home and let him control my life even more than he already does. i am having horrific night terrors and just feel like i am going to break."

it's too difficult to hide how I'm feeling when it happens, the most I can do is run off somewhere so I can at least be alone.

I tremble, I remember the fear in each moment prior and it all accumulates into a horrible beast of things better left forgotten.

I feel sick, sick to my stomach.

I can't help but feel like vomitting.

my heart starts racing as if it's going to burst.

Does anyone else have this issue?,4,magvth,0,Since my trauma happened I have not been able to talk about it or even acknowledge that it ever happened and as of recent I've tried being more open and talking about it as this has started bringing on flashbacks but I also cannot talk about it in a serious manner I only smile and laugh and joke about it whenever I have to talk about it or bring it up even in therapy or close people to me is this normal?
I was able to cry today!,16,magn2l,5,"I have struggled with dissociation, mostly depersonalization and an inability to feel attached to my own emotions and life story, for 2 or 3 years now. I haven't been able to cry or access my emotions unless under the influence, which is especially problematic for me because I am an addict and alcoholic in recovery. So, outside of a 2 week relapse this summer, I've felt totally dead inside.

BUT I CRIED TODAY! It was about a hypothetical situation, and not my own sadness, but it still provided some emotional release! I remembered how I used to be able to cry at sad movies, and so I got the idea to meditate and imagine a story of something that hasn't happened to me, isn't related to my traumas, but nonetheless would make me sad. It worked and I got a good 2-3 minutes of sobbing in. Progress!

I just thought this might be helpful to someone else. Not being able to cry has been so, so frustrating to me."
Anxiety is too intense,1,magfbr,1,"It’s really hard to manage so much anxiety. Idk about anyone else but because of it, I have a lot of physical symptoms that make it really hard to function. One of the worst symptoms is racing heart. It can be triggered from eating, taking a warm bath or shower, or just completely at random. It’s so uncomfortable and makes me feel disabled completely. The fear of death thanks to my trauma has been just very scary. I was hoping maybe hearing from others on how they manage their physical symptoms would really help me maybe. Especially if it’s also a racing heart.."
Diagnosed severe ptsd - no self talk?,1,magay6,1,"So I am very new in my therapy journey and have been diagnosed with ptsd due to childhood emotional and physical abuse, sex abuse, later intimate partner narcissistic abuse and witnessing my brother's death.

I cope by avoiding and dissociating. I detach from my surroundings often and also constantly keep busy to avoid feeling. If I do feel negative feelings, it's a spectrum from extreme nervous system actvation to being completely numb and ignoring those feelings the second they come. I'm generally numb and will not let myself go to the places that upset me unless it's right in my face.

The therapist wants me to spend this week focusing on my ""self talk"" - taking note of what I say to myself and if it's positive or negative. Now that I'm paying attention, I'm realizing I have very little self talk. When I do, it's usually after something very embarassing but the day to day? I say really nothing positive OR negative about myself. Has anyone experienced this? Is this a symptom of my extreme avoidance/detachment to myself and my surroundings? I feel like it could be.. Because I keep busy on autopilot and don't even think of myself being a person most of the time. I have thoughts, many of them.. But not about myself."
Parents just don’t understand,1,mag0y8,1,"I was in an extremely abusive relationship/marriage; sexual, physical, verbal, financial, you name it....for almost 14 years.

I have been having a hard time recently ( even though I escaped almost 2 years ago).  I had to check into a psych hospital because my parents said I was not living in reality.  I was laid off from my FT (75k annual) job while I was hospitalized.  Since then, everything has gone downhill and all my parents say is....stop being a victim.  I don’t want to be a victim.....I just have this like racing heart some moments and like extreme fatigue others.  I’m finding it hard to even interview for new jobs and my parents just don’t understand.  My Dad watched some YouTube video and keeps saying I’m in the freeze zone and need to get out.  I’ve been continuously in therapy, once a week....but I just feel so hopeless and scared and I wonder if it’s because I am trying to live up to my parents expectations.

"Idk what to title this, but i need to vent",1,mac0ie,1,"tw: tics and mentions of r\*pe/sexual assault but this is also a vent- so- idk

I'm 15, and I was sexually assaulted by a 19 year old about 11 months ago.   
I haven't had a full nights sleep since, I didn't sleep in my own bed  for a month after it happened. I'm a teenager in my first year of high school, and on top of Covid, it just can't be normal. I've been trying to have friends and just be normal but I can't. Something always reminds me of what happened. I've developed tics, and I can barely let people touch me.   
I don't ever really have 'ptsd attacks', but I'll have tic attacks. They normally end in me on the ground in a ball trying to stop ticking. My tics involve me hitting my self and usually ends in me having bruises up and down my thighs and arms.   
I'm in the process of pressing charges and trying to get the man arrested. Since the case started 10 months ago, the whole thing hasn't felt real til recently. That's about the time my tics started happening. The case really started to pick up about two months ago. My parents and the county attorney are talking about having me testify. I can't do it. I know I can't. I don't even care if he goes to prison. I just want it over with. 

With all of that, I've really been trying to just be normal. I have a boyfriend, but since I'm finally getting male attention that's positive, I've grown extremely attached. I can tell that my clingy-ness is going to push him away. But, it's something that's making things feel normal. I just want to feel fucking normal. He's something normal in my day to day. Ever since it happened everyone pities me. I can see it in their eyes when they're around me. So much pity. I don't want it. Just act like I'm normal. I'm so normal. I can do day to day shit without people acting like I'm some fragile being that could break at any second.   
Is what I'm saying normal though?   
Do I even actually have ptsd or is it all in my head?   
Is all of it in my head?  
These aren't questions I expect answers to. I just don't understand whats happening anymore.."
Walking,4,mabk2c,2,I found this to be a helpful solution. Grab a pair of headphones and take a walk for a few hours preferably on a nice day or afternoon. This will take your mind off things while you enjoy yourself this stops your rage for a while but no promises of nightmares and nighttime stress because that's the way it gets me now. Give it a try and stay hydrated.
anyone else experience stress fainting?,1,maat8h,1,"so to help with a timeline, i was dxed with ptsd about six years ago following a violent relationship. at about that time, i started experiencing brief (1-5 minute) fainting episodes in response to interpersonal conflict, intense fear, or loud noises. sometimes i will just get lightheaded and wobbly on my legs, sometimes i go down completely. 

i’m very fortunate, after many years and a combination of therapeutic interventions, that most of my other ptsd symptoms have improved quite a bit since my diagnosis, but the fainting is still happening. luckily i haven’t hit my head or otherwise hurt myself, but it’s super embarrassing and draws a lot of unwanted attention.

has anyone else experienced anything like this? i’ve always assumed it was linked to my ptsd as it began alongside the trauma but i may be incorrect in assuming so. if you have, how do you manage it? has anything you’ve done made it any better or less frequent?

thanks for your insight!"
"I don't need a ""breakthrough"" I need relief. I need life to be more than an endurance test",210,ma9xqu,57,"It's not a matter of reframing, I'm not delusional, I'm not in denial, or suppressing my memories:  I'm VERY KNEELY aware of how I'm impact by PTSD. Clinical discussions don't change how I feel, nor do labels. Coping isn't sufficient for me to do more then surivive. Being aware doesn't equal relief and if I cannot do things like work a job, have a relationship, have regular restful sleep, feel the full range of emotions, or even get through a single day without being drained, I'm not sure how I am supposed to have a good quality of life."
Stigma making my life hell,16,ma9cy1,6,"So i have PTSD due to being bullied. No assault, no death, just bullying. Which obviously means im just imagining it, others have it worse. I dont have real ptsd. Im making it more difficult for others. Im overexaggerating. What happened to me wasnt bad enough. Bad memories arent trauma. I should man up about it. I dont need intensive therapy. Its all in my head (where the fuck else would PTSD be? In the kidneys). 
Ive lost about 7/10 friends. Cant make new ones. Can barely get help when in a flashback. I get laughed off when i tell someone. 
Not sure which is worse, that, or when i get out of a flashback (reliving the memory, including ohantom pain) and i dont know what is real and what is my tortured mind slowly going insane. I just sit there, wondering wether its a flashback, and i cant escape my past. Or am i still there, and the 'here and now' is just a fever dream so i dont have to deal woth reality."

Too young to remember: question about trauma you can’t remember,7,ma8uvy,0,"Tw: flashback story and mention of sexual abuse 

Since I turned 18, 10 years ago, and started working through some GAD  and MD, I can’t shake that there may have been sexual trauma or abuse that happened when I was small. But I don’t remember exactly.  First, is this possible? I’d like a discussion and advice on this. 

Second, here’s is my most recent story of having a break down that leads me to believe this is the case.  

I was visiting my mom with my young daughter. At this point I was also 3 months pregnant almost. And when I was there I had a complete mental collapse. I’d been dealing with a lot due to home and kids and life. So I took a shower and closed my eyes. I was having, what I can only assume was a dissociative episode, or splitting of my emotions. And when I tried to hug myself back together I found myself stuck in a memory. I couldn’t open my eyes or do anything and I was in my childhood bedroom in the dark. Scared. I felt like I knew what was going to happen and that someone was going to come in and hurt me. So I counted down from three and forced my eyes open and repeated “I don’t want to know” over and over again.  

I talked to my mom about any trauma and she said she doesn’t remember me acting weird about anything. Except, when I was a toddler at preschool, I throwing a fit because I didn’t want the man with the mustache to take my picture for the class picture. So I wasn’t in it. 

I remember being very sexual from a young age. Feeing shame around that but it wasn’t public or too inappropriate. 

I’d like advice on where to go from here as I can’t afford therapy and I’m still too scared to talk to anyone irl about this so I thought I’d start here."
Flatmate problem,1,ma8ex1,2,"tw sexual assault  


I'm having problems with my flatmate. A while ago we were cuddling and kissing and he asked me to do something sexual which I declined. Then next day I tried to flirt/joke about it and he acted like I did something wrong so I was upset. Yesterday when we decided to talk about it he thought I was upset about the kissing. He claims he didn't ask about anything else. He insists it didn't happen, not even that he might not remember (he was at least tipsy and I was sober). It makes me feel terrible because it reminds me the way the guy who assaulted me gaslighted me the next day, it was exactly like this. So now my flatmate is a trigger and I already struggle with sleep plus I'm starting to doubt myself. He can be selfish and ignorant but I don't believe he would lie on purpose. We had another fight previously but at the time I just decided to accept he isn't capable of understanding me for the sake of my mental health (not speaking to him made me physically ill and depressed). I was in a better place before this talk and I don't need him but right now I'm feeling terrible and dissociating.  I can't move houses either. And unfortunately I quite care about him so it hurts me seeing him hurt. But wouldn't be surprised if he's a narcissist. I wonder if I should even bother explaining him how damaging this is or just cease any contact"
I learned how to ground myself and now realize how much pain I'm in. How do I deal with the pain?,10,ma7mer,7,"The emotional pain is pretty unbearable. I've put on so much weight medicating myself with food. I don't have any pleasure in my life, literally just pain or self-medication.

Does anyone have any techniques I can follow? Like techniques I used to learn grounding?"
My cousin bought my childhood home,11,ma77j3,0,"It’s where most of my trauma happened and there’s mostly just bad memories. I’ll be spending more time there during get togethers.

I was hoping to make happy memories to make up for the past. I wanted to make a positive out of a negative.

Had a dinner the other night. My aunt was talking to her daughters fiancée about the history of our family living in the neighborhood. She talks a lot n it was all mostly bad. She right away said she didn’t like the neighbor across from us. 

To elaborate she talked about when my mom was 8 months pregnant with my sister, her boyfriend, the neighbor’s brother, tried to kill her with a huge knife.

It’s a long story and very complicated. It didn’t need to be told at all. Even my cousins fiancée said he felt uncomfortable about being told everything.

My aunt just runs her mouth so much. What made it worse is she told it to make her look good and left out a lot that would put her in a bad light.

She didn’t even consider how I would feel hearing that. It’s a very upsetting subject. She can’t be so stupid or maybe she really doesn’t care how I feel. Maybe it’s not malicious and she just wants attention. 

What the hell goes through someone’s mind saying all that shit. I was so awkward and pretty quiet most of the rest of the night.

There’s another dinner tonight. I explained this to my cousin and she said it’s fine cos the fiancée is back in Europe and everyone already knows and doesn’t care. 

That was beside the point. My problem is hearing about it again. Listening about it brings back visuals. My aunt could say anything at anytime. She has no filter and you can’t say anything about it or you’re seen as attacking her. She’s very good at victimizing herself, disregarding my feelings. Gossiping is seen as a quirky part of her personality.

“Who cares? It was a long time ago.”

Exactly so don’t bring it up unnecessarily."
Shouldn't I be over this s**t by now,5,ma71eo,0,"Okay I hope I'm okay to post here.
Okay so I (17M) was the sole carer for a family member who had a sudden illness that eventually lead to their demise. All of a sudden they got ill and it resulted in six months of truly horrific physical pain but also what can only be described as complete insanity. I think the last month or two were almost entirely endless screaming and insanity where I was unable to leave their side. I occasionally got enough money to get a carer so I would be able to sleep but generally it was never ending insaneness for both of us.
This ended back in September and I don't know why I cant forget any of it, most nights I cant sleep properly cause I just get these stupid memories of how it was and I wake up cause I swear I hear them and I just zone out and I just want to be in control."
Rant/Vent (marked as spoiler for trigger warning),2,ma5rrq,1,"I'm not sure where else to put this. I don't think I have PTSD solely because of diet culture, but diet culture, fatphobia, and mentions of the ""war"" on childhood obesity are all super triggering for me, along with commercials for weight loss.

Please don't make fun of me. I just want to share my experience. Please don't tell me to stop stuffing my face or to get off my \*ss. Please don't call me a fat lard, a waste of space, or a land whale. I am none of those things, I don't stuff my face, and while my life is fairly sedentary due to the pandemic, I am not lazy or weak. Please don't do anything along those lines.

I grew up just before the body positivity movement started to take hold, at the height of the war on childhood obesity. I was the symbol of an enemy, of an epidemic. My body was something to be ashamed of, something to change, something to eradicate. I was evidence of moral failure. I mean, one of the ads about childhood obesity by strong4life, the one that said ""it's hard to be a little girl when you're not"", literally looks exactly how I did when I was a kid. If somebody told me that the little girl in the picture was me, I wouldn't be surprised. My body and bodies like mine were a heartbreaking tragedy, never allowed to just exist.

Every weight-loss ad on TV was targeted at adults, but they were on every channel, including the kid's channels, sending the same message: here is how to stop failing. here is how to be loved. here is how to become lovable, here is how to be seen as human. Pay us, and we will make you whole. You are not whole, not human, not loved, not lovable, you are not good, not worthy.

My dad agreed. He set the pantry off limits, only ever gave us salads or rice and vegetables, and scolded my mom (divorced) for not doing what he did, for not having a stay-at-home spouse able to make healthy meals, for not being able to afford to keep good food in the house that would always end up only half-eaten.

He taught me to suck in my gut, told me it would help my posture and make people like me better. He said that nothing tastes better than skinny feels.

One day, in my teens, when we were about to enter Burlington's to go clothes shopping (the WORST place for plus size clothes), his wife told us, repeating what he had said to her, that this was the last time they'd buy us a size up, because they wanted us to start losing weight.

My face burned with shame. If I got any bigger, I wouldn't be clothed. I spent a lot of time wearing jeans that were too small, in denial of my voluminous body needing a size up. In denial that I could still get bigger. In denial of my body. It got so bad that the pants I was wearing dug into my skin and caused digestive issues because of how tight around the waist they were.

As it was, I didn't find anything good at Burlington's, just a bunch of clothes meant to hide bigger figures, made to hide bigger people, made to help us blend into the background, to not be seen, not made to make the actual customers look and feel good about themselves. Some kind of sick motivation to lose weight? I don't know. The message of fat people being worthless is so prevalent that it's hard to see where it's intentional and where it's accidental.

I went to the doctor a few years ago. I hadn't had my period in over a year. He said it was probably PCOS, made an offhand comment about an ultrasound, and told me to lose weight. No diagnosis, no testing. Just shrink your body, it's so easy, you just have to stop being such a slothful, greedy, glutton.

He then tested me for binge eating disorder, which I was marginally diagnosed with, and sent me home with a stimulant weight loss pill. I'm still recovering from the mental health spiral that it caused. It's a stimulant. I had already been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, for which stimulants are the opposite of treatment.

Every time I went to the doctor, it was the same thing: You're too big, you take up too much space, you're too heavy, you must have done something horribly wrong to end up like this.

At one particularly low point in my life, I tried to force myself to develop an eating disorder. I tried to force myself to become anorexic; despite the fact that the risks of being a little bit too thin are far worse than the risks of being a little bit ""too"" fat, I just desperately wanted to be in a body that my father could accept, that would allow me to date, that wouldn't make everyone around me cringe at the word ""fat"".

All these euphemisms. Fluffy. Curvy. Big-boned. Voluptuous. Just say fat. It's not a bad word, it's an adjective just like tall or short or blonde or brunette or redhead. Fat is not a bad thing. If I say I'm fat, don't tell me I'm not to try and make me feel better. All you're saying is that it's bad to be fat. Don't tell me that I'm not fat, I'm beautiful, because all you're saying is that fat is ugly.

When I feel bad about how the world treats me due to my size, don't tell me that some people find me attractive. I don't care. I want doctors to see me as a person, as someone worth treating, not a diseased person whose only problem is their size.

Even as I type this, I'm starting the keto diet. I've always hated diets, and the idea of dieting scares me. The only problem is, that's the prescription for insulin resistance. That's the prescription for prediabetes. That's the prescription for type 2 diabetes.

I don't want to lose weight. I won't be upset if I do, but I don't want to focus on it, ever. Every time I've focused on it, the results have been disastrous. Still, I must take care of my body and reverse my insulin resistance if I want to avoid diabetes. Still, I must face the condescending congratulations for finally trying to ~~be thin~~ ~~lose weight~~ be ""healthy"" as I exercise and eat better, despite the fact that I may very well gain weight (even if it's muscular and not fat, as weight exercises are apparently the best for increasing insulin sensitivity). 

I'm honestly scared of what will happen if and when I do become thin. Will people suddenly be more comfortable being blatantly fatphobic around me? Will people still try to share diet tips with me to make myself shrink even more (flat tummy tea is just a laxative, my stomach is where I hold my organs, I don't need it to be flat!). Will doctors congratulate me for leaving my slothful, gluttonous, lazy life of a fat person behind? Will people ask me how to lose weight and keep it off? Will my fat family members resent me for my ""success"", due to their own beliefs that being fat is a failure?

I'm so tired of all of this. I read Aubrey Gordon's book, What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat, and I realized what I had truly gone through, and what I deserved, as, at the end of the book, she talked about her first doctor visit in years.

The previous visit had left her ashamed, as the nurse couldn't believe that her blood pressure was healthy due to her size. Previous visits had had the same effect: despite being in a weight watcher family, her doctor talked to her as a child as if she were eating gallons of ice cream. A visit to another doctor for an ear infection resulted in being prescribed weight loss. ""My ears didn't get fat"", she told the doctor. She was right.

Her most recent doctor's visit, in the book, was so different. She told the doctor about her habits, and he called her healthy. I have never been called healthy, and neither had she. The nurse only took her blood pressure once. She told her doctor all about all she had been through with medical professionals, and let him know that the moment that the doctor recommended weight loss as a solution to something completely related, she'd be done. The doctor *empathized*, said that it sounded like she'd been through a lot, and she just... broke down. That is how rare it is for fat people to have empathy given to them.

I realized that I had never experienced that, and that I might never experience that, and, like how I mourn the relationship I should've had with my biological but abusive father, I mourned the professional relationship that I'd never had with a doctor, or anyone else who believed that my fat was a problem.

Today, and for the past few months, I've been having severe GI issues. They're likely caused by my PCOS. Still, I want to see a GI doctor to get tested for gluten sensitivity again (the numbers last time were suspicious but didn't quite meet the mark for an allergy - my sister also has celiac). Every time I brought this up to my mother, wonderful as she is, and a very close fat ally, she told me that I needed to eat better. 

Sure, she's not entirely wrong... but she's not entirely right, either. Even if I wasn't eating wonderfully (not a lot of fruits and veggies), I wasn't eating crap all the time, either, and junk food was a rarity (the worst that I ate regularly was bland cereal, frozen waffles, and sometimes hotdogs). In addition, the food that I ate usually had gluten in it anyways. I can't stop eating gluten if I want to get tested again, as the test relies on the ongoing reaction the body is currently having due to ingested gluten.

I told her that this felt like blame, that it wasn't very relevant, and that it was hurtful. Thankfully, she is a wonderful person who is willing to grow. We're working on setting up an appointment with a GI doctor, and yes, I'm working on eating better. I recently found the HEAS (health at every size) registry, and I'm hoping to find a dietician in my area who can help me change my diet without triggering all the trauma around growing up fat.

It still hurts.

The last time I was at my dad's house, there was a printed page on the fridge of ways to lose weight. In the same house as my younger half-brother. He's ten.

He's just a little boy. He's too young to know any better. Who is going to tell him that, no matter what size he is, he's still worthy? Who is going to tell him that his fat is not a failure? Who is going to prepare him for the onslaught of medical discrimination? I wish I could, but for my sake, I had to cut off my and his bio dad, meaning that I may never see him again until he grows up. I don't know if he'll ever get to see me again.

*He's just a little boy.* He's *ten*. He deserves so much better. He doesn't deserve to go through what I went through.

***He's just a little boy.***

I feel so helpless, even as progress continues.

After all, who would listen to a fat person?"
I'm losing,12,ma4dep,0,"I'm losing control of my sobriety. I'm losing control of my binge eating. I'm back at a point where going outside is fucking horrendous, and I'm in pain. 
Even at home I'm hallucinating spiders and bugs everywhere. And auditory hallucinations of people fighting  

Just been diagnosed with *another* chronic disease. I've been permanently uncomfortable in my body and soul for years now. My doctors are saying my entire body is inflamed and it could be due to prolonged periods of being in fight or flight. The adrenaline just slowly poisons you. 

I thought once I got away from my abusers I would be okay. I really want to be okay. 

All I do is binge, hate myself and shower several times a day."

Is my PTSD still valid?,1,ma39us,10,"I (27F) was gang-raped by three men nearly ten years ago now. I went through a very long period of denial followed by a breakdown in summer 2017. I'm doing a lot better now but I've had a couple of friends recently suggest that ten years is a long time to come to terms with a one-off event that only took place over a few hours. One of them was sexually abused throughout her childhood and keeps reminding me that what she went through is so much worse than me and that I'm making too big a deal out of it. 
I was quite proud of how far I've come since then but I still have flashbacks and nightmares sometimes and now I'm wondering, am I just weak? Should I be over it now when so many people have been through worse?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your kind words, I think I just needed some validation that it's ok to process things at my own speed and feel what I feel. Thank you."
is this even ptsd??,3,ma2mz2,1,"ive had multiple past traumas with men that led me to being extremely afraid of men to the point where i would literally tremble when one tried to talk to me. i managed to heal after getting into high school bc the boys in my school generally knew to respect boundaries etc and are all pretty 'woke' esp in recent times. 
i was okay for a while but this guy im talking to is being rly nice to me but critiqued a story i posted abt the vast differences between the measures men and women have to take to not be harassed and that somehow triggered my trauma and got me really stressed. i didn't even consider what i had to be trauma until i actually thought about it and just thinking about what people have done to me made me sob and shake. but their behaviours were so normalised back then so i didn't know it was bad, i always thought i was being weird and a coward. 

question is am i even allowed to be stressed? he was just thinking out loud and he was super apologetic after but now i feel uncomfortable even talking to him"
"My trauma story. I swear it's true, I can't make this up. There is HOPE!",138,ma15j7,41,"Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help. It is work and initially very hard, but the alternatives can be horrible for you and your loved ones."
Hair loss from stress of PTSD symptoms,18,m9z325,10,"So since I started experiencing my symptoms and processing my trauma, my hair has been falling out at a rapid rate. I also have an underactive thyroid, but I’ve been getting  really good lab results these last couple months. I keep trying to tell my doctor I want to see a hair specialist, but she keeps telling me it’s “probably just your thyroid” but doesn’t increase my dosage and tells me my thyroid is fine.

My question is: have others experienced rapid hair loss due to the stress of processing trauma? And if you have, are there any hair treatments you’ve found helpful? I’m getting stressed about my hair, which is probably not helping the hair loss xD"
I woke up crying from a PTSD nightmare,40,m9uk48,22,"I usually fight my sleep by going on my phone until I can’t keep my eyes open anymore (I know how bad this is). Anyway, I got sleepy around midnight and I woke up at 3 AM crying actual tears flowing down my cheeks. It took until now (4 AM) to stop crying. I had such a perfect day with my partner, too. My crying woke them and they stroked my hair half-asleep until my cat came over to see what was wrong. Is there anything anyone does to stop these realistic nightmares from happening? I sleep with a weighted blanket and I’m on meds that I take daily which are about to be increased. 

TLDR; Is there anything anyone does to stop these realistic nightmares from happening? Weighted blanket helps with sensory issues (autism) and getting sleepy. I take meds."
How do I get past this,2,m9synj,2,"Tw: mentions of sexual assault and past self harm

Throughout my lifetime I’ve dealt with abusive relationships. My first was when I was 13 and he was around 18. My most damaging was at age 16. I was raped four times by my boyfriend at the time but didn’t know it was SA. Since then my personality has drastically changed, I dipped into self harm a little bit (Im a month clean and am not planning on ever going back) but it’s been theorized by multiple doctors that I have PTSD. I also have dealt with traumatic health emergencies, multiple hospitalizations and surgeries which have contributed to the trauma as well. My parents don’t understand why I’ve changed. They call me lazy and ungrateful because I can’t get out of bed. They say I’m overreacting when I say I get a panic attack if I see anyone similar looking to my rapist. My mom constantly complains that she has to micromanage me because I won’t take care of myself if she doesn’t. This is only layering on more trauma and stress. If anyone was in a similar situation to me, what is your advice. I’m 18 currently and I’m not knowledgeable about this type of stuff. It’s really taking a toll on my entire life and hate living like this but I feel trapped."
I want to go to therapy but scared to ask,3,m9s2ch,1,"I really want to go to therapy because I think it will help but I'm scared to ask most of my trauma is caused by my parents and it would seem weird to ask to see a therapist, for a while I thought I was bipolar but I don't know how to get diagnosed I'm still a minor and don't know how to get help also I don't really trust counselors because the last time I talked about my trauma they called cps"
My trauma is worse than I thought,1,m9pe38,0,"I was abused by my mother for 19 years, was sexually abused the summer after high school, and then met my abusive X that fall. It was a long timeline of shit that never got resolved and I’m still struggling to deal with it. I have intrusive thoughts, a lot of horrible dreams, and it all is still on my mind a lot. I feel no hope in my current relationship (it’s been 3 years since I left my X) because of the abuse I suffered in the last. I feel so bad that he has to deal with my fears and trauma and I try my absolute best to not let it affect us. But I can’t shake that feeling of dread, and the feeling of self preservation I have had to develop to survive. I am on antidepressants and they help me get through the day, but I feel like I am still not moving forward. I have tried therapy before but it’s always just 30 minute sessions where I talk about my problems and they give shitty advice and I leave. Never had a good experience with it and it almost feels like no one could help me without me spending thousands and it taking a horribly long amount of time."
Ptsd torture pls someone help me,10,m9p0jn,3,"I have given advice on this platform numerous times. And I'm sure we have all heard, you never take your own advice. 

I get it. I don't want to say mine's different, because everyone's trauma is different. 

Ptsd is a syndrome. It's not discriminatory. 

But what happens, when child abuse isnt child abuse?

I've recently been told that my abuse is not considered abuse over the 18, but actual torture techniques. I never talked about it. I heard stories (I grew up in Saudi Arabia), but never imagined that was me. Because I was an adult, and my father moved to South Africa, no consequences. 

I never thought it was ""bigger"" than abuse. But after years of dating navy SEAL s, they all tell me the same thing: what my dad did to me are torture techniques. Those are real torture techniques they have done in order to access important information.  Except in my case is was executed  when I didnt scrub the fridge with a tooth brush if he saw something he considered dirty. 

I didn't know that pouring hot oil over your kid so their hair falls out isnt normal. I didn't know that hand prints bruised in Deep purple aren't normal, or that stripping naked and sleeping outside wasn't  a normal punishment, or stand on your head on concrete for 30 min wasn't regular punishment (list goes on). 

The worst part about this ? You would think people would have intervened. They didn't. Because my parents are wealthy af. Their wealth almost killed me nearly everyday. 

The reason I'm talking today is because, I've done everything you can think of in terms of treatment, including ketamine and the FDA trials with MDMA. Nothing is working.  You name it, I've done it.

I've come to a point of radical acceptance.

However. How does one forgive their mom for being the bystander? I am estranged from my dad (my choice), but I told her tonight that while she has been very supportive, no amount of guilt cloaked under the guise of support will ever allow us to be close. I'm 32. She's 64. I lived on my own, started a whole new life, but have been helping my mom since she retired from covid. As a result, I spent money on getting more education and hopefully getting my master's next year. But I haven't been able to work as a result. I don't have the financial ability to 'pick up' and leave. 

Now that I've been told about the torture (or rather, have it redefined as torture), I'm having night terrors. Except I leave the house. Unclothed or clothed. I go to different places, apparently to seek help. Except Im not awake.. I was told that this is also very rare. (Great)

I never remember this, I always wake up IN the same position so unless I have Security cameras I can't tell. ( I have hid keys in safes, locked doors, moved furniture so I don't leave), so that never works  because your unconscious mind picks up small details. 

HERE IS MY PROBLEM,  I'm drinking heavily. All the time. I'm not physically addicted, but emotionally, ""therapeutically"" I act like it. I know behaviour modifications are in order. 

I feel so Lonely, my ptsd type 2 complex is so rare it's only written about or mentioned in 6 medical journals.

 Does anyone out there relate in some way"
Roommates,6,m9ozw9,0,"How do you deal with roommates when you have PTSD? Or in the grander sense, living in the city? I experience a lot of sound sensitivity and general restlessness. I'm afraid to wear headphones or ear plugs because I can't hear my surroundings, but if I \*do\* I get shots of anxiety. (doors shutting harshly, stomping feet, indistinct screaming). 

My current roommate is very calm/quiet but he's not really working with me in finding a new housing arrangement since neither of us want to renew the lease (loud neighbors). I can live with him, and I'm genuinely scared he'll just suddenly give me zero notice about finding a separate situation without me. I've tried to express that this entire process is really stressing me out because of my past, and because I'm transgender, but he kind of waved my fears simply due to the fact we live in a socially liberal city. He told me to ""be flexible"". I'm being flexible by virtue of not having enough money to live on my own. I'm being flexible by completely forfeiting location by offering to move closer to HIS work when I have to take the bus and he drives. I offered to pay more rent than I am now, to pay more than half of the deposit... Everything but flat out begging. I just want stability, it's not even about being attached to this roommate. I just can't deal with the fear and process of having to move in with a stranger and potential abuser.

 I wanted to get a pet so I could start to heal from losing my mom and dog back to back but I don't have the money. I want a therapy dog but I work on my feet and outside... Until I find a better job I'm stuck having to depend on others. I'm so sick of feeling like I have zero control over my life. I can't lackadaisically treat live like an \~adventure\~ because I'm poor and mentally ill."
The rage is killing me slowly.,1,m9muc8,3,"I suppose my ptsd is a bit different than most. I don’t feel most emotions anymore, I have become an enraged animal in a way.

I’m always angry, when I say angry I don’t mean normal anger, I mean crazed insane want to tear people apart angry. It’s like another personality inside me, a wild beast of nothing but pure violence and rage and my mind is the only thing keeping it in. I’ve been betrayed and abused by almost everyone I’ve known, have severe ptsd and am constantly on the verge of snapping. I’m not naturally violent either, I’ve just spent my whole life pushing down and suppressing this rage that I can’t feel anything but this now. I can just think of a memory and become enraged and it’s all I can do to control myself. Honestly idk how much longer I can live like this, I’m so exhausted from it and my willpower cannot last forever. I try to explain it but even my psychiatrist doesn’t understand or listen, I really wish it was in fact a tumor causing this but I don’t have medical insurance anymore so I can’t even get the mri I need. I’m just tired of the rage, of the madness in my head and pushing it down. I have been losing my mind even today just thinking about things that would just anger a normal person but send me into a near psychotic state and a part of me wonders why I’m like this. Yes I had an abusive youth, I’ve tried to kill myself several times when I was young, had people try to kill me and even been beaten by police and thrown in jail for something I didn’t do but what I have is like a wild animal clawing at a cage at people watching it. I wonder if honestly there’s something more than just ptsd, if it’s some kind of brain damage or something. I just know I can’t keep going like this but don’t know what to do."
"just over here, quietly losing my mind and trying to go on with my day to day life.",10,m9ky0m,3,"Ever remember something terrible that happened and have it trigger a runaway cascade event that triggers even more memories?

I've been remembering so much shit lately. I will never be able to say for certain if any of it is truly valid but it's vivid and a lot of it *does* make sense. I've talked to some people about it and they seem to think I imagined all of it. Which maybe I did, I don't know.

It mainly pertains to sexual abuse, sexual assault, and my time as a firefighter/EMT. I just packed a lot of things away. I want to talk to people about it but I'm afraid everyone will say I'm making it up. Maybe I am making it up. I don't know. It still feels invalidating as fuck.

How the hell could I possibly have all this shit happen to me? It seems improbable. I feel like an imposter."
I need guidance from people who have healed. I feel like a shell- idk how to socialize as well as consider yourself a worthy and valid human. I’m crying rn avoiding people in my apartment because I don’t know how to people anymore besides at work or with select friends from early childhood,101,m9kdfq,41,"Hello. 25f, probably unwell due to childhood abuse and sexual abuse/assault from a previous relationship.

I think with the emotional abuse/bullying from my mother, the lack of consistent positive interactions, my abusive father, and the sibling relationships that mirrored how our parents treated us I just never learned positive or correct social behaviors and I might have even been purposely not diagnosed for some type of autism (I can’t tell but people are hard and I know I do things out of the norm or too practical or formal and I don’t know if it’s learned behavior from acting to stay alive/safe or I just am not programmed the same?) and it took a while after hs to come to terms with the fact that I wasn’t ok and my shyness was a product of abuse/ptsd but also some ‘symptoms’ seem like autistic tendencies and I just don’t know how to learn how to talk to people or maintain friendships or not run away from people (both irl sometimes and avoiding them for months bc depression/anxiety?) sometimes. Like sometimes I feel ‘normal’ like I can put on the face I used to in hs ams be outgoing and other times I dissociate for weeks and I am empty and quiet and even when I open my mouth sound doesn’t come out (sometimes someone will call it out -usually it’s not brought up- and usually I am made fun of for being too practical or shy or not reacting as much as other people) and I don’t even know what to say even if I could be louder.

I don’t know if I’m just afraid of interacting with people and how they will treat me/dislike me bc of what I do or if this is how I am and therapy (for about 4-5 years now) hasn’t really helped with the learning to be human again and looking at my body and perceiving it as real and what happens when I stop dissociating or having extreme paranoia and after leveling off my constant flight/fight Mode as my therapist called it- like how do I enjoy being human and being in this body and living. How do I talk to people and know what to talk about and interact in groups without immediately wanting to leave bc I feel like I don’t belong to begin with. Like I am in my own house right now hiding upstairs bc I tried to sit w/ my boyfriend and his friends - and sometimes I can talk to them as I have seen more of them but rn (me and him are in a rough patch and might break up?-He is not acting like that is the case though all week and even in front of them now is being nice and sweet) even though he is being super nice and asking me to join I left a few times to go back upstairs without saying anything about it bcI am too shy to announce what I’m doing I can’t help feeling like I am coming off as rude. I also am constantly nervous I’m just not welcome and they know and talked about me and I know it’s in my head but I sat there and couldn’t even look at them or join a convo and how do I just practice or get used to it without wanting to cry in front of people just for sitting there"
In this alone,1,m9jjt6,0,"I got no one well besides my gf . I’ve always been kind of an outcast and it’s been worse after high school. I was beat, punched, scratched, kicked, burned and locked in a basement basically every other day until I was 12. I watched my mom walk out and leave when I was 6 seen my dad do drugs like cocaine and crack right next to me until I was 27 and I’ve seen him over dose 3 times. I am no one and I’ve done nothing with my life. Ive struggled my entire life. I have been in and out of jobs and now I’m on disability for severe ptsd. I watched my brother and step brother have all these connections through their parents and have all this help. They were both taken under someone’s wing and taken care of and trained or got jobs that way but not me. I’ve always had to do things on my own and I’m at the end now. I’m no one. Never went to school, tried to join the military but was disqualified. Worked basically everywhere. I live with my girlfriend who is very amazing but isn’t sure about us after 3 years because you know ptsd affects everyone and she saw me be suicidal a lot and even did the dumbest shit ever to get her to go away so I could kill myself. This past year I’ve been trying to get back on track and fix my self and our relationship. I did wrestle in high school and was lean but now I’m 29 and obese. she won’t have sex with me because I can’t breathe and I don’t blame her. I eat once maybe 2 times a day but that’s from depression I think idk I’m just not hungry. I tried to call my therapist but she won’t answer. We have this thing where if I’m struggling and doing badly mentally I call her and she’s there for me. I do call like maybe once every month besides our regular sessions but only when it gets to me needing help. she’s been really bad at picking up and it sucks because I need someone. I know she’s busy and not doing it to hurt me. I just hold shit inside until I can’t anymore and so me and my gf argue. she’s not attracted to me anymore because I put on weight I’m skinny fat got a gut lol. I’m trying to lose weight but it hurts so damn much. my body hurts beyond being sore and when we run she sees I can’t breathe and my legs give out on a light jog. it sucks so much because I use to run miles and was fit and now I have horrible purple stretch marks and have breathing problems. I get why my body is ugly to her. I just need help being motivated because right now I got nothing."
PTSD & Moral Injury,5,m9j4pe,3,"Last week my husband decided it was finally time for him to talk to a professional, and upon hearing our options, he decided to go for inpatient treatment for a month. I'm incredibly proud of him because he is active duty military and his job is a first responder position so I know how hard it was for him to choose this. 

His first week inpatient was completed and they told him that while he did in fact have PTSD because of the things he's seen at work, he also has moral injury because his life growing up in the LDS church was so sheltered, that when he left home and went into the military he expected to continue seeing the best of people, but what he began seeing was some of the absolute worst. 

Has anyone else been diagnosed with moral injury? How do you manage it daily? What have you found helps you, vs what doesn't help you for yourself and from your partner?"
"Recovering from what happened in 2020 is a true struggle. How have you coped, what's your story?",11,m9iocc,0,"My PTSD is the highest it has ever been for a sustained period (10 months counting at full over-drive 😬) from all the violence that happened last year in my city. How have you been coping with how 2020 effected you? What's your story? 

Here's mine:

 I wasn't doing well on 2019: I was on disability leave from work due to PTSD  (there was ashooting at my office) , and was in an IOP the day the pandemic hit; spend 13 months in almost complete isolation now - no job, no social contact. 

During George Floyd I got locked out of my apartment, alone, with a dying phone, in a city on the edge of open rebellion. I hid under a van, while police, protesters, and looters battled in the streets; I still have nightmares. I walked into a 711 for medicine and food, and a guy pulled a sawed-off on me. The National Guard occupied the city, even brought a tank. It wasn't safe to be outside for many days. 

It happened again in October afterover more police brutality and cerwfew. Then again in November when Trump came to the city, and Federal Forces showed up. Then again in January....I'm burned out from it all, of all the hatred, the killing, the beatings and guns.

I've been threatened on the street, and in line at the store for wearing a mask by militant Anti-Maskers. I've watch police interrogating people in the parking lot near my apartment, and guys in all camo with guns driving around flying alarming flags. Shit feels unreal sometimes; I dissociate and it feels like a bad dream. Other times I obsessed about it and have panic attacks, flash backs. I struggle to sleep and have nightmares every night. 

It's not like this everywhere. I'm moving away from all this in May becasue I can't living like this; its killing me. Everyone in my apartment building fights with eachother, everyone is so stressed. I'm a wreck, but I keep reminding myself that I'm surviving a historical catastrophe and one day ill look back on this and me able to say, "" yeah, I survived 2020 and I have a story to tell""."

My 5th home invasion in my life now has me absolutely shell shocked...,13,m9f7ep,7,"I contemplated even making this post but I think getting it out there & just expressing how I feel now might help my healing process. Nobody can really relate (or at least I feel like that) to my situation given how unique it is & the amount of times I have been violated. It’s hard for me to talk about it all without getting into a ginormous spiral of excitement & drastically overwhelming myself, too.

Anyway. You might ask yourself how a regular person manages to have something this unfortunate happen to them so many times. But it’s as unbelievable to me as it is to anybody who sits to listen to my story.  The best way to begin really I guess is to briefly explain each incident. (I will number them below)

1) The first home invasion I experienced was my home where I grew up in that resides in a nice suburban neighborhood (so it was very shocking to me & still is considering I don’t know who it was to this day) was broken into randomly and $50 stolen out of my room, nothing else. Cops were called and nothing came of it to this day.

2) My Dad’s old place got broken into by people my brother had beef with from school when we left to the gas station for 15 mins- they trashed our living room breaking our tv & stealing my dads pistol and laptop along with other belongings of ours. They ended up getting in trouble for it but it was just horrible given my little brother & my Dad & I didn’t have really any money to replace the things stolen and damaged. 

3) Then - I moved into my first place with my close buddy in a rather sketchier but still halfway decent side of town . My duplex got broken into by my friend who I consider my big bro that got all tweaked out on meth with his dad & thought it was a good idea to break into my place when I was at work. They stole $1200 and my safe, other belongings of mine. (Luckily to this day I have made up with him, he is clean & about to pay me back & I am thankful for that, though he truly hurt me & only added to my paranoia / ptsd. I never called the police or reported this given he is my good friend of many years & I love him . 

4) Then - within months later (At the same place as incident #3) I had linked up with a girl through a friend that I have known since I was young. We hit it off & I ended up doing the whole whoop with her (yea yea) & more or less- I found out that she had a boyfriend . And he was somebody according to others to ‘not be messed with’. Had I known this was his gf I wouldn’t of engaged in any sort of anything with her. But my actions were done & it was too late for me I guess. My roommate received a random phone call from him demanding to speak to me- to which he told him to kick rocks . It was weeks later before my lease was about to end that my bottom door to my music room was broken into. Luckily nothing was stolen- but I only had to do the math really to take an educated guess who had done this. I didn’t report this one either to the police as I was not mentally well & I just wanted out of my place I was living in given I did not feel safe at all with it being the second time my home had been violated.

Each time this has happened to me it has been when I am not home until this last recent incident (not even 2 months ago now) being incident #5.

5) I was standing in front of the tub on my bathroom in my boxers about to get in the shower with the water running & on my phone (wasting water yea I know sorry people). I thought I had heard the door open so & I walked around the corner to be met by 3 masked men that had entered my home through my front door that had been left unlocked mistakenly by my good long time friend from school who had just left about 30 mins earlier. I was injured attempting to defend my home (that was a sorry attempt given my gun that I carry was not on my person & across the bathroom in my pants still). I was pistol whipped multiple times splitting my head in 2 places & beaten to the ground . When I hit the ground it was mere seconds until my arms were forced out in front of me & they were zip tied . I was held at gun point bleeding badly and unable to hardly see / very hazy. 2 men ran my house as one stood there over me waving the gun to me and to my puppy who is not even a year old yet & thought it was play time basically jumping all around on and off the couch. They were inside for only minutes. One came out of my room and back into the living room and asked me what I have to which I said nothing & to please not hurt me. He returned in my room leaving me at gun point still on the ground with the other man. They then stormed out very shortly after he had re-entered my room and 2 of the 3 men kicked me once a piece in the side on there way out. I lost my pistol, $200 out of my wallet, about $70 in ones I had stored in a change jar and my phone. I live alone & have friends over often & am outside with my dog often as well. I believe that somebody cased my house , saw I lived alone & seen me as a target to be hit. I just can’t think of what for as I don’t have any sort of involvement in anything or any real beef with anybody. I stick to myself & for this to happen to me yet again and to this degree just has me overall fed up & completely shell shocked. I feel like I am never safe. I called the police & reported my stolen weapon obviously - but nothing still has came out of the case itself. I was hospitalized just for the night with a CT scan done to make sure my head was okay enough to go home & was released after I got some staples in my head . I now suffer from intense headache / migraines that occur randomly (post concussion symptoms) but luckily the medicine I am taking for it now helps that quite a bit. 

With all of these things happening to me. I just feel like it is something that will always happen to me . And I know that is a far fetched way to think- but it just feels like it is a pattern that is unbreakable - and I don’t know why it keeps happening . I cry at night often. I have panic attacks through the day that my home is at risk with me not there. Sometimes when I am home I can be okay and then the next minute I feel like I need to get out my gun & have it loaded ready to go. It’s a horrible , horrible way to feel. My heart rate increases to where I can feel my heart pound in my chest, my nose I can feel shake on my face , and I can’t help but turn to a stone &amp;  not speak or completely break down. I am getting help currently through therapy & a psychiatrist and have for years now. But now my doctor wants to change my treatment I have had for so long that’s helped me which makes 0 sense & is a fight in itself currently to keep it the same to maintain my mental stability. It makes no sense , and that along with other very unfortunate events like my little brother about to be going to federal prison for a very long time here that are weighing on me / stressing me out to the max. 

But the main point of this post is me trying to just vent & get this out there. This is my life. It isn’t what I asked for. But it’s my life. I just hope somebody sees this & maybe has any good words for me in this time of me healing & as I am trying to learn to cope. Always be vigilant and keep your eyes peeled. I guess this world isn’t as safe as I thought it was. I know it isn’t a warzone in my city or in this country. But I feel like sometimes when I wake up that’s exactly where I am & that neither me or my belongings are safe.

What stories or articles would you like to see on PTSD?,12,m9byx1,15,"Hi, all! I do some content writing on the side and a mental health website is going to start paying me to write for them. As someone who lives with C-PTSD and other conditions, I'd like to focus at least some of the writing on PTSD and have some ideas. However, I'd love to hear from others who live with PTSD or love someone who lives with PTSD to get an idea of what types of stories or other content would be beneficial. 

Any and all ideas are appreciated, and thank you for taking the time to read this!"
Can someone just tell me I'll fuckin live through this?,26,m9b2ma,16,"Been sexually abused at 15 by my father (currently 21f) and I have ptsd, anxiety, depression, and if overthinking was a thing I swear the docs would diagnose me with it. It's annoying and frustrating af waking up everyday with flashbacks and worries in my own household.

Don't get me wrong, I'm safe. I just don't feel it at times. I feel like it gets to the point where I dont think I'll make it past the age of 25. I dont wanna keep annoying the RAINN hotline with my anxiety attacks.

I'm not alone right? I dont want anyone to go what I am going through but I want someone to relate, I feel so alone.

I can't even be in a relationship. I dont feel like I have a ""home""

I dont feel like it will get better.

I just need to hear it from someone else.

How the hell does this get better?"
Does anyone feel undeserving of their diagnosis?,11,m98xbc,12,I know the majority of people think only veterans or people who have gone through extremely dangerous situations have ptsd. I was diagnosed by my therapist due to an act of assault against me by my ex boyfriend. I don’t think I can ever accept this diagnosis even though I know i’m struggling I just don’t see anyone who can relate to me. Nightmares come rarely and I don’t get flashbacks. I also started getting bad years after the event happened. I feel really embarrassed being part of this community when my struggle doesn’t compare nearly as much as the other people who have suffered.
I have PTSD from working healthcare during covid,18,m98koq,1,"I've seen so many people in my nursing home, that I've known for years die from covid. I was there when they took their last breath. I was there when family wasn't. The pressure of these experiences hurts me so much. It's so hard going to work because I'm so scared of being the last person someone sees. I'm scared of having another covid outbreak. I'm scared of not knowing. 

The amount of people that know me by first name, and that I took care of that asked me ""am I going to die?"" Has broken me. And even if they do live through it most people left physically disabled. I've seen about 22 people; all from my unit die. 

How do I get better at possessing this, and how do I stop feelings so awful about work."
I feel like a burden,12,m96f4i,1,"I don’t feel like I’m deserving of love. Whether that’s romantic or the love you receive from friends. I have nothing to give back to them except for a load of garbage that my fucked up childhood has thrown on me. I feel it’s unfair for me to get involved into someone elses life because the only thing I ever do is destroy things. I can’t maintain healthy relationships and everyone seems to leave me in the end. I know I’m a lot to deal with and a lot of people just want positive energy around them, but I just wish someone would stay. I don’t have faith in my recovery anymore and don’t think I’ll ever find people that I can get along with. Things are getting harder every year and it’s hard to see things get better any time soon."
Has PTSD played a part in you walking away from God?,121,m95sgh,80,"I was raised in a ""Christian home"", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?

Even if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: 

\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.

\- God is good.

\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.

These phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. 

Perhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. 

If there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.

I'm sorry for the rant, but I had to get this out. Thanks for listening."
How to feel less like I’m on auto pilot and be more present.,3,m921ar,0,"TW: murder, grooming

I am just venting here but when I was 18 (5 years ago) my childhood best friend was kidnapped and murdered. I’ll save all the details but I was a part of the search team and such and it was an extremely life altering experience and very traumatic. Before that I have to admit I lived a fairly blissful and sheltered life (parents super religious) aside from fighting a lot with my mom (I was also an angsty teen) but after this event a lot changed. They were my best friend and I couldn’t cope with going back to college and working and just being a person and I just tried to block out every memory of them, which was a lot of memories particularly throughout high school. Also looking back, I was groomed by a much older man from 17-18 but he introduced me to drugs (nothing crazy, but hallucinogens) which was also a lot to deal with. I didn’t realized I was I was groomed until therapy, I thought it was a consensual relationship and I was just mature but he was 31 and I was 17 so...yeah. After my friend died everything felt like a blur. I was constantly getting high and drunk, constantly severely anxious, and violently depressed and had vivid disturbing nightmares (I also didn’t realize this was PTSD until therapy). After a horrible night of overdosing at 20 I quit all drugs cold turkey and haven’t touched anything since. That and therapy helped a lot.

Fast forward and I met an amazing supportive partner, mended relationships with family, made amazing friends, got a cute cat, and went to therapy as I feel like I’ve stated a lot here haha. One thing I’ve noticed though is I still sometimes just feel like I’m on autopilot. Like everything is going by so fast. I started Zoloft about two months ago after having severe panic attacks again and although that has helped a lot, I still just go through times where I just feel weird? I don’t know how to explain it other than feeling disassociated but it’s like I recognize it more in hindsight. My memory is still all jumbled up (I also got diagnosed with hypothyroidism which doesn’t help the memory stuff) and I just feel like things are flying by sometimes. I usually feel like I’m better and things are better but it’s just like I can never quite feel the same as I once did about myself and life and everything. It’s not depressing, it’s just confusing? 


Has anyone else experienced this? Do I need to up my Zoloft dose lmao? I feel like I’m in the prime of my life (in my twenties) but I also feel old. I want things to just slow down. I feel like all of this happened a while ago and I just wish it would stop affecting me. I feel like a different person (better in tons of ways, but worse in some others) I left out a lot of other weird crazy shit that’s happened between now and then but idk I’m kinda rambling but basically things just feel like they’re flying by me and I just want fix that and feel more present and in control more often. If you’ve made it this far, any advice on how to do that?"
Why do you think so many resources for ptsd in women and victims of abuse is focused on codependency? Why the intolerance for otherwise “healthy” victims?,11,m91v0a,12,"I first tried AlAnon and later Sanon since they were specific to the kind of trauma I’d experienced. Instead of focusing on healing from abuse, they seemed to do the opposite. After being in 3-4 different “chapters”(?), I felt that they normalized the abuse and paradoxically labeled any reasonable trauma response as part of the codependent traits that needed to be corrected. I can’t speak for them, but as a non-codependent, it seemed at best, the blind leading the blind and at worst, predatory. There’s something distinctly off about telling codependent abuse victims to rely on a (male) “higher power” while simultaneously indoctrinating them that they’re somehow implicit in their own abuse. Bottom line is there was no support for someone who was focused on they’re own recovery, not the addict. I tried and never got anything out of it. 

In fact, the referral to AlAnon came from his addiction counselor and everyone I knew after I left him and was directly responsible for the door opening up for him to cause unspeakable trauma for another three years. 

I called around for support groups for ptsd, victims of abuse, betrayal trauma, etc looking for the right fit. When I talk to the people who run these groups, they’re asking about my experience and without fail, they start to project on me. It’s like there’s no room for a non-codependent person and that my presence as such is some kind of threat. 

Everything I say is twisted around to fit the codependent narrative trying to force me to admit to mindsets and feelings I don’t have under the premise of wanting to help me not have them. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been baselessly called an “empath” or “a caretaker” on one of these short calls. They don’t accept a polite no and frustrate themselves trying to force it. Next thing I know I’ve got a hostile person on the line and I’m shaking because this is the exact kind of word twisting and manipulation my abuser did. 

I empathize with people who are struggling with codependent patterns but it seems there is no room for a “healthy” or otherwise balanced person to get help with ptsd. I want to regain normal function from very real symptoms like paralysis, or shaking, or my physical body shutting down due to subconscious stress.

So why is there such low tolerance and little help for a non-codependent victim of abuse? Isn’t the ptsd enough to focus on in a ptsd group? Why do I have to fit a narrative of being “attracted to” red flags? Or trying to “fix” someone? What about the rest of us?"
I have a lot of problems in my life. Am I REALLY the problem?,0,m91cj1,2,"I have a lot of horrible relationships, especially to other people I don't know online. I get blamed all the time for everything. I have a lot of shit going on in me every day like I'm going through madness. I feel the need to post on Reddit to get relief and approval. Some of the time, I would, but only for a little while. Other times, people would say that I'm the problem, how dramatic or stupid I am, etc. It's like one little jeer and I fall into a hole of insanity. The same jeers go through my head from every morning I wake up, every night I go to bed, and even in the dreams I have. I have a rough time standing up for myself without either feeling guilty or foolish, someone roasting me back with something even clever, or running away to sob. I hide my guilt with my anger a bunch of times in my life. I hate the thought of giving in to my insulters, blamers, and accusers because it would end up being my loss for their gain. I learned that while dealing with a troll, it made me look worse while everyone actually sympathized with him and took it all out on me.

I feel painfully shamed even if I'm being applauded. It's like whenever I feel proud of myself, I end up feeling guilty soon after because I feel like I'm showing narcissism. Yes, I have a lot of problems, especially personal ones. But am I the problem like everyone says? Are they right about me? Am I truly the problem?"
Feeling extremely afraid currently; experiencing my first real trigger - alone.,4,m90j5n,3,"TW: rape/near death

My grandmother told me that there would be a power outage from 9pm-6am, but never told me the date. Well, the date is today and I will be handling this alone. I have not slept in almost 2 days now. Things have not been good in my life. And I’m always terrified to sleep after being awake so long because it feels like.. the night he had his hands around my throat. It feels like dying and so I tend to just stay up until I physically can’t. 

But, here’s the thing. I very very rarely ever get truly triggered by anything - especially to the extent I am currently. I’m literally in tears, shaking. I just got off the phone with a good friend who offered to pick me up (I’m on Xanax and stuff so I can’t drive) and let me spend the night there, but.. I just,. I don’t want the first time I meet his wife (who, despite us having not met in person yet, have become very very close because she deals with a lot of the disabilities I do). 

I have my dog. I made sure to do a lock check. My phone is only at 20%, so I don’t know what I’ll do when it dies, but.. I wish I knew why I was so afraid. I’m not afraid of the dark, maybe I’m afraid of what or who is in it? 

Another reason I decided to stay home is because.. I’ve felt extremely weak lately. Physically mostly but emotionally as well. I feel like this is some test from God or the universe or whatever is out there. To prove to myself that I am strong and that I can do this and that it’s going to be okay.

I just wish I knew why this effected me so strongly."

Sometimes I think though, what if all of my symptoms disappear? Because I do remember a time where I didn’t feel this way, I remember when I could work and not dissociate or have a panic attack. I always think about this, what if I’m faking? What if I could just turn it off?

How to form meaningful healthy relationships,4,m8qq71,5,"In any interpersonal relationship; friends, romantic relationships, acquaintances, classmates, I have it always goes 1 of 2 ways. I either have a stone wall put up or I give too much of myself. 85% of the time it's the stone wall and I get people thinking I don't like them or that I am cold and distant. 15% of the time it's the other extreme. The 15% extreme happened again recently with an older student who is my supervisor. I shared more than most people do about my life and struggles and have a closer relationship with him than other supervisor/supervisee relationships. It's nothing romantic, maybe I just wanted support and he was willing to listen to me...maybe because I think he's really great at what he does so it meant more to hear his opinion of me...idfk...but I cried and got so angry with myself because I messed up again and now I feel weird about it...Why does it have to be either extreme? Why can't I be in the middle with relationships, why can't I be normal? I'm 27 and I still struggle with this. I told my therapist this incident and she said it is common for people who experience severe trauma to feel these extremes and struggle to have relationships that are in the middle. My internet kept cutting out during therapy so I couldn't work through this and I still feel really sad about it. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to connect with people while staying in the middle of both extremes? Or have any skills or used any resources that helped you? I'm willing to give almost anything a fair shot as long as it is safe and reasonable for me to do so.. Thank you 
Sorry for the long post."
Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse),149,m8psfb,18,"TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again. 

I am starting to enjoy sex again and I'm just so happy I do. They haven't ruined it forever for me, I can heal and it's me that gets the credit for that. I am taking my power back."
I just got diagnosed with ptsd and I just want to talk to people who can relate,9,m8ph00,7,"The title says it all, I just got diagnosed with ptsd  and I just want to talk to people who experience what I experienced. From a young age I was abused by my father, both physically and emotionally. (Trigger warning) At first it was getting hit by the belt or for speaking out, then it was fist. As I got older the physical abuse stopped but it became verbal abuse, every single day I’d hear how much of a piece of shit I am. I was 8 when I’d heard him call me that and it never stopped. I never understood why I felt like this when I was younger, I remember I’d get really scared to talk to people, and shake a lot, I would hear voices of my father in my head and I still do. I would tell my dad because he was the only person I could talk to because I was scared of talking to adults. He would tell me it was nothing and I was just over reacting and to not bother him. So I never got therapy or diagnosed until now. I had therapy for a while and just got a diagnosis from a psychiatrist and I just really want to talk to others who feel like I feel. Thank you for reading this and I hope you have a good day."
"Teacher thinks I'm faking it all (my gender dysphoria, PTSD, and panic attacks)",13,m8p1xh,10,"So... about a month or 2 back, I wasn't able to get my homework done. I got kept after school, and they were sympathetic about it at first. Still wasn't able to get it done, and this second time they yelled at me for it. Even guilt tripped me into making my other teacher cry. In addition, that other teacher told me what she went through (during the first time after school) and yelled at me for not getting it done even though she told me that. They saw me harming myself and did nothing but call me an attention seeker. After that, I haven't been the same. Every day is living hell for me.  Fast forward to yesterday, I texted my dad to pick me up as I felt like I was about to have a panic attack. When my teacher found out I did this, I was trying to hide it by pretending to be upbeat around my friends, joking around a bit. She yelled at me in front of everyone and I broke down. She then thought I was 'acting'. Next thing you know, my teachers won't let me use my phone while others can and they told everyone to not call me by my preferred name and pronouns. Now even when texting my sister I feel hesitant to talk about this stuff even though she fully understands and knows I'm not a faker. If I moved schools, I'd be bullied again (one of my traumas was being bullied for 3 years) so I don't know what to do anymore."
Intensified nightmares with weighted blanket :(,1,m8o4fn,2,"Every time I use a weighted blanket to sleep, I sleep better and longer, but have the most vivid nightmares, or at least I can remember them better.

I’ve pretty used to them and can start my day okay, but will still be thinking about these images all day."
Husband laughed at comic about strangulation,16,m8muye,6,"So last night my husband was reading Calvin and Hobbes (which is great) to our daughter. They were reading for a while (which is great) but nothing was ""haha"" funny, just kind of funny. Then he got to this part where the mom says something like ""if it weren't for \_\_\_\_ I'd be choking you right now"" and my husband laughs about it.

The problem is about 10 years ago he strangled me and left bruises on my neck and face and chest and I was in pain for months every time I even swallowed water. Last night was perfect other than that. I didn't want to spoil the evening so I said nothing even though I found it very triggering and kind of bizzare on his part as I've explained to him that he can't make jokes about strangling people (he used to) since he HAS STRANGLED ME.

AITA for being so upset about it? And now it's the weekend and I don't want to wreck our weekend by saying something (he's a narcissist and so calling him on this would mean he's probably verbally abuse me and blame me for wrecking the weekend for all of us etc., it would mean a big fight)."
Hot flashes and involuntary movements / mumbling when I get flashbacks..what is this??,4,m8lqez,0,"I have no idea if this is a PTSD related thing, but I was in a weird relationship that super messed me up like two or three years ago. I get flashbacks to things at least 3 or 4 times a day, and when the flashbacks hit I immediately just blurt out ""no"" or ""f*ck"" or whatever. This is really annoying because its a reaction to the memory, and I've honestly had it come up in meetings before and I've had to play it off like I didn't just blurt out a string profanities under my breath. 

Ontop of the verbal stuff I get really jumpy and have to move or run my hands through my hair or just anything. I often get really over heated too when it hits and it typically lasts for like 5 or 10 seconds. 

Anyone know what I'm about talking about or can relate in some way? If so, any tips?"
Intrusive thoughts and delusions,3,m8l9sx,0,"
Any advice would be appreciated. So I’m feeling pretty down and kind of embarrassed, there’s a few things I want to talk about. It really terrifies me and embarrasses me how much my anxiety from PTSD can warp my brain. 

I saw this picture on Pinterest which was posted under a nice drawing post, it said “turn your phone to read” and when I did it said “if you dont repost this this will be the worst week of your life” I was panicked, and surprised I was panicked, this was clearly made by a kid and I’m supposed to be an adult why am I freaking out? My brain is pulling together and identifying the effects of the “curse”.

Ive become extremely paranoid and refused to read my emails incase ive manifested a rejection letter from University from this...its so humiliating that this has bothered me so much I feel like I’m crazy. I’ve been already anxious about my university application, I’m applying to a lower level prep course so that I can progress but work on my inner child.

Ive spent all my energy and time even though I’m struggling badly to make large portfolios and organise it, everyone has been telling me my work is impressive and that there’s nothing to worry about and I’ve already been accepted to the higher level course at another University but my brain is making me feel sick with intrusive thoughts, I guess its insecurity, I guess I feel I don’t deserve it deep down. The intrusive thoughts spiral as I feel I’m almost tempting the fate of failure by thinking about it happening due to these thoughts which generate more. 

this is my first time applying on my own and I feel if I fail I can only blame myself I know a lot of this is to do with childhood insecurity but when the thoughts are there I feel like my future is crumbling and Its my fault identifying intrusive thoughts has helped but admittedly they break my confidence. I feel like I should be confident against the odds and a fighter but I feel shaky and like I’m merely surviving."
NDE and it keeps replaying in my mind (NSFW),12,m8kxdv,4,"This is a big trigger warning. I’m sorry if this hurts anyone who reads it.

Someone tried to murder me with a large knife. I was stabbed in the lung and was bleeding to death, I accepted I was going to die while I laid on the concrete. The ambulance came, took me to the hospital...I had a bit of hope.

In trauma I started to pass out and I heard the loud voices and racing around for a blood transfusion for me. I lost two liters of blood and I couldn’t breathe. But I accepted once again that I wasn’t going to make it and was sad that this is how I was going to die but so it goes. It was calm, somber, but okay.


I survived and made a 100% recovery physically. But that NDE absolutely shattered me mentally. It bothers me every day (it’s been about a year since the incident) to think that I accepted death and was willing to go. Nothing has been the same since. I have a therapist and I’m trying to cope but the little things all seem meaningless now. I know it sounds so emo and dramatic, but it’s how I feel most days. I somehow always wind up back on the table in the trauma center, looking at the ceiling and feeling like I’m gonna die again. It’s not a flashback per se, but more of a washing over of sadness again. 

I don’t know what the point of this post was. It just feels good to say it to people who understand."

I hate how I've been treated by the people in my life closest to me and I cannot forgive it,36,m8ecyb,3,"TW: self-harm, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, emotional abuse, and trauma

I've dealt with mental illness (including C-PTSD), drug addiction, and emotional abuse. I feel worn down and tired. The past year with chronic pain has pushed me to a breaking point. This is something I really want to scream about as an aspect of my life that causes me a lot of pain I can't cope with. The only way to describe it is misery. I think I've cried too many times, I just want to be heard in any capacity.

I started using drugs after having my anxiety professionally treated by being diagnosed as-needed Ativan, which was for panic attacks when I was around 10-11? So from then on, consistently through my early teens (later made daily, changed to Xanax). Taking a pill makes me feel better, clearly, so what if I did more. Having relief of any kind was prioritized, potential harm didn’t matter because I had no reason to care about myself. If a chronically anxious and depressed teenager is already suicidal and harming themselves then overdosing doesn’t matter. When my mom found out I started smoking and abusing substances around 15 is the point she began yelling at me directly in my face. I was more miserable and considered abusing drugs worth the yelling, I started shutting myself down mentally to deal with it when it happened.

About 16 my dad physically walked out, my parents never loved each other, I was used to them verbally arguing loudly since I was really young. My mom berated my dad and criticized him constantly. She will claim she never yelled, which is a bald-faced lie to make to a child who could hear their parents arguing in their closed room from the kitchen downstairs. He gradually started shutting down and then left. After that, her anger was transferred to me because I was the oldest child in the house. I don’t forgive my dad for leaving, never will, because the verbal abuse wouldn’t have escalated towards me specifically if he wasn’t a coward who knowingly abandoned his kids with a wife that he — as a grown man that served in the military for around 30 years — took drastic measures to get away from.

The drug addiction ramped up from there and became my primary focus in life. My grades never slipped but I put forth zero effort, I was high at school and blacked out a lot from that time period, wish I had treatment as an option. My mom turned it into something that felt like a game that functioned to make the abuse more extreme. To have it acknowledged that I had in my possession weed, a pipe, and 30-40 hydrocodone pills directly by my mother at 16 but receive no help besides a lecture about felonies (my dad knew, shrugged about it to my face)... and then for my older brother I idolize to question my integrity as a person when I escalated to heroin in 2020 was demoralizing. Stigma from drug use has severely damaged my relationship with him, that’s when he started dismissing any time I contacted him out of desperation that my mom was abusing me. Everyone wants to be pissed off at you but not acknowledge that you were suffering pretty fuckin openly for years and getting worse.

\[My mother knew that I was on drugs the entire time I was using heroin, from the literal first time I picked it up, but for some reason waited a few months to randomly drug test me to prove how she was right. I guess so I would become physically addicted and consumed by it, so she could then force me to cold-turkey withdrawal for a week under the threat of cutting me off completely.\]

This is a vent about things I’ve been pissed off about before, many times, but god damn it sucks. Had input from my current therapist that she didn’t think I had a chance once I was put on benzodiazepines and I probably would have never become a drug addict otherwise. But addicts are terrible people, so clearly any treatment towards me has been deserved. Just ask the person who responded to me once by saying “but you did do heroin”, my brother."
Does anyone else experience noise sensitivity related (or not) to their trauma?,25,m8drnu,8,"tw sexual assault  


I started struggling with noise sensitivity when the pandemic started because everyone was always at home and because the memories of sexual assault emerged. At first I thought it was just extreme anxiety (I remember I was sensitive when my brother played the guitar years ago). I lived with very loud people so noise during the day led to panic attacks, I couldn't escape it. Then I moved to a nicer place with quiet flatmates and I gradually got used to the noise. If anything, I just get annoyed at loud sounds when I have a bad day but it never gets really bad. Apart from the night time... Unfortunately, I had another incident happen recently and someone accused me of lying which destroyed my sleeping pattern. Since then, I've been having sleep anxiety, I had to start taking anxiety medication that helps a bit. A new flatmate also moved in recently and he likes cooking at night (my room is right next to the kitchen). I told him to be quieter which he is now but not completely so I still have panic attacks sometimes. I'm also quite anxious when he's around simply because we never talk (he doesn't seem to be home most of the time). My therapist says it's because I don't feel safe at night and possibly fear being attacked. And I try affirmation to fight it, I wear earplugs, play white noise and sometimes wear ear defenders but I can still hear him moving the plates. I guess it's possible his presence itself makes me anxious. Is anyone dealing with anything similar? I wonder if you found a way to cope? I don't know anyone with a similar problem so would be nice to connect with someone."
My heart physically hurts when i get flashbacks or think about what happened to me.,102,m8d1vd,14,"It is absolutely horrible. I have had every test done, heart is perfectly fine as are my arteries.. I am 24. Every time i get a flashback or think about my trauma, it feels like my heart breaks into pieces and i have a huge pit in my stomach that won’t leave for days. It’s like my heart physically hurts from sadness. 

I try to avoid thinking about it, but it happens sometimes and i need to recover for days. My muscles are sore, my head hurts, i feel like i have the flu. No one understands this and i feel like i’m a whiny child. I wish i could just suck it up but i just can’t do it anymore, i am so tired and still getting pushed by authorities to work, go to a million sessions, phonecalls, meet ups while breaking apart further and further mentally and physically but it doesn’t matter to them. If i skip something, there will be consequences i can not take and are probably even worse than my life right now.

I am completely broken, physically and mentally, but they are still pushing me to do all these things because “its good for you” and it will “make you feel better”. I wish. 

I hate my life. I have no control over it because i have no money and have PTSD. I pray i will die peacefully in my sleep so i don’t have to live like this anymore."
"TW: Cancer, abuse, death",2,m8d1p2,0,"How do I cope? I’m a 23 year old who was abused up until age 20. I don’t remember the childhood abuse from my mom much, mainly my dad. But as I turned 13 or so, it got bad with my mom. Eventually years later we found out she had cancer and only had so much time left to live. I was basically her spouse at this time. I was 17-19 and just. Raising my siblings, working, cleaning the house, taking care of her (dressing her, cleaning surgery wounds, giving her shots). Eventually I realized I needed to get out (she pulled me out of school at 12 so I had no connections and if I had left, I was homeless and would be on the street and had no clue what to do) so I talked to an online friend and planned to move in with him. Two weeks after I told her she told me she thought she was dying and that it was my fault because I broke her heart by wanting to move out. A week later, she went into the hospital for labored breathing and later died that week, on my birthday haha. It’s been three years and I still don’t know how to fucking cope.

TW: he's doing better now and i am still so stuck,1,m8b774,3,"Boyfriend is currently playing video games with friends haha, so I guess I'm yelling about this here.

I know I shouldn't have. I kick myself every time I do, but god it's like I can't stay away. I have secret accounts, 0 followers and 0 following, that I used to use to just vent to the void. Occasionally I'll use them to check up on an old bully or someone I hate so their recommended doesn't show up on my personals, but I can still see if they still seem like a p.o.s. I've had these accounts for years, even before we ever met. When we were dating, he had no idea. I barely ever spoke. Barely got the chance to speak, really. I never talked about myself unless it was about my parents, my sexual assault, or my various mental illnesses, but he didn't really know me.

We fell in love in the spring, made it official in the fall, and he finally showed me his true self throughout the entire winter. Winter is now the most triggering part of the year. But the worst of it is during the seasonal changes. Fall going into winter, he slowly became worse, we slowly became worse. He was a master manipulator, and I watched myself become so much more timid, apologetic, and small. All I did was for him. I just wanted to make him happy. If he was happy, then we would be okay. I wanted to be beautiful for him. I wanted to be perfect for him. I would starve myself to stay pretty and petite for him. I shoved away all my friends so I could give him all of my time. If we fought, it was always me that fucked up, I didn't fight for him enough. I didn't show him enough love. I wasn't being authentic enough for him. I'd try to explain why this was happening, that I didn't mean to hurt him, I didn't mean to make him cry, that I was so sorry and I'll do better next time. But he would keep me there, locked in his car, screaming and crying because he just wants someone who loves him as much as he loved them, and I wanted so very badly to show him that I did. He'd ignore me for days after a fight, tell me he never wants to speak to me again, and then after he missed me, he'd beg for me back, say he doesn't care if I'm not perfect, that he loves me and he wants to work with me to be better, and I was so grateful that he gave me a second chance. And then a third. And a fourth. And a fifth. And a sixth. And every time I thought I really did lose him this time, how could I? How could I be such a monster to hurt him like that? How could I be so stupid? He'd tell me, ""god I love you, but I really don't like you."" And I'd say with a half smile, ""yeah, I understand.""

I knew when he was angry immediately. I learned how to sense it, even before knowing for sure. One time, we were in the car with friends, singing badly to some sad song we all loved, thinking everything is fine, but I suddenly felt incredibly uneasy, so I look over, and he wasn't singing. He was staring straight ahead. His face was blank, and he wouldn't meet my eyes at all. I felt my heart drop to my stomach, and nudged him a little, but he ignored me. We were on the way to a local play a friend was in, one that I didn't really know that well, we never really spoke. There was this big cast dinner right before it, and he dropped us off and went to go park the car. I went to the bathroom, and came out hoping to sit next to him. I didn't know anybody there really except my group, but they were all  talking to other people about inside jokes I didn't know and I just wanted to hold his hand while we ate. I wanted to know what was up, because he seemed so happy before we left. I was planning on asking him. And I get a text. He's not coming anymore. ""Go have a good time,"" he says, ""I'm turning my phone off. I won't answer if you call. Don't worry about me. I'm going for a walk. I'll see you in 3 hours."" I knew I was being tested. I didn't see it that way at the moment, but in the back of my mind, I knew that if I did not go look for him, he would leave again. I wouldn't have shown him that I loved him. And I didn't give a fuck about this dumb play with these people I've never spoken to. I didn't want him to be alone out there, walking in freezing October rain. If he was going to suffer, I was too. I spent the next 3 hours walking around with a flashlight, trying to conserve my phone's 15% battery, searching the entire woods around us, the entire shopping center, the entire community play area, some neighborhood nearby, a baseball field, anywhere he could possibly be. All I had on was some skinny jeans, a t shirt, and a jean jacket with a hood, but I ignored the biting cold and my soaked jacket because my discomfort didn't matter, what mattered was finding him and making sure he was okay. My phone eventually died, and I became more distraught. It was getting darker, and I couldn't see where I was stepping anymore, so I finally resigned and hoped to wait for him by the car. I sat there for another 30 minutes, the play had finished, and everyone came back asking where the hell was he, since he was our only ride. They all went inside again to wait, but I stayed right there on the hood of the car. He finally came back, looking down, hands in his jeans, and opened the door without saying a word. I sat inside and asked him ""what the fuck?"" He was pissed. I should have left him be. He didn't owe me anything for looking for him. What did I expect when I practically abandoned him to lie just to fit in with our friends? That he expected it from Girl1, or Girl2 but me??? That I knew how uncomfortable the song I was singing out loud made him, but I just pretended like nothing happened, like everyone else has. Nobody actually gives a shit when it's hard to, and I was no exception. I almost didn't take him seriously. All this, over a song?? And I was hurt, and angry, and I just wanted him to fucking apologize for leaving like that and worrying the shit out of us just because he was mad at me. But he was getting more and more angry, more defensive, and I was getting overwhelmed. He sounded on the verge of tears, and I was already starting to tear up myself. I couldn't speak. He begged me to just say something. I didn't know why I couldn't. I wanted to. And he finally breaks, and begs, ""god, why? why doesn't anyone ever fight for me?"" I managed to choke out, ""I'm sorry."" He just sighed. And then I break. ""I'm sorry. I should've just let you go. I know you were overwhelmed. I'm sorry for not putting you first when I knew you were uncomfortable. I love you, please. Just. I really missed you."" ""I missed you too."" I reached for his hand, and he rubs the back of mine with his thumb. Our friends start coming back when they see me crying, but he goes ""it's okay, seriously, we were just talking."" We drop them all off back home, then ride back to my place in complete silence. He pulled into my drivethrough. ""Goodnight."" ""goodnight, hun."" I walked into my room, and cried for the rest of the night. And it wouldn't at all be the last time anything like this happened. And it would only get worse almost every other day, or at least every week, for the next two months.

We would eventually break up that December. I was devastated, and so unbelievably worn down emotionally. I had two real friends at the time, and they were truly the only two keeping me sane. But the toxicity didn't end there at all. he'd write songs about me, that shittier friends would send me. he would stalk me over the next three months. he screamed one of these songs during a cabaret we were both performing at, a cover that he changed the lyrics to as a direct attack at me specifically. I had stormed out sobbing violently and yelled at him what the fuck. It was then when he told me I didn't deserve to even look at him. I still had 2 other classes with him, but I couldn't even look at him. He told me I was a monster. He told me he wish he knew how much of a coward I was when we met, so he could've avoided all of it. i almost attempted suicide that night. if someone i would have given my life for could say such things to me, if i hurt him enough for him to tell me that, then i didnt deserve to live. 

When we first broke up, I would spend hours looking through his account, seeing the pictures he kept up indirecting me while we were together, or commenting on his own lovey posts about me saying ""go fuck yourself,"" or changing former captions about love songs to things like ""haha nvm."" It was like a form of punishment. I would torture myself, because I deserved to be tortured, and I didn't ever want to let myself forget what I did to him. Sometimes, before things were as hostile, if he made an indirect post that seemed like he was sad, I would message him saying ""hey. Just wanted to check up on you."" I couldn't let him go for months. And then, one night in March, something in my mind flipped, and I suddenly realized how angry I was. How unbelievably unfair it was for him to treat me like he did. And I spent the rest of the spring uncovering the depth of my trauma almost every day. And stalking him through social media didn't feel like as much of a punishment, but more like I had a right to. He told me I couldn't look at him, well fuck that. I was going to look at every single fucking thing he did. And I was going to let myself become infuriated, every new indirect post, I would make my own vent one about how bullshit it was. How bullshit he was. And yet, even if I thought I didn't love him anymore, and I supposedly hated him, and I'm doing this out of pure spite, I still just couldn't let him go. 

It's been 2 years now. 
And eventually, I grew more, and I found someone so much better, and I became responsible, and I tried so hard to heal despite that when winter rolls around I become increasingly suicidal and irrationally terrified, and despite the nightmares that would come almost every single night of me trapped inside his car, despite the fact that the feeling of cold air on any bare skin makes me want to cry, scream, sob, and throw up immediately, despite being unable to see white priuses without falling into panic attacks thinking it's him, and despite the flashbacks with a million stupid fucking triggers like someone grabbing my wrists, or certain ariana grande songs, or the taste of my favorite trident watermelon twist bubble gum.

but God, fucking damn it.
god damn it.
I still haven't been able to let him go.
i still find myself searching his account when im feeling really low, wondering how he is, whether he's doing well. 
and he barely posts, but i usually assume that he's just as damaged and shitty as he used to be.
Until he posted another new song.
And it's a part 2 of an instrumental song that he had made for us when we were together.
The original was complex and soft and bittersweet, representing a romanticized version of our fights, where we(he) blew up, but then come down as we realize how hurt we were and how much we wanted to forgive each other. It was representative of all the goodbyes we made, believing this was the last time, wanting to share one last kiss, one last hug, sharing one last joke, and one last glance. 
This newer one was captioned something like ""been doing pretty damn fucking good lately. Things are looking up.""
I couldn't listen to more than a minute of it because of how completely different it felt. It's this metal guitar instrumental, and it's passionate and fast paced and angry. It's almost like a complete fuck you compared to the old song.

And so I looked more at his account, and a friend of his commented on the post promoting his song. Apparently they're in a band together now. Apparently they have an ep out. And they even have a tiktok. And in all the videos, he looks so goofy, and happy, and like he finally found people who he can really relate to.

And again, god, I know I shouldn't have looked, because you will always find. But it's like I'm addicted and I don't know how to stop. I've tried blocking him, I've tried deleting my accounts, but when I'm severely depressed and I have much less impulse control, I just find new ways, make new accounts. 

I feel like I'm so fucking stupid
I'm still so fucking stuck in the past
It's been 2 years and I just can't move on, even if I do move forward. I mean I have a great job now, I'm saving up for a van to move into with the love of my life, I have so many plans once I don't need to save as much (basically my entire paycheck after necessities) to look into ketamine therapy or maybe emdr, I just got my own nice laptop for the first time in my life and I'm really happy about it, and a lot of things are looking up for me too. 
But if I have all these good things happening, why am I still so fucking low? Why do I still feel like it all happened last year, why am I still so unbelievably depressed, why do I still get immensely triggered, why am I so fucking stuck here?? And how long will it be until something changes?? How long will I feel this way?? It's been almost two years and he seems actually happy now, but why do I have to be the one that's still miserable?
God I just wish that I could fully move past everything that happened to me and just live my life. 
Why did I have to fucking look godddd
I don't really know how to end this, but fuck I'm just tired. I just want to be happy, fully, and without anything holding me back."
Recieving trauma related medical assistance,1,m88pl4,4,"For reference I have a diagnosed trauma disorder. Recently (as in the last 18 days) I have discovered through crisis therapy at my clinic my ""trigger.""

I have purposely not mentioned my specific trauma as to not trigger others. But it does have to do specifically March and not because of the pandemic.

TLDR: Is it too much to expect medical (ie medicine) intervention short term beyond my current plan for trauma disorder when it is too overwhelming to use coping skills previously used in therapy.

I feel like I cannot adequately process this trauma right now. Doing so unmediated creates waves of panic, dissociation, and at this point, sheer physical pain.

I have been continuously told to do my ""exercises"" related to anxiety and ""self care"" to stop the panic attacks but I've reached a state where that is impossible in the moment.

I spoke with my primary care physician, 3 different therapists, 2 psychiatrist nurses, and an emergency room. The er is where things went haywire because they prescribed me a short term controlled while I'm already on one and my psychiatrist doesn't even believe in my current one so he abruptly ended our conversation when I disclosed my er visit. He put in the notes I requested the er medication when I didn't. I will find out in 4 weeks if he plans to drop me as a client.

I have explained in detail my night terrors, panic, agitation, panic attacks, body aches, lingering chest pain, inability to do anything meaningful after 3pm, and irritable feelings. I'm unable to cook or clean or do much of anything after 3. 

Am I expecting too much from my medical team? Am I supposed to suffer through the pain of panic waves? I talked to the inpatient at the local hospital and they said I'm an unlikely candidate and wouldn't be admitted (which I'm okay with because I don't want that either). I could be evaluated by a psychiatrist nurse but they wouldn't be able to help me medication wise, that can only be done by the psychiatrist inpatient. And if that decision was made, there would likely be a wait since I am not dangerous."

Can you fully recover from PTSD?,13,m88b6b,4,"TW: Sexual assault 

I was taken and pretty violently sexually assaulted when I was a freshman in college 3 years ago. However, at the end of last year, I finally got justice! After a long two and a half year investigation and a week long trial- my rapist was sentenced to 14 years in prison. 

I’ve struggled with PTSD due to the assault for years now. However, I thought after court and after my rapist was sent to prison- I would feel better. I thought I would feel safe again. Like I could relax. However this isn’t the case. If anything the court case made my PTSD worse. My therapist thinks the trial completely retraumized me, even though the outcome was what we wanted.

Is it possible to fully recover from PTSD? Is this going to truly affect me the rest of my life? I go to therapy. I take some medicines to help with the PTSD symptoms (sleep issues, anxiety, lack of focus, etc) but I feel like this is never going to go away. It’s been 3 years. My rapist is in prison now. I feel like I should recover at this point."
Angry song suggestions?,5,m86de9,11,I was looking for song suggestions to add to a playlist about my abuser. I'm looking for songs that are angry in tone or are vaguely threatening. I really want to take back my anger against my abuser using music as that seems to help me a lot lately. Thanks!!

Dissociating over the weather,1,m84m7e,0,"TW: guns, crime spree

I feel I've officially lost it. I don't feel like I can share this with anyone in my life, because it's so so trivial.

I live in a rough area. Crime has been up, and lately there have been shootings and assaults in plain view right outside my door. I've had to intervene in things I never thought I would. But my trauma has nothing to do with gun violence, and these events didn't shake me up all that much. As fucked up as it is, the ""excitement"" just felt like a refreshing break from the safety and monotony of everyday life. 

I sort of live under a rock when it comes to domestic and world events. Yesterday I checked back into the news as I occasionally do. I read about brutal crimes that recently happened in my city and across the US. I kept up in real time with an ongoing police pursuit of an armed suspect all over my neighborhood.

It got to me.

Before I knew it, I was *sure* I heard shots ring out outside my window. I was *sure* I'd heard a woman shriek. I hit the floor. I felt myself start to dissociate hard- the world got quiet and blurry and I floated farther and farther away. It was so pronounced that I could actually tell it was happening and somehow managed to snap myself out of it. *This is life or death, you have to stay in the present.* 

Even though my body was so sure of what I'd heard, the little remaining sense I had left in my mind told me what is now obvious: *those were not shots. You know what gunfire sounds like and that was not it.*

And yet, as the sounds rang out over and over again, my body was convinced there was a full-blown firefight happening outside. *Should I call the police? What if I'm wrong about this? I need to get dressed and get armed.* 

The sounds kept coming. *Is this a law enforcement shootout? Is this a mass shooting? How is it still going after dozens of rounds?! In the middle of a rainstorm? ... rainstorm...* 

The sounds were from the storm. I listened intently, crouched down on the floor with a pipe in hand for what felt like an hour, trying to gather enough evidence to prove to my shaking body that the sounds I was hearing were just the wind beating against something outside. Eventually I was convinced enough to stand up and compose myself.

I feel really stupid. On the one hand I am sad for myself that such an innocuous turn of events could have me genuinely fearing for my life. On the other hand, it feels really tasteless to confide in anybody about the gunshots I imagined when the country is reeling from actual gun violence. I grew up firing guns, and I'm ashamed that I somehow mistook the wind for a full-blown shootout. I'm baffled at how my mind could make such a leap."
I need some support,4,m83x85,2,"Tomorrow is my moms birthday. 3 years ago on her birthday I forgot to give her a birthday present and she grounded me. Later that day she had pushed me to the ground and told me how I wasn't worth her giving up medical school for and how she wished she never had me. That night I had suicidal thoughts for the first time.

Being that said, my depression gets really bad around her birthday but usually I can handle it. On Monday tho, she kicked me out of the house of 3 hours. This whole weeks she has been upset with me about me losing all the silver ware and now I'm getting flashbacks to the day 3 years ago and feel absolutely awful."
"I anonymously reported my rapist after 3.5 years (Success, and venting, advice appreciated!!)",13,m83uxf,5,"CW for sexual assault 

Background: I was raped and manipulated by a boy I liked and who was in my friend group  in my dorm my freshman year of college. For a lot of reasons, namely manipulation, fear, gaslighting, and complete denial about what happened, I didn't report him immediately after the assault. A few months later I had come to terms a bit with what happened and was ready to report him at least to my University... And then he got in trouble for attacking a member of staff in my dorm while high on cocaine. He should have been immediately expelled. Instead he had a hearing where he pleaded and said some ridiculous sob story and the disciplinary staff at my University bought it and he got off Scott free with only a minor warning and he had to switch dorms. He bragged to friends that he could get away with anything because the university was invested in his big sob story and felt so bad for him. That scared me once again into not reporting him. 

&#x200B;

It's been 3.5 years. I am about to graduate from University. I have PTSD now and have suffered hugely because of the assault. He ruined my life. he still goes to my college and I see him walking around. In September My University got into the news for their treatment and handling of sexual assaults, it's a prestigious university and they care a lot more about reputation. An anonymous social media account was made which revealed a massive problem at the university (our only fraternity was revealed to have a MAJOR problem and they have since done nothing about it other than ""give consent trainings"". This inspired me to start to open up more about my experiences. I told friends. But at the same time, I felt horrible because I never reported him. He could and likely will hurt more people and its my fault that I was too ashamed to speak out. 

Because of the bad press, my University started something where students can anonymously report people online. Two days ago I did it. I wrote down all the details, when, where, his first name, and specific details about who he was. But I didn't share my name. I thought at least they'd look at his file, see he had a history and talk to him. But apparently they do NOTHING with anonymous reports because they don't believe them, it's just a way to placate the press. I want to feel empowered that I spoke out about him, but I also feel like it's useless because nothing will happen. 

Here's my dilemma. Should I come forwards with my name so that an actual report can be filed? If I reveal who I am in my report, will he find out that it was me that reported him? I am so scared of what happens when you report, but I feel like a failure of a survivor if I don't. I feel like survivors are only viewed as strong if they report. I know this is a word dump. I just needed to write it down. I needed to celebrate that I reported because I didn't tell anyone! Should I feel guilty about not reporting sooner or with my name attached?"
thank you!,14,m83e9j,2,"this group helps me immensely, even without posting. reading other people’s stories makes me feel less alone so thank you all for being here"
Triggering yourself,1,m82s39,8,"So I have trauma due to police violence, and sometimes I purposefully trigger myself by watching the videos of those nights (it was at a protest).  Is it normal to do that?  Purposefully triggering yourself?  I don't know why I do it, and obviously it doesn't feel great.  It's weird and i don't really like it.  But i was wondering if anyone else does this...and yea"
Let’s talk about the elephant in the room,261,m7z65v,51,"Every time you see PTSD symptoms online or elsewhere, they include the classic symptoms such as flashbacks, hyper vigilance, etc. However, nobody talks about another common symptom, minimizing your trauma. Saying things like, “What happened to me wasn’t that bad. Others have been through worse.” The reason why we do this is because it’s our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that’s exactly what it’s doing, causing more damage. Think of it like a fever. A fever can help you recover. When the fever gets dangerously hot, your body is still using this as a way to protect itself but in reality, it’s just making the illness worse. 

I also use apps to help with my trauma but none of them have anything to help out with this symptom when they really should as it is a very common and miserable symptom. That’s all I have to say. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
What I’ve been pushing down has exploded,3,m7xdb1,0,"A little over a week ago, I physically assaulted my boyfriend during a dissociative episode/flashback. I only remember a portion of it, but even those memories are flawed. I feel incredibly guilty, horrified, and disgusted with myself.  

I have been sexually assaulted four times since the age of 15, by three different men, all of whom I considered friends at the time. I have few memories of most of the incidents, and the first two times (ages 15 and 16) I wasn’t believed by the people closest to me because they “seemed like nice guys”. This led to me not trusting myself or my own memories, and when I woke up to a friend raping me after I had passed out drunk at age 22, I convinced myself I was dreaming. The last time I was attacked, by the same man, I fought back, but he overpowered me. My friend and his roommate woke up and heard me screaming from the other room, and had to pull him off of me. Though my memories of all of these incidents are vague at best, I know they live somewhere in my brain, because they’ve affected me ever since.  

My boyfriend and I had been having a petty little argument, nothing major, and I went to bed while he went out to the living room. I woke up to him looking for his vape in the bed and I panicked. I thought he was trying to lunge at me, and I started kicking him to try to get him away from me. I thought he was laughing at me and continuing to lunge at me, so I kept kicking and pushing him as hard as I could. When he left the room, I tried to lock the door and put things in front of it, but the lock is broken. He was trying to get out of the situation, so he came back into the room to get his stuff and leave, but I thought he had broken the lock to get to me. This is when I completely blacked out. From what he’s told me, I started pushing him and hitting him in the chest while screaming at him to get the fuck away from me. He left and I ended up calling my parents in the middle of the night to come pick me up an hour away. He tried to come back in to check on me and I threatened to call the police. I was absolutely terrified and broken down, and my parents were horrified and concerned that he’d actually done what I thought he was trying to do.  

I’ve had dissociative episodes sporadically in the past, but I’ve never gotten to that point before. My ptsd mostly manifests in insomnia, repressed memories, and extreme paranoia. My boyfriend is trying to support me, but he’s also rightfully hurt, scared, and upset. He’s had his own trauma associated with his ex-girlfriends being physically violent with him, and I feel so guilty that I re-traumatized him by letting my own issues get so out of hand.  

This incident not only brought up trauma associated with being sexually assaulted, but also other intrusive thoughts. Memories of my past abusive relationship and repeatedly watching my brother overdose and go into diabetic keto acidosis are constantly playing through in my head. My brother died the same year I was last assaulted, and I left my abusive ex that year as well. At the time my grief took precedence over dealing with my other trauma, and although that was five years ago, I know it’s affecting me now.  

I’ve previously dealt with these feelings by using alcohol or disordered eating to cope, but I’m trying not to do that anymore. I’ve been in therapy for the past five years, but I know I need to try more or something different. I’ve worked so hard to put my life back together and now it’s falling apart. My relationship is strained from this already, and I can’t hurt anyone, let alone the person I love most, ever again. I’m not sure if I’m just venting or asking for advice, but if anyone has actually read this far and has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: My PTSD is ruining my life and relationship, and I need to take the right steps to treat it."
Should I quit my job?,1,m7x2y5,1,"I need to rant this out. I feel like an ass currently. I landed a good paying entry level call center job. I just poofed out of training last night, and called out today. This is my third entry level call center possition so I can't say I didn't know what I was getting into. I feel trapped in customer service. It's not that I don't like helping people. The problem is that dealing with the public takes an emotional toll on me. Unfortunately, it is the only industry I've ever worked in. I already tried to resign from this company and they talked me into giving another project a chance. But, they don't have any possitions that aren't on phones. So its not as if they can acccomodate me with a possition I'm better suited for. I don't know why I keep trying customer service when I know I am not emotionally capable of doing it at this point in time. I just really don't know what to do. Any advice will likely be appreciated."
I’m triggered.,23,m7vn6e,13,"My father was an abusive alcoholic druggy who sexually abused me throughout my childhood, most of which I don’t remember. I was brainwashed into thinking it was okay, normal even. For 11 years of my life, he abused me and manipulated me. As a forgiving person, I reconnected with him a year ago, giving him the benefit of the doubt (nonexistent btw) he continued to manipulate and gaslight me, which was easy because hardly anybody in my life believed me because my abuser claimed I was always a liar. It’s all stupidly ironic in retrospect.

Most of the ptsd I suffer from his actions (and all the ptsd I received in foster care) are tolerable, manageable at most, with the coping strategies I have established myself.  

I see him in my face,which fucked me up for a while because he told me I wasn’t his child and I believed him. Wrong, I’m a spitting image of both my parents. Most days I cannot stand to look at myself. Some days, I look in the mirror, I don’t recognize myself and have a panic attack, so I avoid mirrors as often as possible. Coping mechanisms aren’t as effective for my visual triggers because they’re only suppressed for a short period of time while the trigger is a constant. 

The thing I just cannot escape, is my hands. My hands and quite literally a fucking replica of his. I see my hands as my abusers hands.  He took a part of me, my identity, and reclaiming it is so hard when i have a constant trigger literally in my hands. Sometimes I get my nails done but it doesn’t always work. And that’s not an option at this time because of lockdown. Other than that, I have no ‘healthy’ coping strategies so I think I may resort to wearing gloves 24/7. I’m a student and can’t even get my schoolwork done without being triggered.
I literally cannot win. I am continuously shown that my life is full of unending suffering."
Considering a daily vlog/stream of my recovery to help myself and others become more comfortable with vulnerability,6,m7ufm6,9,"Hello fellow humans, and thank you in advance for offering your time and space! I'd really appreciate your honest feedback about a potential resource I'd love to start offering. 

Some background info: I am non-binary but embrace a very mother-hen+bear type of energy. I am a system (have multiple alters) and manage DPRD, dissociative and psychotic episodes, autism, delusions, ADHD, and C-PTSD. I have experienced childhood abuse, sexual assault, grooming, ostracization, and religious and disability persecution, pretty consistently through my life. I am recovering from codependency and substance misuse. I've been considering lately how grounding it could be for me to lean into how unique and unstable I am, so as to help other people realize it's okay, and that you can love yourself even if everyone and everything around you is insisting you're unlovable. My biggest source of stress right now is having perspectives that can help people but feeling like I can't share them because I'm not healed yet. 

What I'd like to do: I've come to realize recently that this (^^ re: holding back) is exactly the kind of behavior my oppressors and oppressive systems want from me, and that I'm better served finding a way to make my current position work for myself and others. I've landed on making a daily vlog (whether it's rain or shine, manic or depressed, ecstatic or suicidal) that consists of my musings and processes about my trauma and recovery (some including triggering content with ample warnings but some not), my perspectives on how we can all heal ourselves and this system that keeps farming us for trauma and profit, and other things that could be helpful (sharing music, doing art together, playing games, Q&A, etc). 

What you can help with: Is this something you feel you or others could benefit from witnessing? All of my life, I have been either admired, preyed upon, or insulted for my compulsive dedication to absolute authenticity. Though to me, it's one of the most beautiful things in the world: I truly believe that my ability to be pure and vulnerable without fear of judgement, despite it having lead others to wreak havoc on my life, can change this world for the best. Especially given that my intent is to help others with it. I want to normalize being emotional and vulnerable, sharing things online other than toxic perfection, and witnessing ourselves and each other for where we're truly at rather than judging for not being somewhere ""better."" We are always exactly where we're meant to be!

How you can help me: If you do think this would be helpful, do you have any interests, recommendations, or suggestions, on how you would like to see it managed, or what you would or would not like to see? This would eventually expand into my accessible healing businesses that will include animal therapy, disaster relief, crisis intervention, conflict resolution, community advancement, etc. 

Thank you so much to anyone able to read this, and to those willing to offer feedback."

Being constantly triggered ( I think I should include trigger warning),1,m7p20o,1,"One of my triggers is people coming into my room, be it strangers or friends, I can’t handle either. Living in a student accommodation, one of the worst things is that the staffs keep coming into my room to inspect this or that at least once a week, they say it’s part of the agreement that I signed up for and it’s for my own safety so I can’t refuse these inspections. What’s even worse is that I have no idea what time would they come, they may say they will conduct the inspections on Thursday and Friday, so I would have to suffer for absolutely two days, unable to do anything, unable to sleep at nights, nothing could possibly interests me, I feel so sick that I can’t eat anything, I would just anxiously await, as if awaiting my own death, until they finally come and be done with this whole inspection. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, my mind is not functioning very well."
How can I learn to thrive and no longer survive? How can I stop feeling sucicidal? Looking for advice,22,m7moll,2,"My whole school experience has been abusive for me, I am now in university but many people made me feel flawed beyond repair and screamed or insulted me to go away and then laughed when I went away, there was lots of psychological abuse which is more traumatizing than words, if someone insults me I can answer back, if someone kicks me I can try to protect my self by stepping away, but like what was I supposed to when someone throws objects me, ruins my personal property or stalked me and provoked me because I have overwhelming emotions and it is easy to make me react. I am now out of school but I grew up too quickly and never felt like a child, and now I feel like a 8 year old stuck in a 20 year old's body due to never being childish and normal and being more mature than my peers. How can I learn to deal with my vulnerability, vulnerability is one of the core reasons I was bullied and since I was too open and friendly, I feel more comfortable self isolating and being cynic since 9/10 times people betray my trust but that is not healthy, I can't spend the next 50 years living with my parents and avoiding people. However people are the core reason I had anxiety, depression and tried to kill my self many times. Now I just cry when I process emotions but I just want to know how to thrive"

I think I was molested by my cousin,0,m7l992,4,"A memory from 10 years ago resurfaced, of I think my cousin molesting me we are both female and she was a year younger than me, I remember being close with her but after a while I didn't want to hang out with her anymore I thought it was because she was into girly things and I wasn't a girly girl but I think I finally know. I'm still trying to process everything because it's still new to me we were around 6or 7 years old she didn't touch me (I don't think) but she made me do sexual things like making me hump a pillow and pretend we were making out I honestly don't know if anything else happened but this has been bothering me I feel like I was molested but I don't know if it counts I was so uncomfortable but for some reason I thought it was fun and I just feel so guilty and disgusting, I need someone to lmk if what I'm feeling is valid because I feel like I might be overreacting. 
I also have 2 other experiences that are a little more serious
1. When I was around 6 years old my dad said my nipples were ""weird"" so he sucked them to ""fix"" them this was another memory I forgot but I don't know if he truly was trying to help me or not. I don't think my dad is a creep.

2. I think it was around the same age my older sister pressured me to make out with another kid that I didn't want to do I'm not sure who the kid was but I repeatedly told her no but she told me she wouldn't tell and I listened to her because she was older (around 10ish?) And after she pressured me I tried making out with this boy and she told on me, this really messed me up because I got made fun of by other family members even though I was forced to do it I remember crying about it later. 

I'm just so confused about everything but please I want to know if this was molestation. I feel so gross"
Hyper vigilance,9,m7i1zc,6,"I've recently identified why I act the way I do, its due to being in a constant state of hyper vigilance. Its hard to turn off the feeling because I sometimes don't even realize my behavior, until someone asks me why I'm always in a rush or why I notice everything going on in my surroundings at all times.

I served almost five years with an extension, on active duty and deployed twice to combat zones. Despite all of this, it's been an uphill battle to get back to a somewhat normal way of living. I've been unemployed for about seven months and have been using this time to bond with my girlfriend's dogs. She has two female dogs, and they've been living with me almost as long as my girlfriend. Well, one of them has had liver issues and also has anxiety related issues with a fear of men. Despite all of that we have been getting along very well and they both really just want to be by me and get attention from me. Which I find comforting. Yesterday I had taken them both for a walk while my girlfriend was at work, which is fairly normal. Nothing weird was going on aside from light snow as it seemed like the snow was gone for the season. When we were coming back in, I usually harness one first and remove her harness first, as she can be a little weird if she isn't first. When I leaned down to unbuckle the harness she bit me in the face, and missed my right eye by mere centimeters. I think I blacked out because I can't remember anything after being bit, at least until I felt the blood rush down my cheek and I went to clean it. The dog that bit me is leary of me now, and she has some cuts and bruises, but is otherwise alright. I explained it to my girlfriend, and she seemed understanding but upset, and the dog still wants my attention and love, but can be a little timid and scared of me now. I feel so bad, and don't really know how to cope with this. I was diagnosed with combat related PTSD almost four years ago now, and have seen a psychiatrist and therapist since the diagnosis. I just feel like I had a major setback and it is really bothering me. Fight or flight or not, doesn't matter, I don't want to hurt the ones I love whether they've wronged or harmed me. I'm at a loss here."
TW: CSA--- Can this still be traumatizing?,7,m7gd3k,8,"can childhood sexual abuse still be traumatizing if it only happened once almost a decade ago, I didn't realize it was abuse until years later, it wasn't violent or life threatening, it wasn't r@pe, and the perpetrator was a woman? This was my situation, and the past couple of days, especially today, I've really been invalidating myself because it could have been so much worse. I have so many symptoms of being traumatized (flashbacks, upsetting dreams/nightmares, frequent dissociation, extreme touch aversion, and depression just to name a few), but I feel like it can't be that bad or trauma because so many people have had it worse or even feared for their lives and realized it was abuse right off the bat. I feel like I have NO RIGHT to feel traumatized."
"I need a break from my mother who traumatized me, but I don't know how to make it happen",3,m7g9p2,2,"I grew up in an unstable home, dad took his life when I was 8, mom began drinking and leaving me and my brother home alone, my brother took it out on me and would ""bully me"" for hours, mom would get angry when I texted her to save me. I would get punished because my brother would upset me etc. This is just the short version though, haha.

So, I am an adult now, living in another city. I've realised that I need a break from her. I only feel anxiety whenever I am contacted. But whenever I talk to my mother about boundaries, she gets defensive or interpret me as a villain, then she'll gossip with her friends about me. It scares me a bit that she'll talk behind my back to my father in law who lives in the same city as her. I feel like I am in a prison where I have to abide by her. She's also guilt tripping me on not spending time with her and my brother. Because my brother is so depressed and I should feel sorry for him. Just like when we grew up and he ""bullied me"", I was the inconsiderate one.

I don't know what to do, she doesn't even know about my PTSD. I have no security network other than my partner. 

For clarity she wasn't always bad. We had some normal times too, even as adults. She's periodically nice and periodically like a child."
Today marks a year since those shots were fired.,38,m7fm8s,8,"I was shot 5 times at basic point blank range my army friend said I should have ear damage from those rounds being so close. The story is on my account somewhere I think. The doctors said it was miracle after miracle that I survived and most people don’t get 1 miracle let alone all the ones I got in a short period of time. 

I’m recovering slowly but I have to admit this first year has been rough. I still can’t go to the area without being filled with anger and I wanting to do something I can’t say on Reddit. The event caused me to get heavily into opiates and anything I could get my hands on in a matter of weeks not even two months I was doing 2 fentanyl pressed M 30 a day without missing a day. 

Heck it got to the point I was taking 6 2mg Xanax and snorting the whole pill once I let 30 minutes of taking the Xanax so I would know I got them both together which with a drug as strong as fentanyl it was very dangerous and reckless.

I was in a dark place I was barely in the stage where you feel invincible I quite literary had just become an adult my birthday had passed just around 3 months ago. I decided I needed to do better so I quit the fentanyl cold turkey. Let the withdrawals happen and then waited 3 weeks. 

Now I still occasionally take pain pills for nerve damage and to stop thinking suicidal and am now legally prescribed Xanax to use incase a panic attack hits hard. I haven’t touched fentanyl in a while. It’s been rough but finally after so long I get a couple days every now and then when I can smile and truly believe I will get past this.

It’s hard and I know it’s going to take time but I know it’s worth it and I’m proud of myself for coming so far and that’s what matters and I truly believe I can go further and heal even more. So to anyone dealing with this awful thing, always remember that things can get better and you don’t have to be stuck in that dark hole, if you need help my messages are open to anyone who needs it even if you just need to vent or need someone to talk to feel free to message me nothing will annoy me or bother me I promise."
Recovering Trauma Memory?,5,m7fgm2,1,"Hello,

I have a friend who is experiencing some repressed memory resurfacing. What are some resources he can use to recover memories? Or is recovering memories the solution? He currently hears a song from Church music, and is devoted to Jesus and all. But he has no male friends and is around females. He is often perceived as gay, but often makes relationships with girls. He tells me he's not gay. But that's besides the question. He manifested homosexual acts. Apparently, either his family member or pastor forced him for a blowjob while the Church music was going on. 

What are some ways to recover the memory of who did it? And how does one deal with this traumatic event? Should he avoid christian church altogether? What is the hope for him?"
PTSD is about to cost my job and I’m losing my mind.,17,m7dib3,8,"I got my dream job and I’m going to lose it due to PTSD. I literally can’t handle the pressure and it’s shutting me down. I started this job a few months ago and it was going well until my “training” ended. I had a performance review meeting last week that confirmed what I already knew. I’m slipping behind. I’m missing things that can’t be missed. The role is too important to the company and I’m failing. They put me on a month long “improvement program” that ends with successful completion or termination. 

I’m finally in a place where I’m stable and should be able to function, but I’m literally falling apart. I’ve been in therapy and on meds for a year, I started this new job, moved into a nicer and quieter apartment. I’m working from home. There’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to function and focus and get it right. I feel like I’m in school again. I can understand everything, but I just can’t do the work. I don’t need someone to explain it to me, I just freeze up and can’t finish it. I’m having all these flashbacks to my mom screaming at me and shaming me for not finishing my homework. 

I’m sitting in my desk chair, in my home, shaking and crying uncontrollably because I made a small mistake and had to resend an email. It’s unbearable. I can’t eat, I wake up sweaty well before my alarm goes off. I spend a good hour each day in the bathroom because the anxiety tears up my stomach. I’ve probably lost a couple pounds too because I can see my ribs more now than ever before. 

And I blame myself. I 100% blame myself. Because everyone else can suck it up and get the job done. But I can’t. I was the first of my friends to graduate. I was the first to get a real job. I was the first to move away. And now I’m gonna be the first of my friends to be fired from a job for being too fucking stupid. And I have to sit there every day until they let me go facing my mistakes and stupidity."
"The fear of not being able to sleep is stoping me to sleep (and other ""not so"" cool stories)",5,m7cv8f,0,"I thnik some experiences from the 2 3 lasts years were I was in places that beimlng able o have long calm sleep time was not an option created this fear.

I had before that, trouble from trauma, depression period and ADHD ( hypersensitivity/empathy/ etc....) and suicide attempt. With all this shit in mind I got in a place for my studies in woodworking were for a long time I tried to bury everything in work/ begin a new life . Also I'm a big sleeper ( and depressed ) so all of this was never a good idea and almost everyone being rude was the icing on the cake.

I kept this rhythm for one year before everything begins to shreds apart again the first week of my second year I almost lost a thumb because I was a complete mess all the time (I am not bad in my job but people sometimes get mad because I'm me ... you know...and it creates arguments and I don't now how to handlw them and I have panic attacks etc... ) trying to hide everything despite I promised to myself to never do that.

I tried a lot of things nothing never work out and then covid came. It pull me out of a lot of stressfull things and help me heal, rethink my life. 

When it restart again I was in a more confortable and  had lot more autonomy.

But, I get beat up (again).... on my bike during comuting... I stop cycling despite I was in a very good progressions, gain 4 kg (a lot for me ) and it reveald everything It broke all of my mental barriers all the different personalities i tried to create of  myself.
Everything came bake twice as fast and the littlest thing became huge.(like being able to sleep in a quiet environment).

And also new I can't be touch on the back without completely freaking out.

Right now I only stay up because I'm used to being completely fucked. I know how to deal and prevent panic attack, stress period, stupid euphoria etc
...

But it still happen and I'm completely aware of it.

I'm just feeling like despite everything I try I'm just a bunch of trauma that can do anything with confrontation (i was in rebellion before now I just lost hope on that point ).

If you have read this rent thank you and sorry for the probably bad english and possibly non understandable sentences.
I just had the strongest panic attack I had for months because of a computer mouse a guy used in my room while I was trying to sleep."
Surviving in Academia with PTSD: Anyone else out there at the graduate or post-graduate level with PTSD?,17,m7c9e6,5,"Hi everyone! I have complex PTSD, and I recently joined a group for women who have experienced trauma because my symptoms exploded in January due to dramatic and unexpected life changes. The group meets 3 hrs/day, 3times/week, which is really a lot and kind of overwhelming to manage with my new job. The women in the group are nice, but I feel like a lot of what I'm struggling with right now is trying to understand whether or how I can continue my career trying to manage my mental health issues, because I am currently an academic--which requires heavy cognitive effort, focus, and skill. It's so damn hard to have a job that relies on my mind being at its sharpest and finest all the time

I just completed my PhD in December 2020, and then started a postdoc immediately in January. So, I've survived in academia for a long time, and it has taken a terrible toll on me, and increased the amount of trauma that I have experienced. I've had to take two separate leaves of absence due to PTSD explosions, and I'm currently nearing the end of the second one.  I am wondering if there are other academics out there (including grad students, postdocs, faculty/professors, or people in industry positions that require a PhD) who would be willing to talk about their situations in private DMs? I really want to be able to share my experiences of disclosing/navigating PTSD with people who are more jr. to me in academia (i.e. grad students/postdocs who may be struggling the way I had to), and to learn from people who are more senior to me (i.e. faculty, industry researchers) about how they have navigated.  I know this is a little specific, so maybe nobody is on her who meets that criteria... but the special pressures of academia require special treatment, and I figured it couldn't hurt to at least put it out there and see what happens.

If you already know of a safe space for academics with PTSD, I'd also love to hear about that or get recommendations for that!

Thank you for reading. I really hope to connect with people to share knowledge and help figure out a way through. You can send me a DM, or comment and I'll reach out to you over DM if you indicate in your post that it's ok for me to do that."
I found my friends body!,43,m7c5j0,20,"It's been a couple weeks.  I had a very traumatic event happen, I'm in therapy but find even my councillor disturbed by what I explain.  I'm very touchy and have difficulty sleeping.  I break down a few times a day right now.  Crying, hyperventilating, obsessing over details of my friends death.  It's hard to know if his death was a suicide or accident.  Alcohol was involved and he was not in good physical or mental health.  I sometimes wonder if I'll ever feel normal again, if these feelings of emptyness and images of his body when he died will leave my head.  I don't know if this is normal grieving or something permanent.  I have so much to do but no energy to do it.  I'm constantly tired, and never feel rested."
Venting/Long Rant (warning: SA talk),2,m7c04c,0,"I (26F) have been through a slew of traumas growing up.  None of them gave me PTSD.  Developmental issues for some of them, but never PTSD for most of them.  A car accident did a bit.  So did a two year hellspan as a child of multiple things (gang violence/threats, cop harassment, sexual/psychological abuse, isolation, puberty/discovering my sexuality).  I ignored it all mostly.  I grew up not realizing how fucked up I was despite looking back now and seeing lots of warning signs.  After a lifetime of multiple traumas I didn't get therapy til I was raped almost two years ago.  Suddenly my whole world has crashed down.

I already have a tough schedule.  I have an internship, three polyamorous relationships (only seeing one person rn due to covid), a fulltime overnight job, trying to learn to drive, caring for two incredibly needy cats, taking care of my SEVERELY depressed partner that I live with, and fulltime online classes.  I graduate this year in May.  Now I also have to deal with therapy and really looking at how deeply fucked up my life has been and I just have no motivation most days.  Even with depression I used to just chug caffeine and power thru things.  My future goals (to be a homelessness focused social worker and leftist activist) motivated me.

I know ptsd is technically a form of brain damage.  I should be easier on myself.  But I've gained 50 pounds, have gotten physically weaker (I used to work out), I am using weed way more than I used to, my memory and focus are gone,  I feel numb and tired and like there is no point anymore.  I'm always trying to be strong for some reason so feeling less strong the past year is killing me.  I am not suicidal at all most days, but I do have a slight resentment for my mom most days (even though I adore her and we even relate on both having ptsd) that she didn't abort.  

I can't bring myself to job hunt for a state I'm excited to move to (other places lessen my ptsd generally).  I can't bring myself to care about talking to people.  I can't bring myself to do basic shit like brushing my teeth.  I wish I could just lie around daydreaming, sleeping, showering, listening to asmr or bodyscans, or cuddling with my partner.  Even things like video games, listening to music, watching tv,  and creating art that I deeply love feel like work now.  Every little thing feels hard.  I am giving literally nothing my all anymore.  I don't hate work or school or my internship, but I just don't care.  I'm wishing I could just drop everything some days and start over.  My body is numb.  Memory and focus are gone and sometimes looking at my homework just becomes a blob or another language and no thoughts can form.  I'm tired.  I've been thru so much.  Everytime things feel a little better another traumatic thing happens.  I just hate that life is like this and it makes it hard to care about any obligations.

I've been sexually assaulted so many times.  Even my healthy sex in life had unhealthy thought processes behind it and I did a lot of stupid shit to myself internally.  There is literally no guarantee that working to improve myself will matter when yet another person decides to abuse me in some way.  I'm angry that the world is like this.  I'm angry that I'm not fixing my life the way I want to yet.  I had finally reached my peak self before the rape and now all my work is gone."
"The Shawshank Redemption, my favorite movie of all time, yet I can't watch it anymore (TW: Prison, jail, etc)",6,m7bcuw,0,"I can't watch the Shawshank Redemption anymore, even though it's definitely my favorite movie of all time, because it triggers my PTSD. I decided today, I'm gonna face it head on, and watch it again, this time with some weed, because lowkey the cannabis does help me stop getting triggered.



I've been arrested 4 times myself, for petty misdemeanors, and the last time I saw the movie I had horrible nightmares and felt suicidal. I get nightmares like every other night regardless due to other, more serious traumas I've been through.



This time, we're watching it in my virtual law class, and I'm gonna use some medical cannabis. I'll report back on how it goes


EDIT 1: Ok, I've been using some weed, and it's definitely helping. I have REALLY bad PTSD, like I can't watch after the first 8 minutes anymore, now I'm just muting it once in a while, but I'm still able to go by, it feels less serious, but still there, but it also reduces how intense it is"
I just need to get this out somewhere,7,m7abo4,0,"First of all, trigger warning for combat.


This is my best March since 2003 yet so far. I haven't been drinking heavily, I haven't retreated completely in on myself, and I've only cried every other day. But today and the last couple days have just been so heavy. I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time and it's been a constant barrage of bad dreams and bad memories. I'm also constantly angry. This morning I was walking my dog and I caught myself checking all the angles for enemies. When I caught myself my brain immediately switched into a memory where we ended up in a minefield and an overpowering urge to run and get away from it. While my VA therapy did fall through over the holidays (I may have forgotten to call to schedule the next appointment about a 100 times) I did learn it's useful to get the memory out. Recite it. Over and over again. This is in furtherance of that. If you don't want to read it, fine, whatever, I just need it out there.

A few days after the first wave of soldiers invaded Iraq they were deeply in trouble. The Iraqis were threatening to cut off their supply lines. It was decided the 101st would go in next and secure those while trying to engage the Medina division. This was, for us, just a few days after we had a member of our division attack our brigade command, witnessed a friendly fighter get shot down, and numerous scud alerts, (none landed near us at this stage). So we were very much already on alert, already walking around armed and ready to fight.

When we left the camp they were playing heavy metal music over the psyops loudspeakers. We were all high on adrenaline. I was gunning a pickup truck style humvee. That adrenaline quickly wore off in the face of boredom as we drove to the Iraqi border. As mortars we had to not only be ready to fight off any direct attacks, but also be ready to put our guns into action and fire rounds to support our leading elements if they got into fighting and needed the help. So we were intently listening to the radio as they got into various situations, none of which I remember.

As we approached the border ourselves a sand storm blew up. We would later joke that we brought our unit's rain with us. Visibility dropped to mere meters and we had to slow to a crawl not to hit other humvees. This seems like a good time to mention that the Iraqi/Kuwait border is one of the most heavily mined areas in the world. The engineers had marked the safe route with red stakes. So when the visibility opened up again for a second and we found ourselves on the wrong side of the red stakes there was no small amount of panic. We all noticed at the same time and we all shouted for the driver to get back over on the right side right the fuck now. Our platoon sergeant also politely requested our presence on the safe route over the radio. This was my first real experience with fight or flight where I thought death was a real possibility. My ass puckered, my muscles tightened up, I started grinding my teeth. About 30 seconds later we were back with everyone else and our introduction to war was over. I relaxed a little and felt like I had run a marathon.

There were many other things to come that year. (Not least the fact that it would be a year and not a couple months) But that was today's fun memory. If you were in a certain place at a certain time there's probably enough here to identify my unit within the 101st. I have ceased to care about that getting out there, NFS."
Anyone has ADHD?,10,m79nky,6,"anyone here has ADHD?
How is it like to have ADHD and PTSD?"
TW: CSA Being told it isn't a problem (advice wanted),6,m793gt,2,"Hi reddit. Nothing triggers my PTSD more than being told that what happened ""wasn't that bad"", but lately what my parents have been on about is saying, ""Oh it happened but it wasn't bad and it actually secretly triggered suppressed memories of previous incidents that none of us know about, and you need to go to hypnotherapy to unlock them."" I'm terrified of this. I know what my problem is, I remember my assault clearly and have never once changed my story because I knew that if any detail was out of line nobody would ever believe me again, and my biggest fear and biggest trigger is being told I'm lying or trying to ruin someone's good reputation. It did happen, I didn't make it up and I'm not crazy. I also know that it's the problem that causes me the most distress. I'm so afraid that if I go to hypnotherapy I'll just end up making something up to make it stop and they'll use that to sweep everything else under the rug. I don't know what to do."
CBD cannabis oil,9,m78cgo,0,"Lexapro has been giving me side effects so I have been weaning down with cannabis oil, one with high cbd content (about 2:1 cbd:thc). And it’s amazing, I feel like myself again. I was worried that I would get anxiety or paranoia from the cannabis because that has happened before. But none of that happened, I do feel a bit less sharp but it’s helped with all the lexapro withdrawal pains like headache and I feel better in terms of mood. It’s been helping me do introspective work without being judgmental like I am usually and it’s helped a lot. Im taking more since I’m dealing with the lexapro weaning off but once it’s better I will lower it. Just thought it might help someone. Maybe higher cbd lower thc for you to start, like 5:1 or more. I like having a clear head so I’m looking for a higher cbd ratio. But I think a little thc helps than pure cbd, but majority should be cbd for anxiety. Take care everyone."
Had a nightmare after a week of losing my consistent ptsd nightmares,4,m784b1,0,"Names have been altered and stuff but I basically got a nightmare triggered by someone saying the word ""vacation"" around me. Someone i have ptsd of.

So I was dreaming about Lake. Which started out really pleasant. We had finally met irl and were living together. For some reason I was also still living with Thebi?? Weird. I figured i had to hide who Lake was to me from Thebi so I decided to be stealth around her. 

(One sec to interrupt the nightmare. It was irregular after not having had my usual Trauma Nightmares for about a week. Irl Thebi mentioned the word vacation, talking to herself.)

Anyways, it started out great, Lake and I were romantic, sensual, sexual. Just as over voice call but much better in life, Lake's voice made me feel at peace and loved at the same time as excited and supercharged. We read books together and slept in the same bed and hugged and kissed and all the good things. I felt so so so loved. But then Thebi said we had to go on a vacation[this word has always been a negative in my mind]. So we went to the airport and Lake was being distant so I went up real close to him and asked him what's wrong and he snapped at me and physically pushed me aside. I kinda felt tears just automatically press behind my eyes and I wiped them angrily. I felt stupid. But I HAD to try again. I tried to put my hand in his own and he slapped it away and I felt myself at the beginnings of a meltdown. Right there in the airport. Tears of frustration, shaking from anger, I stood there just kinda humiliated and unsure of what to do with myself. MY lover, MY life partner, MY Lake. How dare he leave me feeling so low just like that. We were told to start boarding the plane and as we walked through the terminal, I only saw him getting more unstable. And I was too. It was so wrong and horrible and oh, ""vacation"" only ever brings horrible things. I told him, ""we don't have to go anywhere if you don't want to, love."" But he pushed me away again. He said to me that I was annoying and clingy and a crybaby. That he would be surprised if I ever found an actual lover. He told me I was stupid and emotional and childish. I wanted to hit him right then and there, really badly. I told him I wanted to break up with him and for him to get out of my sight. He said ""fine with me"" very coldly and simply walked off on the place of the terminal right before the point of no return, the plane. And I was then pushed into that plane by Thebi. As I stumbled inside I felt dreadful, nauseous and claustrophobic and terrified like a free animal trapped in a cage. I wanted to run back to my lover. To chase him. To do anything and everything i could to get him back to me. I didn't want some stupid fucking ""vacation."" Vacations always hurt me immensely. I just wanted to be close with my lover. But he had gone from me willingly, coldly. He had insulted me and thrown me away just like everyone else in this cruel life. I had nothing. And then I woke up."
Shame after episode?,74,m73v5b,9,"Does anyone else ever feel tremendous shame after a dissociation episode? I rarely have the perfect storm of being triggered, going fight instead of flight, and dissociating in the same event and so I’m a little shook. 

Last night I had a rat in my shitty studio apartment, which isn’t the end of the world or directly triggering in of itself, but I dealt with them for two years and that was very stressful and this was the first one since... anyway, I didn’t sleep well because of that, then this morning the construction site outside started with this concrete saw at 7:00am that shook my windows it was so loud, then they added a jackhammer. 

My service dog was upset my the noise and started barking and then she starting alerting me I was having a panic attack and all the noises just snapped me. I just disappeared. 

Turns out I called and screamed at the wrong construction site, armed myself with a self defense tool and went out and screamed at the construction workers until one told me he understood 100% where I was coming from but that he couldn’t do anything about it he was just trying to earn money for his family and I snapped back to conscious of my actions. 

Of course I apologized but I feel terrible every single time this happens, which thankfully isn’t very often anymore, but I just feel so ashamed at not being in control of my self. 

I guess I just wanted to rant and figured you guys would understand. Thanks."
I thought I was getting better.,6,m73tnb,2,"I don't know if this is the right sub.. I ended up having a dream recently. I know it shouldn't bother me but I can't get it out of my head.

Even awake I feel hands around my throat, being pushed up against a wall. The only person I feel safe with isn't really available and I don't want to bother them with this since they're going through their own issues.

before I left for good I lived with her and her fiance...she treated me very poorly, setting me up for conflict between friends, i didnt cut off the relationship but I vowed to focus on myself moving foward. 

Her Fiance passes away and I didn't not go to the funeral nor the wedding. he was her Husband when he died accidentally. both occurred in the city I am.afriad of. 

she was awarded a large sum of money,never once did i ask for anything.  And never once did she offer to lift me up...She knows I suffer from PTSD 

she is a partier and I am introverted...she loves bags, jewelry, shopping, 

i enjoy books, reading, and researching. 

now her Mother is sick and I need help with addressing what I should do to be there for her but keep my sanity.  I cannot go back to that city.

How long did it take for you to start having regular therapy sessions?,3,m6w3o5,1,"I started therapy but I’m not sure if this is what I should expect, and I would like something to maybe help base my understanding on. 

TL;DR: Did it also take you at least two months before being able to actually talk to a trauma therapist about what you’re going through?

About a month ago I called a local mental health clinic to set up an appointment because I felt it was time that I found a therapist who could really help me. Ive had counseling before, but it was only for depression and they never even asked about my past and it felt like they just cared about learning to hide my symptoms so it never went further than a couple of appointments. 

At my intake I got diagnosed with PTSD, and I’ve only had two appointments (my intake, and another that was like a continuation of that) where we go over a brief history, symptoms, and my current life. I also have appointments for peer support, skill support (for coping methods), a psychiatrist (for medication) taking place in April. I think I will be seeing my trauma therapist biweekly or maybe weekly, i can’t remember which option I agreed to.  My issue at the moment is that i still don’t have an appointment with the actual trauma therapist, I just know that one will be set eventually. 

The event happened 10 years ago but I still have nightmares often, and have really intense periods of disassociation very frequently. I recently lost an acquaintance to suicide and it hit me very hard because some of this person’s trauma was very similar to mine. I also suspect I have a disassociation disorder along with the PTSD but of course i need a proper diagnosis before being able to say that. Because of this, I really think it would help to see a therapist sooner rather than later. 

I know starting therapy for PTSD is difficult and there is probably a long waiting list and not many people willing to take new patients so I don’t want to complain too much about the process taking too long to start. I also know that recovery is a lot of work and it’s going to take me years to make significant progress, so I don’t want to rush the process. But I have to ask, did your experiences with therapy start out similar? I’m not sure if it normally takes this long, since I have nothing to reference."
If anyone is feeling down hit me up! Keep our minds busy,14,m6vh79,3,"I’m having a pretty rough attack right now and if anybody feels like venting, maybe we can help each other out and calming each other down!"
I had a someone disturbing & triggering childhood revelation tonight (long read),4,m6tl7p,2,"Hello everyone, I hope your nights are going well. I have had a revelation tonight that is pretty upsetting to me and it is a pretty long read.
A bit of insight first; a good portion of my childhood was spent living around a woman with a severe personality disorder, most likely borderline personality disorder. This was my step mother. 

Years ago, when my dad and old step mom were together, (I must have been no older than 8-10 and I'm 23 now) I really hurt my right shoulder sledding. I was going down a hill too fast and tried to stop by spreading my arms out but my right arm was flung out behind me. I laid there crying and alone in the snow for quite some time, but eventually managed to get up and walk home in the dark.

At the same time, my step brother Dexter had broken a bone (skiing?) A couple days before.
I expressed to my Dad and step mom that my shoulder hurt very badly but my step mom said I was just trying to get attention because of Dexter's injury. I could hardly use my arm but they refused to take me to the doctor. I was playing it up according to her. I always needed attention.

 ""That's enough. Go to your room.""

Weeks (months? My timelines are all messed up from suppressed memories) later, my dad finally takes me in after relentless complaints about my shoulder. Since so long had passed, the doctor saw nothing wrong and sent us on our way.
I always thought I just dislocated my rib or something because of a large, boney lump on my chest.
Sitting on the couch right now feeling my collarbone, it feels very ""odd"" compared to the other side. I ask my boyfriend if it seems/feels weird and after comparing both sides for a while, he's like, ""yup, that was definitely broken at one point."" 

I broke my f**king collar bone as a young child and the two adults that were responsible for taking care of me did nothing. 


Even though the bones healed years ago, I feel like a part of me just broke in half again."
Hey I need some advice.,5,m6rzii,8,"I’ve been talking with this girl I really like and I’ve discovered she has ptsd from sexual trauma in her past, I’m pretty clueless when it comes to ptsd because of how vast of a mental disorder is, so if anyone could help explain I’m how I can support her that would be amazing."
lost in it all,1,m6ru8h,1,it’s all so tiring. i’m as resilient as i can be but man it just really gets to ya sometimes yknow... i’m proud of how long i’ve held on for and how much of the mess in my head i’ve been able to take but sometimes i wish i wasn’t such a fighter. i wish i could just breakdown in the arms of a loved one and cry
Does anyone else have experience with their parents trying to sweep their sexual abuse under the rug?,76,m6qyqk,33,"If you feel comfortable, please share how you knew they were. also, what made you realize they weren’t on your side?"
"I’m currently in therapy with an child and adolescent psychotherapist. I’m 17, 18 at the end of the year. Should I start thinking of switching to a different therapist?",7,m6pyc9,1,"I like my therapist, but sometimes I feel like I can’t talk to her about heavier stuff. We talk about my boundaries, my trauma responses as a result of my childhood, and my depression and anxiety. But we haven’t spoken about my abuse, my PTSD (in specific detail and calling it what it is), panic attacks or bipolar disorder (I can’t really be diagnosed because I don’t want to come off my antipsychotics)"
Should I even bother with therapy? Online therapy?,28,m6pdad,24,"So, I might as well be talking about being abducted by aliens when I talk about my trauma/ptsd with others. It's too absurd, chaotic, unrelatable, and complicated to talk about. Not to mention, I hate talking or even thinking about it. I have tried to rebuild and make a new life for myself, but the terrible events from my past refused to stay dead. Instead, they managed to take over my life again and have made my present an unimaginable nightmare. Sadly, I have no decent people around to help me. So I'm forced to live with these terrible events entirely by myself.

Now, I think that talking about all this with someone (like a therapist) and them giving regular feedback would be a great help. But I fear that if I met a therapist in person, it would take them just a year to grasp what I'm talking about. All I can see is time and money being wasted with little to show for. But maybe online therapy is an option more suited for me? I'm just looking for someone other than me to even consider and talk about my scenario. 

Should I consider online therapy? Or is my scenario entirely hopeless and should I just give up on trying to have others relate with me? If it wasn't for the terrible thing that happened these last two years, I think I would have been fine with telling no one about my past."
"Nightmares about family member's death, how do I tell my parent?",1,m6opqg,0,"Hey everyone, since I can remember I've had these vivid nightmares surrounding memories about the day my close cousin died. He died 9 years ago. Driving there, seeing all the ambulances and people crying, stuff like that. I'm not sure if I want to tell my parent or not. I'm definitely sure that I don't know what to tell them. I told my therapist when I used to do therapy but whenever I think about him I just breakdown and it's really pathetic and embarrassing.

I just really don't know what to say or even if I should say anything at all. Also, is there a way to prevent these kind of nightmares? I'm lucky if I get 4 hours of sleep yet it still happens and I don't know how to make it stop. Thanks in advance."
How do you fight the tiredness of life?,11,m6oo41,5,"The heavy tired you can’t sleep off. The depression, the memories, the loss, the grief....I am TIRED. MY SOUL ACHES. I am hurting."
It’s that time of year again,6,m6nd6s,1,Totally forgot that March into the end of April when the ‘incident’ happened is when the night terrors come back no matter what kind of medication I am on. A friend reminded me of this tonight. This year will be 5 years. If I could occupy my mind and body with something during that time when it did occur I would but it happened at like 1-2am and everyone I know is sleeping. Guess I will be in for a roller coaster of dreams til it’s over. Wish me luck I come out on the other side again!!
Memory loss?,12,m6nbe3,5,"Can ptsd cause memory loss? I was abused all my life and some part of the family still in this abusive relationship. I struggle with intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, triggering words, memory loss  
 I’m so forgetful and I understand this is normal but i feel like it’s worse that the normal
I don’t remember anything from the age about 16 under (only bad memories) - i’m 22 and still to this day don’t remember a lot of things. It was that bad I didn’t know that 3 of my siblings i lived with for years was my siblings until a few years ago."
PTSD OPTIONS AND HELP,3,m6m4c7,2,"If you think you have or recently been diagnosed with PTSD.... please realize you’re not alone. For starters, you found this group. Secondly, while everyone’s life experiences are different, our emotional/physical/psychological reactions will be different, but can be the same. So don’t think you are alone in this fight for your well being.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and secondary PTSD about 2 years ago. My PTSD event occurred in 2016 while my secondary PTSD SYMTPOMS have been occurring over the last 10 years or so(job related). 
You have to understand everyone handles things differently, but that does not mean you have to handle it alone. After my 2016 incident, I thought I was ok after a month or two. It wasn’t until nearly a full year did I truly see what was happening to me. My wife saw the signs much sooner. 

Many people, for a variety of reasons, are uncomfortable with talking to a mental health professional. I was too at first. If you want to truly get the help you need, you have to outside of your comfort zone and ask for help. When you finally do, the first couple of sessions will be fairly short and not to invasive. The therapist wants to get to know you, your medical history and what brought your there. Depending on your type of treatment, it could be 4-5 sessions before you get to the heart of the matter. I was recommended EMDR therapy(please look this up so this post isn’t too long). It wasn’t until my 10th or 11th regular session did we do the EMDR. I have found it very helpful. However, it can be very emotionally and physically draining at times... depending on your incident. But you must be honest with everything, what happened, how you feel it has affected you, and most importantly how you’re feeling during the treatments. Please, don’t try to go it alone like I did. It only makes it worse. 

God bless and good luck to you all"
I don't know what to think about this,1,m6lyj6,1,"Couple years ago, when I was about 11 I was on vacation with my parents in Bulgaria. One time I went swimming alone and it was a bad idea. Some older dude touched my butt, I got scared so I started to swim away from him but he grabbed my leg. I started screaming and he left me. I quickly ran out of the water but I've never told my parents about it.

Some time ago I told my two friends about it, and they just laughed it off. 

I hate when people touch me and I often feel sick or uncomfortable because of it. I have no idea if this is somehow related to that event. I really don't know what to think about this and if I should tell this to my parents. I tried telling this to my therapist but Im too embarrassed. I have so many problems right now and I don't like to think about this, but what if this has something to do with my confidence, self-hatred or whatever. I don't know. Its so embarrassing to write about this and Im kinda scared but fuck it help."
Disappointed with my first therapy session,15,m6kjv6,12,"To be fair it's only the first session and we both felt like we didn't talk about as much as we wanted, but it felt like they wanted to focus more on my anxiety and depression and not my PTSD. They're giving me worksheets and forms to fill out to better assess me and find the best approach to my situation (they mentioned brainspotting and cbt), but I'm already leaning towards finding someone else."
Does PTSD cause ocd symptoms?,15,m6jv2w,3,"Its been a long and I stat to develop intrustive thoughts. Even for some thing that don't related for the trauma.

For example out of the blue I have intrustive thoughts ''You are a doormat''

and ofc it changes the way i behave and appear and people judge me because thougth that ive no control over.

My boyfriend’s nickname is the name of the man who groomed me,1,m6h3b2,6,"I’m dating a guy named “Jimmy”. I love Jimmy and I am comfortable with him, but I’ve recently started hanging out with some of his friends and one of them often calls him “Jim” which is also the name of the old man who groomed me when I was a young teen. I’m trying not to be bothered by it but I think about it a lot. I’m worried the friend will say something about my boyfriend while referring to him as Jim that will cause me to panic. 

Any advice for dealing with this trigger? I’m sure his friend would be understanding if I asked him not to say Jim, but it would be easier to avoid that conversation."
How to heal,2,m6eyo3,2,"I was recently diagnosed with a few things, PTSD being one of them. What are way you heal? I can be quite outgoing but once my true feelings are brought up or asked about, I shut down. I am starting to stand up for myself though and all of a sudden I just feel like writing letters or texts to people telling them how I feel. Is that weird? I’m scared to see how some may react, and some relationships could end if they don’t like my boundaries, but I just feel like I want to do this but I am also doubting myself."
Delete and Ban if not allow but I am sick and Tired,0,m6ey40,7,"Look, I do not know what your people's circumstances are, but if you think you have PTSD then please seek treatment from a professional. **DO NOT SELF DIAGNOSE OR MEDICATE**. You and all your google skills cannot replace the knowledge and experience of a trained medical professional. You may be uncomfortable seeking professional help, I was. PTSD is not cut and paste, you could have severe depression, anxiety,  ect. that are symptoms of PTSD but the underlying cause of the issue is not PTSD. 

I have lost to many friends to suicide, and I do not want to see any of you glamorus people harmed. REDDIT is a great place for talking to others about what is going on with you, but it is not a replacement for a doctor. Go get help."
Sibling with autism and bpd,8,m6cjof,2,"I’m 16, 3rd child of 4, everyone diagnosed with autism except for my little sister. My oldest sister (21) has had aggressive and violent meltdowns for as long as I can remember. I got used to screaming and having the police at our door. I’ve never been in the same room when it happened because it was unsafe, so kind of just sat alone at night waiting for it to end so I can go back to sleep. My parents never talked about it. Every time it happened we just moved on without saying a word, which resulted in me not feeling like I can talk about anything to anyone. 

I knew I had trauma, I never considered I might have ptsd. Probably because all my shit got shoved under the rug when I got my autism diagnosis. 

My sister has been on medication for a few months and it has been better. She rarely has meltdowns anymore and overall we’re much more stable than we used to be. However, I don’t feel like anything changed. I’m still on edge all the time, waiting for shit to happen. I still can’t talk about anything and we don’t talk about anything. I have severe anxiety and can’t talk about any of my problems because my sister always came first. I feel selfish talking about my shit because everyone has worse things going on. 

Things have been calm lately though. I had to drop out of school because of panic attacks but am spending my days at a farm now, where I pretty much do all of my school work instead. But the problem is there are more kids with autism there, kids that also have aggressive outbursts. The reason why I got to ptsd is because a few days ago one of the teachers had to yell at one of the kids that had an outburst. I wasn’t prepared for it to happen and it immediately triggered me with flashbacks and intense fear which eventually turned into mild dissociation. I’ve been doing some research on emotional neglect caused by having a sibling with a mental illness, and parents that don’t notice your struggles. 

Besides that my sister is moving out soon. Which should be a good thing as it would mean the meltdowns wont ever happen here again but it feels awful. I’m still on edge all the time even though nothing in the last few months has even been remotely as bad as it used to be. I can’t talk to my therapist I panic and I dissociate. I’m not quite sure how to get a diagnosis and proper help with my trauma."
Don’t give me your pity,13,m6auqe,7,"I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and bipolar 1 for 2 years now and I just don’t like being pitied, I know I’m a bit different, but trying to teach my friends/family how I process my emotions differently, is so tiresome/frustrating. It makes me feel like I wished that no one knew anything about me and never told anyone about my family and sexual trauma my whole life. I just feel like no one really cares about me and just wants to control my life without even letting me put input in and making it harder for me to make my own decisions Bc of the fear they struck in me."
Do these sound like ptsd symptoms?,1,m6a4gj,0,"(Apologies if I have picked the wrong flair)
Hi, I was diagnosed with ptsd 18months ago, but also some other things, and started on new and much better medication. I’ve kind of been ignoring the ptsd part of it since then, put it in the too hard basket, but recently I’m trying to accept it and face it. I’ve been wondering if actually some of my problems could be symptoms or related to ptsd. My ptsd is related to sexual assaults in childhood and adulthood. My new medication has helped with nightmares and sleep, but I think these other things are more difficult to fix.

Symptoms:
- I used to be happily sexually active and confident, but for the past 3 years I’ve been completely turned off. I now am jumpy even if people try to hug me, unless I have prior warning and am not surprised, even people I love and trust. This really is weird for me and I am angry at myself about it. 
- crying often, for no reason or for very small reasons, like watching a video where someone talks about having an illness.
- full body fatigue and aches, I feel like I’ve run a marathon but I’ve done no exercise. 
- explosive anger and very sensitive to any kind of criticism.

If anyone has any thoughts, even if it’s just a yes or a no, I would appreciate it. I’m waiting to see my new psychologist and will be telling her about all these things too. Thank you."
Growing up with Narcs is probably the reason why I might have ptsd,2,m69y4t,1,"They were overprotective yet mean and discouraging, and fear mongering was their parenting style to put you into submission. 

I was raised in a religious household and at the age of 7 I was told about the devil. 

About demonic possessions and I’ve seen footage of demonic possessions and children who don’t obey God will be claimed by the devil. 

It’s also one of the reason why I still sleep with a night light and afraid of the dark. 

At times I still get nightmares about demons and evil spirits because those are the stories I grew up with. 

It’s so bad that I can’t sleep alone in the dark without feeling unsafe. I can’t live in a large house because that sparks my anxiety when it’s night time. 

I find it hard to find professional help for that because I might be seen as a test object. 

Thankfully I have a kitty and I feel at when she’s around. 

I also hear about going to hell for stepping out of religion, I have mixed feelings, at times I want to stay to avoid going to hell and burn forever but on the other hand I feel like religion is man made and just a control tool."
Officially diagnosed with PTSD after surviving COVID,142,m69j99,86,"I thought I was doing better and. It just spiraled so fast. I’m having severe anxiety on the daily. Feels like there’s glass in my skin. Sweating. Heart racing (I need to take meds to keep it lower cuz it’s like 130+ even when I’m sitting). Feels like I’m stuck in this weird fog. Or black tar pit. Feels like I’m suffocating. Reminds me of when I was sick and I could barely breathe. Remembering those weeks in quarantine in that empty house all alone on Christmas and it’s just a blur of fear and sobbing. Hearing my grandma yell for help as they took her to the hospital. Hearing her beg me to take her home. Crying as I tried to explain that I couldn’t. 

I have slept an average of 2 hours a night since I got “better”. When I do sleep, I am apparently screaming and crying in my sleep. I hardly sleep enough to have dreams anymore but when I do they are nightmares. Hardly eating. Can’t focus. Can’t focus at all. Not even on fun stuff. Keep buying more stuff thinking one of these purchases will be good enough that I can actually have fun again but it’s useless. It’s just all gathering dust in my room. 

I need to learn how to be human again and it’s hard. Especially with a family pressuring me to hurry up and be normal and be okay because they don’t like seeing me struggle. I keep trying to force normalcy for their sake but I feel like I’m dying all the time."

The deeper I go, if you wanna call it that, into sleep the characters in my dream start to pop up as x girlfriends, that I am not only getting married to but some how we have become the browns from Alaskan bush people. Yes used to love that show til billy got sick and their egos got to big. I also wear a Cpap to sleep, have yo purr kids that love to either sleep on me or somewhat close to me, enter added anxiety tonight. Oh and here I am barely 3 hrs later. Totally out of water, stuff is supposed to last me a hoot 6-8 hours when I am breathing normally. Bit freaked out. I know my mind. If I go back to bed will it wander back to dream or go somewhere else entirely. This is why I make up little stories before bedtime because at least then I have control of where my mind goes once it hits dream world."
Need Advice Dealing with Heart Rate Spikes,5,m624so,9,"Hey there!
It's my first time posting here so bear with me.

I keep experiencing spikes in my heart rate. I'll be standing still talking and my heart rate is at 110bpm. I'll be walking around my house, doing the dishes, or washing my face and bam, my heart rate has spiked to 106bpm. (This is consistent across a number of devices I've used to check my heart rate throughout the day)

At the moment I'm dealing with this by stopping what I'm doing to sit down, take big belly breaths and sometimes even the Peter Levine voo breathing. But this is much harder when I'm in the middle of talking to someone, or standing at work (I work in customer service). 

Does anyone have any advice in how to deal with/minimise heart rate spikes?"
Is anyone else losing their hair?,4,m61vy0,7," I'm losing hair to balding/thinning, and it could be because of the ptsd. 

My hair's been getting all thin and straight up going away in some places. Yeah I pull it out sometimes from the stress but this is just excessive, I think being freaked out all the time is making it go away

Has this been happening to any of y'all? What did you do about it? 

The nightmares, flashbacks, bad feelings etc. are bad enough already but DAMN losing my hair has me feeling worse than anything else rn and I could really use some advice from y'all"
Starting trauma work,2,m61nf4,1,"4 years ago I got out a horrible abusive relationship that left me with trauma so bad I flunked out of my freshman year of college, before i was that stereotypical ap student.

I know i need to work through this and deserve to finally feel more free but I’m terrified and half wanting to say no save it for some other time.

Self triggering- anyone else?,7,m5wwdp,2,"For context I was in a terrorist attack when I was seventeen. It’s now almost four years later and after being diagnosed in 2018 with PTSD it’s gotten better but sometimes I have flare ups during times of stress/when terrorist attacks happen. 

Recently I’ve found myself researching more about the attack, purposefully looking for tweets about it from the day and initial breaking news reports. I’m finding that it’s like I’m almost wanting to trigger an emotional reaction even though I know I don’t ((actually)) want to experience that pain.

I need relationship advice,3,m5wgau,4,"I need some advice

I’m a sexual assault survivor, when I was younger and once by an ex girlfriend. Recently with a new girl who also happens to be a survivor who recently went through it about 3 years ago. I cared about her and always wanted to keep her happy. As a young couple we were intimate. Had sex maybe 3 times a week. I thought she was into it because she would send me freaky text messages and pictures throughout the day. About a month ago she had a ptsd nightmare and put my face to the guys face. It started off hey saying her therapist said I had a sex problem and I respected her words. I signed up for therapy a day later to be told differently. She told me and my homie that she realized she just got triggered, told me she still loved me but was scared of me, I gave her the space she asked for and she came back into my life saying I assaulted her so I told her I apologize I made her feel that way. But to me it feels like she’s trying to change what happened in the past or how it happened like she’s trying to remember what didn’t happen. She stalks my account on Instagram. I don’t text too many people on insta so I see when she blocks me and unblocks me every other day and once she accidentally liked a picture. She had multiple accounts too so I don’t know if she’s watching me on the other ones. She called me out for posting me missing her videos on tiktok but she doesn’t follow me or I follow her. Ig I’m here asking for advice, it’s been a month, has anyone gone through something similar? I’m trying to be as nice as possible to her because I understand she had trauma before I hoped in this relationship but it’s kind of scary. I love the girl still but i don’t know what to do. I tried apologizing and she wanted to see me in person and hang out and she would have a panic attack and flake. Now it seems she’s done with me but she’s also stalking me so I’m super confused"
"I want to ruin his life (TW: grooming, r*pe, partner emotional abuse, nsfw for a few parts, suicide)",3,m5vq38,3,"I keep tabs on his facebook once a year or so. Watch his relationships change like the weather. Laugh a little internally at the quotes about leaving the past behind and being a good person.

We were best friends, like siblings. We called eachother that aswell, I called him big bro. I was 14 and he was 18 (soon 19 a little after we met online)

We talked daily, almost allll the time. He was complaining once about being horny in college and me, being a dumb horny teen, kinda jokingly suggested I could help. While I shouldnt have done this, I was 14 years old, already traumatized by other things, and heavily dependent on one person at a time like my life revolved around them completely. He continued and we sexted for a bit, he felt guilty but I promised him it was legal in my country because I was genuinely in love with him and got scared because I thought I wanted this for real at the time and was responsible enough (which it wasnt legal, and even then he shouldve told me I was overstepping and that he was an adult, he shouldve stopped me)

Me being the initiator still makes me feel super guilty. Was it even grooming? what do I call it? His BPD made him extremely dependent on me and emotionally manipulate me into essentially making his mental health my total responsibility. We continued this relationship for about 2 years, s\*xting still. He was my first experience as a sub in B\*SM and it affects me to this day that he's how I discovered that side of myself. I'm still 17 so I won't go into details about the specific things we did for that, but 70% of me says it was his fault that he didnt stop it and manipulated me into being his only support beam for his bpd and s\*icidal tendencies. There were many days and nights where I was talking him out of hanging himself, and he would do it so much anyway. I was s\*icidal myself and still struggle with depression despite being on meds now, and he kept pushing it all on me, a child. When he was r\*ped I was the only one to support him.

I once sent him a nice care package across the ocean where he lives. He wanted some of my a-few-days-worn underwear so I included that. He told me he m\*sturbated while wearing my hoodie and underwear.

All that doubt of how valid it was aside, I know where he works. I have the really bad urge to show the tattoo studio he works at what he did. But he has pets that depend on him.

Big first step! going to therapy,100,m5ujax,16,"My first session is tomorrow. I've messaged my therapist to give her some more info about me and she told me I have more than one trauma, which is interesting to me because I just lumped them all together. Other than depression and anxiety, I depersonalize and also have issues with brain fog and impaired memory. I look forward to learning more and finally getting better so I can function better and be happier. I've been trying to heal on my own but I feel so stuck and unsupported and I need professional help"
Started journaling... but if anything its making me more anxious,5,m5udnd,0," I've been meaning to use a notebook to write down what traumas I've endured just to get them out of my head. The thing is I feel almost like I'm doing something I'm not supposed to. As if I am over reacting to things in my past that ""aren't a big deal"" because thats what I've been told.. I'm so tired of keeping everything bottled up to the point I have a huge breakdown when unwanted memories flood in. It's like I'm reliving them over and over... The past two weeks have been hell mentally because something that happened in my childhood resurfaced to my memory and has traumatized me all over again. I've only managed to get a page in and I haven't even covered the first trauma I've endured. I'm thinking about just finding the right place to post instead of journaling on physical paper. I'm too afraid of it getting in the wrong person(s) hands and then being judged and misunderstood."
Intrusive memories that.. aren't about the trauma??,31,m5txds,17,"Confusing title maybe, sorry. I've been wondering if anyone else experiences this or knows what it is, but I often get just random intrusive memories about my childhood that make me feel really awful, maybe triggered but it's not as intense? Even though they might not have anything to do with my trauma. Like I'll look at the way the light is coming through the window, and it'll bring me back to a specific memory of when I was in third grade, looking out my kitchen's window and smelling my mom making eggs, and it instantly makes me feel sick to my stomach, and my heart races, and I feel very uncomfortable and instinctively shake my head as if to shake away the memory, even though I know it's not a bad memory. This only really happens with childhood memories, and I did experience a lot of childhood trauma, but it just doesn't make sense to me why the memories aren't of any sort of trauma yet they still feel like this. If I need to give more information pls let me know

Edited for clarity."
Spiritual awakening leading to more memories of trauma.,3,m5sv1w,0,"I have been making amazing progress in therapy that has truly been changing my life. My nervous system is being rewired. It's so amazing, I cry from joy. 

Someone went missing and it hit close to home. I had flashbacks of when I was kidnapped and since I am more body aware, I could FEEL the energy move through my body and causing the pain in certain areas. It was like I was in that place all over again. Even writing this makes me tear up. I have so much ignored trauma I am so scared to dive into I. My therapist is 100% amazing and it sucks that I can't do in person therapy right now. To try and work through these emotions via telehealth is a damn nightmare. I am thankful I had my partner there with me while having a body flashback,. It helped me tremendously.. I am worried I will go back to old trauma patterns because of this. I'm trying so hard to get better, and I am, but things like this reallllllly set me back a bit. People fucking suck. My entire childhood was basically robbed from me. I'm constantly in search of that inner child. That little girl who never had the love she needed. And I have to be there for her and Is so so hard."
Well this is new...,1,m5plgt,2,"2 years ago I was in a single car accident. We had some snow/ice and when I was driving, my tire got stuck in some slush, I fishtailed on the highway and hit a cement barricade going 40 mph. My Jeep was totalled and I spent 10 hours in the emergency room while they tried to figure out if I had any internal bleeding. I was the only one in the car, thank goodness, but everyone was shocked that I didn't have more Injuries/concussion/etc. I didnt think I had any PTSD from it, so never sought help. 

This morning I hit black ice on my drive to work. I fishtailed 6 times, did a full spin in my suv before I was finally able to grab onto some road that wasn't covered in black ice. 

I realized when I got into the office that I'm probably struggling with some form of PTSD from my car accident 2 years ago, and this mornings incident showed me that I need to start seeing someone to process it. 

I'm not sure what I'm asking for - maybe some sort of validation that PTSD can be caused by a car accident? I don't really know...but I know the thought of driving home this evening is scaring me and already causing a lot of anxiety."

Any tips on how to get the most out of exposure therapy?,2,m5gt2i,0,Hi! After a CBT treatment my therapist has now started doing exposure therapy with me. I had my first long session 5 days ago so yeah it's still to early to see results. But I'm just wondering if anyone here has had to go through exposure therapy and if you have some tips on how  deal with it. I'm also just not sure how I'm supposed to feel about my traumatic memories after we're done with this. I can't possibly feel ok about them right? What can I expect?

And no hot feelings or even cold feelings when one should be feeling angry if somebody wronged you in the present day for instance?,10,m5flmw,5,It just feels utterly weird. I don’t know if my ability express my anger and pain has left me now. Because of the trauma I’ve gone through. Or if it has been completely switched off and needs to switch back on again. I’m just left feeling empty and hollow. As if I am having key emotions missing from my experience. It just feels hollow when I would normally feel something intensely. Like a need to defend myself when under attack or being treated unfairly. Anybody else get this and does it describe something similar to you?

I resent others who are turning 18 and are comfortable with it, having lived their lives. I’m stuck at 14 experience wise, and the last few years haven’t really been living just, trying to survive and get to a place where I can live. I struggle to be grateful."
Does anyone overcome trauma by trying to forget about it?,1,m5doim,1,"My experiences aren't as severe as some others, but two times I have been separated from my pets when they died. First, my horse. He was out in Colorado and he had an equine disease called EPM. I   
 was in Massachusettes. One day he couldn't get up and he was put down and my mom told me months later of his passing. Recently, December 2020, we had to put my dog down because she had a stomach cancer or something related to cancer where her bowels were obstructed. She was in Massachusettes and I was in Colorado with my mom. Funny how that worked, huh?

 With these deaths, I manage to push them aside rather quickly. It took a bit longer with my horse because he was my best friend while my dog was more of my mom's from time to time. And she kind of disconnected from the family as she got older. With my dog, on the day of her passing, I just felt numb and guilty, but over the next few days I forced myself to stop being sad and just move on.

However, my trauma of experience death still shakes me up. I've never seen anyone die in front of me and I kind of hope that I never do. Now, I currently own another horse who I got after my last horse was unrideable due to his EPM. But even I get scared to think about him dying on me one day even though it is going to happen eventually."
Looking for advice. Tw for csa and sexual assault.,5,m5d5zb,1,"So, I've posted about this once before... But the thing is I didn't receive really any helpful advice ( definitely not trying to sound rude, sorry if it seems that way. Likely on me for not giving enough detail. ) last time and I'm desperate for some help, because apparently getting in to see a therapist won't happen for a few more months, at least, bc... America's mental healthcare system. 

Long story short, I was molested by my older brother as a child, I was assaulted and coerced into sexual activity by my first bf as a teen, and I was assaulted again as an adult. Needless to say, I have some issues regarding sex. And one of those is that once I get worked up, I need to get some release for it, otherwise it starts screwing with my brain. It starts feeling like people are touching me, I can't handle anyone actually touching me, depression hits hard, I start disassociating, ect. It's not pretty. And there's a very specific list of actions my fiance does that get me into the mood, and all of them are explicitly sexual in nature.  I've listed them off to him. He knows what they are, he knows how they affect me, and he knows how it hurts my brain if he does them and doesn't follow through. Even months ago we literally had a talk with my therapist at the time and she said that there should be an understanding between us that if he does those specific things, there should be a follow through. And if he's not in the mood and doesn't feel up to doing anything, then he shouldn't do the things that get me worked up in the first place. Sounds fair, right??   The issue is, he still does those things. Then proceeds to leave me hanging for days following it. And before you ask, no, trying to take care of it, myself, only makes it worse if anything. And if I bring it up to him that he worked me up, he frequently brushes it off or sometimes gets defensive about it. And it hurts.  It sends me into a spiral that gets so bad I can't sleep, even having the cats' fur brushing my skin feels like too much touch, I can't eat, lose my voice, start tuning out everything around me for minutes at a time, feel like my whole bodys just not real or not there or not mine.    And the thing is, I don't know why there's this disconnect?? In everything else, he's the sweetest guy. I have chronic pain and he's constantly freaking out over me if I look like I'm in even a little bit of pain. Hes thoughtful, brings me gifts, listens to me.  So I don't get why this specifically is just?? So difficult??? And it's not like he doesn't understand how bad it gets. I mean, we're both extremely physically affectionate people and I know it bothers him when it gets bad and we can't cuddle or even hug because the mere thought of being touched when I'm in that state makes me feel pukey and shaky, but he still has the nerve to get offended when I turn down snuggles??? I don't get it. And I'm at my wits end. I just need to know what to do, how to get through to him.    Cause the other issue is, I never want him to feel like he has to have sex with me, I would never want to take away someone's consent like that at all. But then am I the bad guy for getting upset with him and kind of expecting sex if he purposely does the things that work me up but leaves me hanging?? Like, is it wrong that he'll do those things and I'll think, ""I guess he's in the mood""?  Like I said, all the things that work me up are explicitly sexual in nature. It's not like just a hug or handholding or something is enough to do it. So, am I the asshole here for getting worked up and expecting sex after he does those things?? Please, advice is welcome. Cause this has been going on for months and I've run out of ideas. I just need to know how to get it through to him fully and completely that he needs to stop doing it to me. It's seriously affecting my health, mental and physical. Losing sleep, losing weight, moods tanking, and I'd like it to stop."

TW//: Shooting

I was a witness in a shooting in October and I live in a very gang active area. There was another shooting near my house the other night and it threw me into an absolute panic. I haven’t been sleeping with out melatonin, I am consistently replaying every single thing that has happened those two nights and the shooting from when I was in high school.

The Storm,3,m57vs3,1,"The Storm

As I leave the gym today in the middle of a blizzard like every other day since my breakup, my past is right there to join me on my walk to the car. It buckles up next to me and holds it's icy grip on my hand. Reminds me of all my insecurities and failures. From destroying the person I loved the most to ruining every relationship with family or friendships I've ever had. It loves to play back why I'll never be good enough for anyone. Why somehow I'll sabotage anyone's life who gets close enough to me. All I do at this point is either attempt to fill the void that my mother left in me as a child or I'm fighting everyday to be different. To just have that breakthrough in change. Therapy, self help books, daily affirmations, exercise for hours on end, meditation, all of it feels like temporary fixes. Like a band aid on a cracked foundation. I don't wanna be like this anymore. My last relationship although I'm so thankful for it ending because it showed how much I needed to change it's also showed how broken I am. It's revealed the monster behind the mask I've always hidden behind. I've been raped, shot at, blown up, beaten into submission, told I'd never be smart enough or handsome enough for anyone to ever love me since I was four. I just wish things were easier. I wish I could catch a break from Life. But I think there are so many people that have had it so much worse than me and my problems are insignificant. I can see on the other side of the mirror someone who is beautiful and can be confident and just at peace. But like a mirror it's impossible to get to the reflection. I just wish I could feel something different. I want to be a better person so bad. I don't want to carry on this toxic cycle."
Philosophical problems with PTSD treatment,32,m56j4n,31,"I'm starting to think that too much of mental health treatment, especially with trauma, is simplify and standardized to the point of meaninglessness for me. When people speak of ""acceptance, healing, and moving on"", I don't disagree, when you get into what that REALLY means, there’s no substance.  

It seems to me like a lot of trauma work is about separating trauma from a person’s idea of the self; “accepting you are not your trauma”. Okay, well, what is the self? And who is to say what a healthy vs unhealthy arrangement of the self is?  

Neuroscience seems to suggest that the self is not a unitary or consistent feature of a person; that complicates any meaningful discussion of this. To my reading of the evidence, it is seems like the self is really like a bunch of interwoven narratives, aspects, and systems of emotion and thought, which by their very essence cannot be partitioned into discrete things. Further, the arrangement of the self, or the mind, doesn’t conform to a single healthy range, or baseline, like say the functioning of a kidney or a heart might. But then this stands in stark contrast to the treatment philosophies and modalities used by a great deal of American mental health providers.  

The mind, as an emergent property of the brain, is not well understood, and I don’t believe you can just say “I am not my trauma” over and over again, and “find acceptance”. I find that the more I push for meaning in treatment, the more I find conversations devolve into either spiritualism (i.e. mindfulness as a sort of religion) or into discussion which are predicated on finding ways to get me conform to hyper-standardized diagnostic label/criteria, predicated upon the world view that my identity is medically “wrong” and bust conform to what is “medically right”.  

I think it is very debatable to dismiss the thoughts and feelings of a person impacted by trauma as simply the product of sickness, a disease of the brain; it much more complicated than that I believe.  

I think what it means to separate the ""self"" from trauma is not clear cut the way it is made out to be, and by it's very nature runs into the thorny issues of what people understand to be normal, and what metric or cultural worldview is being used to judge what a healthy baseline of emotional health actually is.  

In my experience, it seems that a lot of psychological professionals struggle to incorporate an evidenced, consistent, and multidimensional theory of the mind into their work, and are extremely resistant to accepting that people can fall outside of the check boxes or DSM.

Ultimately I feel like getting help, real help, is so hard because so many of the people who as mental health professionals are too mired in their narrow worldviews on what the self, the mind, and well being means for individual people."
i'm looking for help coping with still living with the cause of your ptsd,2,m56fiw,0,"hey all ! this is my first post, i've decided maybe the support here can help :)

TW: family abuse caused by mental illness, suicide threats, (mentions aspergers, bipolar disorder, OCD)

i have ptsd as a result of continuous childhood trauma. a lot of people i meet with ptsd from childhood have it because of a parent, but i have it because of my sister. we're a family of 5, which is me (youngest), older sister i'll call julie (middle child), oldest sister who i'll call eliza, and my two parents. eliza has is on the aspergers spectrum and has bipolar disorder and it was something that got worse and worse as she grew up. issues started at around the time she turned 5, when i was born. when she was 10 ish my parents took her to therapy, she was diagnosed and from then on she would refuse to talk to the therapist. like straight refused to speak, she would just sit there. so they stopped taking her, things were in a constant fragile state the entire time i was growing up. she'd have what we call 'episodes' about 5 times a week. anything could start them (ex. telling her to do a chore, her getting jealous of something, basically anytime something didn't go her way). due to this i just developed this thing where my chest hurts when i'm around her, i'm constantly on edge. 

those years were the worst, things went from verbally to physically violent. nobody ever got seriously, seriously hurt, it was a lot of threats with weapons, pushing and pinning to walls, charging at us, that kind of a thing. one of the worst reoccurring incidents in her episodes was her getting a weapon or something possibly deadly and threatening to/saying she was going to kill herself. there were two causes; either she hated herself for what she was doing to us or she would use it as a way to get things. friends were scarce for me, too, because she would have episodes while they were over and it would scare them. one time she pulled out a knife in front of one of my best friends and later that week while we were on a walk eliza told me that she thought my life would be better off with her dead, i didn't know what to say because at the time it was true. it didn't help that both of my parents get easily angered, my dad gets especially angry over finances because he was poor growing up, but my mom is more manipulative and tends to get angry over emotional situations. when julie was in middle school my mom basically lived through her and left me behind with eliza and my dad, which was a horrible combination. i have julie to relate to as someone who went through the same thing in a way, but she was able to do tons of extracurriculars and be away from home most of the time and experienced like 1/4 of what i did. i love her dearly but it's hard not to feel a little resentment.

anyway, eliza finally got some actual help at around 16 and went to therapy until she went to college. she's a senior in college now, but living at home with us because of COVID-19. julie still went to school, i don't blame her, but her and i are best friends and i've never had to be around eliza without julie. julie doesn't have PTSD, she was affected in a different way (she has OCD). i can talk to her about that a bit (my therapist says i'm on the OCD spectrum), but there's no one i can talk about about this. i'm a junior in high school, but i've pushed myself academically a lot and am technically a freshman in college. i'm online in college and will have my associate's degree the same year i graduate high school (weird, i know haha), but the point is eliza and i are both home for school. i'm able to be around her more than i used to because her episodes are more spread out and are only verbal now for the most part, but she still always triggers me and some of the things she says to me i worry will stick with me forever. we got a bit closer this past year, but about a month ago she had a really bad episode and i knew i had to go away and be alone for a bit to use my kit (my method of coping is by pulling myself out of a flashback through the senses, like i'll spray something with a strong scent, feel something odd, and i have a kit full of these things). anyway, i was getting my things and leaving and she said to me ""whatever, go cry about it"" and it just has really stuck with me. i know it sounds lame but it just felt like she was mocking the symtoms of the disorder that *she* gave me. it just felt awful. things haven't been the same, my mom and i got into an argument that triggered me today and she said something similar. i haven't been able to get over it and it makes me feel immature. she has some issues too, she's just sort of textbook manipulative and i can't tell her if she hurts my feelings because she turns it around and tries to make me feel awful about it (ex. well i guess i'm just a terrible person, sorry i'm an awful mother, etc.)

i know i have to live with both of them for the next year. does anyone know some good coping mechanisms for this ? 

thank you <3"
We stuck in the middle ages,6,m56aop,15,"The methdos to solve ptsd are poor. what do we got EMDR? Is the only treatment recongised along with medication.

"I'm just tired of people who are triggering me constantly (TW: sexual abuse, harassment, stalking)",4,m5656k,3,"Well, guys, I suffer from sexual PTSD for three years now. It started the day I was threatened with rape by a guy who was stalking my social media after I ghosted him since he was VERY direct about how he wants to hook up and everything, not to mention he was too obtrusive, even though we were strangers when he messaged me trying to flirt with me. Later I discovered that he had known my family, but I never knew or met him, so we were complete strangers anyway.

And you know what? I'm tired because something similar is happening again.

So I'm a freshman in uni now and one of the guys who is studying with me is trying to flirt with me. To give you some context, we have never met in person and never talked about anything but our studies, but a few weeks ago he started getting, um, kinda too much when I was just helping him with our homework.

To give you some more context, I help everyone, literally everyone and it's obvious from our collective chat where guys and girls are asking for help so I wasn't giving him any reason to act like this. But anyway, it's probably ok to him to ask a girl about when she is going to visit the uni or where is she from (I live in another city), considering that he only knows how this girl looks like and nothing more. I guess he even got angry when I said that I don't know about the time I'll be visiting the uni, even though he switched the subject.

I'm SO UNBEARABLY tired of guys who view me like this. Why on Earth do they act like this towards me? Why I'm viewed as a piece of meat that is suitable only for sex? I'm an alive person and I never asked anyone to treat me like this. I know a lot of ladies who like to be sexual and it's their business, but I'm just sick of it all considering being a Christian woman who was abused sexually. I'm tired of people who just interested in my face/body and think that I need to know about their interest or that they have any right to express that to me directly. I bet they won't even talk to me if they know who I really am and not my face.

Maybe I'm overreacting here, but I am just tired of the fact that the only men that respect my boundaries are my male friends (they are the best cinnamon buns in the world, no doubt, I love them), but when it comes to relationships then I'm just viewed as a proud holder of the vagina but not as a person.

And I'm very uncomfortable with the thought that I need to keep up the conversation with a person who is unpleasant for me so I won't be threatened with rape again. You know, I'm texting with him RIGHT NOW and I wish I was rather dead than talking to him. I know there are lots of good guys out there and thank you guys for your existence, but sometimes living in this society is just too much.

Anyway, I feel like I was raped mentally today for some reason which was is a perfect colorful extra-sprinkle for my major depressive episode so I don't even know why I'm writing this, but thanks if you read the post."
What are the risks of doing a research study on PTSD?,2,m55xkk,2,"[Autocruitment](https://www.autocruitment.com/) is able to connect me to studies about PTSD, and they made a post about how those who may have PTSD are eligible for a compensated evaluation in exchange for participation in some medical trial(s). I don't know all the information is, but I am worried about potentially re-traumatizing myself\* or the side effects of medications interacting with the numerous medications that I'm already on. What are the risks here? Is it possible that they'll compensate me for any harm done? Any advice?

\*I talk a lot about my trauma, so I think that would be difficult but not impossible.

Edit: It just connects you to studies. It's more of an email subscription than anything else. I don't think that it's a scam, it just leaves the information up to the individual studies (which could be scams, I admit). This is more of a general question. I understand that each specific study has its own risks and I need to look at those, but just in general, what should I look out for?"
Hypervigilance is making me relapse,1,m55cw3,1,"tw suicide

&#x200B;

PTSD related from friend attempting suicide when I was a kid. And then I almost attempted suicide because I was emotionally abused online for talking about it.

I can't get it out of my head that I Need To Prevent A Suicide. Because You Gotta. You Can't Just Sit There And Watch It Happen All Over Again. So you get in arguments, and you get angry, and you overstep, and you push boundaries, and stick your nose into other people's business, and people get mad at you, but its ok because you can deal with people getting angry at you if it means someone lives.

All week I've just had images and thoughts of this person killing themselves. And like, how would their family feel? Their friends? What would happen to them? So you've GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

And then people get really mad at you. And accuse you of suicide baiting. And go around acting like you were manipulating and guilttripping them.

But when I'm in the moment, I am *absolutely convinced* I can prevent a suicide if I just find the right things to say. And everyone just kind of...treats me like I'm crazy for it. I feel crazy. I think I probably am.

My friend telling me about her suicide attempt came out of the blue. I was 14. We'd spent the day on [joinme](https://joinme.com) where we could chat and see each others screens.

And then it was evening and my friend told me she'd attempted suicide 2 weeks prior. A boy she liked said something rude to her a party and she toppled over the edge from that one comment, and went home and tried to kill herself and went to sleep and woke up the next day.

So it was a happy day for me with my friend. I was happy. And then the suicide trauma came along in literally a second.

I still don't trust that anybody's truly happy. Even if they act it. I still have the suspicion they're going to try and leave. 

So how can I just sit back. Even if I *know* it's more than likely things will be okay. How do I sit back in the knowledge that there's even the tiniest possiblility it won't be okay.

&#x200B;

Seeing somebody being cyberbullied online made me trauma-relapse. Spent the week *absolutely convinced* I can make this stop. That it's my *responsibility* and my *duty* to make it stop. That I need to prevent a suicide.

A lot of people are mad at me now for sticking my nose in.

&#x200B;

I wish I wasn't this way. I wish I wasn't traumatized. I wish I didn't feel this way. When I get into the middle of a PTSD episode I can't think straight. The episodes can last anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of weeks, or more. I get angry. I say and do things I wouldn't normally do. I cry all the time. I think about self-harm and suicide. I see danger everywhere. I see suicide in everybody I talk to and everybody I meet. I do knee-jerk things without thinking them through. I overreact to every criticism and assume they're going to emotionally abuse me again. I start crying over the tiniest things. I start drowning in guilt for everything I do. I obsess over what I've done wrong and whether people hate me for it. 

&#x200B;

I haven't relapsed in a year. I thought I was over it. And then this week just triggered me completely out of the blue and it's been a complete and utter spiral from there.

&#x200B;

I just don't want it to happen all over again."
People don’t talk about triggers enough.,14,m53ouz,0,"[Let’s Talk: Episode 1- Triggers](https://youtu.be/N-hjvfrojCI)

I made this video trying to simply talk about triggers in a simple way directed more towards people who don’t understand but I tried to also lay it out for people who do understand.

PTSD is literally kicking my ass,102,m53bru,22,I don’t know what else to say
Recent PTSD diagnosis,5,m53bpg,2,"I’m not sure how I feel about all of this. 

I was in the military but never thought of my time in as being something that had a negative effect on me. 

But after reaching out to a number of outlets for help, I was diagnosed with PTSD from the VA a few weeks ago. It’s service connected. They have me on a couple of different meds to treat the symptoms and I’m seeing a therapist 2 times a month. 

Idk. I always thought I was “strong” or whatever. But over the last few years I’ve started checks by all the boxes. Hyper vigilance, extreme anxiety and depression, persistent and recurring memories, shrinking away from family/friends etc.  

I feel like I’m finally getting past one identity crisis (leaving the military 5 years ago) and replacing it with another. It’s hard because I can’t really talk to anyone about it either. My s/o is made to feel uncomfortable when I bring it up (can’t blame her), I’m quarantining/isolating so I don’t hang out with people, and the friends I game with share the same trauma so I don’t want to ruin the vibe by making them all relive it. 

Shit sucks. It’s not even knowing I’ll struggle with this (PTSD) for some time, it’s knowing that I now have to jive my own self definition with everything else. I know PTSD doesn’t make you weak or anything, I just thought I’d figured out who I was. Now that’s all turned around."
blame it on me i guess,69,m511nr,19,"everyone keeps trying to blame me for my own child abuse like because the longer it went on the worse my emotional reactions to events were and because of that i brought it upon myself. 

why is child abuse such a gray area for people?

i have written so many letters of apology to my abusers and they’re still like yeah but take more responsibility all of it not our faults alone bit.

how could i have had no control and also be at fault?"

CPTSD but with sleep maintenance insomnia. Any meds found helpful during therapy?,3,m4u7cm,4,"Have CPTSD and 2 years ago had full blown PTSD after a stalking incident. Since then my sleep has gone from 6-8 hours of a light sleeper who can get back to sleep to 4-6 hours of waking up hypervigilant. 

I’ve tried CBT-i. Sleep restriction, meditation, stretching. No help. 

What meds helped you for a week, a month, a year so you could process trauma and sleep better causing lower daytime anxiety and vigilance?"
Bipolar 1 and PTSD?,6,m4qml2,6,"I was diagnosed with both at the same time. My therapist recently told me that my psychotic symptoms could be mostly stemming from my PTSD and that the Bipolar could be a misdiagnosis. My dad has very severe forms of the same things. I know that PTSD is often overlooked for other mental illnesses like Bipolar disorder. I have hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions more frequently than I thought would be normal for PTSD (at least once a week with hallucinations appearing almost everyday in some way). I have had a couple of what I thought were bad manic episodes that meet a lot of the criteria. I don't know a lot about PTSD, I guess. I'm on meds for Bipolar that have helped a lot, but now I'm doubting everything. 

Does anyone else have this problem? I feel lost and really alone."
"My abuser got married and looks ""happy""",21,m4pbe6,15,"My abuser (m27) got married to the girl (f27) he was ex's with and was highschool sweethearts with wh I was also once friends with when me and my abuser were together. 

He looked happy ngl I know its wrong to check on their social media but I can't help but want to find out if their lives are getting any worse than mine.

Summary: abuser is my ex of 2 year and a half, ended it last 2017 cuz of an ugly physical fight. He cheated on me, gaslighted me, hit me on the face, guts, head many times with his hands or an umbrella.  Anyway, I'm not perfect. Never said I was, I was destructive and would always do something stupid when he does something wrong i.e. found out he cheated on me and threw money at my face and said he didn't love me anymore (we broke up for a week) so I went and slept with my college crush for kicks. 

Anyway, I've also been dealing with childhood trauma besides this from my parents and I can't solely blame everything to him, I know that. But my abuser and his now wife has kept on bugging me since 2019. First, he created a twitter account to hate on me and in his words he has ""no regrets"" for it. Second, the girl created a fb page with me and his other exs calling us ""bitches"" when all I did was text him ""Just wanted to say hi"" one time (i was in a dark place ngl went thru something physically tormenting and thought he owed me comfort from all the shit he put me through). Then the girl or him idk kept on messaging me with multiple fake accounts calling me a bitch or a whore and texting me stuff like ""I'm glad ""current boyfriend then's name"" broke up with you good for him"" on my fb account. Also why I deleted that fb account. Third, recently they called me and texted me this January 1 to call me a bitch and a whore again. This time I replied cuz I was at the toilet pooping and I just got pissed off. 

Additional info, i know the girls twitter account and she also tweets about being in a toxic relationship and not being able to leave just this January. Thinking about that, wondering how weird it is to marry someone you're toxic with. It baffles me. I know it's hard to get out of a toxic relationship, I was in one too but how idiotic of you to marry them even? 

I forgot to mention when the girl and I were ""close"" I and my ex then told her about abusing me and she even told him ""how low can you go as a human being?"" So she knew about him abusing me. It's just shitty and I'm currently going thru therapy to help me from the flashbacks and depression. Idk maybe I just want attention or maybe I want to clear my heart from the stories he's telling people that I blackmailed him and stuff. I still don't understand why he hates me so much. I wish I could ask him, I really wish I could."
I was involved in a car accident yesterday and I can’t get over the guilt. TW: car accident details.,47,m4o9dg,5,"I don’t know who to talk about this. I feel so stupid. I was just going to work by using my electric bike and I didn’t look right in time. The car was just inches away from me before it hit me from the side, I flew off my bike and broke the windshield. I just remember falling down and feeling grateful that my head ended up falling on top of my backpack instead of the pavement. The fear that cornered me was just way too much. 

The lady that was driving called 911 stating that she didn’t see me and I calmed her down from the floor telling her that it’s okay. I knew it was me. 

I don’t have any bone fractures, just some scratches and bruises all over my body. The hospital released me last night so I could recover safely at home, yet I can’t stop the flashbacks. It’s really too much."
Feeling A Bit Crazy,9,m4maza,4,"I'm not sure if this is normal for ptsd but for some reason I will get a moment in time where I get the memories again but I laugh at some of the things that happened at my ptsd. The problem I have with that is that I know it's awful but some of the things that happened that day was beyond logic so yeah I end up laughing while feeling bad inside. After the laughter I slowly go into depression not just from the PTSD moment but like depressing thoughts of whatever. 

Sometimes it doesn't even stop there sometimes just sometimes the anger follows. But I also get the anger on just plain days too. I'm not getting ""insane"" am I?"
Childhood PTSD (Developmental Trauma Disorder),5,m4ko4m,0,"I’ve noticed a persistent pattern of abusive and unstable relationships in my life. It started by being friends with mostly other traumatized youths in teenage-hood, where there seemed to be a sense of mutual understanding, and compassion - but (of course) accompanied by our collective maladaptive tendencies. Romantic relationships too, the most long term and involved were emotionally abusive. I found myself with 2 frightening and dis-compassionate  partners, and remained in those relationships for years, confused, scared and heartbroken. Real intimacy felt alien. The last emotionally abusive relationship continued for a little over 2 years and ended ~6m before lockdown started. It was at the end of that relationship that I began living in my own apartment for the first time in my life, was completely independent from my family (as I’d completed grad school, started my career and obtained economic independence) and not living with either my family or an abusive partner. 

For the first time in my life, i have a safe space to stop being on autopilot. I didn’t realize this until recently. But 2020 came with its punches and during quarantine someone I had been seeing casually but consistently for months prior, not the abusive partner - but a rebound that I knew from childhood (we went to same school for 10 years), who had also been traumatized as a child, and who I’d casually dated previously in my life, died from an overdose. He had  been best friends with my best friend who had died also from an overdose a few years earlier, when I was in the abusive relationship. Note I’ve never done the drugs these people died abusing, but my childhood friends all did suffer from trauma too, and many have since died or fallen victim to terrible addiction.  This death set me into a deep spiral, I shut down, felt disconnected, experienced physical pain, slight sounds startled me, I couldn’t sleep and I felt completely overwhelmed - crying and sobbing, not always knowing why.  eventually trying to sooth myself in this state caused me to start meditating everyday.

SO, this is the part I’m hoping will be helpful to those with similar experiences, and childhood trauma - which mind you I’m only really starting to come to terms with. As I began meditating every day, consistently (usually after I have my coffee or tea in the morning, but never was hard on myself about it while building the habit), I had an epiphany ~10 days in. I realized that trying to subdue and control the overwhelming emotions just exacerbated them. It was only by sitting with them and letting them have their space within me that I could begin to heal and understand them.

 I read this, which maybe some of you can relate to: 

“traumatized people live with seemingly unbearable sensations: they feel heartbroken and suffer from intolerable sensations in the pit of their stomach or tightness in their chest. Yet avoiding these sensations in our bodies increases our vulnerability to being overwhelmed by them.” - The Body Keeps the Score 

(if you’re ready for some eye opening reading about trauma, pick this book up. But I suggest being in therapy and meditating regularly, and having your safety and independence from abusers secured before doing so.)

Self awareness is the path to beginning to heal. Self awareness begins by activating the medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that noticed what’s going on inside of us and allows us to feel what we’re feeling. Begin by learning how to breathe calmly and remain in a state or relative physical relaxation even while accessing painful and horrifying memories. When you deliberately take a few slow, deep breathes, you will notice the effects of the parasympathetic brake in your arousal. The more you stay focused on your breathing, the more you will benefit, particularly if you pay attention to the very end of the out-breath and then wait a moment before you inhale again. As you continue to breathe and notice air moving in and out of your lungs you may think about the role that oxygen plays in nourishing your body and bathing your tissues with the energy you need to feel alive and engaged. 

Now I see my traumatic responses have followed me throughout life, because of deeply buried childhood trauma. I am successful, smart, passionate, but have trouble in romance and also with self care. Doctors appointments, dentist appointments, showering or cleaning my house (for myself, I will do it to be presentable for others and outwardly am attractive and social) are difficult for me often. It’s hard to make close friends. But I am resilient and I try to help myself. I realized the extent of my avoidance, whilst being unable to avoid with the business of every day life being stripped away during Covid. I realized all the healing I still need to do, and all that I can’t access and don’t consciously remember. Just fragments. 

Pushing on my bedroom door while crying and screaming, trying to prevent my parents from coming in. Being called names like “pimple face” or “little snot faced brat” by my mother. Being pinched by her while she would clench her teeth in anger at me, and being called a bitch when I was only a little girl. I remember being bit and slapped. I remember compulsively masturbating at a very young age and not really knowing what I was doing. I remember as a teenager being bulimic, cutting myself, being diagnosed as borderline by a doctor who saw me only once after a very frightening incident when my mother chased me around the house screaming and accusing me of being a drug addict and drug dealer bc I had taken ambien from her medicine cabinet to help me sleep one night (and had taken 5 or 10 to keep stored away for a rainy day, but when she caught me, I took them all at once out of sheer terror hoping that would prevent me from being caught). I came to hours later, sobbing, with her still raging at me, and having torn up my bedroom from the inside out looking for evidence against me. Mind you I was an honor student on my way to the Ivy League when this happened. But the worst of the memories I know I can’t fully access. Even this all only came back to me recently. They’re mostly things that happened when I was already a teen, but that’s not when the abuse started. That’s just when I started to act out more. 

The thing about childhood trauma, and trauma in general, is that it creates a divided self. The memories of it are disconnected in our minds, but live on every day in our bodies, in our emotional reactions. I am not the bulimic teen who cut herself, those were my coping mechanisms when I was in immediate danger. I feel so disconnected from that self now. 

But “who can find a proper grave for such damaged mosaics of the mind, where they may rest in pieces? Life goes on, but in two temporal directions at once, the future unable to escape the grip of a memory laden with grief.” 

For those with childhood trauma, who have been consistently misdiagnosed and abused again, who have struggled asking themselves if they’re inherently bad, if they’re mentally ill, if they’ll ever feel worthy of love, all while not fully knowing what’s wrong with them - I am sending you a big hug. It’s not your fault. Child abuse is wrong. It is an epidemic in America, and goes unspoken of and untreated. You can heal, consciously, and you can stop spreading the trauma and recreating it. There is science developing to validate your feelings, your faulty, blurry my memories, your extreme visceral responses, and there are people who understand and relate. People who have felt like outcasts their whole lives too, inadequate, and searching for why and how to prove themselves lovable. You can heal."
Responses to triggers,3,m4gv7d,3,"Hi, I'm currently researching aspects of PTSD and was hoping anyone can shed some light on a question.

PTSD from stalking and trauma,6,m4g80i,0,"I really hope you guys in this community can help me as recently I have grown to discover I have PTSD due to being stalked and childhood trauma.

I always though PTSD belonged to Military personnel or victims of Rape/ Abuse.

I had cancer at 11 and was diagnosed 2 days before I would have been suffocated by it. I had Non-hodgkin's Lymphoblastic lymphoma,   which is rare and even more so in females. It grew quick and was in the hospital by April 1st and in ICU the next day.. Haha April Fools day! Obviously I beat cancer and have a family 29 years later but the trauma is still there but barely thanks to counseling. But every year around this time it comes flooding back like it was yesterday. 

On top of that I was stalked for 3 years by my ex and have reoccurring nightmares about him showing up at my house provinces away. I changed my life because of him, if I see  a man who resembles him I melt down and literally either freeze or run the other way.

I wonder I would do if he should show up at my house 19 years later and I think I would fight him, because all of the fear he caused to myself and family.
Now I realize that I am in denial of how much trauma he caused me but feel I don't deserve the term PTSD even though I have nightmares about him, have panic attacks seeing anyone who looks like him and react when I hear anyone who has his similar name. 

Please help! I feel tortured by him and tired if him controlling me.

FYI yes I have posted on Stalkers forum but PTSD isn't really addressed on there.

Thank you all for reading my story."
The Sequel,3,m4e9v9,2,"I self published a comicbook on Amazon. I am a retired Veteran of 20 years. I was diagnosed qith PTSD 4 years ago. I barely finished my 20 years.

It’s been a rough year for us both. He is bipolar. I have MDD, anxiety, and PTSD from CSA and growing up with domestic violence at home. We’re working through it and one of our conversations he said he selfishly wants to be with someone who doesn’t have that trauma. My heart broke instantly. I just want to be happy for the rest of my life. I’ve been miserable enough."
Am I blowing this out of proportion?,1,m4a2er,1,"I try my best to apply stoicism with insomnia as I know I can be quite emotional when I'm tired and feeling vulnerable to flash backs. This is a rant to try and apply some of the emotions but advice would be welcome here too. 

The onset of high emotion was so rapid that I would hurt myself to cope whenever this happened years ago. Not so often anymore and I don't self harm either but it makes the process a lot fucking harder without that go-to. Just feeling like a loose fucking cannon.

I went out for a run today and my phone died. Running without music is like meditation and I hate it. All the thoughts suppressed have a chance to dominate when not drowned out by loud music. I broke down mid way through for a minute because I was just so fucking tired and couldn't think about anything else. Told my mum this when I got home. An hour or so later she says 'I hate to tell you this, but I had a wonderful sleep. It just makes you feel so much better!'
I asked why she was telling me then, and if she understood how it was coming across. She went off in a huff. 
I'm struggling to apply stoicism in this situation. In fact, as an extra vent, without fail, every morning I will be asked 'Well? Did you sleep this time?'. I've had that ice breaker everyday for 3 months. Despite repeatedly requesting not to fucking ask.

I love my mum, our relationship is fine, she is not the  most maternal but she shows love in other ways. It's just on some occasions, like this, that I just don't know how to respond or manage the aftermath within myself. 
If I was to express this to her, I would be said to be being oversensative and then dismissed. I can't really cope with that either so I don't know where to put all this. I'm not sensitive, I have PTSD and insomnia, I don't believe it's the same thing and find myself quite insulted each time my mental health is deemed just me being sensitive."
Thinking about going on disability.,1,m49o04,1,"So as of right now I'm working as a tutor but it's not really lucrative at the moment so I'm looking into getting on disability. I've read that it takes a while to get on it and that the application process is going to be long, with many people getting approved around the 3rd-4th time. Does anyone have any experience with getting on disability? I saw some people saying that getting a disability lawyer makes the process easier? I'm worried that I won't be able to get disability, I feel like I'm not bad enough even though my PTSD makes it really bad to leave the house and actually hold down a job."
"PTSD, Expansion of Consciousness & Other People",7,m48wwr,6,"I'm a bit skeptical to write this as there's a small part of me that wants to be cautious of narcissism and ego defence. Having said that, I think I've thought this over enough and believe the conclusion does hold weight.

When I developed PTSD, I was trying everything possible to figure out what happened to me, why am I suddenly in this vortex of fear and hypervigilence etc etc. This led to me doing extensive research in psychology, therapies, religions, spirituality, ego etc. I've had mystical experiences with psychedelics where I have experienced what I can only describe as ""Cosmic Love"".

These are things that I would estimate 90%+ of people have not done based on my interaction with people. They have not taken the time to figure out their own biases, beliefs, ideology etc. Why they do what they do, like what they like etc. Why? Because it's painful to go in there and start trying to rewire shit. There's almost no point. Whereas when you have PTSD, there's every point. It's life and death. You want so desperately to get out of it that you'll do anything. For example: start shadow work. (Jungian Philosophy)

Anyway... I also remember seeing a TedTalk on YouTube, titled: ""Psychosis or Spiritual Awakening?"". That always stuck with me. I think because, like I said, after developing PTSD, maybe 6 months later, I started doing anything I could to ""fix"" myself. Started meditating, listening to Eckhart Tolle, taking psychedelic trips, studying psychology and spirituality blah blah blah.

So basically what I'm saying is this:

I am of the opinion that trauma CAN, not neccesarily WILL, open one up to extreme growth as a person and identity, due to the desire to resolve the trauma and have a healthy, fulfilled life. This opens one up to new possibilities, new models of reality, and new beliefs to replace the previous regressive ones that may have even helped contribute to the trauma. Hence, growth and evolution occurs in the psyche.
Also, i feel the intense suffering that comes from PTSD opens one up to being more compassionate and loving to others, at least in my own experience. 

Now, I have also noticed on this journey that the majority of people just piss me off. Lol. Like I've said, most haven't done any inner work and I feel most haven't got past the mental age of 16-18. A lot of adult life that I have encountered seems to be like a school playground. This comes in the form of gossip, hierarchical social games, drama, etc.

I'm not sure if I'm communicating this correctly but I guess what I'm almost trying to say is: it's a bit like stepping out of The Matrix. Everyone else is running around creating enemies, and warring with each other. The trauma sufferer sees this as futile and wants peace and love and goes on a journey of resolution and healing becoming a better and more complete person in the process.

There's something that opens up in the midst of intense suffering (like PTSD) which I have termed here: Expansion of Consciousness.

Now, interacting with most other people just feels like a chore. It feels a lot of them do things like gaslighting, hierarchical social games, gossip etc etc. It's just exhausting.

Nightmares,2,m45n34,2,"Hello I would just like a bit of advice as I’m very new to these symptoms. What I’m about to type may be triggering.



I’m not going into much detail but I was sexually assaulted when I was around 4 and basically only found out 2 years ago. Recently I’ve felt very out of it and started waking up screaming thinking something is trying to get me. This time I was at my boyfriend’s house and it was very embarrassing. I actually hurt him during this episode, not too bad thankfully, it was just some kicks. However, I’m frightened it may get worse and I may actually hurt someone. I was looking up night terrors and they involve you forgetting but I am so petrified I can’t sleep. I believed the thing is still coming for me and in my dream it looked so real, I was having panic attack afterwards for about 15 minutes so that makes me believe it wasn’t a night terror. 

I’m not sure where these dreams have come from I have had 2 in the past 2 months (these two weren’t as bad. I was running away in my house and my mum came to help me and that was very effective, I wasn’t scared afterwards ) and I’m not sure if it’s the incident that is causing them as it’s been bothering me more. Things such as being scared to have sex or seeing myself naked when in a bad mental state. I’ve been very dissociated too. I’m really confused about the way I feel and I really want it all to stop because I can’t deal with how frightening the dreams are. Has anyone here experienced anything similar?"
Detaching from bf due to trauma. Pls help me.,10,m44lhh,1,"TW for SA/r’pe mention, s’x mention, SA trigger detail


Something my wonderful bf did triggered me so hard and now I don’t feel anything towards him the past couple weeks and I’m currently mid anxiety attack sobbing at 3am over how distraught I am. I can’t see my therapist for another 2 weeks (it’s already been 2 or 3) and I don’t know what to do, I’m desperate.




Backstory: I’ve been in weekly therapy for going on 5 years now after the lowest point in my life after I was SA’d by my old bestfriend of 10 years repeatedly. Diagnosed MDD + PTSD, layers of complex childhood and adulthood trauma. Sadly got into a relationship with an abuser June 2019 after he had groomed me for months and developed “essentially Stockholm’s” - repeated assaults and r’pes (mostly intimidation and nothing actually physically harmful I would say) had nothing on the level of daily psychological abuse he put me through. Abuser moved in Nov 2019 after convincing me to not press charges, cheated constantly while I was punished daily, treated like a slave and atm with intermittent positive reinforcement. I ended it July 2020, kicked him out in September 2020 because I was so scared of him and how he would react when I was no longer of use to him. I never wanted to be in the relationship to begin with, convinced myself it was okay and he was working on being a better man and could only survive a day at a time, and was relieved to finally end it.

I started talking to current bf in August 2020 casually, we had mutual friends. We took things slow. He’s been a great friend and never once did I feel I was using him to distract myself, I was doing my healing in therapy and we just got closer and closer over time. He’s younger with less relationship experience, and so there’s been minor insensitive things he’s done, but we work through them amazingly. Hes the only person who I have felt genuinely..tries. We communicate great, every hiccup there’s been we have one calm conversation about it and then he puts all his effort into changing something, even if it’s little and I don’t make a big deal about it, to fix the issue and it doesn’t come up again. I do what I can to accommodate him, meet him half way, compromise, support him in his life journey, and all in all be a partner, and he does the same in return. Don’t get me wrong he’s not perfect, and neither am I. He has his character flaws and things we don’t see eye to eye on, but he’s a good person, and I’ve got a lot of baggage and issues. I’ve never been so attracted to someone in my life, I was starting to see what real safety and security and happiness is supposed to feel like for the first time in my life and I can’t thank him enough for that. I was starting to feel those “in love” feelings about 5/6 months in, (I say this as someone who’s very conservative with love, who quadrupple checks that I really mean it for months before I say it because people often mistake infatuation or passion for love or being in love) thinking yeah, this is something I want for a long time. We’re with eachother all the time now and just genuinely adore doing everything together.

The Triggering Event: We went on a little getaway for Valentine’s Day. I shit you not this man makes me cry with how good he is to me, we had some amazingly passionate intimate obviously-we’re-falling-for-eachother sex the night before vday. Vday comes, he tells me he’s in love with me, and I let him know I’m getting to the point of loving him just not ready to say it yet, and we decide to make it official between us. Problem is...that night I was tired, my lingerie was being annoying and by the time it was working for me I was no longer feeling sexy yknow? But I was like hey give me some warm up time, and I’ll come back around. He proceeds to do something he knows I don’t really like, but he does..and it went on for just a minute, two tops. I slowly just stopped being into what we were doing and was silent, looking back I know this is what triggered me: (((I was reminded of previous times with people where they did stuff to me while I laid there silent in defeated “freeze” mode and didn’t want it. They didn’t care, didnt listen to my no or my disinterest, and did so until completion.))) he enjoyed this act enough to where he had to stop himself from finishing during the foreplay. After the 1-2 mins, where maybe 30 seconds I was completely silent, my bf goes “you don’t seem into this/you’re not enjoying this, let’s do something else.” The correct thing to do, obviously!! We pretty much just jumped right into sex since I’m sure he was sufficiently worked up, and looking back I realize I probably should have stopped altogether because I was turned off almost completely. I pretty much just wanted him to finish and for it to be done and over with, so I feel like I did this to myself for wanting to people please instead of being true to my feelings.

Ever since then I have been so detached from him. I was having these extreme moments of depersonalization, and this feeling of ‘otherness’ from him that I’ve never felt with anyone before. I feel so far away from him. I didn’t realize what was going on until last week when I suddenly remembered this event, I had sort of repressed it. I was feeling empty, numb, depressed with a lack of motivation for self care, having nightmares about my ex abuser. I have secluded myself from my friends because I don’t feel anything - I don’t care to be friends with anyone right now. I don’t f e e l. It also means I don’t feel anything towards my bf right now.. I don’t get giddy, I don’t get butterflies, I’m sex repulsed, I don’t feel happy but I don’t feel sad. I’m just empty. I KNOW it’s because I’m in “flight” and “freeze” mode - I KNOW it’s because I was triggered and I now feel unsafe in general and so being vulnerable or close to anyone is automatically being avoided. I cannot stop it. I know these things and usually when I’m aware of them I can process and move through it. But I can’t. And my therapist (who I haven’t seen since before vday because her sudden busy schedule) just canceled next weeks appointment. I’ve been holding out a couple weeks for our next app and now it’s even farther out. I feel like I’m going to lose it.

The emptiness I feel towards this amazing, adorable man is hurting me so bad. Tonight I got insecure he was lying to me about something my ex abuser would lie about, which I know means my Trauma Brain is feeling like it’s happening All Over Again even though logically I know it’s not and that this is not my ex and he simply made a mistake. I feel like my ex abuser is ruining my current relationship without even being here, and it makes me feel ruined and tainted by the abuse all over again and it makes the su!cidal ideation increase.

Literally a day before I realized what was going on with me, we had discussed him moving some of his stuff in since he’s here so often (he’s house hunting but the market sucks), then circumstances made it so he would have to basically move in completely until he finds a house, and he wants to do it ASAP now. I want to but I cant, I cannot do this. Not right now. I feel like I’m back in survival mode and I can’t see into tomorrow let alone the next few months or god forbid a year from now. My shitty Trauma Brain will convince me I do not want friends or relationships and it’s so hard to fight it. It’s trying to convince me I feel nothing for him (I still have moments where I’m like aww I have a crush on him) and that he’s not what I want. He is though. And it feels like this Trauma reaction is something that’s not me at all, not my real thoughts or feelings, and it’s consuming me and making me think that somehow it’s right.

I don’t want to end things with him. I want to feel that spark again. I want to stop feeling so triggered and go back to feeling happy and safe. I don’t feel like I can talk to my friends right now because I’m so emotionally detached from everything.

I don’t know what to do and I’m falling apart."
Trying to understand what happened to me,4,m43uh7,0,"So this might be confusing so I apologize in advance I’ve just never told anybody about this as it’s quite personal. I have a lot of trauma surrounding how person and whereas this wasn’t the worst that occurred it’s the only part of it I can’t talk about fully, I never bring up. I try to avoid.

Before this specific thing started I had gone through something very traumatic so my partner suggested ‘age regression’ to me and to try it, I wasn’t too fond of it but he kept assuring me that it would work. He’d make me do this almost daily but it got worse and worse as the days went on. 

He stopped treating me like I was one person and started acting like I was two, giving negative connotations to the version of me which wasn’t regressed. He’d call the non regressed version “Mean (my name)” and then the regressed version “Baby (my name)” and over time he’d buy items that toddlers would use and force me to use them. I expressed my discomfort but he assured me I was just embarrassed and that this was helping me.

Overtime he started forcing me to talk about the regressed version of me as if it was a completely different person, separating the two. He’d also sexualize that version and any time we participated in anything of those sorts he’d say he preferred the regressed version and force me to do that. 

One night I broke down and cried to him that I hated it, I couldn’t do it anymore, it wasn’t helping and it was only making things worse and in response he got pissed off and ignored me. Then I said I didn’t want to participate in anything sexual with him because of how much it was interfering with our relationship, my mental health and my final year of high school. The next day he came to me saying he was very insecure, especially with the timing because he had opened up a lot more sexually to me and that he loved spending time with me and how sex was a necessity and we needed it to bond. That same day I did my finals and ended up throwing up multiple times because of the amount of anxiety I had from him blatantly ignoring me for trying to get out of this. 

After that I continued on, but the things he’d do or made me do got worse. Make me use ‘pull ups’ or suck on dummies, wouldn’t let me have actual glasses but sippy cups. I expressed my discomfort multiple times but it would always lead to him getting upset and me feeling awful again so I carried on. He set rules for me, had me have a ‘bed time’ and would even ask the non regressed me if I he could go on play dates with the regressed version. Completely treating it like I was two different people. 

Late in December of that year I had an infertility scare and I was terrified because I always wanted t have children, luckily it wasn’t infertility at the time but now compared to them the thought of having or being around babies horrifies me. I freak out anytime I see anything like that or if people try to baby me or talk about age regression. Being around anything in relation makes me nauseous. 

I don’t know if it was the being forced into being two people, the discomfort of the sexualization or what but when I talk about this trauma any other part with it I’m fine with talking about to a degree, it doesn’t bother me when it comes up. Sure context matters and how it’s brought up can impact me heavily but even mere mentions of this or even anything to do with toddlers sends me into full panic. It was quite hard writing all of this out. I just want to understand what happened to me, and why this affects me so much more than other things like sexual/physical violence."

DAE have flashbacks that accumulate from being triggered over the course of several days?,4,m433uz,2,"Woke up today having a flashback. I couldn’t figure out why the hell my brain decided to open the floodgates while I was asleep but then I remembered I actually have done a couple triggering things over the past 3 days. I stopped in my hometown for food the other day and was anxious and uncomfortable but I got the food and left and was okay. Then I visited my aunt and she started venting about our family and stuff she went through as a kid and I vented to her about things me and my brother went through, she said a word that triggered me and I told her that it did but she said it a few more times (don’t think she was being malicious, just doesn’t understand ptsd) 

Then last night I turned on a TV show I used to watch as a kid and only watched one episode. Again, felt anxious but relatively alright. 

During all of those I just felt really uncomfortable and like I wanted to get out of the situation, but didn’t have full blown flashbacks and felt relatively alright. Then today I wake up in one. 

Anyone else have this happen?"

On the 10th of March 2018, my ex raped me for the first time. There were times before that, when I didnt actually want to, but was too afraid to deny sex. There were times after that when he raped me again, but by then I was able to dissociate. But that day, I was screaming, crying and kicking him. I was begging him to stop, and he didn't care. I thought he was going to kill me because he was hurting me so much.
Before the incident, I was an open book. I had no trouble sharing my troubles with my friends and my parents. But this was something I couldn't tell anyone, it ate me up inside. I knew what he did was wrong, but I was too afraid to leave him. He always told me nobody would ever love me as much as he loved me, and I believed him. I blamed myself, I told him that I wanted sex that night. But he did something I didnt like, I told him and he just kept going. 

I've come a long way in those 3 years. I've had a lot of EMDR, I've been through so much trauma therapy. I have gotten addicted to marijuana, but am also in recovery for that now and am almost 6 months sober. I've been through hell but I'm in an okay place mentally. I'm still mentally hurting, I still need a lot of therapy, but I'm no longer suicidal. I am no longer surviving, I am living. 

But 10th of March is always an awful day. Even though most days I barely think about him, 10th of March just hurts me. I can feel the scarf he was choking me with around my throat, I start remembering things I had forgotten about, I'm scared he somehow knows where I am and is going to do it again. It reminds me of other people who have traumatised me later in life, even though those people had nothing to do with that incident. 10th of March makes me feel like the girl who I was the first few years after it happened. An addicted girl, who had lost all sense of self, was cutting herself to punish herself for just existing, the girl who would stand near the train tracks every night and hoping one day she would have the guts to jump. 

Now its the 13th of March, I survived yet another 10th of March. But I'm still hurting from Wednesday. It might take a few weeks to go back to 'normal', but I will get there. And next year, I will survive another 10th of March"
Is emotional numbness one of the symptoms of ptsd?,6,m3yzv9,6,I feel like I can not feel anything I have no emotions it sucks I hate it. I know I love my mom and my family but I can’t feel anything. I have been diagnosed with ptsd. And am scared that I’m turning into a psychopath of something. I don’t want to be like this. Please tell me it’ll get better
I realized how disconnected I am.,98,m3ycxh,18,"Someone came over today that I used to be close with... But having them over made me realize how disconnected I am from people. How poorly I tried to keep communicating with them... I realized how disconnected I am from people like my partner and even my own child... That I feel nothing at all for them.
 I realized that when you spend every day trying to go day by day... That when you spend so long just trying to survive that you lose touch of things that are key parts of normal society. Things like just talking with friends become so distant in your mind when you have to focus all of your energy on trying to seem normal to everyone else when in reality you are far from."
My hatred and psychopathy toward dogs all started because of a traumatic experience,0,m3vjwi,3,"Before I get started, I'd like to warn everybody that this post may contain anti-dog actions. If you like dogs, that's fine. But please no derailing or victim blaming. Thank you.

A while ago, I posted a rant on why I hate dogs, and it didn't turn out very well. A couple of guys were saying horrible shit about me. But you know what? Fuck those ignorant bitches! They honestly don't give a shit about what I go through, so they can suck my dick!

Anyways, for those of you who didn't know already, I fucking HATE dogs! Now you may be asking ""why the fuck do you hate dogs for?"". Here's how it all began. I was three or four when I first discovered my hatred for dogs. My car door was open and I was just about to get out, when all of a sudden, a big-ass mutt came storming into my side and bit my hand really hard with its mouth! I screamed and cried while my parents took me home. For years, I've been terrified by these fucking things! I begged my parents to carry me to keep me safe whenever I went to my grandmother's house. I would have nightmares of them chasing after me with their hungry eyes. I would tell anyone about how horrified I am of dogs, but no one gave a shit about it! They just brush it off like I'm crazy. And yet they fucking push me to get near them! Would I ever pressure anyone to go on a ferris wheel ride with me even if they're afraid of heights? Fuck no! It's bad enough that I have allergies at home without any pets around, but for fuck's sake I will scream my lungs out if I see any mudprints, hair, or even droppings on my property, furniture, floor, whatever!

If I'm crazy enough to shoot every fucking mongrel I lay my eyes on, then I guess I am! If I'm a psychopath to actually wish every single one of these fucking mutts to die of cancer, then hell yes I am! What I'm trying to say is those of you who want to tell me how fucked up I am denies not only my past traumatic experience, but also everyone else's. The main reason for my fucked up thinking process is how I became fucked up in the first place. My past trauma (including being physically, verbally, and emotionally abused by my parents) is the main reason for my psychopathic behavior. And I will be honest, I can be persuaded all I like to start getting involved with these mutts, but I'm an all-or-nothing type of person. I could internally shut down as they start sinking their teeth into my flesh."
Am I traumatized?,2,m3tmll,2,"I don’t really like to be the person who diagnoses them self. But I am planning to seek professional help.

So last night I took an edible and when I do I usually watch funny shows, play games, or listen to music. But last night once the thc hit me I had a flashback when looking at myself in the mirror. I think it lasted like 20 minutes of me looking in the mirror and thinking about the time my parents use to fight a lot. 

My parents use to fight all the time and it would be a regular thing like I would be so excited to go to school because I knew i wouldn’t hear them fight, I would be so happy to sleep over at my cousins because I wouldn’t hear them fight. 

But my flashback was back to a time when the fight was more intense than usual: me and my little brother were playing in my parents room and then we heard my parents shouting and then my mom came into the room and told us to pack clothes. I remember trying to get my shoes on but my dad didn’t want us to leave and kept saying he was sorry but my mom wanted to leave. As we were pulling out of the driveway my dad ran out and kept calling us a “bullshit family” I think the whole time my siblings were scared of my dad but the whole time I just wanted to run out and hug him. 

Then I started remembering multiple times when they fought and since that flashback I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I can’t stop crying. I’ve been told that the family should talk to each other about this. But my parents are old and I’m afraid if I bring anything up it’ll spark arguments again and maybe give one of them a heart attack or stroke. As my dad had a minor stroke a few years ago. 

I’ve never really talked about this because when I was in kindergarten I talked about how my parents fought with my teacher and she called my mom then my mom didn’t want anyone to know what was going on so she got mad at me. Since then I’ve been scared to talk about the times they fought and looking back I am seeing the impact it left on the family. 

Lately I’ve just thought about trying to heal myself and somewhat try to bring the family close again. Because I remember the time when my parents never fought and it was before the time my dads mom died. I remember we were once a happy family"
Today I had mediaton with one of my abusers.,121,m3p6nx,22,"We never had a relationship just FWB who ended up with a child,I did not see the red flags before I got pregnant. 

For 2 years he has been verbally abusing me, gaslighting me and treathening me.
We have had meetings on meetings than never helped.
And today was the day I feared the most,mediation. 

And I went through with it, I owned it.
I was scared shitless,I could not eat,my anxiety was at an all time high but I did it.
And im proud of myself, because for once I did not just sit there nodding my head saying yes to things I disagreed on.
No, I went in there full force looked him deep into his eyes and I said 

""I dont trust you,I dont respect you and I dislike you, but still im sitting here today trying to come to an agreement for our son.
It.felt.so.good.
It felt so damn good to finally being brave enough to tell him that. And when he gave me a letter from his lawyer where he treathened me that if I dont share custody he will take me to court.

I was even braver, again I looked him into his eyes and said no, he replied ""well ill take you to court"" and what I said its insane for me to even write ""Well then bring it on"". 

I am so proud of myself, I dont care that I have not been able to eat all day or that I feel like a truck has run over me. Im so damn tired I cant think straight, but none of that matters because I
I faced my abuser,I raised my voice,I stood my ground.

EDIT:

Thank you all for your lovely comments and thank you for the rewards♡ its the next day and im still dead tired but I feel good, in the middle of all of this I forgot the person who supervise the visitations had to work a late shift and it was visitation day, so guess who had to open the door and si hi to him. And I did that too with flying colors!"
Devastated.,3,m3ox6k,3,"I've posted here once before as I was struggling with the anniversary of my partner before last who died next to me. 

Today I was on tik-tok and stumbled across a man who looked so much like him, his eyes, his mannerisms, I was so unprepared and am so devastated, and I felt like I was having a heart attack?? From shock??
It's been almost 5 years since he died and I do okay mostly but today I do not feel okay. I feel as if I am experiencing day 1, and seeing this man so freakishly similar to my person has left me breathless. I went home and cried on my husband during my lunch break and I'm just trying to make it through the day. 
I hope I never ever see this person with my own 2 eyes, I don't think I could recover. It was both the worst and best thing I have ever experienced."
"Dealing with anger? How do you forgive, or at least stop caring about what they did?",11,m3n21w,5,"So, I had pretty successful treatment for PTSD some time ago (EMDR plus some talk therapy) and a lot of my symptoms are under control.

Unfortunately for me I am still full of rage. 

My trauma was such that I didn't find out who was responsible for it for years. By the time I knew, they were out of my life. I'm angry that I never got to confront them, that I was nice to them when I didn't know how they'd hurt me and others, and that they haven't faced any consequences, and that they've probably gone on to hurt other people in similar ways.

I think about them often and I hope horrible things happen to them. And I guess this is understandable, but I know it isn't good for my health, and it's a pall on my otherwise-improved mental well-being. God knows what it's doing to me physically.

I want to move towards a place of forgiveness, or at least to a place of indifference to them as people, to truly gain some peace after all this. Before PTSD I never really used to hold grudges, but a lot of the attitudes I had before that helped me not be angry at people just don't seem to work if I apply them here. A lot of the advice about anger online seems to be about not lashing out at people (which I never have) and a lot of the forgiveness content is non-instructional or religious, which doesn't help me much.

If anyone's got strategies that help with this, I'd be really grateful."
Does anyone else keep a mostly clean house but have a messy nightmare of a bedroom?,8,m3mpow,3,
Has anyone here read A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara?,2,m3khrj,1,"I’m torn on how i feel about this book in relation to my own trauma. It is at times an excruciating read, I’ve never read a book that literally punched me in the face with emotion every 15 pages, and like a masochist I’d sit there and read it alternating between crying because something was so small and so touching or so tragic and heartbreaking. It’s been 5 years and I still think about this book at least a few times every week.

It’s, at its core, a story about trauma and friendship but centers around one character who has had one of the most difficult lives imaginable, like even to just touch on the basics would require every trigger warning there is. At some points it almost feels like tragedy porn, but it balances that with these extremely tender and heartfelt moments and reflections on friendship. 

In a way I felt like the book traumatized me, but on the other it feels so important that I read it. I’m just wondering if any other trauma survivors who’ve read it have had a similar reaction, or just what your thoughts were in general."
I’m not sure if it actually happened or if it was a dream,2,m3jfd3,4,"Tw: rape..?, online predators

I have a ‘memory’ of when I was around 5 years old and had a sexual intercourse with someone. I used to think it was a dream but it keeps coming back to me and making me feel so uneasy. It being a dream makes no sense. I was 5, why would I dream of that?

All I really remember is this old looking wooden outdoor wc or a small cabin or something similar (I’m not sure) and the grass surrounding it. I don’t remember seeing much from when it actually happened, I think my eyes were covered.
It’s so frustrating that I cannot remember what exactly happened and figure it out. I just want to know what happened 

The reason why I think it’s real is because sometimes I get really touch repulsive and self destructive out of nowhere and I never knew the reason. Sometimes talking or mentioning anything sexual will give me a full blown mental breakdown.

The worst thing is that it’s not the only thing that’s happened. I met a pedophile online around the same age, maybe a year later, and have had a bunch of other disturbing occurrences on the internet since my parents didn’t really monitor anything.

Idk, I wish this was easier to deal with"
ADHD and PTSD,7,m3ey1n,6," I've struggled with anxiety my whole life and was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and my psychiatric nurse also mentioned I have symptoms of PTSD. I'm trying to figure out if some of the mood related issues I'm dealing with are related to my ADHD OR are things that can happen with PTSD, and appreciate any insight. 

So basically I have moments or days when something triggers an intense mood reaction in me, and I feel these intense negative feelings ( hard to describe but sometimes they are like dread or just an intense negative feeling) accompanied by physical sensations in my chest or throat, or sometimes in the back of my neck. The issue that caused my PTSD was that my child was abducted by her Dad when he began cheating on me, and for a YEAR, I basically had no certainty that my daughter was OK ( her Dad wouldn't let me talk to her and wouldn't tell me where they were and I had no money to go travel internationally to find them) and so was emotionally tortured and lived in fear everyday. On top of that, I had immense, immense Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria from my husband cheating and essentially throwing me away like I was trash. I now have sole custody and my daughter is doing well, but I'm still an emotional wreck and I'm trying to figure out what to do about it, and if the mood stuff I'm dealing with is related to the PTSD or ADHD/Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria. 

My psychiatric nurse is out of my network so I haven't been able to go back to her, and I had a very bad reaction to the initial round of medication we tried for my ADHD ( low dose Adderal) and I'm hoping when I go back to her, I can better articulate what I'm feeling so she can help me find what will work. 

Anyhow, I appreciate any insight!"
Is doubting own trauma common? TW: Abuse,105,m3ejl4,26,"I need advice from objective people (tldr at bottom). 

Years ago I (M) said no to someone (F) who wanted to have sex with me. She asked and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She asked again and I said I didn't want to. We were sitting down at the time. She got on top of me and I froze as she had sex with me. I didn't push her off. She tried to kiss me and I tried to turn away but was unable to. The whole thing was very brief. I didnt think too much about it for years after (i had the mindset of 'I am male so it isn't the same' ) and I have been on good terms with her since. 

I went for therapy a couple years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist at the time focused a lot on why she acted she did at the time and in the years I've known this person I've learned she was sexually assaulted by guys before I knew her. Likewise I was sexually assaulted by an older boy when i was very young. I gradually began to understand why she acted the way she did and also why I froze (i was beaten up a lot as a kid too and i would always freeze then as well). To that end I hold no anger towards her, as she was a product of her suffering. It helped me move on for a time. She's changed. I've changed. We've grown and now we are supportive of each other. I have forgiven my other attackers as well as part of my own journey. 

The problem I have is that sometimes I doubt the whole thing and now I blame myself. Its like 'i hold no anger, i understand why she was like that' but now I question whether I was raped at all. 

**Tl:DR: **  I guess I'm just looking for a more objective outsider opinion: Given that I said I didnt want sex twice and then didnt fight back, I was still raped, right? Being on good terms now and understanding why that happened doesnt invalidate my experience does it? Is my self doubt just a part of the PTSD?

Advice appreciated."
I don’t know why I feel like this,6,m3dk3t,0,"Hi everyone (or anyone) that’s reading. I have only started looking into these strange feelings and behaviours in myself recently, and just really want to reach out to share my problems (and maybe find people in a similar situation).

So, I’ve got two weird behavioural things that I have experienced since childhood (I have no memory of any abuse as a child). I’m currently in a great place in my life but still experience these regularly.

Firstly, I get this terrible, whole body disgust. It lasts for only about a minute and occurs every couple of months. The best way I can describe it is a completely unprovoked wave of deep shame and disgust about myself. I feel embarrassed and dirty, and just want to cover myself up. It’s an overwhelming feeling in my chest, arms and stomach. I feel so disgusting and dirty that I just want to hide away from everyone and even myself. This does eventually pass, and then I’m back to feeling completely normal.

Secondly, I have this unavoidable need and requirement to cover myself in super unflattering clothes around my family, more specifically, male members of my family like my dad. The thought of showing certain areas of skin (which I am completely comfortable to display around my partner and friends) makes me incredibly uncomfortable when around these male figures. On top of this, any positive remarks about my looks from these family members, makes me feel icky and gross. I actively try to look as ugly as possible when around such people.

So, as I said, I have no recollection of abuse in my childhood. But these feelings are so intense and relentless that it completely baffles me. I would really appreciate anyone’s thoughts, and would love to hear anyone else’s experiences.

Thank you for reading."
mother with ptsd. need some sort of advice or support,3,m3c714,2,"hi there,

i didn't know if i should mark this as vent or advice because it is a combination of both.

my mom keeps having ptsd episodes in the evening which usually gets both my parents arguing until she is exhausted and falls asleep. the reason i consider them episodes is she tends to talk about her insecurities and parents (which they have passed away and she does say her dad gave her ptsd), but also talks (ends up shouting) in circles about subjects that have upset her and sometimes she is antagonistic (will touch you if you don't want her to, too.) her shouting is really agitating so its REALLY hard for me to just be like ""hey everything is going to be alright."" it seems like she doesn't really remember what happens the next day but she also does... but this has been going on for at least two years and when i confront my parents about it, they keep making excuses for having arguments so loud in the house that everyone can hear instead of just talking things out. my mom has told me her therapist said she can express her feelings however she wants...

i understand that PTSD is complicated but there needs to be help because it is wearing down everyone. in addition to the PTSD there is addiction with alcohol and my mom has taken xanax for anxiety so i know that doesn't help her memory. recently my dad told me that if i keep mentioning all the bad things they do during arguments, then they have no reason to change or to try to get better. so that helps sort of but my emotional needs are being put second because of the past.

i need some sort of advice. this post is only a slice of the pie of what happens. i know that it is on my parents ultimately to get help because they want it but it is so hard watching this keep happening. i know my parents have had painful pasts, but they giving me and my siblings a very difficult present and they act like our home life isn't stressful or frustrating to us."

Ptsd from tripping on edibles I guess,1,m3a1vh,2,"

I tripped 3 months ago and had constant dissociation for 2 months which was just internal chaos and panic for the duration, my triggers seem to be dissociation, infinity, tripping and the matrix and other strange thoughts can cause it but they seem to be indescribable and tbf anything can really cause what I think is a flashback because things seem to just cause it randomly. Now I dont know if I really truly have ptsd but whenever I see these things I get sent into immediate panic and like im gonna or am falling down the rabbit hole again and that makes me freak out or well i guess im freaking out because the dissociating makes that invisible really i never really get passed the point of rolling about my bed and groaning because of how uncomfortable I am but inside I feel as if im getting sucked out the arse of reality. I don't seem to have 1 singular intrusive thought but a large collection ever expanding weird thoughts ethier like the weirdness of existence and consciousness, it causes me to dissociate hard and feel like im tripping again I don't know what this is but from what ive heard it sounds like ptsd I talk to my therapist about it but I won't be able to see a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis for a few months my question is what do you think? Is this ptsd or im I experiencing something else? I have asd and I had a panic disorder before all this mess so maybe I just exacerbated it? who the fuck knows at this point"
Does every past setback have a lesson to learn?,0,m3a0kz,2,"I did badly for my GCE A level exams and couldn’t enter any local university. I feel guilty that my parents had to fork out a lot of money to enrol me into a private University instead.

I keep thinking back at all the events that might have caused this misfortune. I know I worked hard and knew how to study. All I can think of is the lack of time. If only I had left my suicidal and clingy boyfriend earlier, I could have opened up more time to study. But thinking back at it again, I did try to initiate a break up a few times but he would physically restrain me and talk me out of it. I kept pondering many other ways I could have solved this problem but they all felt too risky or pointless. It’s been a year since I received my A level results and I still don’t know what to learn from it."
Need some help: how to tell someone to stop triggering my ed.,2,m39v48,2,"So, long story short, I have an eating disorder tied to my ptsd thanks to my mom and her repeated and frequent comments on my weight. I used to starve myself for days on end, feel like I was going to throw up midmeal, not be able to eat in public bc it felt like people were judging me, ect.   Recently, and with thanks to my fiance, I've been managing to eat better and more than I have in years prior. The issue though is, we are currently staying with his mom due to life reasons and she, while she has good intentions, does tend to trigger my ed. She'll get on us for what we eat if she doesn't consider it healthy enough, told me a couple times that I won't stay skinny ( I'm also currently still recovering from being dangerously underweight ) if I keep eating the food I am, ect. And that tends to send me into a downward spiral of wanting to starve myself again, of only seeing my fat every time I see myself in the mirror... That kind of thing. And I'm just wondering how to POLITELY let her know that she's tripping me up. I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest ( though I do try ), but at least I'm eating something, which is better than before, right?     Thanks for any advice in advance."
Does anyone ever really get over sexual assault?,2,m36598,3,"Trigger warning SA. 

I (20F) broke up with my LDR boyfriend of 3 years maybe 6-7 months ago because it just won't work out with our families. We are on really good terms and are still the closest and best of friends. I was also sexually assaulted when I was 15, only something I recognized and came into terms with around 4 months ago. During the relationship, my ex boyfriend had told me that I was sexually assaulted, but I never believed him because I felt like I was exaggerating the whole thing or that maybe he said it because he was protective. 

We used to have sex during the relationship and it was great, but ever since I realized I was sexually assaulted, I no longer have any desire to have sex (with anyone) one bit. It's almost as though, all of my desire has totally vanished. Even the slightest thought of any physical touch makes me feel anxious and worried. 

I must admit that I still love with my ex, but I know in my heart it won't work out, although I still love him very much (and he loves me too). There's this guy I recently became friends with and I felt like he may have feelings for me and he does have a background that would work out with my family. Although I don't even know if he likes me, I just still feel anxious or scared about even speaking to men again. I don't even know if I have feelings for him. Obviously not everyone out there is a pedophile or rapist, but I feel this sense of anxiety speaking to men (who I'm not good friends with) in general, especially in situations where there may be the chance of being more than friends. 

I genuinely have no idea how I'm going to get into a relationship again because the entire thing just makes me anxious - and whenever I feel this way, I like to disappear. I'm probably not going to text the guy for a few days bc I feel my anxiety shooting up again. 

My question is: those of you who were sexually assaulted, how did you ever get into relationships again and feel comfortable with physical intimacy?"
I need help supporting a friend…,5,m35a9u,1,"TW: RAPE

Recently I’ve had a friend who has wanted to have sex. We have traded numerous times but feels extreme guilt when he finishes. We were also supposed to hook up numerous times, but he would always back out at the last minute. So I could tell something wasn’t right. 

So I started to ask him some questions, I prefaced the question by saying that I won’t judge you and just be honest ok? I then went on to ask him if he was sexually assaulted. He told me he was, when he was younger by an older male friend. When I asked him if he wanted to talk to me about it he said no. I immediately changed the subject. 

I briefly touched on the topic of internalized homophobia and I can completely help him with that as I was once struggled with it. I told him that when he’s ready to talk about it I’m here for him. I also told him I wanted to give him some space and time to process some of these thoughts.

I fear as if he may have PTSD, while I’m familiar with the syndrome. I’m not familiar with it being caused by an assault. I’m asking for help because I know he has a shitty family life, and doesn’t really have anyone there for him. I’m asking for advice on this so when he’s ready to talk. I know what to say.

I don’t remember my childhood :(,73,m338hu,19,"trigger warning: violence
hello! recently I’ve been very sad on how I don’t remember my childhood. so, I’m kinda still in my childhood, I’m only 15! but, I’ve dealt with generalized anxiety disorder and ocd since I was 7, and trauma since I was 11. my dad is sometimes very violent, and he  does bad things (especially towards my mom). I don’t want to go into details but just know, it isn’t good. throughout my early years (8-12) it was only violence and arguing. I have nightmares and anger/emotional outbursts throughout the day that are hard to deal with (all related to my parents). my therapist says I have “complex trauma” and I cannot remember ages 8-11 at all. its very sad. i feel like I didn’t even have a childhood! I only remember the fights and stuff, but everything else is a blur. is this related to trauma or is it something else? I have struggles with dissociating in grade 5 and 6 so I don’t know if that’s related. how can I get my good memories back? what has worked for any of you guys? please help! I am very sad and I feel like my childhood was wasted :("

ptsd makes yet another appearance,1,m31yhm,7,ptsd is wild tonight with all the conversation around sexual assault in the uk. its so scary that although everyone is talking - no change is being made. will life ever get better ? just constant fear of worrying when the next attack will happen. where is the justice for victims.
Misdiagnosed as OCD when it was really PTSD,1,m301rj,1,"So I had a traumatic event happen to me almost 2 years ago. Someone broke into my apartment.  It really shook me, and it caused me to have all of these side-effects happen. I couldn't sleep because I was terrified something would happen again, and also because I would have nightmares about what happened. I continually would check all of my locks, windows, leave lights on to look like I was awake, etc. I couldn't even do normal things like shower or cook without having to be on full alert about everything going on in my apartment.

It really disturbed my life, and I was in school at the time, so I was falling behind so much as I wasn't sleeping/couldn't concentrate. I decided I really needed to go to a therapist because I was ashamed and embarrassed to talk to anyone I knew about this. The therapist was great. We did CBT, and she diagnosed me as having OCD because I would ""check"" my locks and windows a lot. The CBT really did help, and I had to stop seeing her because my insurance changed and unfortunately I could no longer afford out of pocket prices. But I felt so much better after months of working through what happened.

A few months later, I went to another therapist. She was AWFUL. I told her how I was diagnosed with OCD, and she said there was no way I had OCD. She kept on asking me about what happened with the event, and she almost mocked me for being so scared. She told me people with OCD counted their steps etc while I was just scared of something. This really hurt me. Knowing I had support from the other therapist and doing CBT helped me to kind of realize what happened and to work through it, and stop having these awful thoughts. Going to her kind of put me into this hole again in a way.

Yesterday I went to a new psychiatrist to get medicine for anxiety and ADHD. I hesitantly told her about what happened, and we discussed it a lot. She said she thinks I was misdiagnosed with OCD as this is not something I have done/still do unless something triggers me into thinking about the event (re: the checking locks, etc). She said it was PTSD that I actually had. I never even knew much about PTSD, but after reading about it online, it makes so much sense to me. And in some way, I feel better knowing that it wasn't just me being silly for being so upset over something that happened a while ago, and not feel embarrassed for being so traumatized.

Anyway, I wonder if other people on here have also been misdiagnosed with OCD or something else instead of PTSD."

I trust way too easily considering past trauma,14,m2wpya,3,"Hey! I first want to leave a content warning just in case!

I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience or if it’s common at all. But essentially I have quite a bit of trauma from my childhood as well as past abusive relationships that very much do effect me to this day. 
One thing I’ve always been painfully aware of is despite this trauma I’ve always been way too willing to completely open up to someone and trust them within the first few times I’ve met them. Because of this I have been used a lot and hurt a lot so at this point I should be able to be more wary of those I meet. However I still continue this cycle of trust and hurt. 

Does anyone else experience this? Is there potentially something else going on besides my ptsd?"

Just diagnosed with PTSD,7,m2ud1i,1,"TW: sexual assault, suicidal ideation



I was diagnosed with severe depressive disorder 25 years ago.  I have been in therapy and on medication ever since, and have struggled a lot with keeping jobs, having enough money for my bills, keeping insurance and medications, etc.  Every couple of years I would have a major breakdown, lose whatever job I had at the time, and spiral downwards.

Well, we had a breakthrough in therapy the other day and I got a new, additional diagnosis - PTSD.  I had never told anyone before about being raped when I was 19.  I finally opened up to my therapist and told her about it and together we traced the onset of my depression to that exact incident.  Literally everything that has gone wrong in my life is because of what that monster did to me.

I am so angry I can’t deal with it.  I literally seethe when I think about how this one thing and this one man completely ruined my life.  I can’t stop thinking about where I might be and how my life might be if it had never happened and I am overwhelmed by these thoughts.  I can’t move on and I almost wish we’d never figured this out, because I feel like I’ve regressed and ruined 25 years of therapy.  

This is why I’ve never been able to trust men enough to make a relationship work, so I’m 44 and single.  This is why men with mustaches give me panic attacks.  This is why I was promiscuous for ten years, because I didn’t think I was worth anyone forging a real relationship with me and that sex was the only thing I had to offer.  This is why I think about ending it all every time I get into a major depressive episode.  This is the answer to ‘why me’ whenever I think about how no one else in my family has depression.  This is why I can’t keep a job and why I live in poverty and why my therapist says that I am the poster child for disabling depression.  

I hate him and I want him to die. I have no idea where he is now, I can’t find any trace of him on the internet, and there is a very real part of me that wants to get a private investigator and track him down so I can ... I don’t even know.  He needs to be punished.  He needs to know what he’s done to me but he probably won’t even care, or worse, he might be happy about it.  He might have done this to other women.  

So basically he’s ruined my life up to now and now, he’s ruining it even more because I’m so hyper focused on him and what he did.  How do I get over this?  How can I stop thinking about him and being so angry?  Angry doesn’t even seem like a strong enough word ... I’m incensed, I’m enraged, I’m furious.  I don’t like feeling like this; it colors everything and I can’t even do the things that brought me happiness before.  

I do have another appointment with my therapist and we’re going to be dealing with this but we just made the discovery at our last session and I have to wait a few more days before I can see her again.  

I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who might have an idea how I can stop letting this monster live rent free in my head."

Friendly rope in his hand.  

Going to make it all go away.  

Yesterday will be the last day.  

Pint of whiskey with the willow tree.  

The only two friends he has that make him feel warm. 

He is screaming inside, but his eyes stare ahead blue and cold  

Wind whipped and sun burned face cradled with calloused scarred hands

A hard man inside and out

But this world is no longer a place for hard men

Expected to be gentle and soft

It tears at his heart because he wants to be this way for them

They think he does not want to learn 

They know nothing of the daily struggle within

A warrior and animal can not be domesticated 

Only sedated

But the sedation is hated, and so is the sober

So what choice does the man have 

It seems better to be grieved and remembered 

Rather than hated and forgotten 

The friendly rope holds him tight 

He whispers goodbye and his words are devoured by the empty night 

The willow tree rocks the warrior to sleep

He is at peace and in the hearts of those he loves."

I feel more calm under pressure?,8,m2mcvg,8,"Back story, I was diagnosed with PTSD at 15 from living in a somewhat abusive household and from getting hospitalized after being attacked in my teens. Got diagnosed again after my partner shot himself while we were on duty together. Moving on... I see the symptoms pretty much day to day. It has been hell and back trying to be normal or not tell everyone to fuck themselves, it’s been hell trying not to break shit every time I hear a door slam or I hear a loud knock.

But what’s weird is... I’m finding that I find comfort in situations of high stress. Whether it’s at work, and I’m trying to track someone down, or it’s at home and I’ve got my headphones on playing the campaign for Call of Duty MW. It’s like, I don’t like loud noises or stress when it’s out of my control, but when it comes down to it.. the only time I do feel comfortable is when I’m playing videogames, in the middle of a gunfight.

My best friend refuses to acknowledge one of my biggest triggers,1,m2ixj6,1," Hiya, first post so I hope i’m not doing something wrong,

A bit of backstory: I was officially diagnosed with c-ptsd as well as several other mental illnesses in June 2020 because of some things that I really do not want to go into. This came as a shock to me to be honest as for about 5 years I had drilled it into my head that I could not have ptsd, which was ridiculous. The main reasoning behind this stupid idea was because of the number one trigger for me. Something so small and minute that most people wouldn’t bat an eye at it. Notification noises. Upon talking to my therapist in one of my first sessions I learned that most people don’t throw their phone and curl up into a ball every time their phone beeps. I’ve been working on it for a while now and making very slow progress on it but progress nonetheless. (I also do not have notifications on. Ever. on anything. The amount of times i’ve almost missed an assignment deadline change is horrifying) 

Onto my actual reason for this post: not to sugar coat it, my friend is being an ass about it. I love her to bits, we’ve been friends for 7ish years now and I call her my best friend when asked about that sort of thing. But for some reason she refuses to acknowledge that this is an actual problem for me. She thinks I’m kidding for some reason. She has literally seen me go into panic attacks on really bad days because of skype notifications. I’ve asked time and time again and as kindly as I can if she could please just turn down the volume when we hang out. And every time she laughs and turns it all the way up (sidenote: she's not hard of hearing, or anything of the sort. She does this because she thinks it's funny). Our mutual friends are not like this, they take my trigger very seriously. It's only the one. It's gotten to the point where I dread her coming over, or just talking to her in general. Did you know that on instagram video messages if you get a notification your phone picks it up and it's in the message? Guess how I found that out. (Jesus that sounds so bitter I’m so sorry). She messages me more or less everyday because I’m out of our hometown for college. 

I know that I can’t expect the world to bend to my will just because I go into a panic over phone beeps. That it’s a dickish move for me to try and force my friend to do things a certain way. But I just wish she could treat this with the slightest amount of decency. How do I go about this? I don’t want to cut her off or anything, she's still one of my best friends and I don’t want to tear our group apart because of this. But I just don’t know what to do anymore. Thank you so much in advance for any advice you may have, and sorry if this is kind of rambly or if it has the wrong flair or if it doesn't belong here."
My therapist told me my ex online friend gave me PTSD.,5,m2e5xa,1,"This is my first post here so I hope I am doing this okay. 

Note: I have been diagnosed with C-PTSD & BPD due to traumatic childhood which I will not get into.

TL;DR: had a best online friend from Sweden who led me on and was emotionally abusive and toxic. There are certain things I can't do or look at because it reminds me of her.

I'll try not to make this long at all, but basically I met a online friend from Sweden on Twitter/Instagram back in 2018. It was part of a fandom and we got really close by talking and just getting to know each other. I already have a lot of trust issues and just went through a really bad friendship break up a year before that was very traumatic.

I explained to her my situation meaning my mental health, that I have a hard time with confrontation or being honest because of abandonment. So basically we got really close and video chatted, swapped emails, and swapped each other's addresses.

Around 2020 is when our friendship started falling apart. At the time I was getting a lot of help and wasn't very honest with her, because she was the type of person that believed in toxic positivity. She told me that I was her soulmate, her happy place, and her world. That she wanted to meet me one day and a couple years and hang out. She was basically a second mom to me since I don't have a good relationship with my mom. 

One of her friends from the Philippines who she was friends with online as well, would always make fun of my ranting online. I like to vent a lot because I don't have real life friends because I just don't trust people. I opened up to this swedish friend of mine who I got close with about my traumatic childhood. 

She started distancing herself for me after I told her everything, we were friends for almost 2 years. She would constantly lead me on and start taking things back by saying ""oh I was drunk and I didn't mean to say you were my soulmate, it slipped out.""

I was very close to this woman, and I just loved her so much. I told her I had attachment issues and she kept telling me in the beginning ""I don't want you being afraid of me, cling on to me if you need to. This is what I'm here for."" She ends up taking everything back and slowly stop talking to me. 

May of 2020 I ended the friendship because it was a dead end and one sided. She told me if I felt better or was ready to talk again that she would be here for me. Silly me thinking that few months later I wanted to check on her because of the covid-19. Never answered me back, and I was in a severe depressive state and still dealing but for 7 months.

I talked to my therapist about everything and she told me that my former friend from Sweden gave me PTSD along with the psychiatrist saying that as well.   

I can't listen to the music from my favorite artist that we were in a fandom with because it reminds me of her. 
I get really uncomfortable with people from different countries (Not in a racist way) because it reminds me of her accent.
She would send me tea and sweets in the mail, sometimes I would see them at my local whole foods or world market.
People's faces sometime look like her and I get nightmares of her.

I deal with racing and intrusive thoughts. I've been diagnosed with BPD due to childhood trauma along with C-PTSD. I've been on a long road to recovery and my therapist told me that I've been doing so well. I had to step back and decided to write her about 4 days ago, after 7 months. Guess what? She never wrote back. I cried for 2 days straight and wanted to just die. Here I am 4 days after writing her the fifth time & feel a little bit of relief. I was afraid of her being blunt towards me because she used to be mean to me. I accepted it because I thought that was normal, my whole life I was treated like dirt so I thought it was normal. 

sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'm still having a hard time and there are triggers seeing certain things, hearing certain things, and even tasting certain things that remind me of her. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice how to handle flashbacks, triggers, and nightmares?
Thank you."

Which way of therapy/psychotherapy you practice and recommend,2,m2dhro,2,"Hey everyone,

So far I haven't had much success with psychotherapies(I guess majority was gestalt and any sort of ""talk"" therapy. I have had appointments with psychiatrist too

Most of the time diagnosed with depression, anxiety, latest psychiatrist even prescribed me concerta with possible attention issues that I guess stems from early age trauma and some bullying that induced tremendous amount of shame, guilt, anger for not intervening when anyone tried to hurt me

I will have my first (successful) somatic experience soon, had one that was complete failure and got some contact for a body psychotherapist and she also had a degree for EMDR

My issues as mentioned are possible early age trauma(a few years ago I have been told that my mother left our family couple of times) that induced big amount of trust issues, insecurities(in relationships), attachment issues, abandonment issues

What do you think of my plan for helping myself out? Any other psychology path?

Thanks!"
I wish I could.,8,m2c2z5,0,"I wish I could be like a normal person. Not curl into a ball and powerlessly watch as my brain freezes in panic whenever I encounter my triggers, which are so ridiculously common in everyday life.

My therapist tries her very best to help, trying to get me to process my trauma properly this time. But I was hurt almost continuously for ten years of my life, a decade that I'll never get back, and threatens to steal even more decades of my life by shrouding them in sadness, a life spent continuously triggered over and over again to the point where functioning is so hard. I wish I was freed from the abuse early enough to heal my wounds properly, but unfortunately they've just scarred over now, and I don't know if it's even possible for me to reprocess what happened to me the ""right"" way anymore.

I feel like I will never ever be safe and there's nothing I can do to keep safe. Even in my own home I'm scared, I live in flat share and last week my flatmate brought a stranger home who assaulted her. When does this end? It just feels like I'm in hell. 

Every time I think I'm making progress something happens and my fears are confirmed. I'm so frightened not just for myself but for all women. I just want it to stop."

She was blind, couldn’t walk and cried constantly. I had to make the decision to do what my mom couldn’t... I had to have her put down. She was the only living thing I had left of my mom.

I hate being a woman / Rant,14,m27uxb,5,"I don't mean like I hate existing in woman form,. I'm fine with that, but I hate the world does almost nothing to change already. Every fucking day not only do I need to deal with men being insane and staring at me as if I am created just for them and causing flashbacks in public, but because our culture making me exposed to all kinds of bad stuff I wouldn't have to endure if I was a man.


This is just today's example. I accepted one male linkedin connection, and today he sent me simple message hi :). I was little on the edge because usually messages on linkedin go straight to the point but I thought, well, maybe he wants to be extra polite before talking business. I sent him hello :) and the next message I received from him was - do you have an instagram :). I swear this feels like office sexual harassment, or triggers sexism flashbacks I already endured many times. I went into helpless mode right away, and I always have trouble getting out of there. So fucking ridiculous! I can't imagine men receiving something like that. It's repulsive.


Also, today I discovered a new trigger - it's being asked how old I am. It is a trigger purely because it sends me into flashback when I was a girl and sexually abused and felt powerless because I thought men are authority and I thought that I have no right to speak for myself as a little girl. 🤮😭 To this day I have trouble thinking that's NOT how the world is supposed to function.


I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! Ffs, my life is literally shortened because of trauma and all these situations ate making it even shorter with new stress. I want to escape, I am overwhelmed dealing with this non stop. It's insane."
I found my trigger (sexual assault/violence),2,m275n5,1,"It's white cars, ones that look closest to his. When I see one in the parking lot I look around frantically and I used to now know why. When I see one on the street my throat and lungs freeze but my blood is on fire. When I'm driving I try to hide my head. When one passes by my house I spend the rest of the day ""in grey"". When I saw a fucking commercial I became angry and had no idea why. The images were so sharp and jarring that I pretended they weren't real and dissociated. 

My trigger is white cars. Because he used to find me in a white car. He found me, took me, and left me in pieces in a white car.

(That's it I just wanted to write it down and know it's real. It doesn't make sense to me still but I'm working on it)"
Can abusive relationship and fast antidepressant switching cause CPTSD?,2,m26vng,0," 

Hello everybody, I would like to apologize for my English coz I am not a native speaker.

I have always had some problems in my intimate relationships. My ex-girlfriend was a narcissistic abuser and a premiant student at my university. Like everybody, I have been through some childhood trauma, but a minor one, I think. However, it led to a bad attachment style in my relationships. Mainly I cannot keep my personal boundaries and have problems with assertiveness. I am also a ""pleaser"" type of person because my parents were arguing a lot during my childhood. We also have some history of psychological problems running in the family (neurosis). After my last ex-girlfriend, I have been attending a psychologist. Recently I found a new girlfriend who is sadly my colleague from work.

Everything went pretty fine at the start, but after few months, I woke up with a panic attack that she broke up with me. Since then, my problems started. I was extremely anxious in her presence and didn't know why. I confronted her honestly, but she was raised in a family where psychological problems do not exist, and they are trying to avoid people with problems. Long story short. My anxiety becomes panics, and she was blackmailing me about breaking up with me if I don't solve this. I started to have nightmares and weird unconscious feelings forcing me to run. After discussion with my psychologist, he assumed it is good I do not run away and try to confront my fears. Well, I tried it, and after few days, I was hospitalized after terrible neverending panic attacks. We broke up. I found a professor psychiatrist from the medical faculty and started taking Mirtazapine. I have had such ambivalent feelings for my girlfriend. I know deep down I love her (maybe attachment issue?) and cannot be with her in one room without having panic attacks. She became more understanding, and AD started to work. Unfortunately, I have had terrible side effects and dissociation on Mirt. After consulting with my new EMDR/trauma-focused psychologist, I tried to switch to a different AD to target my anxiety/panic (PTSD symptoms?). I wanted to solve it and stay with my ex-girlfriend, so I was attending him twice a week + plus prescribed different AD. Well repeatedly, in this case, new AD almost killed me a let me in long-term dissociation (dp/dr), and I had 24/7 panic attacks during 14 days. Terrible depression started, anxiety attacks, and everybody persuaded me to listen to the psychiatrist about taking them. I could not cope anymore and stop taking them. My girlfriend broke up with me again during that time, saying I would like to help you, but I don't know how the problem is in your head only, you need time for yourself to solve it. I could not go to work or study. I started SSRI, which caused the same reaction as the previous AD. Now I am again on Mirtazapine because it is only which works somehow for me.

Now I am almost not communicating with my ""newer"" ex. However, we are just friends; I still like her somehow after all of it (she has many good attributes). I keep attending EMDR twice a week + have EFT every 3 weeks. I am completely braindead after all that happened. I am dissociated 24/7. If I feel something, I have panic attacks or anxiety. I've been told I have an extremely hypersensitive amygdala (well, thanks :/). Cannot focus, work or study. I wanted everything and ended with nothing, sadly. My whole life is in ruins now.

If my ex would understand more and not try to convince me, it's just a feeling or thought which causes my anxiety. Maybe It would not end like that. I don't know, really. I am a super kind person, well was, because now I am full of anger or emptiness.

I have questions for you. Was my unconsciousness right about my current ex? I have always had ambivalent feelings for her. Nobody understands it, even two of my psychologists. Maybe I did not see something my unconscious mind tried to tell me. She is not perfect, and anything is either ""black"" or ""white ."" Maybe she is also some type of abuser or shares some similarities with my previous ex (triggers from the previous relationship) - my psychologist suggests this. I am interested in a specific type of girls. I am also a perfectionist myself, so it is a very complicated topic overall.

The second question is about the type of diagnosis. I went through an almost constant life-threatening situation during the past few months. Well, at least my brain thinks that. The worst stress was caused by medication. BTW, the psychiatrist told me it is not possible to have these terrible side effects, etc. I am treated for mild PTSD, Panic disorder, and dissociation disorder. However, after reading some comments and topics, I think it could be complex PTSD.

I would be so grateful for information about my feelings towards my ex (ambivalent) and her non-emphatic behavior maybe. Can I be a victim again? What should I do when she is my colleague? I was stupid to let it go so far. I was so attached to her.

I am highly depressed, changes in behavior, aggression, not communicating with anybody almost. Have nightmares, flashbacks, constant panic attacks. Avoiding certain situations, people, not feeling anything deep down when I am in dissociation which is like 20/7. Should I keep my treatment plan? I took a semester free and trying to have a daily plan. Is there any medication that could help me and not kill me. The worst is the dp/dr for me. I want to live my life and study but my brain is dead, I cannot think and focus and also cannot remember certain parts of the day or even past months. Could it be CPTSD? I will be so grateful for every suggestion and idea from you guys. Well, I keep fighting but I am incredibly scared about my future and brain functions.

Thanks a lot, guys."
"Does anyone else feel like they've manifested their PTSD?

I say that in quotations because I'm not sure if I really was a bad partner or he was just gaslighting me. He was sexually abusive towards me and would humiliate me by touching me in public, but I didn't realize it was abuse until after our relationship ended.

"Finding Support for my wife (trigger warning:parental abuse, no graphic details)",2,m252ki,0,"Hi! My (30m) wife (29f) has PTSD (diagnosed) and possibly some other mental health/neurological disorders, possibly ADHD, which I have as well. She was physically/emotionally abused by her father, who was himself undiagnosed with multiple issues, and who's parents grew up during the great depression. They had a long and difficult relationship, and her father passed away recently in his sleep and was in his 60s, which has destroyed my wife, her sister, and mother, as they were all still close with him, and accepted he was mentally ill, even though they didn't put up with his temper anymore. He had gotten better (was no longer physically abusive), but still had a tendency to fly off the handle/berate people.  My wife was not on speaking terms with him when he died, and I don't think she will ever forgive herself. Her dad was her best friend, regardless of the trauma. 

  My wife has seen general therapists, but is still pretty new to her ptsd diagnosis as a whole, though she's had it a long time. We live near Columbia, MO, and I was wondering if any of you know if there are any resources in that area for us to look into. My wife has trouble with employment, she doesn't do well with stress/jobs she hates, as they drastically affect her mental health, which affects our relationship, as my ADHD makes it difficult for me to be aware of her mental state at all times and I have a hard time anticipating her needs.  This of course makes treatment difficult, since in the US, Healthcare/insurance is tied to employment, and I don't make enough to pay our bills and her health insurance. 

   I genuinely believe she needs a specialist. She has a lot to work through, and doesn't have a normal size support system, as she has trouble developing lasting friendships. The 2 people she really talks to besides myself have their own lives, and being a one man support system is far more difficult than I could have possibly imagined. I love her so much, and I just want her to be happy and healthy, even if it means she can't work sometimes. Any help finding resources would be greatly appreciated."

Complications with Opening Up to Family,1,m22kao,0,"TW: sexual assault

Hello. As the trigger warning above suggests, I'm a survivor of sexual assault, particularly from a close family member: one of my cousins. It happened when I was a teenager and I've barely had contact since (save for a few moments I dreaded but that's not relevant) but at least 2 of his siblings are unaware of this. His sister in particular keeps accidentally triggering me by trying to bring him along to visit or posting on my dad's memorial page by comparing him to my deceased father. Now, I don't blame her in the slightest, we just fell out of touch with that side of the family because of her brother and she doesn't know that, but I think it's time.

However, it's really difficult to write or record that message. It was easier to tell my grandmother and other aunt because they knew some of what happened and already supported me, but honestly I'm kind of scared about this one. As much as I know it's not my responsibility, I don't want to ruin relationships, break her reality, or cause drama. I know that whatever happens next is on her and maybe her mother or brothers, and I rationally shouldn't blame myself, but it's a really hard thing to write out and press send. I know this because I've been trying to inform her for months, but I don't know if I'm strong enough."

Cptsd?,7,m1w76y,2,"When I read about cptsd the symptoms match me very well. It is confusing because I remember my early childhood as very nice. But I dissociated a lot even back then as I remember (my teacher even wrote it to my mom because I constantly spaced out dringend class and just react when she calls me several times). My childhood went down when I was 10 and we moved to my stepdad. Then the Mobbing and emotional abuse began, at 11 I was sexually assaulted and dissociated the event since I was 16. My depression started and I got an eating dissorder too. But everyone accused me to make things up and my pain isn't valid. It was very painful, until I moved out. Then it got better, but I was raped 3 times and didn't even feel anything until the last time, like, I dissociated hard and felt like shattered completely. Then, the regular ptsd symptoms began. The dissociation is like a Red line through my life. I dissociated every past event that got me pain so is it possible I dissociate some Events of my early childhood too? It seems to me like I didn't went through enough to have cptsd even when I have the symptoms. I'm confused."
The difference between borderline and PTSD,6,m1umri,1,"I had a very abusive childhood.  I then had various life altering traumas like my husband and love of my life dying suddenly at 26.  I was also attacked a few times (I live in a country with a very high crime rate).  I also have trichotillomania and various other self esteem psychological issues. 

Long story short, I tried getting help over the years but nobody has been able to help to the point where I can actually function in normal society.  I've had about 40 jobs and moved about 50 times in 15 years.  I can't seem to stay in any place.  The moment there is any kind of stress I move or run away.

Embarrassed to admit I'm bothered by things that COULD HAVE happened but didn't when I was in Afghanistan.,16,m1t58h,10,"I was in the military deployed to Afghanistan almost six years ago now. Say what you will about how the US military is being used there, but I thought I was doing the right thing being there until I left. I figure there's a pretty good reason we're not wanted there. Either way, I was fortunate enough to make it home safely, but I had several situations that, at the time, made me wonder if something really awful was about to happen.

I just woke up to go to the bathroom around 2 am, and when I got back to bed I started thinking about what might have happened if I'd been attacked and my weapon didn't function properly. Or whether a rescue team would have been able to find me if my vehicle was disabled. There were several times I felt I was in imminent danger because I'd been spotted and the person would ID our vehicle and get on their radio or phone. Every time something like that would happen, my first thought was that someone somewhere down this road is waiting to kill me. That feeling of not knowing which turn to take or not take would be enough to make you crazy. 

At the time, you compartmentalize to get you through, but for some reason tonight, over six years later, for the first time I nearly had a panic attack thinking about what could have happened to me. I started typing this post and I got sweaty and anxious, and my wife woke up and helped calm me down a bit.

Tired of being invalidated and told how “young” I am,15,m1sl8u,4,"TW: physical abuse mentioned

When I was a young kid people called me an old soul or “very mature for my age.” I spent ages 8-14 reading books all day almost every day (a lot of adult fiction) and found it extremely hard to connect with my peers. I wish I spent more of my childhood actually living than just thinking. 

I’m 21 and just feel so done with life. Mentally I feel 60. Mainly because of physical abuse that lasted my teen years, that caused me to have severe chronic pain for 4 years that is still far from healed. 

I sustained concussions that literally gave me amnesia for a year, where I constantly complained about feeling “like an old person with dementia”.

It’s just weird having such a huge disconnect between where I am in my mind, and how people see me. In everyone else’s eyes I’m some young dumb practically teenager still, and should be out partying. I’m so jealous how everyone around me is carefree. I can’t live to my parents or anyone’s expectations, of being like that and I hate it. 

I’ve just suffered so fucking much. I literally think my brain is eroded from the combination of concussions, depression and ptsd, and drinking. 

Idk why but I’m so frustrated that people keep saying shit like “omg you’re so young” or treating me like I don’t have any life experiences. I’ve suffered a lot more than some of the middle aged people saying that, who never experienced abuse. It didn’t help that throughout the abuse people constantly told me “you’re too young to have neck pain”... 

Idk if anyone else can relate, it just makes me feel so invalidated when people assume I’m just some young dumb kid who’s never suffered in their life."

I’m not asking for a diagnosis but I don’t know if what happened to me could be bad enough to have “given” me PTSD but I’m so not myself anymore. Any advice would be awesome.,1,m1p48n,4,"In the beginning of January I was in a horrible car accident that I shouldn’t have walked away from. The pictures are traumatizing and it took me a while to look at them. It was entirely my fault, although I can’t remember the accident at all or afterwards really, and in my police report it’s stated that I was unable to recall the event.

I ended up in the hospital, eventually stayed in psych for a few days due to my extreme reaction and saying I wish I did die with my car etc. 

Since then I haven’t been myself. For one I HATE driving now, I got a brand new car and I don’t even like it. However, given the severity of my accident I don’t think wanting to avoid driving is outlandish. 

But, personality wise idk what’s wrong with me. I’m jumpy, I’m detached from my surroundings and people. Half of the time I feel like things are a dream and not happening, this was something I kept repeating in the hospital, I refused to believe anything was real. I have next to no concentration, I’m extremely overwhelmed- that being said I’m taking on a lot with college courses, 2 part time jobs, and an internship so maybe overwhelmed is normal. I have reoccurring dreams that I’m in my new car and I flip it like I did in real life. My anxiety is out of control, I can’t relax, seeing car accidents in movies makes me horribly distressed and loud noises make me jump. I’ve isolated myself almost completely and have no desire to get back to the way things were. 

I’ve always had mental health issues, but this is a bit more extreme. I’m pretty good at “wearing a mask” and keeping it on and acting normal but lately the thought of having to do that is exhausting and I avoid situations where I’ll need to “wear my mask.” 

I guess my question is, can something like a car accident possibly result in PTSD? Or is this just something else? I just wish I could feel normal again but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen any time soon even with all the time that’s going by."
"""You can only control your response to the situation.""",43,m1oxvz,18,"This is something my boss told me today.

I can't control my response. I have a disability that stops me from controlling my response. Sudden noises make me jump. Objects coming at my face make me flinch. When my coworker starts lecturing me about something, I have a PTSD flashback, a panic attack, or I start dissociating. There is literally nothing I can do to prevent this.
I really don't want to drag my PTSD into this situation because I don't want to be treated like I'm delicate or crazy. I'm just tired of my coworker lecturing me like I'm one of the toddlers in our class. And I'm tired of my boss making excuses for said coworker and writing off her bullying as ""pandemic stress.""

Quitting drinking...is hard.,23,m1mrcl,3,"The incidents leading up to the most traumatic moments of my life, leading to my journey with PTSD, all involved me drinking to the point of blacking out.

Went to work the next day and had to take a nap under my desk...when I woke up, I threw up in my garbage can.

Both times I was sexually assaulted, I was drunk. Last week I made it home safe by some miracle but god, I'm so angry with myself for the mistakes I've made. But I've decided to quit drinking. I'm proud to have come to this decision but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm a performer and all my friends are party animals. I have no idea how I'm going to resist the urge to drink. Without liquor I'm terrified to be intimate with anyone and terrified to sing, which I'm extremely passionate about. Alcohol turns me into an extrovert but it also makes me so vulnerable. I can't do it anymore.

I'm just trying to build up inner strength at this point. It's so strange...my rape was years ago but it feels as fresh as the night it happened, despite time passing and therapy. Trauma works in mysterious ways.

I don't know what the point of all this was...but I'm struggling. It was easy to decide I'm not drinking anymore. But building up the permanent strength to replace the temporary bravery alcohol gives me is going to be difficult. Can anyone relate?"

I catch colds frequently because of the cold sweats. I am genuinely suffering and I just want it to stop. Does anybody else suffer from this? If so, what do you do to cope? Any advice needed. :("
I think I need help.,7,m1k1gs,5,"Over the last several months, my mental health has been declining. I am going through times where I’m extremely up and happy, everything is great and I’m hopeful for the future. This lasts for days, sometimes weeks. Then I get hit with invasive thoughts of how awful I am and how no one has ever loved me and never will, and other things I don’t wish to talk about. The thoughts have proof to back them up, there is endless proof of what an awful person I am and my brain reminds me every morning when I wake until every evening when I sleep. It also reminds me of traumatic events I’ve been through and has been surprising me with a ton of repressed memories. Mostly about my abusive ex. It is endless. It feels like torture, like my brain wants to ruin every part of me and rip me apart until nothing is left. This also lasts but for longer periods of time, weeks to months at a time. 

You can probably guess which of these I’m feeling now. I’m drained, exhausted. I can’t even rest when I sleep, my dreams are so vivid and real. I’m waking up exhausted, remaining exhausted while my brain attacks me, go to bed exhausted, repeat every day. On top of all that, when I get to these dark places I struggle with handling my sobriety. 

I’ve been able to fight the thoughts and I’m sober, but it’s been going on for so long I am so exhausted of fighting. I am miserable and I feel like it won’t ever end, it just keeps getting worse. 

I have a bad feeling about if I don’t get help, but I am scared to get help. Every time I’ve tried to get help, I get judged and told to “get over it” or that I “clearly don’t actually want to get better” and they give up on me. They tell me to find someone else. I’m afraid to get a therapist for this reason. I can’t tell my friends or family it’s too much for them to handle and I’m ashamed of my condition. I feel alone, weak and alone. I’m just hoping the better days come soon so I can get some relief."
My professor is a stalker and I don’t know what to do. (TW),21,m1joxy,8,"My professor is a stalker
He hasn’t stalked me personally, but I have ptsd from a person in my past stalking me (among other things). The class is one I can’t switch out or drop and I’m having difficulty going to class without just sobbing throughout the whole thing since learning about his past behaviors. I believe I may be the only current student who knows about this, but I have talked with other professors about it and they know + reported it when the confirmed incident happened in 2019, but nothing came of it. 

I feel very conflicted. The class covers sensitive issues including violence and stalking against women and because of the vulnerable position students are in (myself included) I worry and I feel like I should tell others to be cautious/be alert. On the other hand I worry about the professor finding out that I know and him retaliating against the victim. I feel it’s not my story to share and that it may not be fair of me to tell it, but I worry that not sharing may lead others to get hurt in the future. I know how badly it can fuck up someone’s life when they’ve been a victim of stalking and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. Idrk what I’m looking for, advice, nice words.... idk.

I was raped at 14 - Can I please get support or help,62,m1e8cs,15,"Hi everybody, this has been weighing on me heavily since it all started, and I would really appreciate some support or your attention I just need to get this off my chest

&#x200B;

I was sexually assaulted by my abusive boyfriend of two years in October, he did it to me while I was 14. I was barely old enough to comprehend what he was doing yet all I felt was the excruciating pain in which he was penetrating me. It was the worst experience of my life, he was a big guy and he was leaning his entire bodyweight on me, crushing me so hard it felt like 1000 pianos were being laid on me and it was crushing my chest so I couldn't breathe, I was suffocating in pillow my face was pressed into. He was pulling my hair and groping me at the same time he was penetrating me and the pain was unimaginable, I could feel every sensation in my body, and it was all pain it was all torture. I remember he was yanking my hair and it pulled my head up off the pillow for a split second, and I remember seeing the side table and the chimney to another house outside the window. It was in the middle of the night when he did it to me, about 3AM. The whole experience lasted for 10 seconds, before a 10 year old girl walked in on us and stopped it. It was the most traumatic experience I ever had and I still have PTSD on it. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory on what happened leading up to this. I was abused by my boyfriend physically and mentally for 2 years, with it starting as hitting and punching and then escalating to choking, slapping, giving me black eyes, and he once choked me unconscious. He told me he was the only one who loved me and that nobody wanted me that I wasn't good enough and he constantly body shamed me and gave me an eating disorder. Note this was all happening when I was 12-14. I believed all his mental manipulation and it made me always go back to him. He would threaten to hit me and was always so intimate, groping me painfully during our relationship. In September, a month before I was raped, his friend sexually assaulted me at the local community center. I remember being so petrified and he forced me to eat a pill that turned out to be a sedative so I couldn't fight back. I wasn't raped, but I was groped, fingered, violently assaulted to where I had to be contained in a wheelchair because I couldn't walk because of what he did to my genitalia that day.

&#x200B;

When I was raped, I was still in a wheelchair because of what his friend did to my vagina, making it physical torture too to be penetrated that way. When my parents found out I was raped, they weren't supportive at all, they called me names like ""stupid"" and ""slut"" and drove me to my first suicidal thoughts. It forced me to run away to a shelter at 2AM, but I had to run through the woods in order to get there. In the woods there happened to be a group of men who tripped me when they saw me coming, groped me again, and mugged me of any belongings I had. This wasn't even the end of my trauma.

&#x200B;

During my stay at the shelter, I lost my voice. I was unable to talk to any of the attendings there or other girls at the shelter. I had a court trial with my boyfriend to where he was sentenced to 13 years in prison, then 10 years when it was reduced. It was so scary being in front of all the people, feeling his cold eyes boring into mine when I stood up there and testified and I still have nightmares about that day to this day right now. 

&#x200B;

On Halloween, I was assaulted and groped again by the abusive ex of one of the girls at the shelter. This was just the cherry on top to all the trauma I had experienced so far. It further intensified my phobia of people and the outdoors and even going into my own backyard can set a panic attack on me.

&#x200B;

Fast forwarding to now, 6 months later, I'm back at my parent's home when they forced me to come back from the shelter. I feel alone all the time, have vivid hallucinations where my boyfriend is raping me again almost every day, have panic attacks, and have nightmares of being raped again. My parents refuse to support me so I have no access to a therapist. I always feel sad, hopeless, angry, trapped in a box of negative emotions. I can't tell any of my friends for support and they don't know anything is wrong I'm not ready to reach out. My only help is from confiding in 1 friend I did tell, but they cannot be with me physically. 

&#x200B;

My arms and legs are full of cuts, maybe \~30 total. At first, cutting was a suicide attempt, but now cutting is more of a way to temporarily get relief from all the intense depression and anger and sadness I get from the memory. I cannot stop remembering those 10 seconds and it's ingrained into me and I feel so unimaginably angry all the time since it's not fair how I got all this trauma and nobody else did. It feels so hopeless and everyday I want to give up and kill myself.

&#x200B;

All I want is a therapist, some help. I don't want to go to the hospital because it reminds me of the first time I got assaulted, I have a phobia of hospitals and I believe everyone wants to rape me too and hurt me. I'm petrified of stepping foot outdoors and I can barely tell my story to anyone because it seems so far fetched and crazy and made up. Everyday is so painful, I wake up with a nightmare and have a panic attack, I have suicidal thoughts, I become depressed and then become so angry I want to punch a hole in my walls. I can't distract myself, the memory is always on the front of my mind or back at all times. 

&#x200B;

I just want the pain to stop, I want a break from all the pain my only wish is that there is a therapist online somewhere willing to converse with me over a live chat since calling would be extremely difficult since my parents can hear. They believe everything that you think of when you think rape culture and refuse to help me. They constantly yell at me and hurt me and make me want to kill myself more. I'm too scared of going to the police.

&#x200B;

I always think I'm not good enough, I still remember what he said and part of me still loves him I think I'm crazy for that. I think I'm alone and nobody wants to help me that nobody would believe me that I'm all alone with him in my head all the time. I obviously have PTSD or rape trauma syndrome but no therapist to help me. I live in Canada.

&#x200B;

Any help would be graciously appreciated, I would love it if anybody could get me contact with a therapist for free and without parental support because it feels so hopeless to continue going without one. But I just wanted to let this off my chest, any support would be appreciated. Thank you if you read all that."
propranolol,8,m1bysq,7,"hi! i just started taking propranolol for my ptsd and my body feels more relaxed? like it feels like the tension in my body left my body? i’m not sure if it’s my other medications but it’s easier to breath.

If someone can have such compassion for me, I feel like one day I can too.

I'm so grateful that I'm in tears. I can heal. I can get better and be in peace one day. I don't have to be afraid anymore.
Maybe I'll soon give myself permission to have dreams again, instead of just coping all the time.

Today I managed to breathe a little."
Exaggerated Startle Response,7,m15ynz,3,"I could use some advice for meds or resources that help with exaggerated startle response.  I’ve kicked almost all my other symptoms, but if somebody comes out of my peripheral vision or walks into a room and I don’t hear them my instinct is to attack them.  I don’t.  But I yell and have like a quick startle spasm and then it’s like I’m having a heart attack and can’t catch my breath.  It’s like this instant flash instinct to counterattack them even if they’re just walking faster than me or one of my daughters getting a drink in the kitchen.  My four year old just asked me for chocolate milk and I almost threw her into a chair because I didn’t realize she had gotten so close to me.  I don’t want to hurt anyone.  Ever.  I just... I could use some advice on how to deal with this particular symptom.  I really appreciate the help."
How do I tell my parents I need therapy,6,m13zco,3,"TW

I’m 16 and when I was 14 I met this guy online who was 17 and we started dating when he was 18 (yes I know I was stupid) I won’t go into much detail but what matters was he was emotionally abusive and manipulative and that lasted until the beginning of quarantine when I was finally able to completely cut him out of my life with the help of my new boyfriend.

He said if he ever saw me he would “publicly r*pe and humiliate me”(he knows where I go to school and hang out) He would always be yelling at me for the smallest things and call me a pathetic little shit and ever since then I’ve been extremely paranoid by the smallest movements, whenever someone slightly raises their voices or makes a loud noise I start crying. I’ve had trouble sleeping and have had constant nightmares, and talking to adults has been completely terrifying and I break down crying. There was also a time while we were dating where I just had an anxiety attack after a girl who he cheated on me with showed up randomly and I started shaking uncontrollably. I’ve just been really sensitive and constantly overthink.

My current boyfriend says I need therapy and I know I do and I want help but asking my parents for anything is terrifying and whenever I do or I try to I end up crying uncontrollably and it’s just scary I don’t now how to talk to them or bring it up I don’t want to tell them about what happened to me yet since they would probably be really disappointed and upset but I just need the help and don’t know how to ask them or how else I can get help.

I did tell my parents I wanted a therapist before but they ended up forgetting and that never happened."
Coming home is hard,3,m11rz1,1,"I was/am a person who had to travel around alot for the work i did that messed me up so bad. I won't get into details because it may upset some and it is vaguely political in nature (hence the throwaway as well). Suffice to say though i was a medic and a good one at that who lead a small team of medics to help people in danger.

I saw some things and lost some people during my time. Some nights it really does all come back and i just lock up and relieve every sight,sound, smell and noise in vivid detail in a way i was not ready for. That isnt what this post is about though.

Instead i just need to vent about coming home. I had a schedule almost where i would go out for up to 2 weeks at times (usually though it was 3 to 5 days)  each month. It may not sound like much but during that time my existence was just getting my people home and helping those who needed it. Nothing else mattered to me and nothing else existed. It had to be that way because if it wasnt i could make a bad call and get people hurt or killed very easily (we werent targeted for arrest because we were peaceful, didnt stop others from attempting to kill us several times). Then i'd come home and just pretend nothing happened. If anyone asked where i went i said vacation or a friends house. Still it was weird being home even when i was still regularly going out. I'd find myself just finding everything so odd and funny almost. 

I never really noticed it until one day i was in aldis shopping and it was the day after i came back from a really rough outing. The day before i had to talk down an armed gunman who had been agitated  after firecrackers and flashbangs went off. He had gone down into a high ready and was repeatedly sweeping the crowd with his muzzle. No one wanted to go near him but i did and i convinced him to come back with me and disarm then escorted him out of the area. I genuinely believe i probably saved a few lives there. I remember i was sitting there in aldis and I couldn't explain it but somehow just this idea that i could go from that extreme situation to my biggest worry being picking out ceral messed with me to the point where i couldnt stop laughing and crying at the same time. I went to the store bathroom and just stayed in one of the stalls bitting my arm to try and stay quiet.

That was 2 years ago now and its only gotten worse. I find myself frequently feeling alienated from normal people around me and feel like a freak, like i dont belong. It has gotten so bad i have developed paranoid ideas that people recognize it and thats why they glance at me on the street or say hello. I know i'm wrong but it still pops into my head occasionally.

My last outing was in december, since then I've told my people i'm retired. It means nothing but that i'm trying to live a normal life. 

It's only gotten harder being home. I find myself feeling alone more now as part of the process of my retirement was seperating myself from my old friends and trying to reconnect with the old ones. I find my temper short and its gotten to the point where im so afraid of snapping that when i talk to normal people i shut myself off emotionally, i learned recently this is called stone walling. The hardest thing is the lack of a mission or purpose. Weirdly i find myself more afraid of dying now then when i was in despite being in no danger. 

Frankly it is so hard coming home it is driving me away from home. Lately i started reconnecting with certain members of my team i was particularly close too and purposing the idea of taking our work farther by starting a ngo as cover to go into active warzones. It terrifies me that this is a real part of me and i want it to stop but i can't. I tried talking to shrinks about it but was told twice this was a normal part of processing and was even encouraged. Honestly i'm scared, i'm scared that it will never go away and that i will always find home foreign to me. I want one day to be able to settle down. To share my life with someone and to grow old and raise a family in a community that i feel is a part of me. Sadly i dont think it will ever really happen.

Please if you have experience with this advice is greatly appreciated."
my ptsd,2,m11m10,10,"the thing with my ptsd is i don’t sympathy cause i did it to myself, i gave myself the lsd tab and i sat there and did it, but i went through what a rape victim went through ( i assume ), but theres no rape group for me, there’s no community of girls that can go i’ve been through the same thing, idk anyone who has been through this, i saw things no 18 year old should have to see, i watched myself be raped from 1st person and 3rd person, i felt every arm and every bone, i saw every eye, and every face, i remember it so vividly i could draw the eyes ( if i was talented enough to draw ), i saw my mother’s eyes turn into something evil, the arms i felt at home in and safe in, were my enemy, the father who is meant to walk me up the aisle, i can’t even speak about what i saw, it was disgusting and disturbing, but i cant look at my own dad the same anymore, but i don’t get a community, i don’t get the sympathy from girls, i get looked at like a crackhead, i deserved it, i did it to myself, i get flashbacks, but they’re not validated because it was all a flashback, but nothing felt more real, i still think i’m dead and this is just the after life, i cant understand it, how it didn’t happen, maybe it did happen but my family said it was a lsd trip so i wouldn’t be too fucked and feel too dirty, but i feel dirty, i scrubbed at my skin, trying to change it, my neck, i scrubbed at my neck, my neck that my aunt use to say was so pretty and long, i wanted to tear it to pieces, sometimes i just touch it and it feels like it’s happening all again, but my ptsd will never be validated because it was my fault"
"Chronic Stress, Insomnia, and Hair Loss",2,m1160q,1,"29 year old male. I had a PTSD trigger in October at a meditation retreat of all places. The trigger was just a song. That same night I started experiencing insomnia. The next day, I could feel a sensation on my scalp. I have been walking around with chronic stress since the song played. These symptoms have gotten progressively worse. 

I am currently at a 30 day inpatient program. Working on stressors and triggers and how to get this back to normal. 

The stress: I feel like a dense ball of stress. My anxiety and depression has gotten significantly worse. There is a direct correlation to my stress and how much sleep I get. The stress also gives me shallow breathing. I feel like the stress/anxiety is the root issue that needs addressed. 

Insomnia: since October, I have been sleeping under 5 hours a night. This is sooooo abnormal. I normally sleep 8-10 hours a night. I wake up like clockwork at 1:20, 3, and 4:30 am. If I’m lucky, I fall back asleep. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, these hours are related to unprocessed grief, anger, and being in control- very accurate for my situation. 

Hair loss: I assume it is Telogen Effluvium. I am stressed and anxious and my hair loss only started with the trigger in October. The hair loss was unnoticeable for 3 months, but then the shedding got really bad. I have been taking Nutrafol hair supplements and using PuraDor shampoo and conditioner, but I know these are not stopping the underlying cause of my hair loss- stress. 

Any thoughts/ questions/ concerns???"
How do you cope with panic attacks?,2,m10jpf,11,"I found a grounding technique called the 5 senses that worked. But I want to know how you guys cope with it, maybe I’ll find a better way to deal :)"
Family triggering me,4,m0ztny,0,"I’m struggling. I moved home in September, because I was burning myself out trying to train my dog in an apartment/roommate setting while working thru school. I reached out to my parents because I wanted to get my rescue dog into an advanced training curriculum asap. They offered (basically what they had wanted from the beginning) for me to move home and take classes online. Six months, and two massive familial meltdowns, two threats of eviction, multiple threats/offers to put down my dog, and several panic attacks down the road I’ve decided that I won’t be staying through the summer.

 I think moving home has caused irreparable damage. I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 12, when it was brought to my parents’ attention that a practically catatonic state shouldn’t be the norm for a child my age. They brought me to psychiatry offices where id sit in dark rooms, ignoring the questions the strangers prodded at me until it was time to go home and sit in an equally dark room. 

Almost ten years later, I found myself slipping back into that same silent pattern which was why I reached out in the first place. My dog has been the only thing holding me together for the past year. My ‘suicidal ideations’ have pretty much dropped – can’t drop dead when I’m responsible for the life of someone else. 

Even though I’ve had to cut back on my credits in order to save up money, I know id rather take longer to graduate then live without my dog. I don’t see them the way I used to. I thought I could come back, and they’d help me pull myself back together. Instead, I’ve come to the realization that I’m alone. The little trust I have left keeps getting pulled away. I trust more in the security that my animal can give me than that of my own family. The clashes over the dogs training and their contempt of me have only widened the gulf I live with.  

I want to blame my abusers for this gulf. I blame them for leaving me an empty husk. I used to be so angry. I don’t have the energy to feel angry anymore. I look at my dog and I know that if it came down to it, he’d put his life on the line to protect me from further damage. I’m fairly certain my quality of life won’t be much improved by leaving – once the burnout kicks back in, but his could. I’ve resigned myself to living according to the constraints my brain affords me. It just turns out it won’t be with my family."
How to reduce night terrors?,9,m0y7ex,2,"Sometimes they're quite graphic, other times I wake up with an emotion I'd only visit around the time of my trauma. But night terrors always leave me tense and scared in the morning, and I never really fully move on to the day because of how purely painful and terrifying they are. Have been meditating+ therapy. But other than that, any tips to reduce them?"

I just got the official diagnosis today...,12,m0ut1d,7,"My therapist went through every criteria in the DSM-5 with me, and I met almost all of them.

Identifying triggers,1,m0rci1,0,"Hey all, I've been in therapy for coming up on a year now and for the most part I've been doing better. However, I still have times where I completely back slide and am having a lot of trouble identifying why. I wanted to ask if anyone has any good apps or just ideas to help keep track of triggers? I know it's not a linear process but sometimes I end up just completely exhausted for days, after having so much good progress it's disheartening to not know what happened.

If it helps, for me these back slides are like... A complete reversal for me. I dissociate badly and without noticing, I start questioning everything about myself, and I'm so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open for more than a few hours at a time or focus on anything. My medications do help in the sense that I don't feel utterly hopeless like before but the physical sensations are still there."

Are there any free online therapy resources for PTSD? (Canada),1,m0nk7n,0,"I'm in a sticky situation Reddit I desperately need your help

&#x200B;

5 months ago my friend (14F) was raped and sexually assaulted by her abusive boyfriend of 2 years. Her parents are unsupportive of her situation and she suffers from severe PTSD, with hallucinations, nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, etc. 

&#x200B;

She desperately needs a therapist or professional or any outside help of any kind, but without the support of her parents, finding any resource that allows her to get professional help without a cost or parental consent is extremely slim to none. Is there any therapy resource I can forward to her that will help a minor without parental consent for free? I know that's a lot but this is my last hope considering I'm asking this on reddit. The option of asking her parents are out of the question and recovering without any treatment is also impossible. 

&#x200B;

A resource that can operate over live chat and in Canada is the most preferred option. She cannot see anyone in person because of her parents.

Immediately after I had left the scene i sat in my car with another officer and we did our best to rationalize everything. We told ourselves we did everything we could and we gave him at least a fighting chance. I couldn't sleep for the next two days. Every time i took a shower i took the opportunity to cry and I did this for about a week. After that I seemed to have pushed it to the corners of my mind. 

From that point on I began to get nervous every shift that I would have to respond to a similar call..i became increasingly more hot tempered towards any case that involved a child and found that I began to fight urges of physically assaulting these people who were involved with crimes against children... I soon told my wife that I needed to move back to our home state and I ended up leaving police work..... I work in law enforcement now but in a different capacity. Let me be clear I've never acted on those violent urges..

I didn't realize I had ptsd until while working my new job I had to deal with someone convicted of murdering a child. once i read the case something triggered...I started sweating...i became angry and sad at the same time ..in my head I ended up back in that living room with the dying child.. the rest of that work day I was in a total disconnect I felt very heavy and sat in my office and cried....since that day as an officer I've never had a full night of sleep..id have nightmares ..so vivid I felt like I could smell the scene I've never forgot that boys face...

fast forward again

I have a one year old son now...and i felt like it was time to start facing my demons so that I dont short change my son from having a full intact father. 

i sat down with my wife after 4 years and told her the story in full detail...why i don't sleep......why some days i seem to be aggravated or just irritated ..why I don't trust people ..nor care to be around them. the days i seemed to have sat in my own thoughts and just lay in bed...once she heard everything she cried.... She cried for me...for what I had to go through and what ive bottled up for years ..

it sounds cliché to say but if you have never worked law enforcement. .you may not truly know what we deal with and how we have to go from a traffic accident with serious injury or death ...to pulling someone over for speeding and wonder why seem a little annoyed or ""mean""

and talking to the doctors that departments refer you too is kind of a sign of weakness. That mentality does still exist.. 

I have friends who are police officers and I keep intouch with them and find it easier to talk to them about it when i do need to talk about it..I've seemed to be more open to it now after I opened up to my wife.. I feel different.. i still have days where something will trigger it and Ill either start to become sad or angry...but I found that when I do I reach out to my wife and tell her ..and she has always been good at keeping me in check...

for once in my life I feel like I have a somewhat good grip on things ..  I feel like Ive started to become normal again...

I still get the feeling that I'm crazy for feeling this way and that I should be better by now and it shouldn't effect me any more.. and sometimes when I talk about it to my wife...i feel embarrassed .. IDK just an additional thought"
Memory loss,120,m0l81m,32,Anyone else struggle with memory loss/amnesia due to PTSD? There’s like 5 months of my life that I feel like were stolen from me after my assault. I just feel so alone. It also continues to affect my school and work and I feel like they don’t understand at all.
Hyper-Vigilance,15,m0kj7k,12,Does anyone have any tips on how to relieve their hyper-vigilance? I’m scared people are gonna eventually think I’m just faking it or I’m just being overly dramatic. I legit had to install a flashing light doorbell that I silence in to my home office because it gets so bad.
UK based organisations who support ex military people with PTSD (with varying degrees of success),2,m0jn9g,0,"
I was telling my friend recently about my 2 year (2016 - 2018) struggle to get support, for Post Traumatic Stress, after being deployed with the military, a few years working in various Conflict Affected areas, and a pretty robust involuntary coffee meeting, with some dudes from Russian Federation Military Intelligence.
Its mainly UK focused, as that is where my experience lies, but the guy I was sharing on behalf of is in the United States. So, its pitched in that direction.
I will copy the text below, hoping that it might be useful for someone. It is only based on my experience, so I cant speak for others who might have had more positive or negative experiences with the same or other organisations.

Please feel free to forward and share, as you wish. Some information about Combat Stress, the UK’s leading charity for veterans’ mental health. For over a century, they have helped former servicemen and women with mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. Today they provide specialist treatment and support for veterans from every service and conflict, focusing on those with complex mental health issues.
The work they do is life-changing and often life-saving. No one else does what they do.
Their unique services
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for their specialist services remains critical.
Although their clinical staff are unable to meet veterans in person, they have adapted and enhanced their phone and digital services to provide 1-1 therapy sessions, introduced a range of online resources on their website and offered access to their online peer support community.
They are taking new referrals in Scotland and Northern Ireland, after a temporary pause while they reconfigured, they are beginning to take on small numbers of new referrals in England and Wales until they are able to take more.
Their 24-hour Helpline 0800 138 1619 remains available to all veterans and their families for confidential mental health advice and support.
Demand remains constant
Since 1919 they have provided support to veterans from every Service and every conflict. Their support is vital to those who turn to them at their darkest hour. For many, this is years after leaving the Armed Forces – on average, it takes a veteran 13 years to ask for their help after leaving Service.
Their website is https://combatstress.org.uk

Organisations that I have found are also useful in the UK are Horseback UK which take wounded servicemen and women and introduce them to horses. Through working with the horses amongst a like-minded group, service personnel who have been mentally and physically scarred regain their confidence, dignity and especially in the case of amputees, mobility.
The relationship with the horses and the environment in which this was established is where magic happens.
Those who have completed the program return to assist in the delivery of other courses offering their support and experiences. Horseback UK are amazing at what they do, and the staff empathise, and care about their work and their horses. It is a life saving, and incredibly powerful program.

Royal British Legion and SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity (Soldiers Sailors and Airmen's Institute) which provided me with quite a bit of funding for art, paints and canvases and eventually for a laptop computer. Although, they are very bureaucratic and slow, and not particularly compassionate or understanding. They are huge corporate bureaucracies now, and I feel I have lost sight of what they were established to do in the first place. But with some quite comprehensive assistance from other organisations, it is possible to get something useful rom then eventually.

Phoenix House Recovery Centre in Catterick Garrison, in the North of England is a beautiful recovery centre, where staff spend lots of time fundraising, engaging with donors and the media. They do however have a lovely centre, which when ex military people finally get in there, they do offer sports programs, yoga, reiki, resettlement courses, wood work and lots of other things which are really helpful.

If you are lucky, as I was. It might be possible to find one person who will connect with you and will actually be able to work with you to take things forward in a positive direction. PTSD Resolution is a charity that helps Veterans, Reservists and Families who are struggling to reintegrate into a normal work & family life because of trauma suffered during service in the armed forces. The programme is community-based, with treatment and support provided locally through a nationwide network of 200 therapists, accredited by the Professional Standards Authority. PTSD Resolution helps Veterans and Reservists to resolve the mental health problems associated with military trauma that obstruct a normal range of family and work relationships. They have provided me with some great, Rewind Therapy, which is a kind of non-intrusive, safe and highly effective psychological method for detraumatising people, which can also be used for removing phobias. It is carried out by an experienced practitioner and is only performed once a person is in a state of deep relaxation.

Veterans for Peace are a peace activist organisation, although not an organisation that provides direct or charitable support to ex military people. What they do is offer a structure and organisation that is very familiar, and provide a supportive framework of people who are dedicated to sharing information about the futility of conflict and war, and working to oppose and hopefully stop it in the future. They were established in the USA and have many chapters there. I have met some amazing men and women there, and they are all very personable, intelligent and like minded. Veterans for Peace in the UK https://vfpuk.org/
Veterans For Peace is a global organization of Military Veterans and allies whose collective efforts are to build a culture of peace by using our experiences and lifting our voices. We inform the public of the true causes of war and the enormous costs of wars, with an obligation to heal the wounds of wars. Our network is comprised of over 140 chapters worldwide whose work includes: educating the public, advocating for a dismantling of the war economy, providing services that assist veterans and victims of war, and most significantly, working to end all wars.

Other organisations in the UK are Veterans UK which are almost (in my opinion) a complete waste of time and money, https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterans-uk
They do nothing much other than take their time to ""assist"" people to get pitiful government unemployment benefit, which is fundamentally useless for getting anywhere useful.

Forward Assist https://www.forward-assist.com/ No idea what they do in reality, beyond fund raise for themselves.
The Beacon, in Catterick Garrison, which offers supported housing to single veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and who have support needs. This is probably one of the most hostile, and dangerous environments I have ever been in, in my life. I include, Baghdad, Kabul, Mogadishu, Donetsk, Benghazi, Malakal, Sofia, Ulan Bator and Blackpool in that list.
People are lucky if they emerge from this place alive and in one piece and have to work quite hard themselves to do so, as the staff, beyond chatting, don't do very much to assist, as their hands are tied, and they are run down and burnt out by being surrounded by miserable people all the time. There are some amazing staff there, who do care, and try their hardest to help people out, however they can. Although its easy for people to slip through the gaps, and end up dead, in prison or just completely lost in drugs, alcohol or the toxic relationships which abound in the place. https://www.riverside.org.uk/in-your-neighbourhood/north-yorkshire/care-and-support/the_beacon/
ABF The Soldiers’ Charity say they are the national charity of the British Army, providing a lifetime of support to soldiers, veterans and their families when they are in need.In my experience, I have no idea what they do besides pass people on to the next charity in the chain who passes people on in turn. https://soldierscharity.org/
There we go. Not sure how useful that is, particularly for someone in the United States, but I am happy to provide more information, or answer any questions as they come up.
I will just add, that Veterans with Dogs say that they train and provide assistance dogs exclusively for current and former members of the British Armed Forces with service-related mental health conditions. They also claim that they specialise in providing trained assistance dogs for Veterans with mental health difficulties. With their goal is to improve quality of life and help lead independent lives by training assistance dogs in task-specific skills. All of my experience with them has been fundamentally miserable. They seem to not really have a clue of how to communicate or deal with people at all. Let alone people with mental health challenges.
No idea how or even if it possible to get a dog from them. I was Infantry, deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and I don't seem to fit their criteria. I suppose if you are very much a whore for the media, or raise them thousands perhaps then they will pay attention. No idea really. https://veteranswithdogs.uk/


Also, not a military charity per se, but Hostage UK now Hostage International
Who say that since Hostage UK’s inception in 2004, the charity has always supported families regardless of their nationality or location. Families across the world have lent on them for direct support and that they have worked with organisations in many countries to help them improve the support they give to families during a kidnap crisis.
My experience with these clowns, is that they are an absolute scam.
I contacted them in frustration and desperation, and they listened intently and made sure to take note of all off the gory, and most noteworthy details. Then their ""support"" was to try to help to get me on government benefits and write a letter to my doctor saying, they should help out. (Two completely pointless things in my experience).
I saw them at a conference a few years later, gushing about all the amazing things that they do. I challenged them privately, on how fundamentally useless and misrepresentative they are. They claimed I was an anomaly, and had somehow slipped through the gaps. I gave them my card and said they could contact me if they could offer any tangible support. But never heard back.

Hope this might be useful to someone.

"to articulately title the scrambled soup my ADHD brain typed out is too hard so i just wont, and the post flair doesnt fit so well either.",3,m0isc8,0,"well we're off to a good start here. i made the title and these two sentences *after* i typed out the rest of this. something ive noticed is that when ive laughingly remarked ""i hav absolutely no idea how i exist"" others do not find this funny or really understand what i mean lmao. like, the best way i can i explain it is ""I, person that i am, composed of the experiences I've experienced, have been put in charge of myself, and somehow, *somehow* i am here, scratching my head going what?"" its funny to me. im not gonna say that it was altogether *necessary* or in someway righteously destined that i experienced this absolute clusterfuck of mental health becoming absolute shite, but at the end of the day im jus glad to still be puttin one foot in front of the other and makin progress everyday. i think its an attitude that naturally developes over time, even if you dont conciously seek out positive thinkkng or mantras, i think eventually after breaking down enough you are just so easily truthfully grateful for the little crumbs of stability+goodness that you gradually begin to amass. didnt intend to ramble about all this but whatever. love to all, hope anyone whos strugglin today remembers that theyve prolly been through worse and if not- then theyve previously been through things that took the cake for worst shit ever and still got through that so idk keep on keepin on. peace n love"
PTSD and weed?,6,m0i7rh,10,"Ok. So my husband smokes alot. 3 times he has pressured me into trying something whether its smoking or an edible. The thing is each time it has been an AWFUL experience. I get bad flashbacks that happen so frequently I feel like I'm lost in time I don't know when or where I'm at, I dont know who I'm with, and I don't know what's real. Which leads to me freaking out. Has this happened to anyone else who wanted to try weed or an edible because they heard it helped with ptsd? Or am I just weird. I know ptsd changes the human brain, and weed affects the parts of the brain that is changed/traumatized by ptsd. Idk. what gives? Why does it have such an awful effect on me while others get all happy and calm?"
My abuser considers herself the victim.,9,m0fzws,10,"TW: grooming, spirituality 

My abuser, who went on to groom an entire community online, somehow considers herself the victim of narcissistic abuse. It’s maddening, considering how much time she spent gaslighting and harming the community that we were both in. She claimed to be dating a ghost and would use that to spread false information about him on the web - information that presumably came from spiritual visions. 

I’m not here to bash on others’ beliefs, but this person was harmful. Made herself seem like the only pure person and would talk badly about literally everyone else. We did call her out publicly, but it took a lot to do so when all we wanted was peace. 

It’s maddening and literally spits in the faces of all of our experiences with her. She even accused me of things that I have evidence of her being guilty of. Of course, she never responded to the allegations - but she believes that she’s the victim in this scenario some how, when she’s stalked and harmed multiple people here. 

I’m very vocal about what I’ve gone through, for sure. But her silence speaks volumes. 

Have others experienced this?"
Coping with shame?,40,m0fql9,13,"Hi all, I recently started EMDR processing which has been intense but I feel like it will eventually be really helpful for me. One of the side effect though has been me realizing how hyper vigilant I have been constantly and how much the trauma (and person who caused it) have been affecting my life for the past two years. And I’m so embarrassed and ashamed by that, it’s frustrating. My therapist told me ‘don’t be embarrassed’ but I feel like that’s easier said than done. I just keep feeling like I must be a weak person to have allowed another person to have this much of an effect on me, without even causing me actual physical harm. Does anyone else feel this way, or have you? How do you deal with it? Some days it makes me want to quit EMDR, but I don’t think that would be good for me long term.

Thanks in advance!!! Love to you all."
I am unreliable,1,m0blnr,3,"I have PTSD, anxiety, depression, and insomnia. I   really can't make plans with another person. However, i did make plans for the weekend, that i failed to carry through. My ""friend"" blatantly told me i was unreliable and they were merely concerned with their own loneliness. They have never asked my ""mental illness"". Am i not a good person or do i need to drop this ""friend."""
I'm so close to practicing ineffective coping skills...,2,m0a5jf,0,"My ex (not the one that gave me PTSD) is constantly texting me and accusing me of cheating. Long story short and with details changed, I had to move back in with my parents and he told my mother about my therapy sessions and the trauma she caused. So, I guess you guys can kinda guess how it turned out... Emotional abuse, gaslighting, and bullying by mother for $500 Alex?

Because of him, she's constantly being mean to me and calling me names. She makes fun of me for getting into the abusive relationship that I was in and says that I don't really have PTSD, that I'm just ""lazy"", and ""manipulative"". She constantly screams at me about getting a job and it's annoying because I really am trying to overcome this and feel comfortable going outside, not to mention that I've been filling out applications and I'm constantly not hearing back from where I've applied. I've started tutoring again and she constantly messes with my appointments because it's ""not a real job"" or she's ""tired of me being in the house"". I hate her and I hate ex even more because she's even worse now knowing all of my therapy details. She throws my trauma in my face and blames me for it. All ex will ever say when I tell him (on the rare occasion I talk to him) that it's his fault her abuse got worse he says, ""I was trying to help"", ""I didn't think she was that bad"", ""she's your mom she loves you"", ""she wanted you back home, she loves you so much that she fought to have you back there."" It makes me so fucking angry!!

Fortunately, I'm currently dating a wonderful man who wants to move out west with me and is just all around awesome. He's the one great thing I look forward to every single day and he motivates me to get better, not only for him, but for myself. Unfortunately, it's going to probably be the end of the year when we can finally move out west and be together. We both want to save up for a nice home and also have an emergency fund. And that almost makes this situation worse because I want to be with him and finally in a caring, nurturing, stable environment with someone who actively listens to me and shows me that they care about my feelings. And it frustrates me that I have to grin and bear it for now!!

The silver lining to this situation is that I have him in my life to look forward to, he's supportive, emotionally present and he actually believes me when I tell him my mother is abusive. From what I've told him, he seems to know and accept the fact that she is as bad as I say she is. It's so validating to know that someone, *someone* finally sees past that whole ""she's your mother"" bullshit and sees her for who she is!!"
Can a hot bath cause you to have PVCS?,1,m0a5b4,2,"I have really severe ptsd and anxiety problems. It causes a lot of panic attacks but lately I haven’t had any attacks.

Looking for advice (UK),1,m06j1d,0,"Hi, just looking for some insight from others. 

The GP referred me to a charity as well as psychotherapist through NHS when I first reached out in August. 

The charity had a shorter waiting list than the second referral so I’ve been doing CBT therapy for about 6 weeks. My therapist the past couple of weeks has been advising me that although she can’t give me a diagnosis a lot of the issues we have been working through are PTSD. She is going to write a letter to me to give to my GP. 

I was just wondering is there any benefit to having an official diagnosis? (Medication or even just it being on file incase of future struggles)

I was struggling a lot again in December before the charity waiting list was over and contacted my GP who really weren’t helpful- told me to buy a colouring book etc. (I think maybe I didn’t explained myself really well). So I am just weary of dealing with them again as I left feeling really guilty and like a nuisance. 

Someone mentioned to me that it could affect my life insurance costs- does anyone have any experience with this?

Not sure if anyone has been through something similar. Any advice appreciated xx"
I fucking hate my job,60,m05cgn,8,"Got physically abused by my husband and left him.

Psychiatric crisis; can you voluntarily ask for sedation for hyperarousal?,9,m01e0q,4,"Because I worry that I may go inpatient today.    
I know they will recommend traditional psychiatric interventions that historically have been ineffective. I will become extremely agitated, impulsive, and such. Non-ideal.     

Can I ask them to sedate me in advance?  ~~What will they use?~~ apparently Midazolam, Ketamine, or Droperidol.  
Or do I have to throw shit first?"
Update to my earlier post,2,m01ao0,0,Ended up not going and binged kdramas instead
Cold Sweats and night terrors,2,m00iv6,3,"So I’ve taken to Reddit to share this and seek out some useful information.

 I don’t know if it’s ptsd but I can only assume it is. 

Back when I was young and dumb teen I tried my hand at selling weed. Nothing big, bought and sold about a OZ a day. Well the few times I did big sales I got robbed both times. With out going into the details, one time I was shot at (thankfully they missed) second time was just bum rushed with guns all in my face. 

At the time, I was pretty numb to the whole experience. I kinda expected it, given how I was trying to make my money. 
But now it’s been about 2-4 years since the events and for the past 6 months I’ve had weekly nightmares of me being robbed at work, being shot, being robbed in general, being out in positions of kill or be killed you name it and waking up drenched in sweat head to toe but freezing my ass off.. 

I suppose I’m more or less just curious if PTSD is the right rabbit hole to go down here in terms of seeking a resolution or if there’s something else I should be looking at.  TIYA to all of you here in the community."
Am I being manipulative or honest?,3,lzz09y,3,"TW mentions of sexual abuse

Returning to school,1,lzwhdm,1,"Tomorrow I will be returning to school after our lockdown in UK...i am terrified. I have a year left and I don’t know if i can do it. The one teacher I trust and rely on for support won’t be there as she is shielding. My trauma all started at school and it took me ages to get back after it happened, I still trust none of the staff. I have a great friend group, I just wish teachers would take into account my problems. We have to wear masks in class too which is gonna be awful for my panic attacks.

"i don’t know if this is the right sub, cw for alcohol mention",3,lzwc4p,0,"i experience the same memory, the same experience over and over again. i relive it constantly. i analyse everything to the point where it stops making sense. i am in a permanent sense of self-doubt and sadness. sometimes i will find occasional joy in mundane things - booze, food, music, television - but they are short-lived. 

the worst thing is, is that the event feels so hard to describe to people and feels shameful because it was executed in such an overblown way, i am ashamed of my responses and the fact that it could be perceived as something to laugh at. when in reality the event was so much more complex than one or two components. it was so convoluted and restless that it’s easy to get lost in it, entwined, enraptured in this solid state of numbness and internal agonising.

i feel like i am at fault. i feel like i am to blame, that i have dug my own hole and misread everything, that i deserved the eventual outcome and that i handled it badly. my partner reassures me that i didn’t. it is stressful to him, and in turn stressful to me. it is triggering to us both.

so many people have either brushed it off as a misunderstanding. they see it as an online fight. they see it as four days of “drama”. it wasn’t. it ruined my life. and my heart is pounding with fear as i write this, fearful of the masses of invalidation i anticipate from the possibility of confiding to someone about it.

it wasn’t just four days. it went well beyond four days.

fuck. i’m so sorry. i don’t know what to do. what else is there to say."

Meaning, *make me think I'm like him when clearly I'm not.* But it's still incredibly distressing and it shoots my mood so far down, it's **painful**. My partner reassured me that I didn't do anything wrong. They and I make it very black-and-white when we initiate and leave no gray areas but of course this shit will happen in my head regardless.  


How common is this? I tried searching online for answers but I find nothing. I just want to make this stop somehow..."
How long can someone suppress trauma and just hide it away?,2,lzmt8v,5,"For example: 

Lets say someone has a trauma incident like losing a parent, they never want to talk about it but also bury it away and any fragment or memory of it they try to remove.

My girlfriend lost her father, she desperately and almost immediately tried to remove every remnant of him from her life. Not because of negativity but because she just didn't want to be sad with reminders of her father dying.

I just think its severely unhealthy and wish I could share that with her.

But based on my question, how long can someone hide their trauma? Can they live their life and never face it? 

She doesn't even want to talk to her brother because he looks like her father and reminds her of her father. Its like she wants to disconnect from reality and live in this world as though her father is out of sight out of mind and not face the trauma.

Will this or any other related trauma last forever?

Is there anything I can do?

It scares me also that she did this, because now I feel like if anything happens with us in anyway, she will remove me and it will be out of sight out of mind with me. 

Whats your take?"
Does disassociation ever stop?,13,lzlv04,5,"My ex girlfriend went through having an abortion 7 months ago.

Since then I have tried asking her to go to therapy together to unpack it and talk about it. Her reasonings were due to covid and our lack of jobs, and her fear of her disapproving parents.

She shuts down the conversation pretty quickly and then moves on. She normally would never do this.

Further she hates talking about it altogether and thus I had stopped asking.

She had been binge watching tv shows and movies and focusing on her health which is great yes, but its as if she was not at all thinking about it and that is understandable but I just feel like sweeping things under a rug and disassociating are more damaging.

Out of nowhere 7 months post abortion, she told me she associates me to the abortion and thus she couldn't be with me any longer. Again disassociating from her trauma.

Finally its been 6 months post breakup and I ran into her sister at a grocery store. After catching up, I asked her about her sister. And she said ""Funny you ask, we talked the other day about you. I asked her what's he been up to. And unfortunately she said that she hasn't thought about you, searched you, or any of that.""

This killed to hear because we had a long relationship and I thought I was special to her in some way despite breaking up.

I felt like she was trying to disassociate me from her mind and life, sweeping me under that big rug of hers and not thinking about me.

Does disassociation ever catch up to someone and then they need to handle all those things they have pushed down?

Would she ever stop disassociating me do you think? 

Can disassociation last a lifetime?

I would love to be friends just like we were before dating... but yah she doesnt want me around due to the connection, and seemingly she doesnt want me in her head either."

CBT therapy techniques,35,lzl0q0,6,"Saw another post sharing tips for those who can't afford therapy. Here are some tips from my cognitive behavioral sessions. 
1) If you're having intrusive thoughts, write every detail about the thought in a notebook. Write about the event over and over again daily in said notebook. Even if you can't remember much at first, write down what you can remember. The key is that you must be consistent and write daily. This is exposure therapy. My psychologist explained it like this ""you keep playing a scary movie in your head over and over, but you look away from the scary parts. If you watch the scary parts, you wont be scared anymore because you know what's going to happen""

2) if you keep having nightmares and wake up from them, don't fall back to sleep trying to think of something else. Go back to sleep, but change the ending of the dream so that you're more in control. For example, I would have nightmares about my ex breaking into my house again to harm me. I fell back to sleep and changed the ending to my dream. Instead of my dream finishing with my ex harming me, I finished with me successfully overpowering him and throwing him out. 

3) if you constantly have negative thoughts, write down the negative thought, then write down solutions/explanations to the negative thought. 
-""I heard a noise, someone must be breaking in again--the noise is most likely someone using the bathroom, the noise could've been my pet walking around""
-""the restraining order is almost up, hes going to harm me again---its been 2 years and I'm still safe, I can ask for another order,""

These are some techniques they would possibly use in cbt therapy, I hope this helps!"
Gasping after flashbacks,4,lzkp3l,5,Ive been having this issue where i will get locked up in a flashback and then as it wears off i end having this really dramatic reaction of gasping for air. Theres no reason for it that i can tell so its just kinda embarrassing.  Is this a thing thats common ?
PTSD getting in the way of being able to hold a job,14,lzknc0,10,"I because of PTSD I don't know that I can hold a job at this point in my life. In 2016-19 had a series of violent, very serious workplace related situations that ultimately exacerbated my PTSD issues. 

Now I struggle to feel safe on the job, deal with pressures in the office, I struggle to maintain good sleep and not be dangerously sleep deprived when on a rigid work schedule, and I struggle to hide my struggles from bosses and coworkers. It's all  too much to handle day in and day out, indefinitely. 

I keep burning out of jobs and getting bullied by coworkers and eventually forced to find new work. ADA is a joke and just makes the situation worse. I've tried to get professional help but so far all I've gotten is invalidated, labeled, and told to take some deep breathes. 

With the pandemic I've been unemployed for about a year now, and I struggle to see myself ever being able to hold a regular job and not end up worn down and burned out after a month or two. 

After many months of waiting I was connected with a case manager, but they quit their job before my first session, and I ended up disconnected services. 

I am 100% reliant on government help and struggle to pay my bills. I feel very hopeless about it, and don't see myself as having much of a future if I can't support myself. I'm really frightened and lost about this and not a single person in my life understands or has any sympathy for me. It's all ""pull yourself up by your boot straps...""

I have been white-knuckling it through work situations for years and I just don't think I can put myself through a life where every single day I have to but all my energy into pretending to be okay and ""normal"" for people while also coping with a lack of sleep and constant work-related stress. 

Has anyone else faced this kind of situation? I'm totally at a loss. My life is completely stagnated and I'm not sure what kind of future a person struggling as hard as I am can even have."
I don’t think I want to get better.,3,lzkjuf,1,"I know how bad it sounds, but hear me out. I went through some major trauma when I was 13 years old. I didn’t have ANY support system to help me after the fact, not even my own family, who would belittle me and betray my trust. I was a child who was suffering immensely behind closed doors. For years after, I experienced intense PTSD symptoms that I had to cope with entirely on my own. I had to learn the hard way that nobody was gonna come and save me. There was never anyone there to calm me down after a nightmare. Never anyone to bring me back to reality. Never anyone to validate my trauma and tell me it was gonna be alright. Absolutely no one. I honestly don’t know how I survived without ending it. Because I was alone through all of this, I’ve developed intense hyper-independence and insist on coping with everything myself. It’s just how I’ve had to live.

I got a therapist for the first time this year and was officially diagnosed with PTSD. This week will be my first session of EMDR. Even though healing seems like such an amazing thing, and I would give anything for a bit of relief in difficult moments, a big part of me doesn’t want to get better until someone finally sees me. Deep down, I want someone to recognize how hurt I am. I want someone to help me through a flashback or a panic attack. I want someone to care for me on bad days. I want someone to vent about my trauma to. I want someone to hug me and tell me it will be okay. Though I push it away, I want it more than anything. And I don’t want to get better until I know what it’s like to be supported and loved, something I haven’t experienced since I was 13 years old. Maybe this all sounds stupid. I shouldn’t expect to be saved, I know. But I’m conflicted about healing because if I’m not broken, there’s nothing to be fixed. There’s no reason for someone to comfort and care for me. There’s no need for someone to help me when I’m hurting. I don’t want to get better because it defeats any chance of finally feeling supported. Am I entitled for thinking this? Maybe. Honestly, the child in me just wants to be loved. All she wants is a chance to be vulnerable and let her guard down. And even though she‘s terrified to open up, she’s tired of doing this on her own. That’s why I don’t want to get better. I’d rather suffer for a million years if it means I might finally be seen."
The Beirut Port Explosion,15,lzkh2h,4,"This has been bugging me ever since it happened, and Im only now ever really talking about it.

On August 4th , 2020, the port in my city blew up with 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate in the warehouse, most of the city was badly damaged. I live about 3km ( 2 miles) away from the blast.
Nothing happened to me or my family, since they were all out of town,and it was just me in the city that day.
Initially the warehouse was on fire prior to the blast and I didnt think anything of it really, thought it was just like any other fire, about tobe put out.
So I just went about my day , but around 6:08 pm I felt the ground below me shake violently, so I looked out the window and I saw the clouds moving irregularly, I had experienced a blast/ explosion before so I knew the tell tale signs of it,so I immediately yanked my window open and ducked for cover, then the shockwave hit,  mind you this all happened in mere seconds if not split seconds, then stuff from my room was flung around, glass windows around my house shattered. First thing I did was put my shoes on to walk around ,since there was glass all over the floor, and I rushed to fill a backpack with essentials to leave the city.  first thing that came to mind was that this was an Israeli airstrike and we should be expecting another very shortly. Then my family called and I told them I was fine. Next thing I did was walk down to the streets, everything is destroyed , glass everywhere,a large smoke cloud in the sky,people running around with blood all over their face, I can hear people crying from their apartment buildings. And I still have no idea what happened,in my head Im still waiting for the second strike to happen.then military planes and helicopters were out to take recon pics to assess the situation, but everytime I heard them Id get that fight or flight response and then it would take me a while to settle down again. I later learned that I had lost two of my friends in the blast since they live in an area exposed to the port directly .Its been 7 months and I occasionally get nightmares where  Im in different places living out the same scenario, Im always jittery and uneasy towards any sound I hear which is remotely similar to a jet or  an explosion. And Ive been having a feeling of ( this might sound silly to most of you) an impending nuclear attack thats about to take place. 
I havent spoken to anyone about this, not even my closest friends and family.  

Im sorry for any spelling errors, or grammatical mistakes and formatting."
Feeling more and more alone,1,lzj7qk,0,"I suffer from PTSD and lately my symptoms have worsened, forgetting to eat/no appetite , short term memory issue, sleep disruption you get it. 
I had an argument with the only person who remotely cares about what’s happening to me and now I’ve been told that I missed a package and why didn’t I inform them right away. Frankly I forgot, that what happens when you spend most days completely solitary. 

And now (even in anger), I was told ‘ why didn’t you say anything within 24 hours instead of talking about meaningless shit’.  Apparently asking someone how they are, how their day went and anything else I can remember that needs taking care of is ‘meaningless’. I already struggle with imposter syndrome, I last east have trust issues to at run so deep I expect people to hurt me and abuse my trust the moment I meet them. And anytime their kind I only see it as a facade and not genuine. 

It’s was stupid and trivial, more and more I feel like I have less and less of a support structure and feel more like people hate me and what I have to say really doesn’t matter to those around me. And it was uncalled for to be spoken to that way. And it only makes me feel worse about myself and it just makes me want to withdraw more and more to complete isolation. I’m so fucking tired of the very few around me marking me feel less than. I really am and there’s no way to change it. I’m stuck here right now with all this anger and nowhere to put it.

Does activity taking place behind your back trigger you?,100,lzh799,32,"My boss triggers me at work. In the office, there is a narrow walking space behind our desks. And my boss will pace back and forth right there. Whenever he does, I can hear his footsteps right behind me, over and over, back and forth, back and forth. \*clop, clop, clop, clop, clop....clop, clop, clop, clop, clop....clop, clop, clop, clop, clop\* And every time he passes I can feel the air rush past me. And it just...drives me crazy. I have to resist the urge to turn around and ask him: ""Can you go do that somewhere else please?"" 

I swear it just drives me nuts. I'm hesitant to say anything because it's my boss, and I know he's not intentionally trying to trigger me. I think I'm going to start doing my work somewhere else besides at my desk if I can. I'm sorry I'm not trying to complain, but I wanted to vent and share this, and wondered if anyone else has this issue?"

Night Terrors Wake Up Panic Attacks and Sleep Paralysis,2,lzgeb0,1,"I recently experienced a sleep paralysis episode. It was a short moment but I could not open my eyes.  I have a history now with night terrors since childhood. I have extremely vivid dreams that are often sexually based, pedophilic, violent, kidnap themed, and infidelity. Starting around 6-7 years ago I began waking up with panic attacks.  My heart rate is incredibly fast I get vertigo short breath terror and often vomiting follows. It has become daily at times throughout the years even in peaceful periods of my life.  My night terrors have the ability to cause me to violently fight in my sleep and often I wake up from sleep crying loud enough to wake my husband.  I am not sure if this is a familiar experience with PTSD. I have seem many therapists but have never told them all these episodes. My concern is they are increasing in severity and I have little compassion getting my peer circle to understand it's crippling affect it's begun to have on me. I start every morning like this,  it's never a good day.  I notice however with more sleep I don't suffer the attacks as often,  and wonder if all.these other physical affects can realky be due to lack of sleep? Please share if you've had similar night symptoms."
I need to get this out.,3,lza8dy,2,"I keep on having night terrors about what caused my ptsd. The more stressed out I am, the more frequent they are. 

When I was 6 years old my uncle was shitfaced drunk and came over to our house with his son. He was a severe alcoholic so this was normal. But I did something that I can’t remember that triggered him. He grabbed me by the throat, dragged me across the room to the front door and choke slammed me against the front door and was strangling me to death when what seemed like forever my dad came up and obviously flipped the fuck out and got into a fight with him. My dad kicked him out. He then decided to go to his house and broke in and really fucking went after him. 

I always played by myself no was never social as a kid, it was even worse after this, it magnified my issues. Then comes the bullying for me not talking to people and my life went downhill from there. 

Well even as an adult I still have this night terror/dream/sleep paralysis that happens all of the time. I wake up screaming to the point where my neighbors have noticed. I wake up only halfway, to the point where I can hear my tv and people walking down the hallway but I can’t open my eyes or move. I then feel a body either jump on me or spoon up against my back, and the hands go around my throat and I’m being strangled all over again. I can feel everything physically as if someone broke into my apartment and is actually doing it. It’s fucking terrifying. I never see the person though, it’s just physical feelings. I hate it. 

Anyways, just had to get that out. I’m addressing it with my therapist next week."
I guess I’m the worst daughter (Family Trauma/ Sexual Assault Trauma),5,lz821i,0,"I grew up with so much family trauma, parents divorcing at the age of 5, witnessing so many family deaths, and my mother not talking about any of it or helping me understand. 

My older sister ruined my life because of her actions, she took my childhood, and teenage years in high school from me. My sister got involved with abusive men with records, each one more worse than the last, and had children by them, but kept getting her kids taken away, and put in my mothers custody, due to the men she would bring around. One man laid hands on my nephew, had my other nephew pass from SIDS, had another kid with my sister/ named him the (IV) after the son that passed, and another man killed my niece by punching her resulting in brain dead. 

I didn’t know how to process all of this trauma from the age of 7 to 23. I had to watch my nephews all the time, didn’t really have friends until high school, and was taught to suppress and not talk about my problems/ put everyone else first. I’m 23 now, but honestly my mother hasn’t felt like my mother since I was 7. My mother was always at work, real father all the way in Another state, siblings weren’t close to me at all, I was alone all the time in my room depressed/ very suicidal, stressed out at a young age always having to take care of my nephews feeling like a “Second Mom” , and not knowing how to process my emotions at appropriate times. No one came to my lacrosse games, always got picked up hella late like 3 hours passed the time I was supposed to be picked up or longer, she took my sisters or brothers out all the time, and even bought them groceries and was still there for them. 

I turned 18 and tried to admit myself to cry for help, my mother took me to her friend instead, and still felt suicidal afterwards. I got held down in the back of the bus Bc my friends cousin who I knew since 1st grade, wanted to grab my boobs under my bra randomly, and no one heard me screaming, this was my junior year of high school. 

I have been off my meds since December Bc after 2 years just felt numb, and my mother instead of putting me in the bigger room in the new house with a bathroom for privacy, put me upstairs with everyone else in my old bed set from 4th grade.... while everyone else got new furniture and new TVs. I just feel like my mother doesn’t care about me and I’ve tried to talk to her multiple times, even cried to her face that I would go to therapy and go on meds so that I could go to the bigger room and she didn’t listen. Honestly living in this room is my own hell, Bc I can’t suppress anymore memories, they’re all coming out, and at night it’s the worst. I know everyone’s suggestions is to just move out, but I’m honest to God trying, I was in my own sexually abusive relationships that even gave me financial trauma, and I’m trying to suck it up and pay everything off, so that I can honestly just leave this place and start a new life, Bc I’m trying so hard to not burn bridges, but everything is so hard, and I feel like I’m losing my damn mind."
"Does anyone look at their own posts from the immediate past and think ""Who the fuck wrote these things?""",108,lz4b0l,15,"I'm in a sober, clearheaded state atm and I struggle with cringing at some of the stuff I said in a bad way, the ""fuck, I sounded like an asshole"" way.
I was never an angry person and I'm dealing with the fact my head compartmentalized things in such a way that when I observe myself now as a whole, I feel like I should recognize better when I feel angry and I'm doing things defensively. I tend to be oblivious of my faults at those times.
But on the other hand, if I focus on my faults I have a hard time speaking for myself because my head is 100% focused on ""I fucked up"", I can't place what the other person's done in perspective. I give up too much on myself. 

How do you guys reconcile this? I'm aware it's because I'm very co-dependent. 
In my head I believe that in a bad interaction in a relationship one bad thing does not justify another, within reasonableness. We all have to see our part and pull our own weight, but I feel so two-sided when it comes to this. I keep having the urge to go to past me and tell him to look at what he's typing, and to check his emotional state before he says anything."
Question,0,lz24tc,2,"Idk if this is PTSD, upto 12 years old I didn't have any fear of  that's because I was playing out in the street we have a lot of stray dogs in our country so when I saw one I just looked at it and it just randomly growled at me and started chasing me I just ran as fast as I could ,I tripped and fell over on the ground the dog ran away it didn't bite me after that incident I am still scared of stray dogs to this day I am 17 now I used to fear all dogs but with help from my friends I am not afraid of house dogs but strays still scare me.
Can anyone tell me how to solve this."

Does anyone else feel guilty for speaking about the abuse they've experienced?,36,lyzfbm,12,I can't help but feel very guilty for talking the abuse I experienced growing up. I recently talked a little bit about my childhood with my therapist. I feel incredibly stupid for saying anything like I shouldn't speak about it. Even though it hurts. I hate feeling like this. It's like I feel guilty for even trying to heal. I feel like I deserve to live in pain and I hate that. It's like why do I even try to get better? No one understands what this is like.
To respond to Facebook triggers? (Rape & stalking trigger warning),2,lyy0u2,1,"Long-story-short, I was stalked by a guy I dated after I broke up with him because I walked in on him raping one of my best friends while she was unconscious (which brings the number of women who told me the same story about him to 5). He stalked me for 4 years until I finally went to our local police because he posted photos of his assault rifle collection with my name carved into one of them. Our local police had an amazing detective and I haven't heard from him since (even though they could do nothing with my second-hand account of the rapes)  :::knocking on wood anyways because being stalked is TERRIBLE:::

I'm rarely on Facebook these days (that's where he posted the photos and Facebook said that due to ""free speech"" they weren't a violation of their policies) and I've worked really hard to come so far with my treatment, but I just saw a Facebook ""friend's"" post about how ""no one should take anyone's guns away"" and I was going to reply to him, but then figured my response would be better here. Here's what I was going to say...

""It's so interesting to see these posts from someone who hasn't been stalked by a man who has raped 2 of her friends and has half a dozen assault rifles (and her name carved into one of them). 🤔
I guess I should feel comforted that I'm a better shot than him? 😉
Although, (our local law enforcement) obviously disagrees. 😉"" 

...I'm glad I didn't reply on Facebook and engage this obviously-irrational person with my PTSD and I know these flash-back-feelings and their tears will subside, but I needed to put it somewhere. 

I also got a ""friend request"" from one of the mutual friends between me and my stalker and I so badly wanted to say, ""When your request comes withoout an apology while you stay 'friends' with TWO people my ex raped I have NO interest in having contact with you,"" but, obviously, again, this wouldn't do any good against someone who told me I was ""over-reacting"" to the stalking, my stalker was ""harmless,"" and is STILL friends with the guy even though I think our mutual friends have told him the same thing they told me. 

If I didn't need to use Facebook for work I would be off it completely. Maybe I should keep my use only to work?

Can anyone relate? 😭"
EMDR struggles and Self Doubt,3,lyvn3d,0,"I just need to get all of this off my chest somewhere.

I'm having such a hard time in EMDR. I've done three sessions so far and still don't have a safe space in my head. I look back, and there has never been a place I feel safe and it's killing me. I struggle with PTSD related to a suicide of my closest friend a few years back and growing up with autism misdiagnosed as OCD. This is also bundled with severe anxiety and depression/suicidal thoughts daily, even with meds, since I was 5 or 6. All of my happy memories are stained with memories of yelling, fear, and screaming. Even my emotional support animal can trigger horrible fears of her dying and me feeling lost. I constantly feel like everyone I know will abandon or hurt me. I feel so trapped. My EMDR therapist told me I deserve to feel happy and I should love myself and I broke down right then and there. Everyone has said I love you to me, but who really means it? If people knew me, would they really love me? I mean, I'm 18 and already have gone through so much horrible stuff. I just feel so suffocated by my past that I barely can breathe, yet I can't see myself leaving. It's like my brain wants to stay hurting and suffering. Like it doesn't know anything else, and it rather stay with what it knows? I don't know. Does this stuff get better?"
Disconnecting,5,lyt1gx,3,"I’m having trouble staying connected and remembering things. I guess the way I deal with trauma is trying to forgot it immediately. 

The issue right now is that my dog died on the 3rd. As we walked out of the vet’s office, I started to forget. I barely cried. I comforted my partner more in the office. She was crying more than me, and she’s only known the dog a year. I’ve had my dog since she was 8 weeks old, she was nearly 6 when she died. 

I’m finding it hard to cry, and hard to connect to what happened. I really can’t connect to it as “real”. My brain is telling me it didn’t happen, or that it wasn’t real. Or that it didn’t happen to me. 

I’m not really sure how to process this in a healthy way."
I feel like just giving up and let my PTSD consume me.,12,lyshbs,9,"(Throwaway account I dont want my family to find this)

Ive been working hard and long on my PTSD and ive gotten a long way from where I was, but right im so close to just throw in the towel. I was re triggered a few months ago and ever since life has been a living hell again, but im always at good spirits working on myself and my triggers, but im tired now.

I work on myself every day, I have dealt with daily panic attacks, horrible sleep, not eating and just feeling numb for the last few months. And I did get to a comfy spot where I started getting in control again I was actually able to think ""well this aint that bad"". But then, my son was involved in an accident that resulted in 2 degree burns, having to hold down my screaming son while they treated him over and over again for 3 days has been absolutly horrible. While I was at the hospital I did not even want to be with him, it was like my mind shut off, I could not look at him because ""that is not my son"" but im a mother and that is my son, so I gave him all the love he needed even though I felt more like his aunt than his mother. 

I would have guessed that now thats hes healed I would be back at my good old ""thats my son I love him more than life"" but no, still I have distanced myself, ive had this problem before that when things get bad I dissociate myself,and I feel like a shit mother because I carried this tiny human for 9 months and have spent every hour with him since but still its him I dissociate from.
And to make things worse, his father who triggers my PTSD severly called me in for mediation, so I have to sit in a chair for 2 hours listening to him. And there is something in his voice that makes me want to crawl up into a hole and die, his body language and voice it seriously triggers me.

And that man has made life a living hell since I was pregnant, he promised me that he would be there but instead he left me and came back to make things hell.
I became a high risk pregnancy due to all the stress he put on me, at 20 weeks pregnant I almost lost my son because of him. And ive tried my very best to meet his demands but he is NEVER satisfied, all I do is wrong,all I say is wrong. I cant even express myself because I never know what he will use against me, the only reason he is going to mediation is to get a piece of paper so he can take me to court and im so afraid that court will give him custody and then my son will have to move away from me and if that happens ill take a cab to the nearest psych ward and admit myself.

Im seriously on my knees kissing this mans shoes trying to satisfy him, im giving him 110 % of me trying to make it all smooth and peaceful, and all im getting in return is anxiety because im seriously hating myself for letting this man stomp on me. I should have known that my PTSD would get to this point but I could not stop it.

Its currently 4 in the morning and this is the first time in 4 years I wake up in panic, I ended taking one of my ""in case of absolutely emergency take this"" pill, I never use medication but today I did.

Yaknow, im just in such a dark place now, I cant find the door that leads me out and I dont know what to do anymore. I just want to be happycakes again, I want to be able to eat and sleep, but right now that seems so far away.

If you read this rant, thank you sorry its messy."
Something weird happened. It saved my life.,211,lys8ua,56,"I was suicidal yesterday and actually planning on using my .357 to end it. My work environment is so negative and everyone hates me so much and they make it a point to let me know so often that I had literally lost the will to live.

But I went to a facility at work where I deliver to. Two nurses came up from the bottom floor and immediately asked me about my adoption tattoo. Then they immediately gave me a group hug. It was amazing. I haven’t felt physical affection in 13 years. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t even know them at all. I’ve never believed in god, but sometimes I wonder if we do have people looking out for us. It’s just such strange timing. Plus the topic was brought up in aa meeting tonight. So another coincidence. 

Just thought it was strange, but it saved my life. Maybe I can improve myself enough where people will give me a chance again."
I can’t seem to hold accountability without dissociating,14,lys3md,0,"I guess its generally just being called out I can’t handle. It’s not the fact that I don’t think I can be wrong or any real self-centeredness to it, but more of being blackmailed and threatened over the littles things in my past. If I didn’t do everything absolutly right I would be yelled at, spread misinformation about, and even beat. Being told nicely “oh can you please not do this?” is all I really can handle which is so scummy, people don’t owe me their politness for my wrong doings, and I wanna unlearn such defensive behavior but its so hard. I feel I just can’t see what I’m doing wrong most of the time because I’m always on autopilot mode and once something stops me and tells me that autopilot mode is wrong its... very hard to accept. I zone out and distance myself from others, I have anger issues and extreme anxiety, just loud noises can trigger me. I feel so out of body and in pain, I try so hard to teach myself, to listen to others... but I feel I’m getting no where right now, I do have the drive to be better, its just the acting to change is something I have a hard time doing. I never feel like its enough and I have 2 options to either submit, or completely bite back when neither is a good option."
Feeling weirdly at home after being triggered,10,lyruev,4,"It's similar to how being catastrophically depressed is ""comfortable"". Not in the sense that it's enjoyable or easy to bear, but... familiar. 

I know what to do in that space, how to take care of myself, and the like. And so I settle in and play Sims and avoid triggering material the best I can and just generally be kind to myself. And it's... odd.

I go to sleep and have unpleasant dreams, walk around with unbearable anxiety, both physical and mental, and just generally feel shitty, exhausted, and irritable. But it's familiar. Very familiar. And in that sense, it's almost predictable. Much more than when I haven't been triggered and am resting easy for the time being -- because at any moment, that could change. 

Does anyone else relate to this?"
Has anyone else experienced a change over time in their triggers/attacks?,3,lyru1b,2,"I'm going to try to keeps things general to avoid anything triggering, but I'm open to explaining more in DMs or comments if need be. Right now I'm in a good place so it's easy for me to be candid about my experiences. I was diagnosed with ptsd several years ago due to a violent physical assault. One of the side-effects of this was that coping mechanisms I had built up over my life to deal with extensive childhood abuse began to crumble. 

When I first started therapy, my strongest triggers were mental. Most often I'd catch myself feeling happy about something simple, like how nice the weekend had been going, and my brain would flip into panic mode. I'd be convinced something terrible was about to happen to me or my family. Part of that stemmed from my recent trauma, but part of it also stemmed from my childhood trauma (feeling like I didn't deserve anything good). 

Over the past year or so, as I've started working more on my childhood trauma, my mind has become more detached from my attacks, and the attacks themselves have become more physical. Things that set me off tend to be more physical as well. Those physical triggers are still a mix of recent and childhood trauma, just like my earlier mental ones were. 

On top of that there are constants like bouts of depression, long-lasting low-level anxiety, and intense nightmares. Not to mention that my brain will occasionally switch things up and toss me a panic attack like I described initially. It's like my brain constantly finds new ways to refuse to heal. So my question is: Has anyone else here gone through something like this? Where your triggers and attacks almost evolve as you go through treatment? Or am I just super lucky?"

Overwhelmed/Panicked at Work,3,lypl7h,4,"Hi all, basically I need advice on what to do about being overwhelmed at work. 

I previously applied for disability when I was diagnosed about 10 years ago. It was denied because I didn’t have enough work credits (I was in my early 20s). 

Since then, I finished college, and I’ve had two jobs. The first was a very low paying, low effort position that I could do from home, but it wasn’t enough money. It also was considered independent contractor work, so I don’t think that counted for work credits. 

I’ve been at my current job for almost two years - kinda. Due to the pandemic, I’ve been off work for nearly a year. I’ve still had to do some work from home because no one else at my job can do certain things but me (small company). 

During this year, I’ve realized how bad I was doing while I was going to work full time. During the time I worked there, my panic attacks came back with a vegetable and were worse than before. I had several at work. With that being said, I find that I am constantly in a state of stress and anxiety at work. I feel overwhelmed constantly. 

My boss called me today and said we should schedule a time to talk about me returning, and I am absolutely dreading it. I already feel like I’m drowning by the upcoming tasks he’s sent my way. Combine this with some other health concerns I have going on, and I don’t know how much more I can take.

I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do with all of this. I could go back to part time, but I can’t really afford to do that. Money would be tight at best. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Tl;dr I have to work but it’s becoming overwhelming and detrimental to my mental health."
Sertraline/Zoloft experiences?,1,lyocl9,5,"Hi, my doctor has prescribed me Sertraline aka Zoloft starting at 50mg moving up to 100. 

I've read the side effects and some studies discreditting ssri's and it's really making me apprehensive about taking it. 

Has anyone been prescribed this and willing to share their experience? Thanks"
How to seek help?,1,lynpyh,3," I suspect that I'm currently dealing with PTSD from a past relationship with my alcoholic ex girlfriend. It has been a year since I've spoken with her and two years since I've seen her, but a day doesn't go by without thinking about our two years together. I have intrusive thoughts, constant anger, and I always feel like something bad is going to happen. I feel as if I'm always waiting for when it's gunna hit the fan, if that makes sense. 

I was suggested by a nurse practitioner during an anxiety fueled doctor visit that I was exhibiting symptoms of PTSD, but was dismissed when I brought it up to another doctor and was told that he is ""not a counselor"". I'll be honest, I was greatly discouraged by this and think it was wrong of him to dismiss my concerns without letting me explain myself. But now I dont even know what to do. 

I'm getting really sick of this and every day is awful to some degree. I can't bring it up to any of my friends because it's become clear to me that they cannot understand what it was like to be in my situation, and also I do not wish to burden them anymore. I feel as if I've embarrassed myself enough. 

I know subs like this do not advocate for giving advice, so I'm not asking for any advice, but it would be helpful to hear some personal stories about how you chose to seek help, or how you found the courage to do so. 

To be clear. I do not claim to have PTSD. I do not want to self diagnose myself, but nothing else seems to make sense and I'm beginning to lose it over here."
Not able to do things I used to have no issue with,2,lynh6g,0,"Has anyone else had this happen? I had to take a hearing test today for work. I've done dozens of these, and never had an issue. But this was the first one since I started having symptoms of PTSD and as soon as the door closed I immediately felt that tightness in my chest and I'm barely holding on here. I've never had an issue with confined spaces before, but this time I just felt trapped even though there was a window right there. I think I'm just as surprised that I had a reaction as I am having a tough time."
Can ptsd cause anxiety/panic attacks in unrelated situations?,6,lym4kx,3,I don’t have nightmares about my traumatic incident or anything like that but everything that used to make me uncomfortable makes me 10x more uncomfortable after the incident. For example I hated awkward social situations but it was just uncomfortable and now they give me actual panic attacks. Just anything that made me feel uncomfortable is like amplified. And they are totally unrelated to my traumatic incident. Could this be caused by ptsd/traumatic incident or is it unrelated?
Repressed memories surfacing - can anybody tell me more?,5,lylsnj,3,"I would like to know more about the nature of repressed memories and how they surface when it comes to trauma.

I endured trauma as a child that I only knew about because my father told me when I was 12, out of spite for my mother. I knew that the trauma he described was significant, but for the life of me I couldn't remember anything about it. 

Now, the trauma he described is starting to come up in my mind more and more. I don't remember the event specifically, but I'm remembering feelings and events around it: for example, last night I remembered my dad and officers taking me on a tour of a police station, and the officers giving me a teddy bear. It clicked then that he was probably doing that to make me feel safe with police again. It feels like my mind is connecting all the dots, suddenly.

This is all very new and upsetting to me and I'm wondering if what I've described is normal for people starting to recall their trauma. The event in question happened when I was four so I don't know if I'll ever fully remember, but I'm hoping for some direction when it comes to what to do when things surface. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and therapist who are helping a lot, but I also just want to find a safe, supportive place to talk about this."
"First Post,. go easy on me",10,lylko1,5,"I just found this subreddit but I just have to share this with somebody. I just have to let somebody know. I have to.

Disclaimer, I do not plan on hurting myself or committing suicide. I just need to say this stuff.

The worst thing about the whole thing and the worst thing I swear wasn't getting hit or the physical violence. I never even got left a mark on myself. What bothered me the most is that my mother was the kindest nicest person. She was the kindest nicest person. She had been hit as a kid too. She knew how scary it was. And yet she hit me. She hit me and when I asked my siblings they said it never happened to them. It was just me. It was just me. I was such an unbearable kid that I drove my kind and caring mother to violence. That is how I thought of it. It was only me and it was my fault. And it wasn't even that bad, she never broke the skin or left marks and in many people's books that kind of thing is just normal discipline. I even grew up in a suburban household with food on the table and opportunities and education. But it stays with me. It stays with me all these years later. I was a terrible, violent, and awful kid. If it weren't for me, the family would have been so much better off. I don't know if that's true but it's what my brain keeps telling me. I just had to tell this to someone. I don't know if I'm screaming into the void or doing something inappropriate but for now I just gotta tell someone. I have to.

&#x200B;

Edit: I think it's important to mention that I have no PTSD diagnosis. I just need a place to say this. This is the place I found and this event is trauma. idk if that's okay or not. If there's some other place this should go I am sorry. "
Do you feel like your brain goes backwards?,2,lyle33,0,"I don't really know how to explain this, but when I'm going through something very stressful, my brain just completely goes back to who I was a few years ago. Like I'll wake up and expect to be met by the same friends I had 5 years ago, with the same interests and the same room and the same classmates. So when I realize things have changed, I'm confused. It feels like I'm stuck in someone else's life, because my brain thinks I'm still me from 5 years ago. When I'm reminded of what my life looks like now, I remember. But otherwise it's like I've completely gone back. Maybe it's a weird way of dissociating, I don't know. Do you relate?"
I want plastic surgery,8,lyklq6,0,"I won’t turn away advice but the jist of it is this. I absolutely despise my mom and one sister whom I kind of attribute a lot of the past issues to. 

I got crazy the other night and thought it’d be fun to animate old pictures of family with the MyHeritage website and ended up causing a neat catastrophic break down. 

I realized suddenly why I don’t like looking in the mirror. I look just like my mom and sisters. We all look like someone took a cheat sheet to a test and each person just changed one answer each and boom - 4 women that look like we all popped out the same mold. 

So, even though I’m no contact with my sisters and my mom is dead, I see them all the time in reflections. 

This morning, it occurred to me that I could get plastic surgery. Reshape my nose, cheeks, chin and forehead. Now I understand why I’m drawn to tattoos and body modification. I really am surprised I don’t have tattoos on my face to be honest. 

I don’t know if I’ll do this but I just wanted to vent, I guess."
I finally feel safe to share my story,85,lyjlep,12,"Warning: Some miscarriage stuff is graphic so please don't read if it is fresh with you.

This is somewhat long, so if no one reads it that's fine. I just want to say that I have reached a point in my life where PTSD no longer owns my life anymore. I think part of my PTSD wasn't just the actual incidents, but how people around me handled it. I couldn't discuss bits and pieces for a long time, and now I can. 

Step back a few years ago. It seems like yesterday, my timeline is blurry because unbeknownst to me, I smudged everything together. If you lose track of events because you're in a fog you'll understand the constant messing up dates and years. I used to ride motorcycles. A man made an illegal left turn into my bike. I broke 7 bones, including my pelvis (which will matter later). The first hospital not on my insurance but the closest was going to do surgery on my shattered left arm and pelvis as it was an open book fracture. When I was transferred to my HMO hospital they decided I didn't need it. As a result my left arm fused together incorrectly and I lost partial feeling in it. I was depressed in a wheelchair. They gave me two PT sessions. One was just sitting up in bed, one was transferring from my bed to the wheelchair. After that my insurance provider decided I was good. I had to figure out how to do everything else on my own. I was dating someone during this accident. During my depression I latched on to him. I was forming a horrible codependent relationship and didn't realize it. Because I couldn't have sex at first I told him we could open the relationship up. I would have done anything to keep him in it. My self esteem was blown. He started seeing someone else. Our rules were he had to use protection and remain emotionally monogamous with me. He agreed. 

Every week I couldn't work my boss would call me up and ask me if I was available to walk. They weren't wheelchair accessible. At this point I wasn't even wiping my own feces. Thank god for my sister. She lived in the apartment with me. She had never seen me naked and now she would have to wipe my butt. It was degrading. I couldn't work, but my boss's urgency that I come back to work made me worried she was going to fire me. I was determined to get an early release. I called an Uber. I waited 10 minutes for the Uber driver to come just to have her tell me she that my collapsible wheelchair didn't fit in her car. Next Uber driver with the same model car fit my wheelchair in without trouble. Again, feeling like I was a worthless burden on society. I went to the hospital to get my doctor to let me work early. He refused initially as it was clear I couldn't walk well if at any. In the following month I eventually managed to get a note sooner once I was able to walk in tiny bits with my cane. I was in bed for so long that I ran out of breath easily, and the pain walking was like a knife in my pelvis. But, I needed to pay rent so I went back to work. 

A few months out, my pelvis was still fractured, but healing, I stupidly started having sex again. I felt like I was losing him to the other woman. I hadn't got my period and my boyfriend suggested I couldn't get pregnant. He didn't want to use protection. Keep in mind we both were graduate students in biology-related fields but also we were both idiots. I have never had unprotected sex thus never having a serious pregnancy scare. I guess my mind set was I wanted to keep him and I could support a baby as I made decent money. Tbh I was so depressed I had no idea what I was doing.  He said he didn't want children unless it was with the right person. I didn't even love him. I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. Of course, as one might have guessed, I got pregnant almost right away. I bled heavily after testing positive. The initial doctor told me I miscarried but to come back in a few days to make sure my HCG levels went down. I went through that emotion. I was crying, and my boyfriend at the time was out in another country. I chose not to tell him until he came back because I stupidly didn't want to ruin his trip. I had to cry in silence. I went back to get my HCG tested and it doubled in two days. I was still pregnant. As it turns out, I had a condition with subchoronic bleeding. Having a still fractured pelvis and being pregnant led to a high risk pregnancy. I had to see a perinatologist. I couldn't have sex until the bleeding stops which was very seldom. Boyfriend had sex more and more at other woman's house. It did slow down when I hit my second trimester and that was the best I got. 

Cue back to boyfriend. I told him about the pregnancy and he wanted to know if I was getting an abortion. Children weren't in his future. Instead of asking me how I was etc, he kept talking about how stupid it was of him to have unprotected sex. He didn't care about the baby. I instantly fell in love with this baby. He grew, was healthy, and the NIPT test and 4D ultrasound showed him to be in good shape. Right after my 2nd trimester I felt pain in my vagina. I went to get tested but they didn't call me with any results so I assumed I was good. Later on I would find my white blood count was out of spec high, and no one contacted me. The doctor who was supposed to read that test and notify me stopped contact and put me in touch with his partner after what happened next. One morning I woke up and my water broke. I just knew what it was. I panicked and went to the ER. The baby was fine but the amniotic fluid was gone. They told me I had an infection that caused the sac to pop. I had to abort the baby or it could be deadly. I couldn't do it. I read about some mothers successfully delivering with low amniotic fluids and I was determined to keep him. My baby was the only thing keeping me going. 

I stayed in bed drinking lots of fluids and on antibiotics. I was still with my boyfriend but he was more often at the other woman's house at this point. He assured me she meant nothing more than sex to him. One night I was laying in bed and I just felt something shift. I could feel pressure on my vaginal canal. I actually didn't have contractions which would be ignored by the doctor and almost lead to a deadly outcome. I called my boyfriend to take me to the hospital. My sister does not have her driver's license because she's almost blind. He said he was getting high with said woman and asked if I could take an Uber. I was bleeding heavily at this time. I insisted and he finally came over. He brought me to the hospital. I wasn't far along enough for them to bring me to L&D. I had to at least be 22 weeks, so they made me push him out in the ER. He came out sleeping of course. I took pictures with my phone because he was perfect. I'm still working up to looking at these pictures, I put them on my google drive so I wouldn't see them. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to see him, and my boyfriend said those kind of things grossed him out. The nurse took my son and put him in a hazardous waste bag. That was the last time I ever saw him. Unfortunately, the placenta retained in my uterus. 

They did an emergency D&C to get the placenta out while I was under. During that time I bled out because I did not contract. They had to do two blood transfusions to keep me alive. The doctor would later tell me that I should have came in sooner to do the D&C (abortion) and this wouldn't have happened. He said he was close to performing a hysterectomy. I have no children, nor had no children other than the son I had just lost. That would have been devastating. While I was recovering in the hospital bed, boyfriend came and visited me. He said he was sorry to see me suffering too much and decided the relationship was much more intense than he wanted. He didn't want children, and when I got pregnant that ruined the great relationship we used to have. 

I was desperate. I asked him what I could do to make him stay. He said he wanted to try swinging with people. He had already contacted a couple and they wanted to meet the following week. I wasn't supposed to have sex until after my doctor approved. I wanted so badly to keep my boyfriend that I did it. The 2nd day upon returning to work, my co-workers knowing what happened, greeted me by asking me what I would get for my baby shower since her friend is having one. I just broke down crying right there at work. Milk was coming in my breasts and they hurt. I remember my co-worker telling me not to cry because I could have another one. The other co-worker who was a mom said 'at least you didn't have to give birth to a full sized baby. Mine was painful.'

So what happened. I went a couple weeks like this and started drinking heavily, using pot. One day I woke up on a weekday when I should have been working and I just couldn't do it. I couldn't move out of bed. I called in sick that day. The next day and the next was the same. I called in sick over and over again. I couldn't get out of bed other than to get something to drink. A close friend of mine in the same state but another city contacted me. Thank god for her. She truly has saved me. She urged me to come stay with her. I stayed with her because I didn't see my life improving. She did meditations with me, and did some therapeutic  work that she was taught. We really spoke a lot about what I wanted to do. We did a proper ceremony for my son so I could get closure. I've been wanting to move out of CA, out of my crappy toxic job, and the boyfriend was a narcissist. I made a plan to pack up everything I could, my sister who lived with me would get the apartment (she could afford it by herself), and I would pursue a new life because I just wasn't happy anymore. 

The problem was I hadn't dealt with a lot of the trauma of what happened. I went to stay at my parents in the middle of the country while I looked for jobs in my dream state. The first of what would be many panic attacks would occur. Triggers of baby commercials coming on, and remembering everything everybody did to me to make things worse. I refused to sleep because I felt like if I went to sleep I would die. My body would constantly feel like it was going to die and give up on me. I contemplated every second all the things that could kill me at any second. Driving became a nightmare. I had cut off contact with boyfriend, but the woman he was sleeping with and wouldn't ever date, he started to date. This psycho started contacting me with no provocation asking me if I was still around. It started off with did I call her. I had her number from before I left the state because she wanted to hang out with me as we were ""sharing"" my boyfriend. The whole thing was weird but I went with it. She starting sending me fake call logs saying I called her and to contact her. When I didn't respond she became more aggressive. She told me I had tried to trap boyfriend with a baby, and he wouldn't have been with me otherwise. I blocked her but I'm pretty sure she used phishing numbers as I received random text messages pertaining to stuff she would say. Of course this triggered me every single time. (I've changed numbers since). After the last bad trigger, I started seeking therapy 3x a week. 

At first I didn't notice a change. One by one I was able to talk and peel apart more about what happened that last year. There were things about my accident I ignored because I was focused on my pregnancy. I never mourned the loss of a lot of things. I never got angry with how my boyfriend treated me. I let my self-esteem plummet. For months I couldn't drive without having to pull over the side of the road. One day I went 30 minutes without panicking while I drove. I actually relaxed and listened to the music without feeling my body go numb. That's easy for most people, but for people with flight or fright responses it can be scary. After so much intensive therapy I that was the first thing I noticed as an improvement. 

I met my future husband while staying with my parents. It took me awhile to find a job again out of state. Fast forward, I'm married to someone who loves me and treats me well. I have my dream job with colleagues that treat me human. I still get panic attacks, and I'm still in therapy. But this is one of the first times I can tell my full story without crying. I'm not 100% completely healed but I'm getting there.  I feel like I was fortunate enough to have things turned around in a matter of a few years. I know some are still struggling on here, but I hope that everyone finds a point in which they realize that something as small as a car drive for a few minutes is improvement."
DAE write things they know will trigger them,7,lyikr2,3,"Does anyone else write something that they know will trigger them? I love to write but I don't know how to write anything that doesn't come from the perspective of a villain, normally a murderer or abuser.

And now I'm like having a huge anxiety attack and I don't know what to do about it. I just can't write anything that's not triggering, and it's really bad for me.

Saw my abuser at Trader Joe’s,23,lygwwk,6,"I saw him twice actually. I live in a relatively small town so I’m surprised it’s taken me this long to run into him. But I haven’t seen him since elementary school so like 12 years ago. End of December I saw him at the grocery store and it sent me into a spiral. I haven’t been the same since and I’m honestly terrified of leaving my house. I have constant panic attacks and can barely sleep anymore. I left the house for the first time in a long time yesterday and he was sitting at a fucking outdoor restaurant a block from my place. Like what’s my luck honestly. Every part of me says run away from this town but that’s irrational and requires a plan and time. The worst part is I don’t even think he recognizes me. Or remembers me. Like all the years he spent hurting me don’t even exist and he can just live a normal life. 
Should I leave? My brain is telling me to pack up my car and just run."
Someone had the audacity to just flat out dm me and asked how I was abused without them noticing,22,lygwsh,2,"Hello,

So I was in foster care as a teenager and some terrible things happened to me. For one, I was struggling with anorexia at the time and was sent to a residential treatment facility. At the time, my case worker was completely neglectful and rarely checked on me, and left me totally in the hands of this facility. Long story short, throughout my time at this facility I was drugged, abused, left with vaginal infections, rotting teeth, etc. After awhile I ran away and was brought to a psych hospital, where I told the psychiatrist there everything that happened to me. He deemed me NOT a danger to myself, weaned me off of drugs (I told him I felt high and was being forced to take things), I told him about my vaginal pain, etc. Within 2 weeks I was off of most medications, and eventually reunified home and out of the DCFS system by age 17. 

I am in a facebook group about eating disorder recovery and somebody asked for a review of this particular facility. I told her i had an abusive experience as an adolescent and let her know she could message me if she had any other questions since she is looking at a few facilities for her recovery. 

There is a woman who was in the same treatment center as me at the time (and who was an adult at her time of treatment, therefore separate interaction and only saw each other during mealtimes) and at around midnight sends me a private message saying, ""How were you abused in there as a child? I've been there and wasn't abused."" I let her know that her experience does not invalidate mine, and that just because she didn't witness what happened in private rooms with me being abused, doesn't mean it didn't happen. 

I gave a very brief description and told her I wish to go no further, as it felt like she was implying that since she didn't witness or experience any abuse, that they did not abuse a child. She apologized for coming across as invalidating and aggressive but it was just a really messed up confrontation- as if I owed her my story. I have a diagnosis of PTSD. I have weekly night terrors, I can't open my door/am alarmed by my doorbell. It was just like since they didn't abuse her, how could it have happened to me. It kinda hurt especially considering I've barely ever spoken to the woman."
"Diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, depression recently. Tw (child abuse, verbal, physical.)",2,lyeajo,3,"Hello, I’ve never posted here and just found the reddit for this tbh. I am turning 25 on the 18th this month and it’s pretty hard to fathom. Up until I was 22 I prayed everyday for something or someone to come take me or to not wake up. I had an extremely abusive childhood growing up and extremely high standards. 

Background I am half white/Korean, white dad and Korean mom. Both came from poor backgrounds and one came from a family of alcoholics and smokers and one was third world with outhouses. I was told I was the golden child my entire life cause I just did what they told me to do and I was a robot. I listened because the yelling, the beating, the anxiety and feelings that I’d get would be worse than just obeying. My older sister was the trouble maker who stole from stores and family, chase me with knives, put me in boxes and shove me down stairs, pushed my parents buttons, etc and it would all come back to me for no reason cause my parents couldn’t separate their anger and find something to come after me for. I was always a picky eater I don’t like certain textures they gross me out and I was forced to sit at the table till my plate was cleared. I was left at the table by myself for 3-4 hours until my parents would finally release me as I could not eat it, it isn’t possible to this day with certain things I just cannot do it. Which then just results in being screamed at even more. We would get beat and screamed and the only way it would stop is once we were hyper ventilating, crying and gagging to catch your breathe it would get to that point everytime for things to finally stop.

During an extremely stressful time with their work, my sister had nudes leaked in middle school which resulted in attempted suicide and her chest pumped. Parents are manic and always on edge waiting to snap the house was always like being on egg shells waiting for someone to snap.

I lived on the internet, I had my real friends there, gf’s, and my personality was there and I had to put a mask on everyday in real life. Regardless I would get yelled at if my sister did anything. Things that would happen is beating switches, belts, kitchen utensils, and my dad would always say things like “say that again and I’ll knock your fucken teeth out”, “you guys are such ungrateful spoiled fucken kids”, everything was a comparison, a threat, a beating if you do this or that. Yelling at kids that they should’ve known better in hindsight after making a childish mistake. 

There was standards for school too that we must have all B’s or better or we lost all the rights we had pretty much. Everything was taken away, screamed at, monitored, etc. At this point my parents were making 6 figure income and I was struggling in math and school. I had never studied in life, but I was always able to just do schoolwork until 10th grade. My memory disappeared and I couldn’t remember or focus anymore on anything. I asked for a tutor for help and they told me no. I got a 2.3 and 2.5 gpa sophomore and junior year. Freshman was a 3.9 and senior was a 3.7(cheated and teachers let me and got my gpa up final year. 

I am on my 3rd therapist which is a psychologist with a PhD specializing in EMDR therapy and has been helping a lot to process. I am on my second psychiatrist to help. I suffer now with poor self esteem, suicidal ideation daily, ruminating thoughts for 4+ hours a day, severe GAD, major depressive disorder chronic, and it’s hard to avoid triggers for ptsd. Everyday feels like I’m playing a game of dodging land minds. I feel like I’m sitting on a bench everyday watching or waiting for things to crumble apart. Hope has been something that flickers back and forth sometimes it’s just so hard to imagine there is another side to life feeling one way for.

I just wanted to voice my story I have been struggling to stay “afloat” these days and when I fail or I let myself be consumed I just feel like such a failure. I just want to help others in this world and be a nice person treating others with respect. Yet part of me will snap and just end up breaking, throwing and screaming when I can’t hold it together. My body tenses up so often with muscles feeling locked and to the point of pain. I would wake up the next day sore from the tension. On the road to recovery, but I have such a high level of respect of the people who have made it to the light at the end of the tunnel."
Making myself look good,7,lyd9qx,1,"Hello, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I wonder if anyone else does this. 

I make myself look good when I've done something bad. Whenever I'm accused of doing something bad, like being rude or hurtful. I immediately minimize the other person's feelings and try to make myself look better. This is reflexive, almost like I can't stop it. I immediately jump to, ""Oh well it's not that bad, I have (insert excuse)""

This happens with my spouse a lot and he's growing increasingly frustrated and is threatening to kick me out - this isn't the only reason that's a very long story. This seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

He's told me I have to process the trauma surrounding this defect I have, or I'm leaving.

Anybody else experience this? I was raised by a narcissistic mother (diagnosed narcissist) and a pretty absent father, so my PTSD stems from childhood trauma. Any advice appreciated."

New traumatic event how to process,1,lya0u1,1,"Trigger for childhood abuse

My PTSD is probably more likely to be complex due to many traumas. I am on the waiting list for therapy and have had CBT twice and I believe the other type with eye movements when I was a lot younger but the word is escaping atm. 

This weekend my mother outed my sibling to me, then instead of saying ‘please don’t go and speak to him yet he’s not ready’ she aggressively grabbed me, and as I tried to get away she tugged more and wouldn’t let go. I had to take on an anger response in order to get her off me by being the superior person, she doesn’t like confrontation unless she’s the one doing it. I shouted and leaned over her and explained violence is never acceptable in a situation like this, that she is to use her words and not her body to express her concerns.

She let go eventually. My husband was there and said it seemed quite short in terms of time. But he was in front of us as we walked at a distance (the fact she broke distance laws to attack me I’m furious), and he didn’t see the beginning of the struggle. All I did was start to turn around and walk towards the house. I had wanted to say to him hey don’t worry I’m bisexual, I totally support you (because many attacks from my mother were after I came out and I never spoke of it again after childhood until a few years ago. I’m learning to be out of the closet and sharing with some friends and husband and have told my sister but because mum is always there I didn’t know if my brother knew), but if my mother had said that he wasn’t ready then I would have turned back. I can totally see why she would have been defensive, but I also know it was an inappropriate reaction. Like she’s been saying she has anxiety for years but I actually think it’s an anger problem.

As a child she would shove and push and do this pulling and shaking and screaming, and launch attacks for similar non reasons but in her mind they were good reasons. Like having a shower before work when I was a teenager being a severe problem, or eating food when I was hungry, or picking up scraps when she hadn’t cooked me a portion of dinner, trying to stab me when she didn’t like that I was putting leaflets in newspapers after she insisted I do it for a job because I was ‘in her way...’ the worst one is that she attacked me for being in the bathroom when she was pregnant. She smashed my head into the mirror above the toilet and it cracked, hitting me and pushing me around, similar not letting go while screaming hit me. Eventually I had to push her off, carefully to only push her not near the bump in defence so I could lock myself in the bathroom. She did a dramatic ‘I’ve been pushed!!!’ And did an act of moving very far back step by step until she was at the top of the stairs. At first it did seem like I had caused her to lose her balance. But She paused got her balance...then grabbed the stair bannister and called out for my stepdad and said I had attacked her, stood there for a moment, swinging herself back and forth to get the guts to throw herself down and smirking at me. Then she pushed the bannister and smirked at me as she fell down into a pregnant, splayed mess on the floor at the bottom. Crying and saying help me. Stepdad ran up the stairs shouting at me. I said she did it herself but nobody believed me. 

I don’t remember after that. She lost two babies at some point but because I have ptsd I struggle with timing. I don’t know if she lost this baby or it went on to be my sibling. 

This sibling is the one I stay in contact for. She doesn’t allow him to be alone with me. When I arrange to meet him, even though he’s almost 18 she has to be there and he has to ask permission. I would not have contact with her if the situation was different. He has clearly been fed all sorts of information about me but I think after this incident at the weekend he might be realising that I’m not this monster she’s told everyone I am.

After the event this weekend, I closed up. She chased me and after I shut myself in my car and told my husband to drive off, he was just as confused as he hasn’t experienced a parent attacking their child before so he thought he should stay to try and work it out but she tried to  get in the car and I got lost in a flashback. He got in and drove me home. He said she was trying to apologise but it was too late. I cried the entire way home, then all day and evening and had flashbacks in the nights. 

So my question is...I’ve had CBT and all that and recently group therapy to learn how trauma memories happen...and to take care of myself now. But they didn’t teach me how to process new trauma memories. I’m aware there is a 2 week time period before the memory is stored in either the hypothalamus for a normal memory or the amygdala as a trauma memory. 

How can I process this new traumatic event so that it doesn’t become like all the others? I was naive to think that I was past trauma and that it was just work on my past."
may i ask a question,2,lya0ot,13,"hi all,

im starting to do some reaserch about the relation between FPS games and levels of PTSD, im trying to assert if there is any truth to the claim that people that play FPS have similar levels of PTSD to vets, i highly doubt it but looking at some of the gory sights of some of the games, it seems that there may be some PTSD in people that play games, if you have any studies please share.

Edit: thank you all for responding, its enlightened me about it, I am grateful to you all. I wish you all a happy lifetime."
"Is it normal to have bad dreams with ptsd? How do I stop them? Please help me, idk what to do anymore.",12,ly8pzx,4,"Hello, a few weeks ago I was forced to get a mental health assessment and was diagnosed with ptsd caused by my mom passing away, me seeing her in the hospital and having to make the decision to have her ventilator turned off. For the last 6 months that she died my life has honestly been a living hell and up until recently I thought it was just normal grief but I guess not. Anyways I’m still having horrible nightmares about what my mom looked like in the hospital or about her being gone in general and I keep waking up crying as hard as I can and punching my pillow. I genuinely can’t sleep. I’m on medication and seeing a doctor/therapist and it doesn’t work for me. I’m just wondering if this is normal and if so what are some things you guys do to help?"

Looking for Support and Advice for my Combat Vet husband,2,ly665o,3,"Long story short, my husband is a combat vet (we met in the service so I get some of the issues but not to the same extent by any means). He won’t go to the VA for his PTSD, and I don’t know how to convince him that it would be good for him to. When he first came home, he used to shake me a lot in the night and that was scary, but I know he wasn’t trying to scare me. I have been so patient with all of the issues he has been having because I didn’t make it out of my service period completely unscathed either. He has made a lot of progress, but he still has so much trouble at night. He reaches for my hands while he’s sleeping instead of shaking me so I can say that’s probably the most personally affecting process he has. I just want to be able to support and help him, but I’m not a professional. The little help I can provide isn’t necessarily going to make the changes that help him sleep at night. Any suggestions of places to have him reach out to or reasons that I could get him to talk to the Va would be so helpful. I worry about him a lot."
Disappointed and disoriented,1,ly5z4d,0,"I had been doing so well lately getting to sleep at a decent time, some nights it would take till 1, 2, or sometimes 3am to get to sleep but that’s not so bad considering sometimes I can’t sleep till 5 or 6 in the morning. While it’s only about 1:30am as I’m writing this I feel like I’m in for a long night because I feel very disoriented and physically tired but not sleepy tired if that makes sense. I’m so tired of shit sleep schedules and I’m angry that I’m on vacation rn but it feels like I’m having more flashbacks than I’ve been having for a while. It’s possible they are coming from my EMDR therapy, my therapist told me that when my brain starts to feel like it’s ready to process the traumas it’ll start bringing them up more and I hate it and I want to repress all of them. I keep putting them in my container like my therapist taught me so I can process them with her and use the EMDR to kick all that shit into the long term memory bank instead of having to relive it too often. Idk I’m rambling at this point but I just wanted to let some of these feelings out."
Too many preconceived notions about people holding me back,1,ly5seu,0,"So I have a pattern in all my relationships. All my relationships end with someone in the guy's family being to possessive about him and trying to break us up and the guy not standing up for me so I leave or they leave me.

It's usually a possessive sibling and Its become a big red flag for me now. One of my exes sibling called me on the phone and began to yell and ask me to leave the same night.

Another one made his brother take back the ring after he proposed and we were engaged briefly because our customs were different and she wanted a more lavish wedding than our customs usually were..She used to keep texting him when we were dating like calling and checking on him in the middle of dates, during our first few dates. I wish I had taken the exit door then than have to bear seeing my wedding called off because she wasn't happy with our wedding plan. 

Its very disorienting because initially I'd try to be friendly and courteous and they ll be nice since they know I'm dating their brother and when they suddenly change or make demands, I usually say my point of view and also hope the guy will speak up for me. If he stays silent, I begin to reconsider being in that relationship.

Another ex guy s sister would keep trying to tell me she is hanging out with him more now coz later he would be too busy with me.

When ever im talking to someone new and they bring up their sibling, I'm too scared now. Its ridiculous coz almost everyone has a sibling. And I'm stuck in this infinite loop of collecting red flags.

While I'm aware of how my fears are based on a small population,  these were traumatic events in my life because almost every break up I had involved a sibling- their they caused it or my ex made the sister call me and tell me its over..or something of that nature.

I almost begin to cry when i see there is another one in the picture . My therapist is aware of this but I'm not sure if I can overcome this. It's become inbuilt in my head now to avoid the remote possibility of this trauma ever again. 

I talk to someone new and his display pic is of him carrying his sister on the snow during some trekking holiday. They re clearly very close and I havent even met this person 

I just want to take the exit door now because I feel I could be potentially hurt."
My family is emotionally suppressed and I’m entering the part of recovery where I attach emotions to what happened,14,ly5g3e,4,"I just got off the phone with my mom and I cannot stop laughing about the ridiculousness of the conversation. I told her my psych “graduated” me to the next level of working thru my ptsd which meant that I’d have to start feeling whatever emotions are attached to the events that I’ve detached from for years now. Right off the bat, my mom, in all her ignorance, asked me if it was a wise choice to become emotionally regulated when I’m in a family that has multi-generational emotional suppression. I laughed and said yes it is, to which she asked why. I told her by suppressing my emotions, it’s literally killing me. By having that learned behavior throughout my life, it will end up killing me.

I’ve struggled with suicidal attempts in the distant past (pre 2003), and ideation off & on since, as recent as 2016 when she left work to come sit with me in my apartment one night. I also have a severe history of schizo-affective disorder (schizophrenia & bi-polar for me). My family hasn’t really been there for me through much of that short of my mom sitting with me. My brother & his wife are largely hands off with me in the mental health department.

I’m not allowed emotions in my family. I can’t get frustrated or mad, I can’t cry, I can’t be too happy, I can’t be moody, I have to be the equivalent of a robot, emotionally speaking. So with all this ptsd sht going on, it’s been hell going it alone. I’ve called them out for not supporting me once & my SIL ghosted me for 7 months. 

BUT! What I am glad about is that my weird sense of humor is coming back after it being one of many things robbed from me, and as it’s come back, it’s picked up inspiration from this hell and oh boy does my family not find me funny anymore. So I just gotta laugh at my mom clutching her pearls and being personally offended that I would try to break one of the few family traditions we have."
How to survive,5,ly55vd,4,"I haven't been diagnosed yet, but am pretty sure I have PTSD/C-PTSD. I'm currently thinking about leaving my husband, due to some problems in our marriage. I'm not sure if I'm emotionally ready for this move. A friend was willing to help with counseling, but really I'm concerned about food and housing. 

What is getting on disability like, and is it possible to afford a clean place in a safe area? I have these crying spells and some emotional trauma, so I don't currently think I can work. Eventually, I'd like to train and get back into graphic design, which is what I'm good at. 

If anyone has ideas for resources, it would really help me."
Why do I tend to over share?,98,ly4yjq,52,"Why do I tend to over share very specific details about my trauma and childhood adversities?

Autistic teenager living with parent with PTSD needs advice on how to get along better.,6,ly4wyw,7,"Hello im 17 and my stepfather has ptsd from mutiple different experiences in his life including but not limited to the military. I do things that im not conscious of that sets him off like for example.

1.Moving my hands in jesters which he interprets/ begins to feel nervous because it looks like im going to strike him. I do that because it helps me talk easier and slower.

2.I make quick motions like ""snatching"" somthing out of their hands which I dont consider as snatching but ill accept that I probably am bit I dont consider how much strength I use. 

3.I ask questions to understand things but he interprets that me questioning his authority when I just feel really uncomfortable doing somthing without understanding why im doing it.

Im fine with learning to improve but he cannot correct me when I do things that setshe him off because they immediately get angry and to stop themselves from lashing out in a way they will regret they just ""let it slide"" but keep thinking about it. They may not ever bring it up again and when they do I completely forgotten that  happened or how I did something even if it was less than a minute ago. So I cannot really learn from it, it just keeps happening over and over and over again. What should I do/encourage him to do for us to get along better if we cannot even communicate in a way that will let me improve."
s/o video game rage is triggering,5,ly4sgg,4,"Just wanted to rant that my boyfriend's video game rage is a major trigger because he tends to yell, throw things, and hit the things around him. He's definitely gotten better after the 3+ times I've broken down after his rages from my PTSD but I was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? It took a lot to get him to understand how deeply his seemingly inconsequential video game rage would affect me but I definitely had to break down multiple times and threaten to leave (I'm temporarily living with him) if he didn't stop. Have any of you ever had something someone else did that was triggering to you and you had to argue with them to stop? He has had general anger issues in the past (not physically towards any of his ex's or me) and for him, video games are where he can let out anger and frustration and it's a really difficult habit to change. It's not completely fair for him that I feel like he will let that anger out on me when he is raging at FIFA but it's also not fair for me to be hyperfocused whenever he plays in order to know when he loses so I can mentally prepare myself or not be able to breathe when he's punching the couch/table/floor/controller."
Trauma work alternatives to EMDR,3,ly3rf4,2,"Hi everyone, 
Along with my life-long anxiety and after a few bad experiences, some of them with therapists, I'm having a hard time feeling safe around some people. I feel panicked, spiraling, very confused... My issue now is that it's difficult for me to trust therapists, but I really need the help. 
The times I've tried EMDR I benefit from It, but there are not many Emdr therapists in my city rn.

I was wondering if there are techniques for trauma work or nervous system work that I can do to empower myself so I can feel more protected/more clear in triggering spaces, including therapy. I've heard about TRE and somatic experencing. Any other things I can do in group/by myself? 

Thanks you"
Hi. I’m trying to help my wife...,8,ly2guz,13,"My wife has some trauma from 5 years ago that has been creeping into her/our everyday life for a while. She finally hit a breaking point and decided to take FMLA from work and do the trauma work. I support her in this decision and o realize she wasn’t ready until now. So, she applied for leave and was approved and started a PHP program locally. It proved to be really, really hard for her to do the work outpatient due to her trauma response/dissociation. So after three weeks, the insurance recommended a higher level of care and we agreed that it was necessary. We didn’t do any research on places because they told us they would do a single case agreement with our insurance for their residential facility and it would make it easy for her to step back to PHP after. She left a few days later and it was an awful, borderline traumatic, experience. She got to the facility and they took away the phone use they promised before she arrived (we know inpatient/residential facilities are strict on phone use, but we pre-arranged phone access because out 1-year old had a 105.8 fever and because of the single case agreement, my wife couldn’t wait until she was better before leaving). On top of that, we found out they didn’t *do* trauma and couldn’t really do med management because the psych was only on site once a week. The facility had just opened and there was really nothing in place, so it was a giant mess. We decided she should come home and we would find another treatment center. 

This is where we are now - there is nothing available. We’ve spent hours calling therapists, PHPs, inpatient and residential facilities, etc. and everything is a dead end. She doesn’t have a therapist and no one in network is taking new patients. All inpatient/residential want a single case agreement done by a PHP or therapist. The prior PHP won’t allow her to assess, help us, or take her back because she didn’t “successfully complete residential,” and we don’t have $30K to pay for anything out of pocket. 

I’m getting nervous because she only has 7 weeks of FMLA left and is in no place to return to work. She needs to be somewhere ASAP and one minute she knows that and the next she can do it on her own. I feel like I’m walking on egg shells a home and I’m using all of my mental energy to make phone calls, ask around, and support her, but we just keep getting nowhere. 

I’m hoping someone has some ideas, resources, places they received treatment, etc. I realize this post leaves out a lot. I’m trying to keep it relatively short but I’m happy to answer any questions you may have. I appreciate any and all feedback."
"Today, I realized something very important...",97,ly1s4m,10,"I realized that I can't make everyone love me, no matter how hard I try. No matter how much effort I put in not everyone will care for me. I realized that after standing there, staring at my boyfriend who was too busy playing video games to give me a proper hello after just returned from being hospitalized due to be suicidal. Then, watching him barely talk to me the rest of the day and mumble a ""I love you"" just to appease me. Part of my PTSD comes from being abandoned after being severely abused by a parental figure. So, I always have strived to try and make sure people love and care about me... Yet, today made me realize that I can't."
I think I have ptsd...,3,ly133s,0,"Where do I start ? My father was and still is very abusive. I grew up being beating up in a very violent way belt, electric cable, broom, hanger. One of many memories I still have was This one time when my father took the belt force me to lye down the bed grabed my feet and started to hit under my feet which super sensitive. I was not even 7year old. The reason why he beat the shit of me was because I said shut your mouth to one of my neighbor and she went and told my dad. I wanted to kill her after that. I think my father suffer from a mental illness or maybe expert trauma in his childhood himself. Because the things he use to do to me and my siblings were really crazy. He was like this until I was 17 years. Then the beating decrease but the emotional abuse persisted. My father was never nice to me and on the rare moment that he was it's because he needed something from me. He use to call me names every single day telling me that I am stupid, a piece of shit and kept threatening me to take me out of school like going to school was a favour or a reward. I am 26 years old I drop out of school after high school, I can't stay at school because everytime i sit in class or try to work on something i cant focus, I keep hearing my father's voice that I am stupid , that I am not enough , that I will do nothing with my life. I really want to at least finish my college but it's literally torture for me I swear. I keep having flash back of my childhood all the time, I freeze or just feel like hitting my self. I have anger issues , when I get mad I just want to hit anything, my Body have this urge that won't go away until I hit something. Now that I have a child it's Even worse it's like all memories are trying to come up some are blurry that I am not even sure happened. I get triggered very easily. When my husband yells at our child I loose it on him I become like monster I see all black.

Paranoia and guilt,8,ly0qa4,0,"I was verbally, physically, and I believe although my memory is blurred, sexually abused growing up. I bit my tongue and moved out at 18 and since then I have somehow managed to continue to have a relationship with my parents with a lot of distance involved. Every time we come to a point of understanding or they want to do something nice for me, I feel this extreme like, paranoia about what their intentions actually are. I never have trusted their reactions to anything I do but especially since I’ve moved out and they’re no longer a physical threat to me, I feel so anxious and cautious and like I can’t trust them, or even my siblings. This has extended into my friendships and my family friends, like my boyfriends siblings for instance. I love them all very much and I hate that my brain rationalizes everything this way. I feel like everyone has ill motives against me and I feel guilty for thinking that. Has anyone else dealt with this and how do I stop my thoughts from going there?"
"I finally said it out loud, for the first time.",14,ly07jl,1,"I had my assessment appointment with a therapist for trauma focused cbt this week. She asked what it was that I was struggling with most. She then brought up things I had said in the first appointment to get on to the waiting list. She didn't press the matter, just asked, and for the first time those words left my mouth in 14 years. 
 Part of me doesn't get why this all still affects me the way it does, it shouldn't still hurt like it does. I shouldn't still panic. I shouldn't be ""malfunctioning "" like this. 

I managed to finally say that I had been in an abusive relationship,  and had been raped when I was 17. How so many things at work bring back the memories because so many more people have been aggressive and angry, and when working in customer service its always directed at the wrong person. Its directed at me. 

The medication I'm on must have truly numbed me to most of the feelings because there wasn't any relief uttering it out loud. There was no weight lifted, no easing in the pain. I don't know what I truly expected but I thought I'd feel something. If anything everything feels crushing now (a few days on) because its out there now. There's no going back to pretending.

Still feeling like an asshole even after being forgiven,4,lxzk87,1,I took my friend's offer to stay with her and her family to get away from some issues that were messing with my mental health. It was going great until I had a bad night terror and her youngest son got excited to show me the snow that had fallen. He jumped into the bed and I woke up swinging. I punched a 7 year old. my friend had warned the kids that I'm different and not used to the noise. I was told the kids aren't allowed to do that unless it's Christmas. I did apologize and he did too. he also got his revenge with a snowball so we have no hard feelings. my friend isn't mad at all at me and her husband is more disappointed at his son for jumping onto a bed with a sleeping woman in it. I feel so upset with myself.
Stuck in a period of daydreaming about memories.,18,lxyxo2,4,"I hate these periods. Not only am I remembering ""bad shit"" but I am completely lost in them. I am both ruminating about how life would be if I acted differently, had avoided different situations or had grown up in a stable environment. I'm also ruminating about the future in relation to these memories. What if me and X have kids at the same time and they go to the same school, so we've gotta do parent meetings together(lol).
Or for some reason Y will spread rumours about the abuse, to make me look like I was asking for it... and everyone will believe him and leave me.

It's so silly but I always get stuck in these periods and can't stop thinking about them for weeks. Then I'm fine for a few weeks, then it's on again like a never ending oscillation. I feel like I haven't been living for a long time."

I have a newfound anxiety after a major PTSD episode [TW below],9,lxxa8c,2,"TW: Drinking / Alcohol






In August of last year I had a MAJOR dissociative episode and subsequent panic attack that landed me in the hospital. I had been drinking that night, though certainly not heavy by any means (just enough for a slight buzz) and a doctor at the hospital thought I might have been drugged (but they lost the sample before testing it so I won’t know). Since then, any time I start to feel even a little bit buzzed from a couple drinks, I start to feel overwhelmed with panic. I feel like “what if I’m about to lose control again?” The episode I had in August caused me to be kicked out of my best friend’s wedding, I lost several friends, and my boyfriend initially wanted to break up with me. I was out of work for a week recovering afterwards. To be completely honest, that experience felt far far worse than what originally caused my PTSD.

This new anxiety makes me feel even worse. I feel like I can’t get drinks with friends or even have a glass of wine with dinner at home with my boyfriend. I feel so scared. Part of me wants to commit to cutting out alcohol but, having never struggled with alcohol, that kind of feels like I’m letting my PTSD “win” over me living my normal life.

I experienced my trauma 5 years ago & I just hate that even now, I’m having to navigate new anxieties, fears, problems, etc because of it.

Regrounding after Trauma?,8,lxvtqa,2,"TW for physical violence mention

I was wondering if anyone had any advice or tips on how to get back to doing the good things for yourself after you've been traumatized. I life with my SO and his family (renting together) until May. If you read my post history, I made a post in the justnomil thread addressing the details of the situation. Anyway, long story short, I witnessed my bf's mom physically beat his younger sibling and it's hard to get that out of my head.... It really scared me and made me uncomfortable and luckily for us, we're moving out soon.

The problem I am having is getting back on top of school after seeing that happen to a child... It was disturbing and it reminded me of my own past abuse I've been through. This is affecting my grades a ton and I don't know how to get back on track.

I'm in my last year / important semester of university and I need to do well. I'm feeling so stuck though, whenever I go to type up an assignment and feel ok again generally, my bf's mom will start more drama/arguments/violent acts.

I'm debating on deferring my term or asking my advisor if I can get extensions for my assignments due to my circumstances.

Any suggestions on how to not let my surroundings impact me this badly so I can get through the term?

Thanks"
I'm so pissed off,10,lxrvpx,3,"I'm so fucking mad. I'm a military spouse and my husband got orders to go overseas. We were so excited but I'm probably getting rejected from going because I see counseling for PTSD.

Anyone else strangle themselves during flashbacks?,46,lxrgoi,22,"For some reason, when I have flashbacks related to my r*pe, I strangle myself and I have no idea why. The other day I was having a flashback and choked myself to the point of dry heaving and it pulled me out which has never happened before.

PTSD makes me feel bad for my partner...,77,lxr1ds,8,"Last night I had a trigger after watching something and it messed me up more than I thought it would. Normally, I have a decent grip on my moments but later it came back to bite me.

My partner, bless his heart, did everything he could as I had a panic attack, cried, and dissociated and I felt so bad. I hate making him worry, but I am glad he supports me.

But with my episode I just felt guilty and anxious. I felt so broken. I hate my parents for being horrible and breaking me this way. 

Yes, I know that I need to mother myself and treat myself with care in these moments. It just sucks.

running around in circles ..,9,lxpptx,0,"it feels like I'm constantly running around in circles. it is so exhausting. it is hard for me to do daily tasks because of a spinal injury I got from being in a car accident, so I am very limited (physically) but with my PTSD, it drains me mentally and emotionally. 

I work so hard daily to fight the voice in my head of my abusive mom who called me selfish to when it came to thinking of my needs first. I fight the guilt of not doing enough to my (adoptive) parents to keep them alive. I blame myself they died 3 months apart. I feel a heavy heart that I lost contact with my siblings because after the car accident, I contacted a lawyer to figure out what to do. it was my first car accident and I wasn't the driver, so I wanted to know what can i expect. in doing so, my 5 siblings cut contact because they thought I was suing them. 

 I fight this fight, daily. but i fight it with you all of you. you guys are warrior, my heros, my inspirations...

Losing the battle with constant nightmares,59,lxj6l2,17,"Sorry if this isn't  fully coherent, I was just woken up in the middle of a nightmare, I may be a little out of it. 

I'm 29f, married with a child and have been diagnosed with CPTSD and BPD (borderline), I'm on anti depressant and anti anxiety medications. The only thing they do is limit my anger response , which naturally is a huge issue for me.

The problem is the nightmares. I can't sleep more than 2 hours without having one. Most aren't even about the trauma I went through, just made up situations. I wake up screaming, crying, and drenched in sweat. It used to just be me waking up on my own to go do something around the house to decompress before my family gets up. Recently it's become more common for my internal freakouts to be more vocalized. I now scare my husband most nights by screaming and loudly arguing to the air. 

This one I didn't start to calm down as soon as I woke up as I normally do. He rolled over to comfort me after explaining what I was yelling. I declined because I felt as though someone poured a cup of water on me and I needed to escape. I tell him I'll be ok, go back to sleep, as I walk out holding in my panic attack crying the best I can until I can distance myself from the room.

I'm at a loss on how to handle this. I need sleep, he needs sleep. I can't be waking up everyday in fight or flight. It's  simply getting to be to much and I have no idea what to do :("

Can you have PTSD/CPTSD without flashbacks?,8,lxgc3n,9,"
  Hii, sooo i was looking at a post on here and someone said you can have (c)PTSD without flashbacks?

Is this true? when I addressed possibly having PTSD to my therapist once but she said people with PTSD often feel like they’re constantly reliving the event. I have a lot of symptoms of trauma. But no flashbacks? soo.. I don’t know I’m kinda confused."
Just need to put this into words.,1,lxfzot,1,"In May of 2020 I was in a car accident, it was bad, very bad. The highway patrol was certain they were going to see a corpse in my vehicle, that level of bad. But I survived with a few broken bones. Including several pelvic fractures, but I was walking within a week.

The first week after the wreck was awful. Nightmares, shaking, random crying spells and even the urge to take my own life. (That urge was beaten back and has never reared itself since, if I start to feel off, I call my therapist. Even if it's 2am on a Sunday.)

I slowly worked my way back mentally, I can even travel through that intersection without my heart rate spiking. Made a lot of progress. But sometimes it rears it's head. Two days ago I was so overwhelmed with flashbacks I had to pull over and was late for work. I've had trouble sleeping, every time I close my eyes I just see the grill of that truck in my drivers window again. I've talked to my therapist, but it isn't helping. Tried talking to my S.O. about it, but she isn't able to help either. It's 3:20am and I'm standing in the bathroom, fighting back tears while I write this.

I just want it to stop, I want my life back. PTSD, you can't have control, I refuse. I'm gonna charlie mike, fuck you PTSD, you won't win.

Working through my sexual trauma alone,5,lxf2y3,0,"TW: SA
I can’t afford therapy or medication although those are both things I have done in the past and went into debt from. I am reading “the body keeps the score” and while reading am trying to work through some of the shit that’s happened to me. I am taking a year off of college because my ptsd was so bad last year that I failed all my classes I’m supposed to go back in the fall but I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it. My family doesn’t know what has happened and they have caused some early childhood trauma. I know if I tell them how bad I’m struggling I won’t get support I’ll get judgement. My boyfriend is the only one there for me with everything I’m dealing with but I find it extremely difficult to vocalize what I’m feeling when I’m feeling it and then after I’m feeling it I feel stupid for feeling it. I’ve been having worse panic and out of body feelings lately. Also while reading the book I’m starting to worry that my childhood was worse than I actually recall I feel like I’m remembering more everyday. I feel like my thoughts and memories are collapsing on me. I was assaulted twice in my life however the first time was multiple times just by the same person which I’m realizing now may have done more damage than I thought and then the second one happened and I feel like it invalidated the first one. I’m trying to quit smoking weed because I’m using it to cope with all of this but without it I’m left to face everything head on. I’m feeling very confused about my past very hurt and very scared. I’m finding it difficult to to go to work and see friends and then with going back to school hanging over my head I don’t know how I’ll juggle it all. I know I need professional help but I’m also on my families insurance and not only do they not know about my trauma but they also do not approve of mental help. They don’t believe it is a real problem you can have. I’m lost. I’m trying to put myself back together piece by piece but I feel like I’m breaking the more I try to help myself. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know why I made this post I guess I just needed to vent last time I posted in here people in the comments told me to get professional help but as I said that’s not an option at this time so please don’t suggest that it just makes me sad:/"
Recently diagnosed,1,lxdcp0,1,"I just wanted to share a little bit of my story. Not going to go into great detail. But I spent most of 2020 physically ill every single day. Upon waking. I went to so many doctors and ended up in the emergency room two times for digestive issues that were causing all sorts of bathroom problems. A lot of people aren’t really aware the effects it can have on your digestive system, pumping a surplus of chemicals through your stomach that shouldn’t be there cause those feelings of constant sickness. And it’s biology, caused by mentality. I couldn’t believe how simple the answer was in the end. After changing my diet completely and exercising regularly now and seeing so many doctors the problem was caused by PTSD.

If you ever feel like you have this disorder please get help. It’s very easy to with covid. There are all kinds of teledocs all over the country that will help. The woman I spoke with was super gentle.

The After Shock,4,lxctnk,0,"It happened so many years ago and for some reason my body hasn’t realized it yet. I’m ok I’m in a fine place (not good not bad, just fine). 

Let me set the scene.... 

I’m 20 years old, I’m in school and I no longer have to
deal with what I dealt with as a child. Despite the fact that I am somewhat free of that world, my body protects as if I’m still in that small purple bedroom on the second floor. 

A minor inconvenience and my body will shut down I’ll lose all human feeling and drift into the unknown for an unknown amount of time for an unknown reason.  There is no snapping out of it because there was nothing to snap into. On the flip side, the same could happen but instead of drifting away I will fall into a manic spiral of rage. “Everybody is against you”, my brain will say. The closest to me will feel the wrath of my brain forcing itself to protect me, but I didn’t ask. I am alone now because of my brain, it protected too well, but can it protect me from myself? 

Will it ever stop? 
Will I ever be normal again? 
Will the protective barrier in my brain let it’s guard down? 

I guess only time will tell... but how much time do I have left?"
New roommate is triggering me and I don’t know what to do,13,lxc09k,9,"Using a throwaway and hope this is a good sub for this
EDIT: the part specific to PTSD is at the bottom


My girlfriend’s best friend moved in with us 2 and a half months ago, and it’s started to make me uncomfortable. We are both gay, and he’s a straight male. He moved into our finished basement after his girlfriend broke up with him and he had to move out of their apartment. I’ve outlined how he makes me uncomfortable below, but I would also like to add that my girlfriend believes he may be on the spectrum. Apparently he’s talked to her about this and has wanted to get a diagnosis for awhile but is scared. It would definitely turn this from one type of situation to the other, but wouldn’t change the core issues. 

* Sexually inappropriate comments and behaviors: He’s asked how tight I am, and has made a lot of inappropriate references to previous sex work I used to do as well as previous sexual partners. My girlfriend talked to him about the first comment but doesn’t see a problem with the references to sex work and my sex life because her and I are able to joke about it, and because I willingly told him about it. I don’t feel like that’s fair. I told him because I thought I could trust him to handle the information appropriately, while it was relevant to a conversation we were having. It’s different for my partner to reference it vs one of her friends that I’m not in a sexual relationship with. I didn’t tell him to hear jokes about it all the time. I regret being open with him. I have told him that I don't like it when he talks about those things, but I get the classic "" it's just a joke jeez haha"" response and it continues.
* Has tried to initiate a sexual relationship with me: When my girlfriend and I first started dating, I tried to be a friend to him as well. He asked if I wanted to come over and watch Queer Eye with him one day, and I said sure. I mean, it’s Queer Eye and I’m a lesbian that’s dating his best friend. I wasn’t worried. He didn’t make explicit advances on me but kept scooting closer to me on the couch and asked a lot of personal questions during the two or so hours I was there. I did feel uncomfortable. I found out a month later from my girlfriend that (for some reason) he had actually told her that he was hoping something would happen between us during that day. He said he had condoms with him “just in case”. She was so upset with him, but they are somehow still friends. He has actually done this a few times before without me knowing his motive, and has told my girlfriend about his intentions a few weeks after we hang out. I do not feel comfortable being alone with him for this reason, although she assures me that he’s harmless and I just have to say no if he tries something. I was sexually assaulted by a guy I thought was a friend, and the thought of having to possibly be back in that situation makes me feel so sick. It’s a horrible breach of trust. 
* Makes insensitive comments: This could be just because he’s a typical clueless dude, but he can be very insensitive and thoughtless with the things he says. My girlfriend and I both have struggled with addiction and sexual abuse, which she discusses openly with him. This is not something I would forget about a person, especially my best friend and even their partner, but he seems to. He very often comments on world events, local news, memes, or videos to us, and sometimes comments on things that involve drug addiction or sexual abuse and assault. He usually speaks to us like he’s talking to some random friend and not people who have experienced these things. He victim-blames, he’s derogatory, ignorant. It puts me in a very defensive position and upsets my girlfriend. One of us will usually tell him that he needs to either stop talking or change his stance. We remind him of our past experiences every time. It’s so irritating to have conversations like this in my own home.
* Weird behavior: If he comes into a common area room that you’re in, he’ll stand in the archway and wait for you to acknowledge him before coming all the way in. This is only mildly annoying, but it can be startling if I’m wearing headphones, or not paying attention, and suddenly become aware that he’s staring at me. He will stand there for several minutes. It’s just uncomfortable and is making me paranoid all the time that he’s staring at me. I’m sure he’s trying to be polite, but I hate it, and both me and my girlfriend have told him to stop. 

He is not a bad roommate per say. He’s polite to me, outside of these situations, he cleans up after himself relatively well, is respectful of our belongings, he pays rent on time. He stays in the basement or is at work 80% of the time honestly. But having him in the house has started to trigger a lot of anxiety for me. I’m not comfortable with houseguests in the first place-my home is my safe space and my sanctuary- but I have honestly made an effort to put this bias aside and be okay with him being here. But...the things mentioned above are making it harder as time passes.

I don’t know if this is normal, but I feel like he’s triggering flashbacks of the sexual abuse I experienced. He doesn’t resemble anyone, but I think because he makes me feel sexually uncomfortable it’s mimicking the feelings I experienced previously and putting me back into the mindset. I really don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my girlfriend to kick him out. He has nowhere to go. She also probably would not be willing to, as she doesn’t feel affected by his behavior. This is a cycle for them that repeats all the time. He is inappropriate or upsets her, then he either apologizes and she moves on, or she just chooses to forgive him. I think they have a very codependent friendship. He’s also told her he thinks I’m controlling and manipulative, so I don’t think it would go well for me to tell her that I don’t want him to live here, and prove him right. I honestly wonder if I *am* being controlling or manipulative by having this response to him being here. What if I'm exacerbating these personal issues so they seem worse than they are, because I want my girlfriend all to myself without her friend around? Without realizing it?  😬 

If his issue is being on the spectrum and not being able to regulate his thinking the same way as us, it would definitely make me feel guilty for shaming him over the way his brain works, but at the same time, these are things that would be inappropriate regardless of that.

I just need to know what to do to help myself. I spend most of the time in our bedroom when he’s home, or will eventually go in there if I’m somewhere else and he walks in. His physical presence feels overwhelmingly visceral and intrusive to me. It’s hard to make eye contact with him as well. I don’t like going into the kitchen and seeing his food because that also somehow triggers anxiety and bad feelings for me. So I have not been eating as much. 

I know my reactions to him being here isn’t all his fault- I’m responding to trauma triggers- so I really do try not to make him feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. It would also hurt my girlfriend if I started being cold to him when he’s not really doing anything outwardly upsetting. She is very attached to him, and gets defensive about him. He’s staying indefinitely because my girlfriend loves that he’s here, but I can’t continue like this. Please be compassionate in your responses. I have no one else to talk to about this."
Need advice for my first date in awhile,9,lxbd3h,3,"Currently on an SSRI that’s clicking well with me, working with a psychologist on my PTSD, doing well and being consistent at work, and overall feeling positive!

She convinced them all that I was the abuser, not her. I almost got in trouble a lot. The counselors at the camp weren’t very aware or caring tho, so nothing happened to me. Whenever I tried to tell them they’d get mad at me, tell me to “shut the **** up” “You’re such a liar” “Ugh what a b****” and stuff. They hated me, told me “go ahead and kill yourself” “Everyone would be so much happier if you didn’t exist” they al thought I was trash. They hurt me too, sometimes she got them into triggering me too (from previous trauma/ptsd). They said I was being overdramatized, “stop faking it”, and stuff. When I tried to tell them about how she raped and touched me they wouldn’t believe me, and even if they did they didn’t react well. I remember being told “Are you serious?! First you accuse her of abuse, now this?! You monster.” “She did that?? Good for her, you had it coming, b****” “Stop lying girls can’t rape girls” “Didn’t you mention orgasming in response?? You must’ve wanted it then, you’re being so ridiculous”. I tried to show them the bruises and cuts I got from her hitting me, or giving examples of what she said to me that hit my feelings, and they’d think I was making it up, that the scars were fake, or that I did it to myself for “proof”. My boyfriend’s the first person to react nicely to it, and I’m still kinda waiting for him to suddenly hate me for it. I was able to convince one person. One person. I thought I would finally get away, it’d finally be okay, I would be safe. Then I watched her get convinced I was lying by her again. Every time I tried to tell her she’d do one of her “punishments”. Raping me, beating me up, choking me, making me watch her beat up the othe girl she abused with me until she was unconscious and even past then, triggering me, cutting me.. At some point I realized they’d never believe me and it’d cause me less pain to just shut up. I still kinda feel like they’re right and I did deserve it, and that I am being over dramatic. But maybe deep down I know I’m not, since I put victim blaming in the TW. My boyfriend says that it’s not and she lied to me, but I’m stil so confused. She continuously gaslighted me into thinking that it was my fault and I made her do it, that I wanted it, etc. etc. I don’t really know anymore

I am so confused ... should I ask my doctor if I have ptsd?,4,lx9hai,1,"I might have ptsd. Or at least reisidual symptoms from an unresolved trauma. I don’t know what to do. at 19 I was date raped by a guy I casually knew. I don’t know for sure and I never will, but I suspect there were date Rape drugs involved. I was a virgin at the time, and I had never even had a real boyfriend yet. I was too scared/ ashamed to tell anyone or report it. I naively thought i could treat it as if it was not a big deal. I even still liked this guy for a while and wanted him to like me ... somehow I thought that would make a difference in what happened. I rationalized and used all kinds of cognitive distortions to avoid accepting the truth of it. I even saw him  and slept with him again ( I actually thought oh well I’m not a virgin anymore so at least I can have fun without worrying about how my first time happens). The second time I slept with him, he didn’t stop when my head was bumping on the wall, and he started without any foreplay or without even asking if it was okay... he didn’t use protection or even pull out. I was so naive and stupid to not speak up for myself and I’m ashamed of that. I guess my self esteem was that bad. 

But after that I started to develop pretty bad depression and anxiety. I dropped out of uni, then enrolled in a college program and panicked and quit 2 days in. I went to community college because my parents insisted that I do something and I almost quit that too. I quit taekwondo which I loved before. I thought about the experience a lot and it made me upset and depressed. I became detached from people that were close to me. I felt afraid going out to places with friends. I refused to meet new people. I started to over eat, and I put on 45 lbs in a year and a half, developed PCOS...I got panic and dread and nausea a lot and I threw up stuff that I ate on purpose because it somehow calmed me even though I knew it was disgusting. 

I worked at a job that I hated and where my boss was abusive towards all the staff and made me cry frequently. I stayed there 10 years because I had no drive anymore. I put on more weight. I lost touch with many friends, and had a lot of trouble making any new ones. There were years that I drank way too much. I avoided dating for a really long time and the ones I did go on made me feel worse. I got confused about my sexuality and thought I was asexual. I felt like I wanted to go back to school to finish my degree but it took me 9 years to decide to go back.

I’m doing better, I have a boyfriend, and a better job, and I’m almost done school. But I’m still overweight and it really hurts me... I want to go back to the way I was before any of this happened. I want to feel pretty again. But it’s so hard ... and not only because it’s hard to lose weight, and because of the pcos. But also because every time I try to make an effort and confront the weight issue with exercise and healthy eating - I struggle with a lot of the feelings that come up when I’m doing it and sooner or later I give up. I feel maybe I still get triggered all these years later. It’s so much to face .... 

I never got diagnosed with ptsd. I’ve always had depression and anxiety since I was 15. I thought the trauma just made it worse. My doctor has been treating me for depression so long... I officially have major depressive disorder. I’ve mentioned that I was sexually assaulted in conversation during visits about other things, but I’ve never focused on that topic with my doctor in one visit. I never got diagnosed with any ptsd and I don’t know if I meet the criteria. I’m very scared. 

Should I ask my doctor. Would it even make any difference ?"
Never ending cycle,12,lx88lr,9,"I just feel I need to get this out and ‘unload’.

Why does it feel never ending, why can’t the ‘box’ stay locked and that be that? 

I don’t want to face it anymore, I’m tired of living with it, I HATE it. I hate knowing that one person changed my life forever without a second thought. 

The things that haunt me I don’t want to admit them, it makes me feel weak, I want to run from it forever. Please go away, I am emotionally exhausted."
Sexual assault memory and realizing it might mean something other than what I thought it did (perspectives wanted)(*trigger warning*),9,lx7u4i,6,"I was sexually assaulted many, many years ago. There is this one aspect of this horrible experience that I didn’t understand much until recently (when I had a full-on very upsetting flashback). Now I wonder if it actually means something else. I want to understand it, as in the real life version not my feelings around it. It helps me process it. I’m trying to understand intention,  etc.

If two guys (18 and possibly 18-21) took two girls to an apartment  after a grad party and it was empty (thought they were giving us a ride home, but vaguely recall them saying just have to go inside for a minute). I remember not wanting to go in, and then thinking what is this place. (no furniture) ... would it seem more likely it was the older person’s apartment or that the older kids’ parents managed the apt building and was able to go in? Do young broke folk often have zero furniture (stark empty)  but a mat on the floor no blankets, nothing?  As in empty apt, smelled like cigarette smoke, and one small mat on the ground

-First guy assaulted me when I went to bathroom.  I said full on NO, tried to say everything in between repeated nos. I have boyfriend, have period, no, want to go home, and also repeatedly saying Stop!  Don’t! Stop please.. Was blocked into a bathroom , not sure what was happening to other girl by other guy...it hurt, and it hurt a lot , rough and remember getting on floor and finding my underwear I think, person left and shut door , something about the other person. I think they were trying to trade. Ugh. I was trying to get my underwear on, but I remember being really upset and not being able to think clearly...then I’ve blocked whatever out.

-what would cause someone to want to put someone in a bathtub naked in the dark/(maybe light from open door?) and then rinse them off, their parts, like making sure water is swished on their vulva etc. This was the second, older guy.. I block out what happened prior.  I have no memory of how got in it, just panic feeling of can’t get out, where are my clothes, what is this person doing,  someone near me in dark rinsing my legs, parts etc.  I hate saying this. I thought it was because maybe I was dirty. I always felt dirty after this. Never felt clean again. Disgusted with my body and my self.

There is a lot more detail that I’m leaving out. I’m not at a point to be able to deal with everything as a whole. I’m breaking it up into smaller increments with the connections and questions that are coming up. 

I’m in the process of starting therapy for this as it’s affected my life greatly. Every relationship. Every sexual encounter. My identity. My stress-response. Panic attacks. Depression. Feeling out of control... Feeling to blame. Feeling ashamed. Feeling like I want to be invisible and no one ever to notice anything about me. 

I refused to think of this for years. I blamed myself. I got scared of men,  I don’t  trust people. I still cry a lot. I wake up scared. My life is one big long run-on day.

All these questions I had about why were we taken to an empty apartment in a crappy building? Why did that person put me in the bathtub and wash me all off...I was so embarrassed to ever tell anyone about this part...

I’d like to know if it’s a sexual thing that people do, or like what just popped into my head today (was this person aware of what they were doing, and washing on purpose)? I always assumed it was not a calculated thing, it was a spontaneous “accident” that occurred.  However, I am suddenly thinking it was much more calculated than I realize.

Sorry for any triggers and I appreciate your perspective on it."
My Parent(s) abused me and don’t regret it,11,lx542g,3,"(TRIGGER WARNING) 

My parents abused my as a kid. And well it wasn’t usually physical or directed towards me but still it’s screwed up to have a parent abuse you, then 10 years later still standing by the abuse with confidence saying stuff like: “you needed to learn a lesson”. Really fucked me up. Now I am a grown “adult” about to graduate(try too) only left with a head full of hate to surround myself with during the day and intense vivid nightmares to look forward to at night. 

I want to have parents again. It’s hard growing up without real ones especially now."
Words that make you feel things (with story),4,lx4ln8,0,"I some super weird ones, but the weirdest, I think, is the word *Metformin*. I'm in medical school and a healthcare worker, so obviously I hear/see/talk about this word often since it's a very common medication for the treatment of diabetes. 

I just want to preface by saying the gun doesn't go off and I still don't completely know how a gun works. I think I blocked as much of that memory as I could.

When I was 15, my dad had a very bad reaction to it and it caused him to have a complete and very scarring psychotic break. He has some severe mental illness, so I'm sure they really played into it. It all started when I asked him how to use one of his guns. He started by showing me how to load it and unload it. When he got to the part where he was showing how to load it, he was explaining how to use the safety and disengage the gun if prepped to fire. He was pulling back the little hammer thingy at the end and it slipped out of his fingers. When the gun didn't go off he just started freaking out and talking nonsense and calling me my mom's name. (He later told me that all he could think about was what would have happened if he accidentally shot me and he just went off the deep end.) I went and told my sisters what happened and what was going on, and then I called my mom and an ambulance. The story goes on from there for a span of two week, with my mom, sisters and I sleeping on the floor of a church because my dad was too dangerous to be around. He finally got forced to go to a psych hospital and we were able to go home to a very trashed house amd try to get what ""normal"" we could back.

During this time, my mom put a lot of pressure on me to take care of my sisters and help her with some very serious stuff. I'm still working through flashbacks and severe reactions to weird things, like completely normal people not making sense when they're talking, even though I know it's just them trying to describe something or whatever so I can understand.

And that's why the word *Metformin* sometimes makes me want to puke."
Dissociating at dangerous times,8,lx4gxi,2,Idk if this is from ptsd but I don’t know where to look anymore. Something bad happened and I forgot about it after a few years. Recently the person who did it sent me a friend request and after that I started experiencing weird feelings. Like emotional flashbacks and sudden feelings of extreme sadness. Worst of all Yesterday I dissociated while driving. I could feel it happening but I couldn’t pull myself out. It’s never happens to me before and it was very scary. Now I’m scared to drive and I don’t know how to tell my husband without him thinking I’m crazy.
i faked having ptsd,64,lx4gco,31,"I know it's terrible and I shouldn't have done this but I literally can't help it anymore.            

I'm a 15 year old girl, and my father molested/raped me when I was a kid (and this is true, from what I remember). But, apart from some intrusive thoughts, I almost never even think about it.             

For the last six months I have been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for suicidal thoughts and depression, and have been hospitalized already five times (I'm in the hospital right now). I don't remember how it started, but sometimes I fake having flashbacks: I focus on my memories really hard until I cry intentionally, just to cause a scene. Also I tell my doctors and nurses that I have nightmares when I sleep, when I really don't.        
I don't know what to do. Coming clean is not an option, because no one would ever believe me again. Also, I told too many people already. Lately I have been telling people it's gotten better, so in a month or so I'll tell them I don't have it anymore. But I still feel really guilty. I'm so sorry for disrespecting yall.

Just joined,2,lx4f53,0,"Hello, I have had ptsd most of my life. I was molested before the age of 5, come from an abusive home and have been raped 2 times in my teens years. I have no memories of the one time being raped and have mostly gotten over being abused/molested but it still has effects on me. The last time I got raped still really bothers me though because I got my friend raped too. I have flash backs to it as I'm calling asleep all the time and worry about having stds because he gave me one. If someone wakes me up or comes in the room while I'm sleeping I will wake up with my fist raised to them. I even did this to my 5 year old sister, I have never hurt anyone though.

I feel guilty for having a childhood trauma that other people where able to get over in 2 weeks as a child.,4,lwzw1k,1,If I where to talk about it here I would get downvoted and would be accused of downplaying more important traumas.

Final VA ptsd level appt,3,lwz05s,0,"I finally concluded my ptsd eval with the VA today - only took 3 weeks of appointments. Unfortunately it will be another week to get the results - waiting will be a bit anxiety inducing, but being crazy has been with me for decades so one more week to find out what's wrong with me is no biggie, right? 

My biggest fear is that I'll be misdiagnosed, or worse yet, be told there's nothing wrong with me. I can't count the number of times I've fled situations to the ER just to have them hook up a bunch of wires and afterwards tell me there's nothing wrong. 

It's so hard sometimes to articulate the terrors and what brings them on - as well as the guilt and shame afterwards. It's as if our language has avoided giving certain feelings and experiences any terminology in an attempt to brush it under the rug.

Anyway, thanks for reading - I hope you all stay safe and keep the demons at bay.

You're not hopeless,37,lwwanv,4,"I want everyone here to understand that no matter what they are going through, you are okay. You are strong no matter what the physical or mental affects are from. You survived and you keep going. Don't let the past take over your present or future. 

It may be difficult at times but you are resilient. You wake up everyday and you do everything you can to the best of your abilities. You deal with what most people can't even imagine. Take a moment to appreciate how far you've come, it doesn't matter if it's a little progress, you've made progress! You might not even recognize that you've made progress but understand that you have. Remember to love yourself and take care of yourself because you are not the reason for your traumatic experience. I believe in you to recognize your distorted thoughts and see yourself as you truly should. It might take time to do so, it might take some work with a therapist or some inner-self work. No matter how you get there you can do it because you are resilient. You are not hopeless. You are not anything to be ashamed of. You are only human. 

Be kind to yourself as you are to others. You recognize them as people with feelings, do so for yourself as well. You are not different, you don't deserve whatever your distorted thoughts make you believe you deserve. You experience emotions and that's okay. It's okay to feel those emotions and they can feel intense but try to remember that they are temporary. I believe that you can see those emotions bubble up and understand it's only human to feel those emotions. I know you can recognize them as scary, but you can get through it. Because you are strong. 

No matter what you're going through and no matter what others say, I believe in you. You might underestimate yourself at the moment, but if you really decide to try and pick yourself up over and over again until you can overcome anything. It's okay to look back on that traumatic event, it's okay to feel those emotions, but keep your head in the present. Lingering too long in the past gives depressive feelings and too long into the future holds anxiety. Breath and focus on the tasks at hand. And I know you can do it. You've already come so far. You're strong. You're resilient. You're human.

Edit: I'm so glad this helped at least some people, I wasn't looking for awards but thank you anyways. If anyone ever needs to talk my DMs are open ❤️"
Should I expect better support from my autistic husband?,3,lww9zc,1,"I don't know what level of support I should expect from my husband. He is Autistic and I know that each person with autism is unique but I seem to have lost perspective on what sort of reasonable support I should expect from him as a reasonable person.

It mostly comes down to the issue I have with having a stress response to his anger. I understand why he struggles with anger, but he seems to think that my reactions to it are my problem.

An example situation:

I was on all fours on the bed to get to the other side since it is against the wall. He had left a pile of washing on the bed and left the game he was playing with friends to move it for me. Unfortunately he was very angry at the game at that moment and when he entered the room it was very abruptly. He threw the clothes onto the floor and the combination left me completely triggered and close to panic. I said stop, yet he threw one more item. I just snapped and screamed ""I SAID STOP"". He just stared at me and slammed the door behind him.

I feel ashamed at my reaction but also proud that I tried to set a boundary. I wish I didn't react that way... It always ruins the day. I have to be up for class in 6 hours and I don't know if I'll be able to sleep after that.

I just don't know whether I should feel like he's not doing enough to support me within our relationship when he just stays angry after that sort of thing and leaves me alone without checking on me... Am I using his autism as an excuse for his behaviour? Should I expect better?

ETA: for any issue I have apart from him, he is a wonderfully caring man. And the weird part to me is that I heard him apologise for yelling at his friend after the incident... And tell him that he's ""sleeping on the couch cos I got angry at video games"". I guess he just doesn't understand or remember that we said that the bedroom was meant to be my safe space."

"Why people blame you, and not your abuser",6,lwss6p,1,"TW: mention of bitch ass people, unfairness and I mention slightly what one of my trauma's are (but I'm not going into any detail)

There is a psychological thing called ""blaming the victim"". Short explanation: people can't handle the fact that other people can do such cruel things. So its easier to blame the victim. And if it's not the victims fault, that means it can happen to anyone, even themselves/the people they care about. So instead of accepting that this is a possible danger for anyone, it's easier to put the blame and responsibility on the victim. 


It's a coping and protection mechanism, which often happens subconsciously. To protect the mind, because some people might not able to handle the truth mentally. 


Not saying its permanent, you can change this. But that is not that easily done.


But that is all I know since I dropped out of my psychological study. So if you want to know more, I'm afraid you have to Google it or something haha.


This knowledge is what keeps me from going insane. I live in a small town and for some reason everyone found out about my r@p€. Me and my family went though a lot of comments about how it's all a lie or how I deserved it. A girl went to my 14 y/o sister to tell her that what happened to me was hilarious. I just need to remind myself that these people don't get it, because they can't. They're fucking shit and I hate them. But it's because they have a problem, and it had nothing to do with me. So I should not punch the 14 year old bitch. Its her problem, not mine.


I hope this knowledge gives you the peace it gives me. 



TLDR: if its not your fault, that means that the world is too scary for them to handle. Also that means that some people are just really THAT bad, which means your abuse/trauma could happen to them or their loved ones too. Blaming you or choosing the side of your abuser is their way of them (subconsciously) protecting themselves."
Badly triggered after long term PTSD from rape,31,lwqoss,4,"I've had PTSD for around 7 years now due to being violently raped at knifepoint by multiple people and tortured. I have managed it well (I think). However I was in work the other week and a male coworker expressed an interest in me. When I rejected him, he came into the room I was taking my break in, locked the door behind him, and continually harassed me for a kiss all day. When I continued to reject him he walked over and kissed me regardless while I shielded my face. This coworker was someone I considered a friend, and someone I trusted. 

I've made a complaint to my boss obviously, and it's being dealt with. But that doesn't stop the anxiety, the hypervigilance, and the night terrors that have now come flooding back when I had just started to feel human again..."
"Mindfulness, Meditation & Trauma",2,lwpxbt,2,"Hi everyone, 

Meditation and mindfulness has for me been a huge help for my ptsd/healing from trauma as well as being (in the beginning) a big trigger. Sitting still with your thoughts when you have ptsd can trigger even more and make you uncover pain you didn't know you had. However, it is often also recommended as a coping strategy. I did some research in my journey and I just wanted to share the resources I found that helped me a lot and share other resources and experiences with other ones going through similar processes. I feel still very alone in my experience and I thought this would be nice as well as able to help others.

I am really curious if this is something other people have experiences with and if you have resources. 

An important disclaimer: please remember that mindfulness and meditation practices are not a substitute for therapy. Remember you need to try an array of methods that work for you and therapy is very very important. Be careful to not go too far and know your own limits when doing mindfulness-based ""inwards"" exercises if you have ptsd, for me it has led to some gnarly situations."

And he flatly apologized eventually and said it was all good on his end, yet was frustrated with me. He said he didn't want me to put my worries on him - that he can't have that on his mind. That he is always fine and nothing will happen and I need to trust him. Except he won't hear me that it has nothing to do with trust.

TW... just a heads up yall. This is my story (short version) and something that happened today that made me freak out.,9,lwlvjz,7,"Almost 6 years ago, right before Easter, 9 guys kicked my door in while I was standing 5 feet away from it, (I had no time to react). My wife, my youngest child, and two friends (a man and pregnant female) were there as well. 
The 9 guys had brass knuckles and immediately jumped on me as soon as they kicked the door in. I was knocked out instantly, don't even remember the event except for starting to turn when I hear the door get kicked. Most of the guys proceeded to pummel  me with the brass knuckles and kick me with steel toed boots. While they are trying to kill me, one of them grabs my wife and throws her out the back door and locks it. Another guy is beating my male friends ass (he was hospitalized with a concussion and minor injuries, they were there for me...). His pregnant wife was shoved into a corner and held there.  My child was in my bedroom with our 3 pitt bulls at the time, & remained in there hiding throughout the event. 
They ran back out of the house before my wife could make it around to the front door. She called the ambulance and started praying. When the ambulance arrived, I was unresponsive to external stimuli, my pupils were fixed and I had zero pain response. I was lying in a 4 foot diameter pool of my own blood. I awoke from a coma (very short term, thank God!) In the hospital, surrounded by cops and drs... both of who started asking me questions. I couldn't move half of my body, or speak to respond. 

Fast forward thru 3 &1/2 years of cognitive, physical rehabilitation & emotional therapy and I can walk, talk & work (go outside) without having crippling anxiety attacks. 

Now I've been back to work for 2 & 1/2 years, haven't had a bad freakout/anxiety attack in like 2 years... im doing good. Yeah me... then I get a FB friend request.  From the ring leader of the 9 guys who tried to kill me.

If you're wondering why he isn't in prison for the rest of his life, there is a twofold answer to your question. 1 we moved right after the incident and the courts didn't get our change of address (we assume because my wife filed one the day we moved) to notify us of the court date. 2 I was hella brain damaged still & utterly afraid to leave the house, so I'm not sure if I would've gone then anyways.


I cant think of but 2 reasons he would reach out to me, he found religion and wants to apologize or he wants to antagonize me... idk what to do"
I feel like my PTSD has made me a shitty and overly needy friend.,6,lwltuo,1,"Background information: I was sexually assaulted in 2018. It’s caused me a pretty significant fear of betrayal and strange men. It’s complicated and it’s made me extremely co-dependent.

A year later in 2019 I met this girl through mutual friends. We hit it off. She’s my best friend in the entire world now. We share everything with each other and hang out every weekend. I haven’t ever had a friend as great as her. She and I have similar interests, values, we love spending time with each other — she’s like a sister to me. Every weekend I spend at her apartment so we can cook, watch movies, etc.

But I think sometimes I’m too needy for her. She’s so independent. I, myself, am not. She basically raised herself because of neglectful and abusive parents. My parents spoiled me. She lives on her own at 22 and I still live at home because I’m scared to move out. She has her own car, I can’t even drive because I have test anxiety and have struggled for years to get my license (embarrassing, I know). And on top of that, I can’t trust myself to do anything. If I’m going pretty much anywhere or doing anything at all, I need her to be there.

She works so much. Every day of the week. And as supportive as she is, I know she’s tired and can’t/shouldn’t always have to be there for me. But I feel very lost without her. I was already pretty spoiled before but my sexual assault has made me...fearful to do anything. It’s just made my inability to be independent so much harder. 

I don’t really know what to do or how to talk to her about this without sounding like a bummer or sounding manipulative. Any advice?"
First trigger,2,lwlphg,1,"During my 30s I went through multiple miscarriages & failed infertility treatments. After ten years, we ended up adopting our two kids so I thought I was ok.

It was like I was right there again, losing all the pregnancies at once, like I never left that place of grief. I was so horrified I came home & drank a lot. I went through years of therapy for childhood sexual abuse. I guess I’m supposed to deal with this now. Fuck."
I'm feeling a bit strange,2,lwkl0j,2,"I'm not going to assume I have PTSD, but I will say something feels wrong, like my experiences aren't exactly as bad as most here, so I'm really confused, should I really think I might have PTSD or should I just act like it's minor and it'll go?

But to give an idea of what I went through:
In primary school I was weird, rattled and couldn't seem to keep my head straight, school felt like an entrance to prison.

In secondary school, I was bullied, getting kicked, shoved, pressured into fighting and looked down on by others. I've had money stolen at times as well.

In college, things seemed to reach another level, I wasn't just bullied, I was gaslit. I was repeatedly told everything was just jokes, but it wasn't funny, I expressed my annoyance several times. Here's a list of things that was done but don't seem to be done between themselves:

Throwing crisp packets at me

Throwing bottles at me

Peer pressured into horseplay

Repeatedly challenged to fight

Name calling

Holding onto my stuff to annoy me until the end of class

Filming me getting angry

Falsely accused me of being in the wrong

Peer pressured into a fist fight, making me throw the first punch and made fun of me for losing

Tried to scare me with a knife (this was an electrician course so a utility knife was needed for cutting cables and wires or something)

Staring and copying my actions in class

Kicking my chair during an exam

Telling me I'm getting loud after a witty comeback

Constantly reminding me they were joking

Since that time I thought I was unaffected, but was I? The trauma seems to come and go, at times it gets very severe and sticks. It did make my depression much worse and kept me out of college at times too, I remember flinching when one of the bullies walked past me. I still get flashbacks and still avoid new people, avoiding sitting with strangers if possible, I avoid interaction with anyone unless they speak to me first so then I can see what they're like. I simply can't get myself to risk going through what I went through again, so I make myself look like the strong silent type, but really I'm just a pussycat.

I'm not sure what to do, my parents have heard me talking about mental health several times, I'm afraid they'll think I'm mad for suggesting PTSD is a possibility. I wish I had a car and money, I'd just run and get help."
Sick of people not taking you seriously because you were “lucky”,24,lwk37t,8,Yeah I didn’t die so I was “lucky”. So I should be thankful and not be panicking and it’s not a big deal apparently
How do I get to open up to my therapist about my trauma?,11,lwho88,5,"Sorry if this is not allowed, since I'm not professionally diagnosed with PTSD. But that's the reason why I'm asking this.

I started going to therapy at the beginning of this year. I've had only 5 sessions so far, but I still want to wait more time until I get to trust her best. I am asking this for now so I can process it for a longer time until I'm ready. 

And I am also very scared and concerned of me not being able to open up to her, because usually when I talk about my trauma in person I start crying and I start getting too much flashbacks, its overwhelming and kind of embarrassing. Any advice to overcome with this?"
I don't know what to do?,2,lwgm52,0,"This is difficult to articulate so please be patient.

Part of my trauma is from being sexually abused. I meet someone i chould make myself vulnerable to and see myself getting intimate with but he broke my heart in a very cruel manner.

I met someone the other day, he lives down the hall from me. He invited me over, fed me, we watched a movie. He put his hand under my shirt and rubbed my back. He was a gentleman about it, didn't mess with my bra or anything. And i let it happen.

I don't recall the last time I've had human contact. A couple months ago maybe? And i was so touch starved i told him not to stop when he backed off.

But i don't know if I'm ready to be vulnerable again, if I'm ready to be intimate in any manner. He seems like a nice guy, very respectful and giving. But my head is so muddled i don't know if I'm ready to even try going anywhere. I'm still at the point where it feels like people being nice to me is a trap, but I'm so freaking lonely."
Mind is playing too realistic tricks on me - anyone else experiencing the same?,3,lwghf5,0,"Today I prepared a package to be send out for repair. It’s a timer switch. I prepped it this morning. 

Just before hopping into bed I see the timer switch laying on my desk next to my books. So, I grab it just to check if it is really the timer switch or sometimes else (bc  of impaired eyesight). I am stunned that I am holding the time switch in my hands since I am confident that I put it in the parcel earlier. So I check my room for the other functioning switches to see if I maybe took one of them out, put it on my desk and forgot about it. But no, all are still in place. And I am still confused about it all and my memory tell me I did put the switch in the box. I can even see and feel the memory. 

And then it hit me - I almost send out an empty package to the repair shop and my mind played another one of his tricks on me. I open up the package and expect to only see wrapping stuff. But no, I put something in the parcel - a plug distributor. The same one I was searching for today. All is fine now, I repackaged the box and I will ship it tomorrow. 

This isn’t the first time my mind plays tricks on me. I’ll give you another example: 
about four weeks ago I went to the supermarkt to buy pizzadough so I could make pizza’s that weekend. So I went to the store, picked it out, put it in my shopping cart, my bag, checked the receipt, put it in the fridge and didn’t look at it until I needed it again (about 5 or 6 days later). And that was the first time I saw that I hadn’t bought pizzadough, I bought two boxes of puff pastry. The MOST nauseating food to exist on this world, I simply hate it. So how come I brought this home instead of my pizzadough?! 

Does anyone else have these experiences too? Being confident you did the thing you wanted to do and even your memory backs you up but later you found out it was another trick of the mind?"
Two car accidents causing me distress (neither one my fault),6,lwdsy8,0,"I'm 22 and I just got in my second car accident two days ago. No one was injured (although I'm very sore and have some nasty bruises) but the accident was bad enough to total both of our cars. A woman ran a blinking red light and hit me on the passenger side of my car, sending me over a curb and kind of far out into a field area. Luckily my car went in between a pole and a tree instead of hitting one of them head on. I had the right of way (yellow on my side) and was not speeding or distracted, but there was nothing I could do to prevent it. The cop at the scene gave her a ticket for failure to yield and she was upset and shocked because I guess she didn't believe it was her fault. She claimed to her insurance company that the intersection was a four way stop, but after my claim my insurance guy told me he Google Mapped the road and saw very clearly it was NOT a four way stop and she will likely be found at fault.

My first accident was very similar. I went through my green light and someone ran through a red light, hitting me on the drivers side door this time. Again, no major injuries and both cars totaled. The other driver was also issued a ticket and multiple witnesses and the police report verified that the other driver was at fault.

I know I'm lucky to be okay after two pretty serious accidents, but I feel so unlucky. I'm having a really hard time coping this time. When it happens once you just brush it off and say it was a crazy happenstance. But happening almost exactly the same way only three years apart is freaking me out. I'm a very safe and cautious driver (which probably sounds hard to believe but it's true). I drove on the same road today to get to work and was nervous but made it fine. I feel anxious behind the wheel and afraid that it will happen again. Even as a passenger Everly movement another car makes has me worrying. It's really scary to know that you can be doing everything right and you can still get injured, or worse. I almost feel doomed, like I should never drive again.

I don't know if I have PTSD but I am definitely feeling different. I feel kind of numb mentally. All I can think about is the accident. I keep running through how it happened and I keep pondering why it has happened to me twice. I've been tired for the past two days and I just feel like shutting myself in my room because I don't want to talk to anyone. I really feel like I don't know if I'll ever be okay with driving again. I know I have to, but I don't know how much driving I can handle anymore.

I don't know what I expect to gain from posting this but if anyone has advice or wisdom or a story to share please drop it in the comments. I would really appreciate hearing from other people about this :)"
First time posting in a group like this and hope I am doing this right.,7,lwdl01,0,"I think the flare is right for this.
I have lived 4 years with a abusive idiot. My sister lived with him longer than me. He tempted me into moving in with the lure of low rent and plentiful high paying job opportunities. It started slow with him raising my rent from 200 to 400 a month. He made a great excuse by saying that it was because we would be moving into a house and I would have my own room. He failed to tell me that the ‘house’ would be a vermin infested dung heap. It finally got to the point where he would insist on most of my paycheck and when I tried to refuse and just pay him the 400. He would say that if I did not like it that I could get out. He knew full well that I had no where to go. 

He also started off as being nice to me but gradually he would add chores that I would need to do. It was reasonable at first: clean my room every week, do dishes every other day. But soon it would be to mow a huge field with a push mower in the middle of a hot summer day. This was because at the time I worked mornings and would get off around 3. Also every small thing would set him off and he would threaten to kick me out: not be at his beck and call when he asked, being in the bathroom at the wrong time, or having ‘attitude’. 

It was worse for my sister: she had to empty his puss cups as he was to lazy to get up and go to the bathroom himself, make tea for him even if she was struggling to walk as it was a bad day for her back, cook dinner even if she could barely walk and use a deep frier even though he knew full well that she hated doing it. 

It would not have been so bad if it was not for the fact that he 
A. Did not have a job and had no drive to get one
B. Was not getting unemployment and had no drive to do so
C. Spent any extras money outside of  paying for utilities and bare minimum groceries on him self in the form of games and cigarettes. 

We would probably be still trapped there if it was for the fact that his best friend came to live with us and saw the shit he was putting us through and sneaked first my sister and then me out of there. Though he caught me as he was paranoid after my sister suddenly ‘disappearing’. I left after her because I had to confirm a job transfer.

I still have nightmares of me being back there and having to do all the things he made my sister do. And she does too."
Emotionally conflicted,4,lwd77y,1,"My ex step mom is at my dad's, after her new boyfriend beat her up. I live with my dad now, after my mom abused me in every way possible for 7 years. My ex stepmom completely invalidated my trauma, and called me a liar and theif back when she lived with us. She cheated on my dad with her new boyfriend because she wasn't getting pregnant, and her alcohol addiction went too far, and now I don't know how to feel, because my dad was in a terrible place after they got divorced and when all that stuff was going on, and it's still difficult for my dad to really understand my trauma, and I'm still trying to deal with all my PTSD and trauma and constant nightmares and now there's the possibility she will come live with us, or be back if the boyfriend beats her up again, since she doesn't want to call the police on him. 

I sympathize with her, obviously, but I am scared for my dad because he was in a terrible spot, even though he's hurt me a little in the past, so everything is confusing."
"Body, sexual body parts, and confused feelings",4,lwbftx,4,"So, I have a history of sexual abuse and childhood traumas. I have some really strange feelings that I don’t understand and was hoping someone could give me insight. 

Basically, I feel extremely triggered by seeing other people’s physical body parts/genitals of the same sex. Realistically, I know everyone is different and has different appearances etc.. but for some reason that does not sit well with me. The fact that I am different makes me feel uncomfortable. I don’t want to be “different”. I want to be the best. I want the best looking vagina, boobs, etc. I feel like the fact that there is so much variety among people, makes me feel like there’s a possibility that I am not living up to someone’s standards.. and I can’t handle that. I want to fit EVERYONES standards. Is it a control thing?"
All the smoke detectors in my apartment went off at once...,8,lwajl1,2,"And even though I didn’t know it wasn’t a real fire, I was still able to stay cool-headed and grab everything important! No crying, no extreme panicking, no attack. I was focused on one thing and one thing only: “what do I need in case I lose it all?”

And I was quickly able to make the decisions: medical records, purse, laptop, stuffed animals (I only have 4 here). I tried for meds, but i realized I didn’t have my key to the lock (they’re in a locker drawer) readily available, so I was able to let those go in the moment, and whatever else is in the drawer. 


The next thing was to help make sure we got all the cats, but by that time the alarms stopped. 

I genuinely thought it was the entire building, but despite that I was able to think clearly. I have hope for myself in case there is a real fire next time."
Why do people always take the side of the people that caused my mental illness,116,lw940h,41,"I seem like the bad guy now because people think I’m like this for attention, maybe I don’t belong here"
"I am a danger to myself, instead of talking I direct my emotions into physical harm onto me.",30,lw8c2k,7,"I just can't trust anyone around me, I know that I'm supposed to but It is hard. My trauma stems from people who were supposed to love, support, care and protect me. I struggle to form close relationships because I have intrusive thoughts and nightmares related to my past but I'm also having new violent dreams about the people who appear as though they would not do that.

I keep seeing these small signs that lead me to overthink the way people feel about but then the feeling gets stronger and more believable because the logic doesn't point anywhere else, I feel like I am going insane because no one else but me sees it, only I feel this way and I am at a point where these thoughts make me hurt myself.

My mind is branding theses thoughts into my head and I feel so unwell lately. I just need to be around people who understand... I am tired of my trauma consuming my every thought, I just want to be sedated, I just can't take it. I was doing so well fighting these thoughts but now they just make me have aggressive outbursts."
I may have red flags of ptsd,6,lw6ays,2,My dad died when I was 7 or 8 I heard him die in the next room his room was next to the waiting room in the hospital and the same year my grandfather killed himself I was really close to both of them like they were my best friends.

Also I get extreme paranoia. And suicidal dreams after my nightmares. I’m not suicidal just wondering if it’s sighs of ptsd or not my doctor thinks it is.

"Drugged, Carjacked, and Who Knows What Else",6,lvvn6w,3,"I won’t make the story too long, but basically several months ago, I was drugged when I went out alone and carjacked. I only have memory of a dark haired dude sitting in my car while I was terrified and crying, a memory of standing in a convenience store crying, another memory of me standing on a road in front of the driver door, another of being driven around in the backseat of an unknown car, and a final memory of being in an ambulance. I woke up the next day next to my husband, explained what I remembered, and then we made our way to the ER to do a rape kit. 

Apparently my husband was in touch with the police during the course of me being missing that night and picked me up from the ER. Rape Kit status is still pending and I’m of course in therapy and have been struggling immensely.

I guess I’m writing here because silly me was sharing a little bit of this experience on a different subreddit along with all the horrible crimes I have witnessed in Seattle in the past 6 months (which only made my anxiety and ptsd worse), and this really awful person started calling me psycho and following me to other subreddits calling me that name again. I also suffer from CPTSD from childhood abuse, and this kind of sent my inner critic into full force, and I’m just feeling a lot of sadness, guilt, and shame."
Therapist told me I'm brain damaged & mentally disabled because of PTSD,3,lvv396,8,"I told her that I found her characterization a offensive; I'm not sure I think that getting sexually assaulted and developing PTSD makes me mentally disabled?

I feel like freak, broken, and misunderstood. I feel really insecure now, worried that maybe I'm just a broken person who will never have anything but a limited life; maybe she's right about me. I'm angry, doubting myself, and raw."
Dealing with guilt.,5,lvuept,5,"So I'm a single mom and I have a four year old daughter, and she's absolutely my everything and I love her from the bottom of my heart. As she's getting older and just this super curious and playful being, she can be really aggressive when we play. Like sometimes she'll pull my hair (playfully, not to hurt me) or pull on my arm, or hug me super super tight, squeeze me etc. And I've been finding myself just going into full blown panic. Like my heart will start racing and sometimes I'll end up just raising my voice (not to yell but just yelling out ""stop it, PLEASE""). 
It's just sometimes we'll be playing and having fun, and of course it's so easy for kids to get over excited.
Of course I've used this as a teaching opportunity to talk about how we need to respect when someone says no, they don't like something, or want to stop playing a game (even if it's right in the middle of the game and they were initially having fun but decide its not fun anymore), consent in general. 
But I just can't help but feel so guilty and sad about it. Of course I can't explain why mommy gets so scared, obviously not an age appropriate conversation. It can get really frustrating when ptsd manifests itself in totally innocent situations and it's so easy to feel resentful towards the past when these things happen. 
I'm just wondering if anyone has any feedback or has gone through something similar and might have some insight on how they've dealt with it or talked themselves through a similar situation."
Triggered from webcomics,2,lvticb,0,"Hi 👋 I'm new here.

Anyways, I don't really get triggered often. It's a relatively small occurrence for me, even when media is marked with a trigger warning I rarely find myself affected by it. But today, I found myself shaking while reading this webcomic. It's almost as if the person who wrote it did so completely from personal experience. Every nuance to the scene was spot on to how I felt and thought during my trauma. At first I was impressed, taken aback by the accuracy of the depiction. But before I realized it, my hands were shaking and my heart was beating out of my chest. Since it was only a mild reaction, I continue reading webcomics like this. Its like I've been spooked by a scary movie, unable to sleep for a week and nervous. I know its not healthy for me to subject myself to this stuff, but I can't help it.
Do you guys think I should avoid reading stuff like this?"
"I'll take not dreaming for 1000, Alex.",1,lvs7ce,1,"My SIL passed in 2012. I won't get into how, but it ""rejuvenated"" the PTSD that I'd been gifted as a child. It was a hot 6 months after my father passed suddenly. For eight years I didn't dream. At all. Not nightmares, not fun flying dreams, NOT. ONE. DREAM. 

I knew it meant I wasn't ""properly"" dealing with anything, but it meant I was sleeping, and anytime I could sleep was a win.

In the past year give or take, I started having dreams again. Every goddamned night. Vivid, intense dreams that I wake from disoriented, and have to remind myself hours later that it was just a dream. That I wasn't interrogated by my bosses about cappuccino mix.

I haven't had flashbacks (yet) or nightmares, but I'd love to get back to NOT dreaming. Am I alone in this?"
Do I have PTSD or some kind of trauma?,1,lvs6ut,1,"Hi. I (F21) just recently did a burn out, possibly because of my GAD and its limitless insecurities. I got diagnosed with GAD at 15, and sometimes its worse sometimes its okay, its kinda mild symptoms. The point is, I noticed that, even though I’m a highly nervous individual, when I see someone drunk/high (out of control intoxicated) in a social scenario, i get very irritated, angry and mean. I really just dont feel good and i have a very weird feeling that it will be out of control soon, when sometimes, it’s actually manageable drunkenness. With my therapist today, I was able to put into words all of that and we resurfaced one of my childhood “traumatic” experiences in which my mom and my aunts got into a fight (a physical fight) at Christmas dinner, and my little brother who was 2 1/2 that time was persecuted as a result. I was maybe 11-12 but I still have a very vivid/core memory of my little brother being in the middle of this when I think about all of this. Is this PTSD? Should i seek more help about this? I never really thought of this situation as threatening to my survival when I was a kid, but when I think about it now, I see how my young self could have perceived it as dangerous. Thanks all, hope it goes well for you xx"
Is this PTSD?,3,lvrajh,1,So my parents are kinda emotionally abusive and whenever i hear footsteps or people walking towards my direction it makes me freak out. Like today my parents were walking around downstairs and just their footsteps made me want to start screaming for them to shut up. And whenever I hear them approaching my room my immediate reaction is to hide or to start crying. Or when we had a handyman at our house once I heard him walking in the direction of my room and I automatically shut my computer (which I was doing school work on so nothing bad) and picked up a book to pretend to be reading so he wouldn’t think I was lazy. I knew the handyman wasn’t my parents but I still felt as if it were them walking down the hall and that I had to do something productive quick or I would get in trouble. Also I should add that one time in early covid I had online class and my parents were walking around downstairs because they were exercising and I literally hid in my closet for 30 mins in fear that they would walk into my room even though I knew they were downstairs. Could this be PTSD?

I went grocery shopping during the worst possible time and was able to actually complete the trip!,6,lvqfiz,0,"TW: Descriptions of hyper-vigilance and anxiety/panic (I'm still learning the rules here so sorry if thats not what one writes here).

tldr; My trip to the store felt like I was existing in a horror film, but I actually did it.

I apologize if this doesn't belong here, but I had to share with people who would understand.   
I've been having a rough go of things on and off this past month. Sleep and diet issues, hyper-anxiety paired with bouts of depression being the major factors among other things. I've been having difficulty finding work, but we get by with enough budgeting, so I've taking on the role of stay-at-home dad. This includes things like handling the meal-planning and shopping.

I usually try to shop around mid-morning as the store is MUCH less crowded. Loud unexpected noises and crowds in general really ramp up the anxiety and hyper-vigilance. Well, after a bad night of sleep and a fair bit of physical pain in the morning I was feeling so drained I just didn't want to do a thing. Thing is, we needed food in the house, and we had splurged on grocery delivery the past two weeks in a row. The nature of my wife's job makes it so she has to be present at almost all times. So I told myself I would take some time in the morning to just mentally prep for the chore and go in the afternoon. Just robot my way through it. I figured around 2:00 would be good, the lunchtime crowd would be gone and the post-work crowd wouldn't have arrived yet. Right?

Folks, I was very very wrong. I forgot about after-school shoppers. I almost turned right around the moment I saw how crowded it was, but I knew I'd feel like a failure and that would just make things worse.  

It was like a gauntlet of everything that makes my body tense up. Random children screaming out, carts ramming into each other, no social distancing whatsoever, lots of sudden movement. I was sweating and shaking almost immediately, trying to focus on my list but also be aware of everyone around me (easy, right?). I can't tell you how many times I'd turn around and someone would be directly behind me. FOUR times I had people REACH OUT FROM BEHIND ME to get something on the shelf I was standing in front of, making me almost scream. There were so many times I wanted to just abandon my cart and run out. By the time I got to the register my eyes were tearing up, my heart was racing, and I felt ill from clenching my stomach muscles for an hour. 

But. I. Fucking. Did. it. For the first time in almost a month I managed to leave the house and buy everything my family needed. I maaaay have burst into tears the moment I shut the car door and probably got some odd looks as I ugly cried for the entire drive home, but I don't care. It's been an extremely rare experience lately but I feel proud of myself."
Empowered gaslighting is bullshit,20,lvok73,3,"Thanks for those that are downvoting my post in a PTSD support subreddit.  You are some truly special people.

I did my first session of EMDR today, second session with a new therapist.  And I was feeling really down about the direction she wanted to take things.  I felt like she is trying to push me to be more socially open when that isn't really what my goal is.  She had me focus on the idea that ""the world is a safe place"" and do homework to challenge my idea that it isn't.

But after thinking about it for a while, I think more than anything I am angry because it feels like a really convoluted way of victim-blaming.

I feel like the things she said all come back to this root where we should be able to tell good people from bad people and if we could just learn the signs we could comfortably move through this life again, untarnished by our traumas.

In our session, I told her that there were things with one trauma that, looking at them now, I feel like it was evident this guy didn't want anything more than sex from me, our friendship was a sham and me today would have recognized that and wanted nothing to do with him.  She wanted me to focus on how I would have acted differently as a way to feel like the world is safer than I give it credit for.  I understand how realizing those things can be helpful, but hindsight is twenty-twenty and you cannot possibly know how a situation will play out until you are in it.

Any other notion is purely theoretical, and, in my opinion, garbage.  You can be prepared, I suppose, but that isn't a guarantee.

If I examine another of my traumas, I was living at a house full of youths smoking pot, and the father that owned the house didn't care.  With my adult lens this sends off horrible red flags, I would never want a child to be in a place like this.  But abuse happens in houses that otherwise seem normal too.

In the first trauma I experienced, a friend's old babysitter smoked a joint with us before offering to help with my homework.  My adult brain that is wired for red flags is telling me it is a risk to go into the house of someone you don't actually know, especially one that would smoke a joint with kids.  But people are assaulted by people close to them all the time, not just strange ne'er do wells.  People who don't use drugs.  People who were trusted.  People in respected positions of authority.

I think it is easy to look at my situation and think that I should have done a better job of protecting myself when I was a teenager, and that guilt is one of the darkest things I struggle with personally.  But at the same time that those people were doing drugs and being nefarious, there I was with them doing the same, and yet I have never had the urge to hurt someone.

To act as though bad people have specific attributes discredits individuals with shared attributes, such as drug addiction, who have never had violent urges or have successfully suppressed the ones they have had.  It isolates people who have been victimized by individuals who don't fit stereotypical depictions of violent offenders.

And most importantly, it undermines all victims because being in a bad situation is never an invitation to violence. PERIOD.

Bad people don't look or act a certain way, sometimes the only thing connecting them is their violent actions.

If we could continue with the moment we have been gaining, that the most proactive way to address this is by treating perpetrators of violence like criminals, maybe one day there won't be a constant stigma that victims just need to know better.

To suggest someone disregard the lessons they feel their trauma has taught them while at the same time relying on information they have because of that same trauma is insensitive.

As always, thanks for listening."
How do you identify your stuck points?,2,lvo53h,1, I’m doing CPT therapy and am having difficulty defining them because I know theyre illogical

Return of intrusive thoughts,3,lvkjle,0,"Traumatic experience (major surgery at young age) 8 years ago. First 2 years has night terrors, intrusive thoughts including imagery and idk just shit like ""you should Google a photo of the op"" which I obviously don't want to do. Went away nearly completely since then. Suddenly come back. Idk what to do, I just want to feel like I can safely go to sleep."
Just started EMDR and not feeling sure about my therapist,1,lvk7y5,2,"Hey everyone!  Hope you are well!

I have just started doing EMDR with a new therapist and I am having really mixed feelings about it.

My main goal is to have better sexual functioning, as I can't seem to really get into it and enjoy myself unless I have had a little alcohol, even though my husband is a wonderful man and we have been together for ten years.

My therapist seems really focused on the fear I feel in a general sense.  I have been through three traumas and, after a lot of therapy, I feel like anything can happen in the world and that is just life.  I feel like that is a deep truth that I will never forget.  It no longer keeps me up at night or causes me to get panic attacks when I go out in public.  At this point, I just don't really have much of a social need.  I like to be by myself and my husband and family (parents, nephews, and in-laws) take up all the social time I feel I can give.  I know that my social need is low because of my PTSD, but it doesn't really bother me.

My therapist wants me to think of daily goals that will challenge my fearful beliefs and encourage me to be more social.  But I don't really know what that is supposed to mean.  She said ""like going to the grocery store alone"", but I told her I already do that.  Two years ago I went to stay on farms for a work stay without my husband to learn about farming and it was hard but pretty panic-free.  A couple of years ago I had a work friend and we would do game nights with our SOs, but it ended when she left the workplace and stopped returning my calls (it doesn't really bother me).  I think I do put myself out there when it feels like it makes sense to do so.  I don't really feel like I have the time or desire for friends, so I don't really want to go out and actively seek a friendship, but if something came up I wouldn't avoid it.  There are still risks I wouldn't take, even if I had a male friend I don't imagine I would invite him to hang out in a private place just the two of us.  But I have been in private places with men, on the farms, at work, and when we stayed in an Airbnb, without it causing me distress.

I feel like she expects me to just let go of that fear I have, but for me, it feels like the fear doesn't control me anymore or stop me from doing anything.  It is more like it is just a knowledge now, like the worst is always possible so don't ignore the signs and enjoy every moment that is good.

Maybe I am just resistant, but I am not sure how it is supposed to be any better than that.

Have others gone through the same thing?  Did you get better than you imagined in your wildest dreams and I need to work harder on the process?  Would you find a different therapist?

In my last intensive round of therapy five years ago or so now (talking every day) the goal was moving past that sense that the fear dominated my life.  I was incredibly unwell at that point and I have made huge progress and maintained it very well.  I feel like my old therapist would still be proud of where I am and I am not sure that she would be pushing me so hard towards something more.

I am having trouble gauging my expectations, of myself and the process.  

Am I right to feel this way or am I just kidding myself?

Thanks for listening."
Just need a little encouragement to keep healing and fighting,9,lvk31v,2,"So I'm currently in CPT for a lifetime of trauma and it's hard as hell. I feel like I'm being split in half. I recognize my stuck points and see how illogical they are (hell I've taken the LSAT like it's so easy to see how they're flawed) but it's so hard to try and believe anything else. 

Specifically I'm having a lot of problems getting over the suicide of my Dad. My mom was in a car accident that basically left her a vegetable in 2005. She's still alive but of course over the years we had crazy financial problems because of the cost of her care and my dad was really depressed. Like stay in bed for days and days depressed. But as a kid you just assume that he's tired or something from working all the time. 

Anyway I survived all that bullshit and was in college killing it in 2017 when out of the blue my dad killed himself. Forensic evidence was kinda sus and because of shitty police work I didn't find out how he died until weeks after we already had his funeral. So for the past four years I just completely ignored how he really died. Like completely. Had a dead dad but that was it really.  And of course then I was left with the responsibility of my mother and younger sibling who was still a minor. 

And basically CPT is tearing me apart. It feels like to come to terms with how he really died I have to destroy myself. It's so much easier to think that he just died rather than him deliberately leaving all of this to me at only 19, and leaving his disabled wife behind. He was all my mom had. No one else in our family cares about her or sees her in the nursing home. It just feels like healing comes with the trade off of having to destroy all the happy memories I had with my dad. If I face the reality of his life, death, and legacy, then I have to face the reality that those happy childhood memories I had running around unsupervised weren't so happy. And that all the times he said he loved watching me grow up that he was lying. Because he chose to stop watching us grow up. I had no parents at my college graduation as a first generation student because his selfish choice.

Greiving a suicide sucks. In my experience in sucks worse than financial trauma, medical trauma, or being in a severe car accident. I feel like it was the cherry on the trauma sundae that has damned my life to sadness and these awful awful PTSD symptoms. I stay high all the time just to get through my days. Someone please tell me this CPT stuff just gets worse before better. I need to feel like it isn't for nothing or I'll shut down and stop feeling again. 

Anyway. Hope you guys are hanging in there. Took so long to get here and it's hard to have all your toxic post trauma thought patterns looking at your pain while healing and telling you that not feeling really was the right way all along. Best of luck wherever you're at on your journey. I hope to come back here one day and share some story about how I no longer have any symptoms but in this low moment that feels like a pipe dream. 

Thanks for letting me vent 💗"
Keeping a 'diary' helped me to believe myself,41,lvjjlc,5,"When I started university, I began a diary of the various things I did, saw, and thought during my studies. Uni's wild, and if you're going to keep a diary at any point in your life, that's probably the time to do it. Now that I'm working, it's fun to look back and reminisce.

I couldn't predict the traumatic events that would happen during those years, nor any aftermath of existing issues - but having them recorded, hours or a day or two after they happened, forces me to accept I'm not hysterical, or a liar.

It helped therapists diagnosing me with something I didn't even know I had, and it helped the police. Whenever I find myself just not believing my own memories, I still occasionally go back and reread things.

I'd recommend the same for anyone else - even if you're not recording anything you think is special. Bit of a retroactive success, I suppose."
I don’t feel anything yet... so when is coming?,4,lvireb,4,"TW: online predators, home invasion, sexual assault, child porn

Hi there! I’m a 20f who started therapy because I was struggling with anxiety and depression. It turns out that it was ADHD the whole time, but that’s another story...

I suffered trauma as a kid from an internet predator pedophile who groomed me and forced me to send him pictures and explicit videos. I honestly thought I was in love with him, and then it was explained to me he was using me. My step mom thought my behavior with this man was “slutty” and kicked me out of the house after a string of abusive behaviors on her part. I was 12, and my dad is still married to her. They live out in California now. I never went to therapy for it and my family hasn’t spoken of it Since. The pedo got released from prison in 2016 and I felt... nothing? 

Last January a man broke into my sorority house and entered my room. He watched me sleep and I woke up to him masturbating over me. I screamed and he fled and my sisters called the police. And my life just... went on?  I didn’t miss a class, didn’t get any extensions. They haven’t caught him and I haven’t checked in with the police at all. 

When I talk about those situations in therapy I don’t FEEL anything. No fear, no sadness... it’s like they never happened. But for the first time the other day, I got super triggered seeing someone who LOOKED like the online pedophile and I felt sick to my stomach.

I’m terrified that all of this shit will remerge with more panic attacks or that I’m already suffering from PTSD but it’s getting conflated with my adhd, anxiety, and depression (all of which I’m medicated for).

TDLR:
Why can’t I feel anything about this trauma? Maybe I’m just lucky and I got out of all these things scot free without emotional impact but the eery internal stillness I feel regarding all these situations is disturbing. It’s been years! When will the shoe drop?

Has anyone else experienced severe numbness for years after situations? And when did the numbness end so you could confront your issues?"
Any recommendations for non-spiritual guided imagery sessions?,3,lvhi9e,1,"My therapist is adamant I continue with her guided imagery voice recordings but I can’t let go of how goofy they are. 

The pseudo-spiritual guiding of healing energy is a huge turn off for me, as is the encouragement to dissociate and bring my mind someplace else.

I want guided imagery that will actively help me heal, that actively attacks the negative memories, even if it is extremely difficult/painful. 

Any recommendations are very appreciated. The ones by Belleruth Naperstek are the ones that aren’t working for me."
Can you get over a trigger?,13,lvh20p,7,There’s a certain video game that I really love but I can’t play it because I was playing it when the traumatic experience happened. It’s my favorite video game but every time I try to open it now it’s extremely triggering and it’s too painful to play.

I want to drop out of high school from PTSD,3,lvgrdw,16,"I’m in grade 11 and about to turn 17. In grade 9 I was drugged and sexually assaulted by someone I thought I could trust. I was diagnosed with PTSD and every single day I’ve been thinking about dropping out.

I always wanted to become a doctor, but it’s hard just to simply go to a high school class. The night of the traumatic event, I did my math homework, so doing math is a trigger for me now. I can’t graduate high school without my math credits. And I can’t do any sort of math without getting a panic attack. Because of this, my grades are dropping and my attendance is weak. I’ve always been a straight-A student but PTSD changed that. 

I just don’t want to be one of those high school dropouts that can barely get by. However, at the same time, I can’t go another day to school. I’m the smartest kid in my grade but my PTSD is making me stuck and I’m becoming suicidal. It makes me feel worse that my attacker went to university and because of him, I can’t even get a high school diploma. Is there anyone who’s made it through schooling with PTSD? Anyone who’s dropped out and been successful? Anything at all is appreciated."
Screaming at my memories?,4,lvgp4w,2,"So I'm not professionally diagnosed with PTSD but it's been pointed out to me several times by people online and offline and recommended I seek therapy which eventually when in the right situation i plan to but currently it's not an option. But I'm not here to talk about therapy and therapists I'm actually here to get something explained to me and to ask a question I'm needing answers to so if we can please focus on that instead.  

Does anyone with PTSD have memory's come back to them either something someone said to them or a memory of something they regret and you start screaming and yelling at the memory to shut up? It almost feels like the memory subsides for as second but of course it's a memory and it comes back. And it's usually just a repeat of me screaming at the memory to shut up the entire day of half the day. It's like my brain wants the memory to stop being intrusive when I'm trying to have a good day. 

Why am i screaming at my memory? does anyone else do this? is it a flash back? idk what this is and i just need a resource to why I'm doing it so i can better understand it."
TW: Loss/Death. How to work through painful triggers,1,lvdgjb,0,"TLDR at end. ; My mother passed away when I was young. I now have trauma around losing people I love. Whenever I see posts about other people experiencing things like surgery, loss, sickness, it sends me into this spiral of worrying about losing more people I love. I want to be able to move through this but I don't know how to. When the emotions are high I focus on grounding and calming myself but then I don't want to address the trigger later and work through it.  Does anyone have any advice on how to stop avoiding this and start on working through it?

My mother passed when I was young.  Since then I have distanced myself from most people.  I don't want to form close relationships because of the fear that they too will die unexpectedly and I would have to experience this trauma all over again.  However, I dump all of my love, affection, energy, etc. into my romantic relationships.  I don't worry about them breaking up with me but I have a deep fear of them dying.  Whenever I see other people going through a sickness, surgery, accident, loss, all the bad things; I can't stop myself from spiraling into ""this could happen to the person I love. What would I do if this happened to them?"" I try to plan for every possibility, which is of course impossible.  But that fear causes me to panic whenever these triggers come up.  In the moment I usually try to just ground myself and calm down, but whenever I'm in a safe headspace, I don't want to go back and address what happened.  I don't know how to exactly work through the trauma.  I've talked with my therapist about this and she said it's very common to use this avoidance technique but clearly avoiding the issue isn't healthy.  I just don't know how to do it.  I don't know how to work through these emotions when they are so intense and cause so much distress and panic.  She recommended a DBT group but I'm not sure of the cost yet.  Does anyone have any advice on how they work through this.  It feels like a double-edged sword; triggers cause me to feel bad so I want to calm myself so I can think more rationally but then when I feel okay I don't want to think about it because it will only cause me distress again.  I can't seem to break from this cycle."

"Trigger warning ⚠ I keep putting myself in traumatizing situations involving men, trauma",5,lv8a8v,8,"First time poster. Sorry for the format, and I hope this is posted in the right place 


So basically I have been through several different traumas during my life, it has resulted in a laundry list of diagnosis and struggles, including CPTSD.

Some more backstory : I am terrified of men, it took me years to be comfortable around my male therapist, I have struggled a long time with anxiety, fearing men, always prepare for the worst and basically not living but existing. I always feel I owe people stuff, if they are kind or give me stuff I feel I am in a huge debt to them. 

So to the issue: I keep setting myself in situations that re traumatize me, I get in touch with men and I let them do what they want, I am usually drunk. I feel so bad after, I keep having flashbacks and I have trouble trusting men I know and should be able to trust. I have read that people with PTSD avoid situations but I leap head first into those situations. What is wrong with me? Is this normal? I know i should just cut contact with the men I have contact with but one gave me some money because I was struggling. So I feel I owe him, even though his messages gives me anxiety, I am usually OK and then he sends something that makes me scream no at the phone and I end up ignoring the messages. I know this is not healthy, I know what it does to me, I know it affects my sleep and my symptoms and function. Its like I have dug a hole and I am stuck there, because I owe the earth worm something. But i also know I have played along with his sexting, sent pictures and what not. But what If it isn't enough? Yes I will basically let him r*pe me (not interested in sex, I just let them do whatever and just hope and pray they will be done fast. I dissociate a lot and can't remember much after) 

We are planning to meet, even though I know it isn't safe due to the pandemic but I just want to be done with it you know. He keep pushing the fantasies, add more and more stuff I am not comfortable with and wants to punish me for not complying. I answer his texts and play along while I am questioning myself and get the panic attack after panic attack because of the content in the messages. 

Not sure what the point with this was. But how ""normal ""is this behaviour?"

Then when I get to Canada I think things are gonna be OK and then Catholic school comes around no offence to any Catholics around but Catholic school was not was not a good experience for me. Just  added to my trauma, Do you laying with having to go to mass and being persecuted for who I am and being bullied within an inch of my life. I’ve wrestled with dark thoughts and flashbacks psychosis and nightmares and rages ever since I got out of high school because it was just too much for me I was diagnosed at the age of 13 with PTSD and Asperger syndrome. I cannot trust people and I would like to be able to trust people and be helpful towards people understand I bite their heads off and I really need to help deal with.  In my 20s I dealt with a lot of violent outbursts flashbacks nightmares and psychosis and suicidal thoughts now I’m in my 30s I’m doing a lot better I still have the nightmares and flashbacks but they’re not as intense.

Dealing with the person who caused me a good amount of trauma in one of my classes. I hate it so damn much,6,lv0h16,0,"About 3 years ago, I was threatened, stalked and harassed by my ex to the point of a restraining order. The threats were EXTREMELY vulgar, with extreme plans to badly injure and possibly kill me. Dealing with that resulted in me dealing with PTSD from that on top of PTSD from my parent’s very violent divorce, extreme anxiety, trust issues, you name it. 

I was in 7th grade when this happened, making me a sophomore now. He was put in a grade below me for my safety and also due to his lack of good attendance in general. Him being away from me grade-wise helped me with my healing, calming my triggers, and just overall helped me feel safe again. Knowing I wouldn’t have to see him outside of the halls at school and coincidental timings, helped me feel 100% safe.

With high school, my freshman year was easily the best year for me mentally since. Due to him being in 8th grade and still in middle school, I only saw him once in a blue moon if he was coming for marching band, which I’m not in, again, for my safety and due to my busy schedule during band season. (I’m a competitive equestrian and competition season starts heavily continuing around the same time as band season, we’re April-October, band season is August-Octoberish.) I knew I may have to deal with him in regular band class in sophomore year, but I thought Covid would save me due to us having supposed to be on different days in person due to our last names (My last name starts with A and his starts with M). I wasn’t told or even hinted as to otherwise.

Or so I thought. Second day of band class, guess who walks in the door? Him. The causer. Right smack in front of me, walking through the door. It was like getting slapped in the face, healing for nearly a year through quarantine and it was like it’d all went to waste. I’d handled myself quite well through this, though. I kept my eyes down, quiet and just pretended it didn’t bother me. It fucking did.

The school knows he shouldn’t be around me. The school was TOLD the mental distress it would cause me. I’ve stayed up on school nights fucking anxious because I hate seeing his face and now it’s burnt into my mind all over again after a year. The fact I wasn’t even told this was going to happen even after it wasn’t fucking supposed to happen by the school or literally anyone just makes the sting all the more worse. I fucking hate it so much. I want to be stress free again.


I knew this was going to happen one day, I just wanted to know it was in advance. Three years and I still fear what could’ve happened and what still could happen if his therapy doesn’t work and if he’s still out to get me."

Trauma therapy,2,lutvzq,1,I started trauma therapy for about a month and I currently stopped seeing my therapist because after my sessions I only feel worse.. The first appointment we had I explained a couple occurrences which I have flashbacks on and she asked if it really happened to me.. every session since she has made me feel like she questions everything I say and it feels useless.

DAE do pettyish stubborn things because you were disregarded?,0,lur3vy,1,"I'm pretty ""low maintenance,"" meaning I'm either so numb I don't care or I'm so conditioned to just allow others to do whatever and say nothing. I also have trouble with people interrupting me or not listening to me and that hasn't helped at all.

My friends know I'm this way and usually try to encourage me to actually give my opinion and do what I want, but less so when it comes to *them.* I know they don't mean it and it's probably just habit because I'm so passive, but sometimes it hurts because they are my friends and I've talked to them about it before. Sometimes I lash out by being a little quieter if they've been interrupting me or something.

For example today we decided to order food, and they (27/28ms) decided completely themselves what to get. One mentioned burritos, I chimed in I'd been craving burritos, I was ignored, and 27 started ordering Indian food, occasionally asking 28 if he should get this or that. Didn't even look at me.

I like Indian and would've been totally cool with it had he asked me, but when he brought it home and asked why I wasn't eating I just said ""sorry yeah I wasn't feeling Indian food, I'll figure something else out"" nicely and made a salad. I kinda wanted it, but I felt like I needed to make a statement and I'm so sick of awkwardly bringing this stuff up all the time and seeming overemotional and annoying.

I know it isn't a healthy way to go about it. I wish I could just say something in the moment, but I'm afraid I'll come off bitchy or high maintenance- and I'm trying so hard to kick that instinct but it's so ingrained in me. Anyone else feel this? I know the myth of being low maintenance is pretty common"
Some advice on my PTSD,3,luqypy,3,"

I am 15, about two years ago i had a very traumatic experience after reacting to an injection i had, i was in hospital for about a week and had loads of tests, nobody knew what was wrong. After coming out of hospital, i struggled with depression, it took me a while to get me the support i needed but when i finally did, everyone was brilliant. I got diagnosed with PTSD and am on the autism spectrum.

However, i still have a crippling fear of doctors, appointments, dentists, orthodontists, needles and even the thought of a covid test makes me panic. Obviously i’m under the age of 18, my mum books and takes me to appointments. I have non stop nightmares weeks before the appointment, flashbacks and i even worry about appointments i aren’t even gonna have. 

I am concerned, i tend to avoid appointments as much as i can due to the trauma. I am a very healthy person apart from a few hormonal issues which is the main thing that keeps me going to doctors. I haven’t been back in the hospital i was admitted to since the situation, we try our best to arrange appointments somewhere else. I haven’t been to the dentist or the opticians since either, i struggle even walking past places like that.

I’m worried because when i’m older and more responsible, am I gonna be able to do this? I need to keep healthy and get checked but going to the doctors is so much for me. I’m willing to go down private healthcare (i’m in UK) or even if people have doctors/dentists in the south that they recommend for people like me. I’ve googled some of this stuff and a lot of people are like ‘you just need to get it done’ but it’s really not as easy as that.
 
Many doctors that i have seen have rushed appointments or made me feel bad and weak. I was told earlier this year that i needed a blood test, I burst into tears and her exact words were ‘calm down and get on with it’. I don’t want this to happen.

any help will be appreciated <3"
"27 F looking for support, Disturbing Childhood memories. CW: Molestation, Neglect",5,luq6md,7,"When I was in middle school and high-school I was responsible for babysitting my 2 younger siblings while my parents worked over the summer. I spent most of the time locked in my room alone on the computer while my siblings were watching TV.

Reading a post about a child that got molested by their older brother made 2 memories in particular re-emerge. One was my sister playing with little people dolls making one go to the bathroom while the girl doll said ""don't look at my privates"". I think in another instance (IDK if this is me creating a false memory or dream or whatever) I remember her saying something to the effect of my brother touched her. This was infront of parents in the room and I don't know if anything came of it.

My brother has Autism.

I have a slew of mental health problems.

These are not excuses. I just feel like I possibly created an environment that lead to my sister getting abused, altering her life permanently. My neglect was the cause. If this is true I hate myself. But I don't know and I can't ask her. I won't ask her because I can't make it better. I will only bring up trauma by asking.

She has had therapy some therapy.. The brother has had years of therapy. So have I.

I'd like to think if my sister was hurt in that way that its been addressed by now. But the anxiety and guilt are eating at me.

I'm afraid to talk about this to people I'll because its a family secret and will influence the way me and my family are viewed.

Idk how to live with this

In retrospect, I feel like my 14-15 year old self didn't take it seriously? Maybe it was a defence mechanism because I did not want to think it was real? Maybe it wasn't real. Maybe I'm just triggered. I don't know."

Firstly, even at nearly 32, I am a very sensitive person, but I try to hide it and act tough.

I also heavily attach myself to people I feel a connection to, because it’s rare and I have Borderline Personality Disorder. 

My first and second serious relationships were back-to-back between ages 17-22ish. I was very naive, oblivious, and extremely stupid. Both of the guys I dated lied all the time about big and little things, manipulated me, and one for sure emotionally cheated on me, but I fell deeply in love with them before I knew any of this. 

To this day, when I randomly think about it or when something reminds me, I can still remember the immense pain these relationships caused me. I get severe anxiety in my chest and stomach, and I cry or almost cry, despite being completely over these assholes. I wasn’t in a serious relationship again until 4-5 years after the second relationship. It took me approximately 1-2 years to finally get over them. 

Last night I went on a Boy Meets World binge and watched some clips of when Cory cheats on Topanga. This triggered my subconscious memories, and I felt the anxiety, sadness, and hatred I sometimes feel when I’m reminded. I did not expect to, or think about it prior to doing so. I think it felt worse because Cory is a perceived as a great guy, almost a perfect bf with insignificant flaws, yet still cheats. This is how I perceive all relationships; cheating/lying is inevitable. 

Moreover, I woke up this morning from a nightmare of my current bf having sex with another woman, which I periodically get. Ninety-nine percent of my dreams about him consist of cheating on me or hurting me in some way, which usually causes me to experience real emotional distress, anxiety, and pain during and after my dream. It’s become sort of an inside joke between us where I playfully scold him for cheating on me again in my dreams. He always has nice dreams about me. QuQ 

I also had a falling out with a buddy almost a year ago who I strongly attached to that still gets me very sad and hopeless when I think about it. 

These events made me realize it’s kind of similar to PTSD, which I don’t know too much about. 

The symptoms I have recognized are:

Anxiety

Stress

Sadness

Sometimes Chest Pains

Unwanted Flashbacks

Periodic BF Nightmares

Distrust/Hatred for Most People 

Loss of Optimism/Seeing the Good in People

Sometimes I feel I’m almost asexual because I’ve lost interest in men and relationships. I used to be in love with being in love, but I think it’s a waste of time and energy in comparison to life’s other offerings, like helping animals. Yes, I have a bf currently, but it’s complicated and most of the time both of us are playing video games. I think I’ve become numb to our relationship. 

I know you may be thinking “three relationships and you think you’re asexual now?” I’ve had a sprinkle of really bad encounters, predators, fling relationships, shitty brothers, and a shitty dad throughout my entire life, trauma starting as early as age four. I do not trust or expect much from men, but I don’t like most people in general.

tl;dr I’m damaged."
How can I help my girlfriend who is currently dissociative,3,lukq8l,4,"
Due to a horribly abusive relationship that she got out of less than a year ago she’s developed ptsd, and is now dissociating for the first time because of some flashbacks that happened yesterday.

It started yesterday and has been ongoing today

I’m scared and I don’t know how to help

I’m looking up things to do but am a little overwhelmed and currently can only text her, though hopefully I can take her somewhere in a few hours.

She can still talk and remember basic things, but I’m scared it’s going to get worse and I’m not going to be able to help when it gets that bad.

Is there anything I can do right now? Or any other resources I can look at that I haven’t seen?"
Fear of church,3,lukhxe,2,"I was raised by baptists in Ohio, who forced me to go to church every single Sunday until I was 17 and told them specifically I was not going and they could not force me to go. They got angry with me and left, and didn't speak of it afterwards. Church was very scary for me growing up, being forced to sit in the adult group and being yelled at about how I was going to hell. 

Essentially now that I've grown up, my boyfriend is Catholic and wants me to attend catholic mass. At first I said no because I'm just not religious but after a while I said yes and then figured out a separate problem. 

I am TERRIFIED of church. I break down in hysterics in the car before I go in and sometimes while I'm inside as well. I've essentially tried forcing myself to sit through it but it's horribly traumatic in itself for me to do so. 

Has anyone else had this problem? Do they have coping mechanisms? I want to be able to have my wedding in a church but at this rate it doesn't look like I physically can."
Does anyone else have other health problems now?,2,luk149,1,The same year I was diagnosed with ptsd I started showing signs of thyroid problems. I also will grind my teeth for the rest of my life. Anyone else have health issues happen all at once related to their traumatic event?
I'm not giving up yet. Can somebody give me advice on what to do.,4,luih6f,2,"First I need help on diagnosis. Is it just trauma or ptsd? I think it's a mild case of ptsd. I know that some people see images of the trauma in thier head. But I don't have images in my head. Instead im easily triggered. My triggers are going near places where the guy is. (Yes I actually have to endure seeing him everywhere at school. He doesn't bother me anymore. Sometimes my friends but everytime I see him I just want to lie on the ground and cry.) And hearing words like. Sexual harassment, harassment in general. Just stuff like that. I'm almost completely clueless on the subject of ptsd. I've marked a date in my diary. Where I will tell my parents of wanting to go to therapy. ""March 31st"" thats the day I will tell them and ill just brace for impact for the rest of the month. The reason why I have picked that date is because most British students go back to school on march the 8th. Giving me time to see if the situation has gotten better. To see if I can cope for another year. If I can't I tell them on that date. Also my parents do know about the ""incident"". I told them 3 years ago. But the thing is they think I've gotten over it. Which I haven't. I don't want to bring it up again. They look so upset whenever I tell them about it. Sometimes angry. I just don't want them to worry about me anymore. I'm age 13 if that helps. If you have any advice on what to do. I'd be so so grateful. I just feel like I'm stuck in a pit which is going to take years to get out of. Thanks for reading this."
I don't know how long I can suppress my feelings and trauma,5,lui22l,0,"TW: se*ual assault/harassment


So today I reported this security guard who m*l*sted me 4 months ago. I basically told him not to contact me again, otherwise I'd report him. And he did... today... hence why I reported him. I fucking opened up to a complete stranger about what he did and it was so weird to talk about and holy fucking shit I forgot so much details and information from how fucking badly I suppress. Thankfully I had live footage of me describing everything... anyway....

So after reporting what the guard done, I been told he's been fired and out of work for 4 months. Therefore, no justice with him.

I feel like a complete fucking failure. I feel so pathetic and stupid. Like... how can I be SA many times? Not only by that m*l*ster, but I been r*ped by 4 diff ppl and completely diff times. I don't understand what is wrong with me? I know its not my fault, took me ages to stop blaming myself but I really do feel awful. I feel so disgusted and stupid- like I'm pathetic. The more it happened, the more I changed my ""strategy"". The first time, it was in school. It was from behind, but the second time... it was my virginity taken. And I fucking hate being asked about my fucking virginity. Like ""how was your first time, how'd you lose it"". It feels embarrassing and disgusting. I feel so violated every time just getting asked that. I was fucking drunk and passed out too. Then the other time, it was my (ex)boyfriend and I was sober and I was fucking vocal but disassociated completely. The next was the same day that occurred with that security guard. It was by someone I considered a ""friend"". I didn't see it coming coz we didn't even flirt at all and he just gaslit me. Like..... I reported the first 2 r*pes, I reported the time someone else gr*ped me, I reported my attempted kidnapping, I reported the security guard.... and NOTHING. NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENED BUT SHIT TO ME. EVERYTHING JUST GOT WORSE FOR ME.

The first ever report got me expelled from school. The second forced me to be abused by my own mother- she forced me into a hymen repair surgery. The gr*per threatened me so bad I had to withdraw the case. The kidnapper guy... NOTHING HAPPENED. The police just said ""don't tell anyone about this"" and that was it. The security guard, well I mentioned it in the first paragraph. 

I can't seem to get anything right. I do anything to avoid such situations but my mental health keep deteriorating more and more. I don't know how many mental breakdowns I can handle or how many panic attacks I can deal with in public or privately even. I don't know how long I can keep up with my abusive mother — living in fear. I don't know how to stop being so idealistic bc my BPD keeps blinding me, making me trust someone enough that they end up assaulting me. My own fucking brain is against me. My brain is the reason for my traumas. My brain is the reason I am in pain, its literally my enemy. I do everything right, I do everything to make sure I'm happy and stable. I meditate, I do spiritual shit, I study, I distract myself, I went to therapy, got pets and friends..... nothing .... fucking.... works.... I don't know what more I can do... I don't know how much longer I can take any of this and I CANT KILL MYSELF. I'm not currently suicidal but I just want to escape this earth... I just want to stop feeling forever. I want to be free from this country and this household. I just wish I had love and care. I just.... don't know what to do and I have no one to fucking talk to."
How did you figure out your triggers?,1,lug5wo,4,"This might be an odd question but I'm struggling to write down my triggers without getting triggered, how did you guys manage to do it?"
Second worst thing about being traumatized is when nobody believes you,271,luem3y,32,"I have been crying and shaking for hours and days and yet people believe i could be lying about what happened

I want to tell someone about my childhood trauma (HUGE TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️‼️‼️),4,ludqp2,1,"HUGE TRIGGER WARNING: 
this post discusses topics of: 
- sexual abuse 
- rape 
- repression of memories 
- female genital mutilation
- self harm 
- mental health hospitalizations 

I’m sixteen, and about three years ago I started recovering repressed memories of being raped and sexually abused by my uncle over and over again for years, starting at 5-6 years old and ending at about 8-9 years old. At first I was convinced I made these memories up, but now there’s too much evidence behind the memories. It’s bittersweet knowing that this actually happened to me. 

I’m starting to really feel the effects of the abuse now. I thought I was getting over it until i realized how scared I actually am of my past. In school we skim over subjects of CSA and rape. I thought it was normal to have panic attacks whenever I heard about the subject. Apparently not. I can’t wear certain clothes anymore. I can’t let anyone get too close to me. I shower in darkness so I don’t have to look at myself. 

My genitals are mutilated from the abuse, and I’m so scared I won’t be able to have kids. My cervix is completely numb and it’s rough, uneven, and bumpy. The inside of my vagina has so many ridges which almost blocks the actual opening. It’s my dream to have kids. I’ll be devastated if I can’t have them. 

I want nothing more than to just tell someone what happened to me when I was younger. No one knows. I mean some people do, like a couple close friends. But my parents don’t know, nor do the police or anything like that. It’s eating me up knowing that my sicko of an uncle is probably hurting other kids and ruining their lives because I’m too much of a pussy to speak up. Other kids are being hurt and it’s all my fault. 

Except I know if I say something my mother will literally go insane. It will break her. 

The uncle who sexually abused me for years is my mothers brother in law, and did the exact same kind of stuff to her. My mother, due to I believe the convincing of my father, forgave my uncle. They began contacting each other and with that, my mother let my older sister and I develop a relationship with him. 
If my mother found out that she let this happen I really think she’d just kill herself. I don’t think she’d be able to cope with the guilt. I’ve been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for the past three years because of the trauma and I know I’ll never be the same. It’ll kill my mum knowing that she could have avoided all of this. It’ll kill her. 

But at the same same time I really need to get this off my chest. For a while I’ve been counting down the days until I turn 18 so I can tell someone without them having to contact my parents, but I really don’t think I can wait until then. It’s all getting too much. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point. I really don’t. It’s either: 
A) I tell someone about what happened to me, and I’ll probably have to share more than what I’m comfortable with, and my mother will probably have an actual nervous and/or psychotic breakdown.

or 
B) I’ll stay quiet so my mum doesn’t find out, but then I’ll have to deal with it all myself when I finally do tell someone about what happened. I won’t be forced into crying to my parents for advice/help. I’ll deal with it all myself because I know that my parents won’t have to know. I also know if I keep this all inside, I’ll get more mentally unwell and I might end up losing my battle before I even turn 18. 

I just don’t know what to do. Please I’m begging you I really just need someone to help me. I’m so tired of dealing with the memories and the flashbacks and the guilt and anger and pain. I need it to go away. Please help me."
PTSD School,0,luapto,2,"Don’t you ever hate when you get in trouble at school and the teachers are mean to you. I remember a lot of those moments of my life and I still feel regret. I remember in 3rd Grade I went into the school during recess without permission for water a teacher came in and said “Did you tell your teacher you’re in here” I said no because I was being honest and she told me to leave. Then a year later the same teacher was a chaperone for a field trip and was being mean to me and yelling at me. I did nothing at all and she kept being mean and grabbed my arm for most of the field trip. I felt really sick. 

Part 2.
In first grade I got in trouble because I didn’t understand something well and I didn’t know anything so when the teacher asked me what did another kid do while the time off I just said what another kid said “He peed” I was sent to the principals office repeatedly to tell more of what happened and go taken outside to tell the principal what happened then I realized the teacher only treated hispanic and black kids bad it still hurts me to this day. I said yes and no to stuff I didn’t even understand. Kids are kids you have to realize that. You can scar kids by getting them in trouble. Just punish them nicely."
maybe i did deserve it,3,lu9ob7,7,i was sexually abused from 5-10 years old. i feel like it’s kind of my fault though. i would encourage it and would not tell him to stop. but as i got older i started to have a problem with it. he came into my room late at night and touched my chest and i threatened to scream if he didn’t leave my room. but is it my fault for encouraging him to do it? i knew it was wrong but i still encouraged him to do it.
I keep on getting flashes of memories,6,lu8phy,2,"Tw: Blood, injury, self harm, physical abuse


So I know most of what my abuser did, but some parts I still don’t remember well. Recently I’ve been getting flashes of memories from one time I haven’t really remembered well. I’m not really sure what to do about it, and it’s been bothering me. Do I try to make sense of it? How could I make it stop, if I should? It’s not really fun doing something then randomly remembering my abuser cutting herself in front of me then saying I made her do it, cutting the other girl she abused, cutting me, and stuff lol (sry I kinda just awkwardly laugh about this stuff). I don’t have access to therapy and the dude I usually talk to isn’t available rn

Relationships and long term recovery,1,lu7dkq,3,"So I have about 7 years since I was diagnosed. My trauma is related to a well publicized tragedy, and it has always been difficult to avoid constant media updates/memoirs/Hollywood renditions of it. But otherwise I’ve managed to live safely thanks to my therapist, my friends, and my family. One thing that has been immensely difficult is romantic relationships. I find that my boyfriends from before my diagnosis are still supportive friends to me, but every guy I dated after is unable to handle me. My trauma impacts relationships in that I have to manage my anxiety and sleep first. I don’t have trouble managing a relationship otherwise. But guys either want to save me or they want nothing to do with my recovery(I had an ex tell me that no one was going to care if I was struggling so I immediately got out of there). I hate the idea of someone saving me. I put in all this work, my friends loved me so much, I don’t need someone to come in and act as if there’s something wrong here. I just want someone to let me keep coping and trying my hardest. I think no one with PTSD has answers and that’s sort of what it is. The point is something immensely overwhelming happened to us and it can’t be made sense of. I went to work one day and ended the day having to escape a tragedy. I wont ever understand why and I don’t need to know because it’s too dark for me to comprehend.

I know because my friends love me that someone else will love me too. My recovery has to come before anything else and I know I can do that. But I feel so little self esteem when it comes to dating. I feel like I have to tell someone up front that I have ptsd, partly so they know why I’m weird and partly so they can leave if it’s too hard for them. I find myself dating friends of friends so I can feel a certain level of safety but that doesn’t work that way I have found. A couple weeks ago I downloaded a dating app just to try it out and way more guys liked me than I knew ever would. I didn’t last long because I realize I’m too sensitive, but I really don’t know how to begin a relationship because I assume no one will want to be here. I’m wondering if anyone out there struggles with this or if they are with someone who manages to be supportive. I’m tired of my friends getting their hopes up every time I connect with a guy just to find out I’m letting them down again because he couldn’t hang."
Not sure what I am looking for...,3,lu48qs,3,"I had a rough childhood but what really bothers me is an experience I had in the army while in Afghanistan. Fellow service members are not always the best support. I remember to this day the incident the timeline. The hours and days on guard after the fear and shock of my joes and those above me. Some days I relate to it, it may not always be relevant. I don't remember all of it but I know I was shook that day. I did what I had to for me and mine. I stood strong I acted when others were unsure but honestly I was scared that morning. I thought that was going to be it. I had just a second where I decided I would try I would be ready for the enemy I knew I would lay down and let them take anyone else...."
dealing with panic attacks,2,lu3op0,8,"I was diagnosed with ptsd in November after a shooting at my apartment. I had been in a school shooting in high school and had previous trauma from that. Unfortunately I live in a very gang active area and there’s a lot of guns, so it can be really hard to avoid gunshots from nearby (the sound of them). I’ve tried the whole telling myself I’m safe etc, but I can’t seem to calm myself down. 

What are your guys’ best calming down activities or thoughts? I take hydroxyzine for anxiety, but that isn’t immediately helpful."
"PTSD, has someone triggered you badly by accident?",16,lu3fce,22,"How were you able to rebuild trust with that person after that trigger? Even if it was out of care and love let’s just say, was there ways for you to rebuild that trust (space, time, etc)?"
I am FRUSTRATED and ANGRY with the stigma that people have.,1,lu2085,4,"I got assaulted about two years ago at work by a client, and they repeatedly hit me in the face. It caused me a lot of emotional trauma and caused me a lot of grief, stress, anger, and all the other words that describes the feelings of trauma. I am mostly over it, but my PTSD and anxiety over the situation flares up every once in a while. My brother has been home from school since the start of the year, due to the pandemic. A few times he ""pretended"" to punch me in the face, and I have said every time I don't like it but he mocks me and says I am making a big deal over something that is just pretend. It reminds me of my assault. Then, today he did it again and I finally stood up for myself and told them to stop, because I have trauma around assault, and even though I know he would never actually hit me I have really had enough. If it was an accident, or if they did it and then immediately apologize afterwards that would be a different story. But they don't care. 

My mom was in the same room and I strictly said to STOP and that I have trauma around aggression, and she mocks me. I then raise my voice again and tell him to stop mocking me and respect that I don't like it. Of course, I get in trouble and yelled at because ""it was only a joke"" and ""I am overreacting"". They weren't the one who dealt with the physical and emotional pain of assault. I seriously am fed up with getting told I am too sensitive, or for getting in trouble for expressing when my feelings are hurt for something that my brother is doing. They didn't work shifts after and face extreme anxiety levels. They didn't feel like their career was ruined because of it. They didn't experience burn out and imposter syndrome. They didn't have to deal with bad dreams and flashbacks from the event for months. 

I feel so frustrated. Nobody is respectful of this situation in my house, and of course I get painted as the bad guy for explaining how their actions upset me. My boyfriend understands and completely supports me, but I just wish for once people (especially my family of all people) could have compassion for their loved one who suffers from PTSD."
So about my meds...,1,lu1m0r,7,"So they've really reduced my flashbacks. I no longer have the graphic, vivid nightmares, and my mind doesn't wander as much during the day. It's a huge relief and I hadn't even realised they were PTSD flashbacks before. I've had them for most of my teen and adult life. I even had people tell me it was normal. I am so relieved to have them gone/almost gone.

However I'm tired as heck, sleeping for up to 20 hours a day sometimes, and I still don't have a lot of motivation. I feel pretty low.

I'm on venlafaxine 37.5mg. Are there other options?"
"If I get a fright, it puts me in a bad mood",4,lu1fy0,4,"I was in a great mood, day going well. Then my dog barked in the car and it was so loud, I yelled at her, I thought I'd pulled a muscle in my chest I jumped so hard. Then my husband jammed on the breaks in the Starbucks drive through because the jerk in front of him did, this frightened me too.

After that, I physically felt my mood change. I was shaky, I wanted quiet, I felt worried, I felt like crying, emotional. I feel bad because I was in such a great mood before this happened. I feel bad for my husband having to deal with these sudden mood changes just because I got a fright. 

Does this happen to anyone else?"

Here’s your more detailed TW: I’ll be talking about online child grooming. This will be venting but feel free to comment.



When I was 10-11 I was playing animal jam. There was this place where you’d be peoples friend, parent, fake spouse, etc. I forget how it happened just that our first interaction was there. He gave me gifts. And you have to understand these were the rare type that people would sell for real money to people. We’d do normal things in the game together. And then it got weirder. Like just having my character dance. And then “adopting” a child. Going on fake dates. I had been told to avoid these things but a person was showing me affection during a hard time in my life. And then he had me (I’ll call it roleplay) with him. I said no and he threatened to leave or take stuff away from me. And when I didn’t know things in the (roleplay) he explained them. When he asked for my personal information I knew what was happening and I left. But he got angry. He told me a lot of stuff about how my parents would be mad. I never told my parents till a month ago because I knew part of it was my fault for not stopping it sooner. They just knew I had been addicted to the game. What’s worse is that the reporting feature on the game doesn’t work and they draw people in safety wise with the sense of “National Geographic). The worst part is I don’t fully remember it. It was months. I can remember the game music and a few details but not the worse. But I want to remember it because limbo sucks."
"TW: mention of fighting, bl*od & h*ir pulling, ab*se",1,lty9za,0,"yesterday my abuser attacked me out of nowhere.. like literally for no reason. for context he's my family member and he suddenly attacked me. he pulled my hair out, dug his nails onto my hands and back of my head and kept kicking me repeatedly in my stomach.. plus more but i'm not trying to have a flashback rn. of course, i fought back and defended myself and got myself out of that situation and now he's thankfully gone far away from me but i'm just so fed up. yknow? i was doing pretty okay and distracting myself, especially with the comments you guys left on my last post it really helped me and made me understand i'm not alone. But it's like every time i try to move forward or i'm even nearly happy, more trauma adds on if that makes sense. I just.. feel so tired. I'm tired of crying, tired of the flashbacks etc. if you read my last post, tomorrow is my mother's birthday and i feel so alone without her."
Do you hear the music too?,5,ltxidk,6,"Hi all. I am not officially diagnosed yet (seeing a doctor soon) but I do very much believe I have ptsd. What I’m wondering is if this symptom is common- music. My brain literally starts playing music when I think of stressful things. It’s so loud it drowns out my thoughts until I just give up. It’s like trying to talk to your friend at the bar, but you’re standing next to a super loud speaker and all you can see is their lips moving. I think it’s a defense mechanism against myself basically. It’s frustrating, and leaves me feeling cloudy and like I can’t work through what I’m trying to process. I have a very busy and demanding life with a baby so I quite literally don’t have the time to deal with  my trauma right now and I think my subconscious knows that so it stops me from thinking too hard.. idk. Just wondering if I’m alone in this experience."
Free online support groups for PTSD?,5,ltvzso,2,Hi! I was wondering if anyone knows about any free online support groups for PTSD? (This is not for a veteran.) Thank you very much.
Do you ever fully get over trauma?,5,ltvf9n,6,I was talking to my therapist yesterday about how I feel like I should be over my trauma after thirteen years and he told me no one ever gets over it.

(TW: DEATH THREATS) my ptsd manifests in anger & i want to threaten and hurt whoever triggers it,1,ltuf2m,1,"sometimes they have it coming when they purposefully invalidate my abuse (a trigger) but sometimes someone wont know i have ptsd and will accidentally trigger it & i want to hurt them or tell them to kill themselves. what do i do about this? its not an immediate reaction, its only when it gets really bad, when i'm having an attack. regardless, i dont want it to happen, otherwise, im a pacifist, so it feels wrong. what do i do? sometimes i dont see it coming so i cant always leave the situation in time."
How to cope with flashbacks when the process of grounding is a trigger itself?,1,lttaon,0,"I have flashbacks about being (trapped) with my ex, who was abusive to me in ways that I’m still coming to understand. However, he had PTSD and flashbacks himself, but would use it against me in order to make me feel guilty and do whatever he wanted and not leave him, despite him hurting me and me being so scared of him every day whether he was there or not. 

On a bad day, almost any reminder of him will send me into flashbacks or a panic attack, and I’ve been trying the usual techniques to cope with them. The catch is that my ex would talk incessantly about grounding and those other techniques, so when I try to do those to cope, they just make it worse since they’re just as connected to what happened as any other trigger, if not more. 

If anyone has any suggestions of what I can do or what might help, I would really appreciate it. So far it’s just been like a vicious cycle that I can’t get out of, since the only tools I have to come out of it just do the opposite of what they’re supposed to do."

Can too much internal stress lead to exhaustion?,5,ltqc4q,3,"I know I’m not having a depressive episode, and I know it’s not ‘the virus that shall not be named’ I’m just so physically and mentally exhausted and I’m looking for advice on how to try and feel better. 
It’s hard to concentrate and anything that was aching slightly aches a lot now.  I is feel like I could sleep for days and don’t want to. I’m too tired to even eat and too nauseous to try. 
Aside from eventually having food, are their any other simple tricks and tips I should be aware of or anything concerning?
I don’t have a lot of resources so I can only do a few things by myself right now and I don’t have family or friends who can physically be here to help.  (Already in therapy and take meds, no more can be done on that front)

I'm stuck in a thought,3,ltmdwu,0,"I keep thinking over and over ""How is it NOT selfish for me to want people to give me more attention and love and do things for me and give me gifts?"" friends do their best to do this but it never feels like enough. my friends say this is trauma from growing up with a sister who always put down my interests, plus we always shared a birthday so I never got a day to myself as a kid to celebrate me. now it feels like nothing is enough to satisfy this hunger for attention and love. isn't this selfish? isn't it?

Disgusted by promiscuity,41,ltm9k0,14,"I totally know this is my own issue. People have their own bodies and should be able to do whatever they want with them. But my trauma makes me FREAK OUT whenever I'm around sexual promiscuity and I don't know why.

I hate it. All these sexual posts on reddit. All these nudes people post on here. I can't be friends with those who sleep around with different people. It disgusts me. And that makes me incredibly ashamed of myself. I was never like this before my trauma :(

I'm by no means a prude with my fiance, we're in to all kinds of kinky stuff, but I'm comfortable with it because it's just between us, nobody else. It would make my skin crawl to discuss it with any other person on this planet."
I hate what I become,2,ltkqrc,4,"As I kid I was not only physically and mentally abused by my moms then second husband but he also molested me. He put my mom in the hospital with a broken back and 30 years later I can’t forget it. I still remember him telling me I’m too ugly to smile.. 
After my mom left him she became abusive to be blaming me for everything wrong in her life. 
Later on I was nearly raped in a train station but got away as he was removing his pants.. only to come home and have my then boyfriend get upset because I did not want sex. 
I ended up with a guy who ignored me left him for another that basically ended up doing the same and I left him. He became an asshole and toms me I should kill myself. 
My next boyfriend put me through a living nightmare for 5 months because he went into psychosis due to drug use and Schizophrenia that runs in his family. He beat me till I learned to defend myself he broke my things and drove me to near insanity myself trying to help him and doing what he asked. Now that he’s gone I still wake up screaming not just from him though but from everything that is my life. 
Now I’m single no friends about to loose my car and I’m at a loss.. oh I’m coping with meth and dint care too much if I live or die."
Do I possibly have PTSD from college and an IUD fiasco?,1,ltjx33,0,"Edit: adding TW (pain, isolation, possible abuse)

Hello. I (25yr old female), am still figuring out if I actually have PTSD, and I wanted some input.

1. From 2013-2015 I was in a music program. During this time I was slapped across the face at school, was isolated from friends and family, emotionally manipulated from a former fling, dealt with sexism and harassment. Yup, all that in two years. Memories became so bad that I left my career due to anxiety and flashbacks. I was told to look into PTSD, but no one formally said I had PTSD, but was dealing with trauma. In your (the reader) opinion, is it trauma or PTSD? 

2. My IUD insertion was so painful that we took it out within an hour. Over the last three weeks I disconnected, avoided intimacy with my husband, and dealt with pain and discomfort daily. It does not help that my regular doctor didn't seem to be empathetic  towards my feelings. Words like endometriosis and pelvic inflammation disease popped up, making me more scared. Same question, is this showing signs of PTSD? 

I'm so lost on what I'm dealing with. I would greatly appreciate insight and opinions. Thanks in advance."
CPTSD symptoms vs regular PTSD symptom differences,23,ltj5nb,19,"I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD for a while now, but I still get confused about my symptoms. 

I’ve gotten to known some people that have PTSD after suffering through a horrible event as an adult. I always seem to notice how their symptoms are different than with my CPTSD symptoms.

I guess I wanted to know more about the differences in symptoms between someone who has PTSD and suffered through a traumatic event once in their adulthood vs the CPTSD symptoms of those who had to withstand repeated and long term abuse in their childhood. 

I find myself questioning my diagnosis a lot because I feel like I don’t relate much to the regular PTSD symptoms. Am I the only one?"
When does the therapy start to “work”? Does it ever? TW: car accident,2,lthj4f,0,"I’ve been involved in 2 car accidents, both extremely traumatic for me and have been in therapy for my PTSD for a year now. My fear is usually contained (for the most part) until I am actually in a car. I’ve tried meditating for 4-5 minutes before actually driving, deep breathing during the drive, and taking breaks. I’ve gotten to a point where when I am not in a car, I rarely think about it (though the dreams are intense still). 
The fear and severe stress is getting worse than it was a year ago. Hyperventilation, heart palpitations, screaming, crying, panicking, the whole bit happens nearly Everytime I am on the road (passenger or driver) I’ve been driving everyday to try and expose myself more but I have happened upon some health issues and I am concerned my constant stress is causing some of my symptoms to flare up. 
So, in your experience, is it worth it to keep exposing myself? Is there another therapy besides medication I could try (I am extremely sensitive to meds). Thank you!"
Can I get PTSD from going to the dentist?,1,lth58b,1,"Hello, a year ago I went to public dentistry for tooth decay and the operation was so painful and stressful. The tooth drill even drilled my gum for a second because I couldn't endure the pain any longer and moved my jaw. After that experience, I have always gone to a private dental clinic. It is much expensive but at least they don't torture me or treat me like shit. But I still feel extremely nervous and anxious when I am getting my tooth drilled. Could this count as PTSD or am I just overthinking it in my brain?"

So angry (tw: drug use),2,ltgd3t,0,"I have PTSD (diagnosed about 12 yrs ago) and part of that trauma is negligence and abandonment. Around Thanksgiving someone who had always said I was a good friend to him decided I do not have any value anymore. They said they needed to be alone but I learned they have not been alone, they just decided that I am not worth their time anymore because of politics (I choose to stay out of it, which is apparently worse than having the wrong politics).

And he has said some extremist things that horrified me.

Yet I refuse to believe I did nothing wrong even though everyone, including my therapist, says he is at fault for putting conditions on his caring. I refuse to believe he is a bad person though he has said some horrifying things and the way he ditched me was cruel. I am so angry cause I cannot reconcile any of this. He was one of the few people in my life that made me feel like I mattered and then just like that I meant nothing. And I want to scream and cry and tell him how dare you.

I wanna die.

In April I will be two years sober from cocaine but damn I am really craving a massive binge right now. My anxiety is getting so much worse, I am lashing out easily and I hate feeling this way. I take my medicine as needed, go to therapy and group, but I cannot stop feeling worthless and I am so exhausted I don't know what to do."
my genitals are ruined from being raped and being on lexapro. i don’t want to do this anymore,2,ltf16q,7,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 

i was then also diagnosed from ptsd from the rape and the bullying. 

i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)"
trigger!!! im (26f) having a hard time with my ex (29f),6,ltduuf,2,"okay so me and my ex gf have been dating on and off for the last 3 years.

there's so much ptsd involved in our relationship strictly due to the physical abuse I've dealt w. phone breaking, choking, window smashing, hitting, verbal abuse but I need help maybe with moving on.. what are some of your tips.. this is my story for the mot part. many violent fights were left out.

we met thru my best friend & were only friends for the first year of knowing each other. well I started realizing that I in fact like girls and wanted her opinion on the matter because I was raised christian and felt... dirty, I guess is the term. it was a huge issue for me int he beginning. I struggled for about 2 years if god still loves me for doing this but anyways I would break up with her a lot due to this reason along many others. continuing my personal backstory I am incredibly jealous IF given reason. I got her a job w me at my work place a few months after talking but nothing serious, but as we worked together we clearly started something and she eventually told me she loves me in like mid April of 2018. I was NOT ready tbh it was only like 3 weeks into being together romantically, we hadn't had sex yet of anything either. and don't get me wrong I did like her a LOT but I wasn't prepared to say I love you because it was so quick. it confused me. anyways back story w her is she's a kid at heart, very friendly unless she's not. she has this...outburst side of her. she's quick to throw out I love you (which is another Eason I didn't wanna say it back) she's a violent alcoholic, but she's fun guess. its your typical toxic relationship in the least. anyways I got her a job at my place of work as the cook & she was able to make friends w all the teachers because she had more free time not being w the kids. which I didn't care until one day me, my ex & about 5 other of us women were all hanging out in the lobby & she walked up to the lady who worked the front desk & said ""tara\* you're such beautiful woman"" and I was like... hold up no this bitch didn't & everyone else looked at me like uhm are you gonna like...oof embarrassing basically. it got awkward idk. that's when it all started. that's whenever I became a jealous psycho it seemed. I didn't leave her but I would leave her at this point because when she would drink it would get really bad. despite all that I ended unmoving in with her around august 2018 cus we worked together and lets be honest I was staying there more than my own house. in those few months it got really bad between us. just too close. we would fight our asses off. we ended up quitting our job together in November 2018 the same day cus I was that supportive gf even tho everyone knew wtf was happening behind closed doors. I got really suicidal during that time of not working and living in her house which didn't feel like home, but more so like an uncomfortable trip to your aunt you see every 10 years, but everyday. I ended up finding a new job & also found her texting her ex gf of over 10 years ago so I didn't think much of it but yeah she tried adding me on fb too which I thought was weird as hell. so anyways I mentioned being suicidal and I went to act on it thanksgiving day 2018 but came home cus there were ambulances at the river already which pissed me off. but she didn't care she laughed at me. I began having panic attack for the first time which wa the scariest thing id ever experienced in my life so far. thought I was laying on my death bed from a heart attack every time. she tried helping me thru them but her presence made it so much worse. its Christmas time all of this happening w panic attacks and then I started feeling HOrribleeeee and was going to the hospital so much for a uti that ended up Turing into a kidney infection so I had my parents pick me up in the middle of a snow storm since my car wouldn't have made it thru & looked at her and asked her if we were gonna be okay cus she was staying home & she said of course and hugged me. it wasn't all hate or else I wouldn't have stayed. I left the house and went to the hospital for my mom to convince me to break up w her & I did because at the time the drs were telling me that I have chlamydia before even got test results back. so I lit her phone up on impulse & left her. 4 days later I passed kidney stones. I never had an std. the next day my parents take me to move my things out of her house, still under the impression that she cheated and I have an std, but she wouldn't let me get my things and threw me down, & as I was trying to leave her mom pushed me down the stairs. so I called the cops cus my ex is scary af and I was worried shed rip or burn my stuff or just never give it back. I got a cop to escort me to get my things but later that night she would text me things like ""I know where you'll be sleeping, ima crawler, have fun closing your eyes"" yada yada so I got a restraining order on her cus she's stalked her exes in her past and I didn't wanna chance it. needles to say the restraining order didn't keep us apart in fact it just let up this past January lol. we got together in February & had to hide it from everyone for MONTHS to a year depending on the person. its 2019 now and I leave for vacation feb 27-march5th to visit my good friends in another state. she's acting weird as hell w me while im there. not communicating well. the last night I was there an old friend of mine who dated my ex & helped me thur the restraining order process against her, messaged me asking if I had spilled beans about what she said about the ex gf who I found messaging my ex that I mentioned & of course I said no but it made sense. I called my ex out on it & she said she's not cheating on me after screaming at me. I get home & we go on a date to see each other and whenever I got home for the night she said I gotta tell you something & tells me she saw her ex gf while I was gone but nothing happened. BITCH WHO YOU LYIN TOOOO. who's ex gf comes over to just hang out. lol she told me she was getting her ex away from her current gf who was drugging her. lol what. so I left her & it ate me up for forever. it still eats me tf alive. id find notes in her room from this chick n everything. so now im like cool you're cheating on me and we still would see eachother maybe once a week for months at a time. together but barely. and then my dad started getting sick. its now November 2019 . dads got cancer. I start getting lonely as hell. I start being myself and allowing ,myself to see my friends because I needed them. wed go out & my ex was never a jealous person at all when it came to my friends. did she like them? no but she was never one to say you can't see them. so I started going out and having fun that I hadn't had in what felt like a good 2 years. im gaining confidence back & my manic bipolar starts to flare so I leave her after a night out because she was boring me at this point. I started talking to someone the next day who I felt was nice, we went on a date & my ass was such a drunk mess he ghosted me which I was fine w. a few weeks go by and im working for this lady baby siting for a full week going completely insane & thinking about how its almost Christmas & my dads sicks but here tf I am, so I got lonely and went back to her for like... a month maybe? left her again. was partying. dads rapidly getting worse off. get back with her, break up over stupid things that I didn't wanna deal with. im a go w the flow person and she's really needy and has specific things she does that annoy tf outta me so at this time period I was leaving her and getting back with her every 3 weeks. & that's how its been ever since. stay for 3 weeks, leave for 3 weeks. I ended up dating this guy during quarantine for about a month and half a few weeks after me and my ex split. one day I woke up and was like ew fuck this guy & wen to see her instantly that morning. stayed with her for a day & left her the next. about a week later I start dating that guy again out of boredom. I leave him 2 weeks later for good to be w Lauren for what I was hoping for good. she hated me & I did what I could to repair what had happened. she told me I was a slut & I cheated on her. I mean we would be having good time and then BOOM ""YOURE A SLUT!!!! FUCK YOU SLUT!!"" and I felt horrible. I knew I didn't cheat on her but I felt BAD cus I knew how devastated I was whenever she told me about her ex staying w her whenever I was out of state. so I did what I could until I couldn't take the name calling anymore and told her to leave. we were broken up the whole summer of 2020 and got back in September to find her high as a god damn kite & in a psychosis induced by what she tells me is wee but I know its from meth. (I don't do meth & didn't think she was the type either but I was WAYYY wrong) so anyways im trying to be there for her while she's down and out but I could handle how she was treating me as such scum. she deels with grandeur delusions & already thought herself as a princess even before her psychosis so it made it so much worse. she ended up going to many mental hospitals to help her figure out who she is. well one of them was like bitch you're crazy & gave her a halloo shot which messed her up so bad for about a month and a half. I was worried for her so whenever I figured out she was in the hospital I reached out to her on twitter & basically took care of her for that month and a half. the people she talks so highly of were no where yet im a pos for helping idk. this girl has my heart. im hopeless and helpless. I just found text messages from the same ex gf I've been dealing with this while relationship. I want to cry cus I just want us to be okay. we've gone thru so much together and somei=times our relationship it GREAT. sometimes we just laugh our asses off together and shack up for days. but idk man she's flirty and im too insecure for that. someone who preaches monogamy & has made me feel like a...idfk.... a pos.. the worst person in her life. she tells everyone im a cheater even when were together. to embarrass me infant of whoever. its toxic yes I know. but I need help. I don't know what to do. my dad is dying. im crying. im alone. I have no insurance so I can't afford to talk to anyone. I can't keep going to my friend every 5 seconds when I feel low. no one wants to deal w someone who's not happy all the time. and im using it. because she is even still my comfort. she knows me inside and out, but she lives a complete double life from what she tells me. and its upsetting.. im REAL, I may fuck up but if I do I own up instantly. I've always told her instantly if I fuck up despite the repercussions. I keep going back to her because she has a hold on me. she acts really nice at first and then switches up. how do I get over this? im going insane. there so many people who I could ""date"" but I want her. she's never tried getting back w me. its always been me. this last time I left her I had to sneak out of the house in fear shed hear me leave. she told me im a slutt and im the one who's cheating on her.. heard it from someone I've met one time for 3 seconds before. she's posting me everywhere. her fb, twitter, yadayada. idc if someone thinks im a cheater btw. let the rumors go its kid stuff. I need help on how you let go.. or what you did to get away."
My PTSD is so bad right now I’m on the edge of my seat all the time.,27,ltc27c,12,"I am 54 years old and have had PTSD most my life.  It really didn’t show its ugly head until until A7 years ago when I had a near death experience.

My PTSD “causes” range from early childhood sexual abuse to being bullied to becoming a sexual object to 2 date rapes to being a victim of a malignant narcissist to losing my parents within 3 months of each other to a couple of near death crap.  So much to unpack.

I have gone through periods of time when I can control my thoughts and be positive.  Now, I’m just at rock bottom.  I am triggered by damn near anything.  I am always at the edge of my seat (literally) and last night I caught myself rocking.

I have had a hell of a time with my mental health journey.  I also have depression and was not actually diagnosed until well into my 20’s.

I am trying so hard to get trauma therapy.  Something always gets in the way.  So tired of living like this!  I just want help!  Uggggg

Don’t worry about anything drastic, I have my beautiful 23 year old daughter living with me and we are best friends.  Someday she will leave and get married.  I hope I am better by then."

Medical traumas... where do I start with the invalidation,5,ltarx6,12,"Like yes, I understand you too have been in a hospital before but you did not experience what I did.

You were not threatened to go through with anything you expressed a very clear desire you did not want to do.

You were not verbally abused and did not have disgusting things said to you when it was thought you were too drugged up to hear.

You were not talked to by a fantasising creep about what he was going to do at every stage of drugging you.

You were not forced to strip naked in a room full of people when you said you felt uncomfortable doing so.

You were not forced to piss with someone else in the room holding your hand, all while treating you like you are 4.

Yes, I know you went into a hospital and came out fine but some of us didn’t. Why is that so hard to grasp??"
I need advice,6,lta8lk,1,"When I was 15 I met a guy who was 2 years older than me. I hated myself at the time so when he showed interest it was the most exciting thing. He was really nice to me for the first two weeks and when I finally said I’d have sex with him it changed. He had sex with me but wouldn’t kiss me and wouldn’t stop when he saw me crying, he also tried to film it without me knowing. I went and saw him a few more times because I thought he would like me, but he would just make me do things and then kick me out. His ex girlfriend would tell people she was going to bash me and girls from school found out and hated me because of it. It was really one of the most traumatic experience of my life. Now every year for the past three years I experience major depression and hate myself so much around the exact same time of year, I feel disgusted with myself and it triggers me to fall back into an eating disorder. Could I be experiencing this at the same time every year because of the incident or is that not really something that would happen ?"
Can you make up with your abuser?,1,lt8yfx,1,"I have someone in my life who I dated in high school. We aren’t close but I’ve invited him to parties in recent years and I get along with him. Our breakups, probably at least 4 total, were very rough. The first was because he’d forced me into sexual acts, both physically and through manipulation. I broke up with him, we got back together because I was 17 and a survivor of worse abuse so it didn’t register with me that his behavior was unacceptable. The second time, he cheated on me 2 days before prom. The third was because of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse and me “just getting through” intimacy. The 4th was not necessarily a breakup because we weren’t “together” but I did halfheartedly cut him off because he assaulted me in my car. I didn’t speak to him for about 2 years apart from the occasional text from him basically expecting me to tell him everything he did wrong because he couldn’t remember and needed to know for his 12 step program. He added me on facebook in 2019 and i invited him to my NYE party and a few get togethers after. I just kind of set everything aside because it “wasn’t that bad” and “it was years ago” but now i’m thinking of it as if this had happened to a friend and i know i wouldn’t forgive him. i’m starting to wonder if i blew everything out of proportion because if it was as bad as i said it was, how could i be okay being in the same room as him now?"
I was a victim of sextortion at 13 years old. Is it possible I have PTSD?,19,lt7frc,11,So when I was 13 I was catfished by a guy pretending to be a girl and tricked into sending nudes (i deeply regret it you don’t need to tell me) The person then started blackmailing me telling me if i didn’t send again they would send the pics to all my friends. I actually can’t remember if i sent again or anything. At this time I also met a dude online who claimed to be playing college basketball and I believed him and we became friends. Turned out the girl was actually him and I blocked both of them. He kept trying to make accounts and harass me so the stress got too much and while crying i told my parents. We all made the decision to just try and move on and not get the police involved since it seemed like they weren’t contacting me much anymore (and other reasons). For the last few years they’ve contacted me here and there sometimes it’s obvious it’s them and other times it seems like a kid my age. The more time passes the less he contacts me. But anytime someone adds me on snapchat I wonder if it’s him. It’s been a few years but I’m still so anxious about it. Is it possible to have PTSD without physical abuse?? Is this PTSD or is it just a thing that I shouldn’t be worried about?
"If not me, who? How does one learn to trust?",2,lt4ops,0,"Of several traumas, two featured a theme in which multiple people that I considered friends and had mutual expectations of supporting eachother, failed me, left me vulnerable to be hurt. Did nothing to stop the harm, did nothing to apprehend the involved party, or any response was far too late to be of any meaning.    

After the first trauma, I told myself if there was a second time, it would go different.            

The second trauma was functionally identical. However it brought more hopelessness. That, those who I trusted to stand up for me, did not.     

These traumas do not pair well in addition to childhood abuse.    

Family has hurt me.     
Friends have been complacent.   
Strangers have hurt me.   
Heck, sometimes I hurt me.    

I am the only person who can protect myself, but being hypervigilant is counterproductive.    

How am I supposed to learn to trust others?     
To feel safe?    

Not having safety has been the only constant in my life."
My therapist is now over two and a half hours late for our appointment / how do i deal with a shitty therapist,1,lt3d4k,7,"I’m on medicaid so my choices are very limited and I’m going through one of the 3 approved practices. My doctor is fine but my therapist is, for lack of a better word, a quack. I don’t know how she has a license, I’m honestly not sure she does.

As a preface, no offense to anyone who practices or likes eastern medicine, I’m sure it is helpful to some, but not me.

My therapist is an “energy medicine practitioner” and told me that tapping different parts of my body would release my trauma. She believes in things like aromatherapy and reiki. I told her I prefer CBT and trauma based therapy, and want to work on processing my trauma (not tapping it away) and she responded that it’s worked for people for hundreds of years so why wouldn’t it work for me. At the time I didn’t really know what she was talking about but i’ve had a week to research it and it’s all pseudoscience with no evidence that it works, and lots of evidence it’s a sham/placebo effect.

Today we were supposed to discuss my treatment plan and I was going to tell her I do not have any interest in energy medicine and want therapy that’s based on science, but she’s now exactly 2 hours and 43 minutes late for my appointment, which I confirmed yesterday. 

No call to cancel, no email, nothing. She’s usually like 15-20 minutes late but this is absurd. I’m sorry but i have a debilitating mental health illness and I can show up on time. This just seems like proof that she’s unprofessional. I want to call the practice and request a new therapist, but i’ve already called twice to see wtf was going on and the man i talked to could tell I was pissed. 

I am not confrontational at all and never complain like this, i’m the type of person who if a restaurant messes up my order i just say oh well kinda sucks and move on. This is my mental health and well-being though, so i feel i have a right to be pretty pissed, and i know i’m not good at advocating for myself and i’m trying to work on that. At this point i honestly just don’t know how i can call and request a new therapist without being bitchy about it because i’m PISSED. what should i do?"
The intersection of my fucking painful stomach and PTSD (TW: substance use),5,lt2bys,4,"Yallllllll my stomach hurts so fucking much. Anxiety and shit. And all I can think of to relieve it is smoke weed, drink alcohol or abuse another substance. I don't wanna do that cuz I know I use it as an unhealthy coping mechanism and in the long run it adds to stomach issues but yaaaaallllll my stomach is so painful. I already tried a heating pad and tea"
Incite appreciated,1,lszpxd,1,"Just joined this group. I’ve had PTSD for a couple years more. It sucks. Prior to that I did see a counselor for depression and anger issues. After a few months with that counselor I thought I was ok and stopped going. Then my PTSD incident occurred. Like others, after a grieving period I thought I was ok. Several months later, I began to see signs that I was not right. I reached out to my counselor, but got no return call, so I was like fuck him, I’ll find someone else. Luckily, someone else in my field got me in touch with. PTSD therapist who specialized in EMDR treatment. Not gonna lie, it was tough, and physically and emotionally draining. But nearly a year later, I was starting to get back to my old self, then COVID. I haven’t been to see my therapist in a year due to Covid. My therapist would only do video or telephone sessions... but they’re not the same especially for my type of treatment. 

I messaged my therapist a week ago to try and set up an appointment, but they are pretty booked and will try to fit me in where they can. But that was after a week of waiting to hear back. I really like this therapist and don’t want to start over with someone new. Thoughts?"
Anybody use the ‘diving reflex’?,3,lsxe72,1," I was taught it by a mental health worker. I was wondering if this is as extreme as it gets? Is there something else that is as powerful, or could work equally well to sharply dip the intensity of rage you’re feeling when you’re having a PTSD flashback attack? Or is this as extreme as it gets to manage extreme emotion?"
Really really need advice. Panicking.,3,lsxdmu,1,"Tl;dr: I [30F] think my mother and partner [38M] are abusive and manipulative in the same ways. How to moved forward?

The story is very very long. Years of what I consider abuse on the part of my mother and now my partner. I am 30 and my partner is 38. We have been together four years. We just moved next door to my mother in my grandmothers house as my grandmother is now in a nursing home. The past few days have been hell. Every interaction with them is subtly or overtly insane to me.

Two nights ago, the three of us were standing in front of my grandmother’s piano. My mother was and is always agitated and stressed and stressful. She always has so much going on, more than anyone else, and her issues are more important than anyone else’s. We were standing around the piano, and I remembered how my mother had said that she wanted to try to move the piano next door to her house because she wanted to start practicing again. So I said, “So are you going to take the piano?” She then told me that she wanted to sell it back to the Conservatory.

I expressed dismay, but I was not angry, I was just emotionally sensitive because all of this stuff relating to my grandmother is sad for me, of course, which is normal. I listened as she explained this wasn’t really the important piano, the important piano is in another country and we can get it back. So even though I was sad about losing this piano, I was a bit relieved by the thought of having the other piano. However because I was sad, because I still felt attached to the piano I heard my grandmother play my whole life, I pleaded a bit saying not to sell it. All I said was “No don’t sell it,” but not in an angry way and I wasn’t crying. And she immediately snapped at me, “I’m not giving it to YOU!” And this was when I started to get upset, and I said “I’m not asking you to give it to me I was just asking you not to sell it!” I tried to explain that I had brought up the piano because I wanted her to have it (more on that layer) but she wouldn’t even let me talk before she kept saying again “I’m not giving it to YOU! You never consider me! I might need to sell it to SURVIVE!”

At that point I got really upset and started crying and when I cry I talk more loudly and emotionally and it sounds a bit like yelling and I started pleading asking what she was talking about, she can’t sell our things to live off of. She owns both houses and has very little living expenses and we have quite a bit of money to invest. Not millionaires, but there is some money and the two houses. For YEARS my mother has been terrible with money, saved absolutely nothing, and earned almost no income. Which is fine, I don’t judge people who don’t work but all this to say that if you own two beautiful houses in a desirable area on some land, you don’t sell those houses to “survive.” You rent out some rooms, you rent out a house, you have a garden and grow vegetables as much as you can to reduce food costs and when you have money to invest, you find a way. She has always had an intense scarcity mentality and even though she offered for me and my partner to live here, since the day we have moved in she has been passive aggressive and hostile in small ways and not small ways.

She then told me that she is an adult, I can’t tell her what to do with her piano, that I don’t want her to have anything, that how dare I say I “want” her to have her own piano, that it’s not my piano. I got really upset, I started crying and yelling asking why is she doing this, why is she saying all this, that you can’t talk about money this way and threaten to sell our things to survive. My partner thinks I’m insane, calls me narcissistic and borderline. I don’t know anymore. There’s so much more to the story and writing this out makes me realize that this story doesn’t really mean anything. It doesn’t prove anything.

Since then my partner has threatened for the thousandth time to leave me, that I am crazy, tonight he came up to my room as I he been avoiding him and he yelled at me for using “his” pot to cook. There are a lot of problems with that:

-That pot was given as a gift to both of us
-It is a pressure cooker and he doesn’t even know how to use because it is me who does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking. He thinks because he’s come to the grocery store with me a few times and makes a couple smoothies that he does as much as me in that regard. I cook real meals every day, multiple times a day for us.
-I have an eating disorder and am desperately trying to gain weight and yelling at me for using this pot is triggering and he knows it
-When he is angry at me he doesn’t give me money for groceries and right now we are low on food
-He is in MY house not paying rent or utilities, he gives me spending money and does pay for eating out. We just moved from an apartment where he was paying for everything but I was doing all housework and we had come to an agreement but one where I didn’t have any money of my own. I have been asking him for a year to help me make money as we have a few side hustles going on, but I need his help. He has his own business and I have helped him with his business a lot but of course he doesn’t see it.

Anyway so he tells me not to use his things, while being in my house and sleeping in my bed and having only contributed $80 for groceries so far. We spent a week making 6 different trips, three times with a uHaul to move his enormous inventory of musical equipment and things to my house. I have almost no things and yet my whole life my mom has always told me I have too many things. I had about four boxes worth of things. My grandmothers house is packed, almost every room, with his stuff.

I haven’t been keeping up with the laundry the last few weeks with the stress of the move, and three days ago, he asked me if he was going to have do everything alone? I got upset and I asked how can he say he has to do everything alone as I had spent days helping him. He in fact had me helping, his brother, and a friend drive an hour and a half to help us move. So he’s definitely not doing everything alone.

So even though he doesn’t buy food when we fight, doesn’t pay rent or utilities now, and won’t help me in making money so that I have my own income, he left all his dirty dishes last night. It was after cleaning up all his dishes that I then cooked for me, and that he then came to tell me not to use his things. I said nothing and didn’t argue and didn’t cry because I see now this is insane. I called my dad and he said that my mom and my partner want me to take the bait, and that they expect me to react in a certain way.

When I was pregnant two years ago my mother screamed at me that my partner was going to leave me and that she wasn’t going to pay for the baby and that I was going to be a single mother. I was really ill at the time and I ended up losing the pregnancy due to health reasons. I was desperately terrified for my health and my babies and she was screaming at me. My partner still to this day doesn’t think it’s as bad as I do. Which makes sense because after I lost the pregnancy I was a mess and having panic attacks and during one I ended up in the corner of the room on the floor sobbing asking what we were going to do about money and health care he spit on me out of frustration. My crying and talking when I’m crying sounds like yelling and it’s very triggering for him but no matter how much I try to stay calm, I become increasingly hysterical. When I had Akathisia from a rapid benzodiazepine taper I was on the ground in pain and she was telling me I was pathetic. (That’s a whole story in and of itself and involves my mom pushing diagnoses and meds on me which has left me traumatized, I went to intensive PTSD therapy after losing the pregnancy, my therapist tells me they are narcissists but still I am trapped). It’s been years of this abuse. I am stuck. Why do they hate me so much?

I’m sorry this is so long and disjointed, I feel really tired now.

Edited to add:

The house is mine in the sense that my mother said she is giving it to me. My partner also has issues with working a traditional job and I have helped him build up his business, I helped with marketing and the actual physical labor working ten hours a day that I get paid with through the food and shelter my partner was providing. So I do work. I didn’t tell my partner it was his job to figure it out when he thought he ruined two of his jobs. I got up and helped him fix it and reassured him and helped him grow his business and have supported all of his endeavors with my time and effort.

I don’t have to pay rent because my grandmother and mother want me to have the house, but when my mom is stressed she threatens to sell it before she puts it in my name. She told me this year she was going to put it into my name relatively soon.

I have PTSD and a therapist that I had ten months of PTSD therapy for after the pregnancy loss and how my partner and mother reacted. I was also ill and made my recovery last summer so I am better now and that is why I have spent the last six months working for my partners business. We have another side business but I can’t do it alone yet.

I do contribute. I do all the house labor, the grocery shopping, I help my partner with his business without real pay. I let him live in this house without asking for him to pay the utilities or anything except groceries. All I ask is for him to do his part of the side business so that I can have my own money in a way that will benefit both of us. I support his creative career, this house has a huge sunroom he is using for his art studio so he can stop working on his main business and pursue his dream of being a famous painter. What more can I do?

I can contact my old therapist but I am ashamed I am still struggling with the same things, albeit I am better than when I first saw her. She helped me get out of it and I know she thinks they are toxic so what can she do to help me if I don’t have the courage to leave?"
I'm embarrassed to use the word 'triggered',332,lswpgh,76,"I assume most of us here have things that either set off a state of panic, or immediately put us in an anxious mindset, where a flashback is more likely to take ahold.

The best word to use for that is a 'trigger', but it's been so co-opted by people being dramatic in political discourse that it just sounds silly to me. The moment I even begin a sentence with 'I got triggered by...' it just makes me cringe.

Is there anyone else who feels the same, or have I just spent too much time on Twitter?"
Nightmares,2,lsvxzr,0,Last night I had the nightmares from trauma and when i woke up i found myself having the same dreadful feelings that just knocked the shit out of me. Pretty exhausted. Just wanted to lie down and let go of everything.

A breakthrough in grieving for myself. Tw: CSA,2,lss60t,0,"I've been in therapy through the Australian public system for 2 years now, with intermittent psychology sessions. I've been dissociating on and off for years since I experienced incestuous CSA in my teens.

But I've been sitting with my emotions through daily journaling and discussions. It's been incredibly rough. My husband is a saint for supporting me through it all, what with my struggle with executive function and feeling overwhelmed by the smallest of things because I'm so raw. 

Today I was already feeling overwhelmed because I was having difficulty getting basic, inexpensive underclothes in my size at the local department store. So I was feeling a lot of shame about my body and it just built up into this big thing and suddenly as I was driving to the family home I had an outpouring of grief, asking ""Why would they do that to me?"" I've never cried over the abuse before. It wasn't until this year that I finally felt the anger, and now I'm feeling swings of depression.

I'd previously spent a lot of time in the bargaining stage, convincing myself that I was at fault. Hopefully acceptance is around the corner!"
It’s too much,8,lsr3do,22,"So much has happened to me, I’m not even 15 yet. My dad said that this isn’t hard, adulthood is harder. If that’s true, what even is the point..?

My body reacts negatively to sex,52,lsqozu,4,"Throwaway because family members could see this. 

When I (27F) was 15, I had my first real relationship with a younger boy (14M). Long story short, it turned bad very quickly. Sexual and physical assault was involved. We broke up a year later.

My first sexual experience wasn’t really a pleasant one. It was with him. He convinced me to lie to my mom about my whereabouts, leave my house at 4am, take the light rail, walk to his house by myself, and meet him at his house. I did it, we fought, and then he kicked me out of the house on my own. 

Fast forward to today. I’ve been with my current partner for 8 years. To be clear, he has not harmed me in any manner. Lately, I have noticed that whenever my partner and I are intimate, my body will involuntarily jerk in various ways during sex as if it’s screaming “NO!”

Without being too detailed, I just have a few examples:

-One of my hands will shoot up and lightly shove at his chest. Not harshly, but noticeable enough to where he’s stopped to ask if I’m okay 

-My hands have shot around his wrist to prevent him from getting closer to me (intimately) 

-If it starts to feel like I’m being pleasured too much, I will suddenly say “stop” and then switch positions. I just can’t be the one being pleasured and I don’t know why. 

I have a feeling it’s due to that relationship. I have blocked a lot of those memories out (apparently he pushed me down a flight of stairs at school in front of people but I seriously don’t remember). I don’t really know what to do about this other than therapy, which I can’t really afford right now. But I feel like when it comes to sex, I don’t have control over my body or my mind. 

Any guidance?"
DAE have guilt over your diagnosis? (Possible TW!),7,lspzo0,5,"I have two coworkers who have openly discussed having PTSD.

One, a military veteran who went through some downright horrific things and was minutes from dying before being rescued.
And two, a survivor of over 14 years of human trafficking.

And while I’ve come a long way since I was first diagnosed, in accepting that I do have trauma, that it doesn’t make me weak, that PTSD is not something to be ashamed of... I still find myself comparing my past to theirs and think
“Eh yours isn’t that bad” or “no one would believe you have PTSD, you’re just weak”

And logically- I know these thoughts aren’t true. But damn if I still don’t feel a little guilty, or weak, or less-than, or stupid for calling my past “trauma”.

Does anyone else understand were I’m coming from? Have you dealt with these feelings before, any advice?"
Could this be ptsd?,1,lsn7tu,1,"I know I should talk to a therapist and I will, I just thought I could share my symptoms and experiences to see if they’re similar to others with ptsd, and just to get some clarity.

My ex partner had mental health issues and would often project those issues onto me. Verbal abuse was consistent when he would get into these bad episodes saying that I’m worthless, pathetic, poison to his life, worse than his toxic ex gf, etc. he would constantly try to break up with me and one minute later take it back. He would often tell me he’s going to drive off a bridge so I would go stand in the way of his and the car keys or door and get pushed and shoved leaving bruises on me multiple times. 
I witnessed him attempt to hang himself and self harm. I had to wrestle him to get the knife off him before he hurt himself, had to hold him back from gouging his eyes out. 
I feared for his life every single time, and my life multiple times. I did all I could to keep him safe but it happened time and time again over the course of 3 years, it would cause me panic attacks every time I would witness his outbursts.
I recently broke up with him for completely different reasons and all of a sudden I’m getting worsening problems. I now get flashbacks of the knife and picture him there ready to hang himself. My body just shuts down and freezes up I feel like I’m back in it again. I get triggered by small things like opening YouTube or being near the house we used to live in together.

Is my story similar to anyone else in terms of having PTSD? Any comments, advice or insight is greatly appreciated!! Tia"
Today was a bad day.,2,lsm0ek,4,"Today was a bad day. I'm fine for several months. I'm good at suppressing. But I have flash backs to a few hard days during my wife's seven months of dying from lung cancer. The worst was three weeks before she passed. She was holding her own after chemotherapy and we actually went out for dinner. Right after eating and a block away from the restaurant. She had massive pain in her stomach. Unbelievable hard pain. I turned around and took her to a hospital. In short, her intestine had dead tissue from chemo and stomach acid was leaking into her abdomen. She was calling out for God to help her. The staff was unable to do anything except fill her with pain meds until the following mid morning when they finally took her into exploratory surgery. I stayed by her side and awake the entire time to protect her. I carried medical records in the car. The hours during the evening dragged on as she suffered from the pain until they finally had no recourse except to medicate. During one of the nightly checks her heart beat was so slow from massive pain meds they pushed me out of the room until they brought her back. I actually still feel her pain and my anguish from feeling so helpless. And stuffing away everything  to stay strong and coherent in case I had to make sure she was being taken care off. Its been since 2007 but every few months the anguish pushes through and I relive it again for a few hours. I know others have it worse, and I feel like a whiner if i bring it up. I've never talked to anyone about that night before. There are other episodes during her seven months but this was the worse."
Self care after trauma therapy sessions,3,lslzz9,9,"I have just started working with my first trauma therapist. She says I am ready for my first session of EMDR next week, which I did very briefly years ago and don't remember. Thank goodness I had actually told most of my history to other therapists before. Please, how do you decompress after sessions? I feel like I have spent several rounds in a boxing ring. I've stirred up so many ghosts and past issues today, and my brain won't stop worrying away at them, even though I know it's going to get me nowhere. I understand the difficulty only goes up from here.

teenage PTSD,1,lslwjb,2,"i dont know how much longer i can go

i just got diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago. im a teenager.

it feels like my life is already over.

i dont know how ill ever be able to recover. ever since my diagnosis its gotten worse and worse. its just brought all my repressed memories back to the surface. i have been having nightmares and panic attacks daily. my body remembers things and i can feel the pain i felt so long ago. but i have no memories attached to these feelings. it just feels like my body is attacking and hurting itself for no reason. i dont even know what triggers them at this point. it all just feels like a punishment

i have cut myself off from all my friends because i can’t handle to see them be so happy when i hurt so bad.

i dont know what to do. i just started to go to therapy weekly, and we have been working on recovering. i feel like giving up. i cant imagine how hard its going to get as i have to dive deeper into my memories and find ones that are far worse."
Question (Possible trigger warning),1,lslpbk,5,"Is it possible to get PTSD from viewing disturbing content? I remember 3 years ago i accidentally viewed a suicide video (a friend sent it saying it would be funny and i trusted him) and i have loads of PTSD symptoms based on that video. Hasnt been diagnosed yet, symptoms started around July 2020."
He Burned Me When I Was a Child,8,lsljmt,4,"This story might be distressing to some but this is my reality...

When I was 6 my mum was very busy with work and handling stress, which i wasn't aware of at the time because she was an amazing mother. Growing up I had a multitude of babysitters and this specific house was with a woman my mum went to secondary school with. I would like to add that her children were also present and took care of me also. I enjoyed going to her house because they taught me maths young and how  to read (I'm extremely dyslexic btw) Anyways back to the story. Despite being close to her children, there was one who never really interacted with me much. We'll call him Cory. Cory agreed one day to take care of me whilst my mums friend was busy, he took me into the living room which was wall filled with a large bookcase of books. Following him in silence I awkwardly stopped after he did.

""You can sit down"" He was polite but the tone showed proof that he didn't want to deal with me. Without hesitation i obeyed his request childishly saying ""okay!"" I remember that the chair was made of leather, it was red and tall enough that my legs dangled.

Cory pulled out a ironing table. Excited, i asked ""Could I help you iron? I actually like ironing, my grandma lets me but mum doesn't like ironing very much.""

""No its okay I don't need any help,"" He took an awkward pause, ""I'll call you if I need any help""

""Okie"" I sat back in the chair dangling them silently thinking about if i stretched them out if they would reach the ground. Time passed, I'm not sure how long.

""Amaya (placeholder name for myself)?""

""Yes!""

I cant remember what he said exactly but it was either ""come here and help me"" or ""I need some help.""

I naively sprung up from the chair and walked calmly towards him, he made me nervous with his silence but it was cut this time. He was ironing a shirt and set the iron upright on the table as he looked down to me.

""Put your hand up here."" He tapped the side of the ironing table twice, because of how close to the table i was standing i first placed my left hand then my right because it was less of an uncomfortable hold (Ill mention that the table was very tall in comparison to me at the time) ""Place it flat"" I spreaded my hand out not expecting his next decision.

He picked up the iron and pointed it downwards. ""Stay still"" he said a second before placing the tip of the iron on the centre of my hand as he carved a C into it. I watched him. I can't remember my emotions whilst he did it. I don't even remember crying but i do remember him telling me ""You cam go and sit back down."" Once again politely but  irritated.

I sat and sucked on my right hand burn silently crying. I remember telling myself ""Don't cry"" over and over again as i silently sobbed. With a smirk, he walked over to me and knelt.

""Please don't cry,"" he said softly, ""at least don't cry too loud""

After that I think started crying louder. His mum came into the room confused, she walked to me.

""Aweee Amaya why are you crying? Did someone hurt you?"" I nodded, ""Who?"" I stopped crying, looked away and said nothing, ""Was it Cory?"" I started crying again and nodding. She asked me if i wanted her to beat him up. With tears I said yes. She left and i heard the commotion, I sat sucking on my hand as i curled into a ball and cried.

I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD but this event makes me feel like I could suffer with it, one of the reasons is because sometimes when i get stressed out I suck on the scar on my hand. I also go blank when i get distressed, its like my whole face rests an I become silent. With thoughts sometimes completely blank.

I'm much older now but  still live with his C on my hand, weirdly enough I must've blocked that memory out for a while after that because as a child I was almost proud of that burn. I called it my moon shaped scar. Thank you for reading my story and I'm very sorry for any grammatical issues.

I don't hate ""Cory"" as a child hate was something i just didn't feel in the same way grown ups do. To this day I want to confront him and ask him ""why?"" I don't think I blame him. I just want to know what I did wrong, I was a obedient child who would listen to anyone I trusted.

I could add a pic of my scar if you guys want to see it (Its much smaller now and not graphic) 

Id love to talk more about this, I've only opened up once and its something that still effects me today."
"[TW! Gaslighting, emot. abuse, manipulation] Parents are a cause for a lot of trauma, now I'm an adult I need to move out ASAP. Is it a normal response for me to feel like a ""horrible kid"" for wanting to effectively run away from my parents and just go live my life? Often feel I'm being dramatic.",11,lskpyw,6,"*{ Okay. This feels very long and ranty and I feel I'm whining a bit, but that's also kinda the point of my issue right now, so here we go. I tried to give examples, as context for why moving out is so essential. Also trying to convince myself it doesn't make me a bad person to do so because of evidence. There's a lot more trauma I won't be mentioning as I feel it'd be too triggering but I've mentioned some of the milder things they do to mess with my head. }*

&#x200B;

So much of the time my parents trigger me and I have an intense initial response (anger, frustration etc), so ready to make a plan to just go and live somewhere else, and then the trauma exhaustion and resignation kick in and I'm too tired to have any fight left in me and I just switch to **""wow I overreacted and I'm just being overdramatic and a sucky family member""**.

**Is this a normal/common reaction for people with trauma to have?** Or am I really a horrible family member for just wanting to up and leave? I wasn't even allowed to leave the house alone at all until I was a legal adult (and even then wanted to place a tracker in my phone) so I just feel I've been living in their prison for so long but they always turn everything on its head and blame me for everything.

They've spent so much of my life pretending I'm not there when I'm trying to talk to them, flat-out ignoring me or talking over me when I'm trying to tell them about my day when I came home from school, taking no interest in my life except to criticise something the context of which they were too lazy to look away from their phone and listen to (e.g reasons for a slightly low grade), only to complain I never told them things and never spoke to them or spent time around them (due to giving up).

I ended up developing at least 1 extra personality (*not* D.I.D) during 2019 when I was deeply dissociated 24hr a day from the constant, unrelenting stress and trauma my parents caused me (I won't specify). Every day I experienced dissociation, derealisation and depersonalization that has only recently gotten better.

They tried to discourage me from going to university, and now suddenly because I briefly had student accommodation but then had to move back home (thanks COVID), they ""missed me loads"" and ""are so glad I'm back with them"". I get paid £3k in student maintenance loans to look after myself and pay my flat's rent and my parents seem to think that money is ""basically theirs anyway"" and I should give it to them when I already pay them weekly rent too.

I have trauma from years of gaslighting and being controlled to mad degrees, and having them even gaslight me about my own disabilities (physical & learning) and telling me I ""just seem to conveniently have an excuse for everything"". I've had them interfere with medical appointments, trying to manipulate my doctors into not listening to me and not thinking I had anything wrong with me besides being ""lazy and a slob"". One minute they say I'm too sick to be allowed to go for a stroll, the next minute apparently I'm not sick at all and I'm just faking my tears of chronic pain and fatigue when I'm unable to clean their house for them (I'm... I'm literally disabled). They frequently call me useless.

My mother listens to phone calls, often rummaged through my things, is generally super invasive and has no respect for privacy. This year she hurriedly returned to me a diary she had stolen from my room when I was around 13. I also have ADHD and struggle severely with sensory processing, and the amount of noise in my house is insane to the point where I end up crying because there isn't a single room where there isn't *someone* shouting or shrieking or singing or shoving things into walls.

&#x200B;

This is absolutely only a fraction of the issues I have with my parents, **so my question is...**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I should feel fine about moving away from them, right?**

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD,79,lsk0e8,41,"Hi there, I was recently diagnosed with ptsd that has been caused by my childhood. My parents are alcoholics, and honestly I never even thought that I had it. I'm still wrapping my brain around it and trying to process it because I had always just chalked it up to just *having a shitty life*. But now I'm starting to understand my triggers, some atleast.
I had just started therapy and im coming to terms that most of my issues are from my mother because I'm basically her emotional punching bag. I have yet to even tell her, I mean, how do you properly tell someone ""hey, because of you I have ptsd"". Like I don't hate her, but she has (and some other people) have definitely messed me up emotionally. She's done some things that I will never forgive her for, if I'm being honest. I'm still angry at all of the things she has put he through, and she will never see what she has done. She's become this very selfish.. victim playing person and it's impossible to (most days) have a conversation with her.
I'm still trying to process this and I hope therapy helps me understand but just coming to terms with this is so.. insane and kinda hurts more than when I just thought I had depression and anxiety. The more I realize the more angry I get, it's frustrating as hell at this point."

I wish I never met my ex,8,lsh5fm,4,"TRIGGER WARNING 

Abuse, gaslighting, self harm







I posted this in trueoffmychest before I discovered r/ptsd. I don't know if I actually have PTSD but... I have flashbacks and ... I just really need to talk about it. Not to someone I know. I feel scared for whatever reason. I don't know if I can tell my mom or my gf maybe because I blame myself. I feel like I ruined my own life.


It's been a little under a month that she moved back to her home country. She's from Kazakhstan and she moved here for education. I think she has PTSD and it probably is a really big reason why she had a lot of the reactions that she did. 

I can't stop thinking of the things she did. It doesn't help that I'm living in the same apartment. I have to move out, but I don't have the means to right now. Sometimes my flashbacks feel like they're happening right now, and the fear is immobilizing. She used to put our lives in danger when she drove recklessly, I remember running out of the car screaming after she accelerated into the parked cars in front of us and then slammed on the brakes. She used to choke and beat herself in front of me during our arguments, screaming. She would cut herself then send me pictures and show me in person. She painted massive words on the walls of our apartment in black paint. ""You should kill yourself. You're worthless."" Directed towards herself. Huge words on our newly painted walls. She justified this with, ""at least I didn't hurt myself."" And said I cared more about material things than her. She would chase me down every time I needed to get away from her, sometimes that would give me panic attacks. Her insecurity completely choked and smothered me until I couldn't breathe. She would badmouth herself constantly... she'd assume I thought badly of her before I ever opened my mouth. There was a constant stream of self hatred from her but it was extremely manipulative. She made me feel guilty if I didn't feel sorry for her. She told me if I ever broke up with her she'd kill herself. She said I'm the only reason she has to live. She eventually made me disconnect from friends and family and gaslit me constantly, telling me that our relationship was normal. That everything she does is normal. That actually, we have a great relationship. That I'm making a big deal of everything, I'm being childish.

She tried to guilt me into marrying her because if I didn't her entire future as an immigrant from a 3rd world country was forfeit. She blamed me for everything when something went wrong in her life. She made me work on her homework and her own work took priority over everything I had to do. Ultimately my struggles were nothing compared to hers. She would excuse all of her own behaviors, constantly saying things that contradicted herself. She would call me non stop if I didn't pick up and message me nonstop, and did the same to my own family members. Begging and pleading for me to answer when I finally moved to my mom's just to get away from her only to be faced with her boyfriend who hated me.

She ruined our personal belongings. She threw glass jars, broke plates, broke doors. She read my personal messages.

She did this and so so much more. Always with, ""this is normal. I'm not doing anything wrong.""

I think of every one of these things a lot and it makes me feel so much fear and regret that I feel sick. I feel like she was a curse that visited my life and I'm trying hard to get over it but... it's haunting me. Her name, Alex, is extremely common and I think of her every single time I hear it. My cousin is named alex, my friend's friend, my friend's ex boyfriend, my hairdresser. I can't escape.

I used to self harm and I have a lot of problems with depression but now when I feel depressed the very first thing I think of is her and her abject insanity and I'm terrified because I feel like that's what I'll become. Obviously not but my own mental illness reminds me of her, and I don't know if some day I'll stop thinking of her. I wish it never happened. I wish I could forget she ever existed. 

I'm polyamorous and I'm with my girlfriend. I was with her at the time I started dating alex as well. I feel like this is all my fault. For dating her, for giving her so many chances, for ruining my own life. Everything seems to trigger thoughts of her. When I see violence I imagine her abusing herself in front of me and screaming. When I'm depressed, when I think of hurting myself or suicide, when I hear people saying that they're worthless, I imagine her manipulating me to tell her she's not worthless, and exploding when I don't give her the response she's looking for.

I'm scared. The flashbacks are scary. I want to stop thinking about her. There are specific moments that never leave me. 

I don't know if I sound... valid or... 

I'd just like some confirmation I suppose 

That what I'm feeling is real

Did I fuck up?

What should I do aside from what I'm doing now (trying to get a psychiatrist and a therapist)?"

How are you guys dealing with flashbacks?,5,lscwvi,6,"I have PTSD from a terrible car accident 10 years ago. I’m still getting flashbacks of it every single day and it comes by very randomly—when I’m in the shower, or eating my meal, or when I’m in the middle of doing my work. There’s no trigger or anything. 

Generally I think I’m doing “fine”, just living my day to day life “normally” (if we’re not factoring in the flashbacks). I’m not depressed or inflicting self-harm it’s just that getting those flashbacks every.single.day is very emotionally and psychologically draining."
Does anyone else wake up feeling anxious and shakey/panicked or is a light sleeper?,3,ls6z1k,1,"I literally need an alarm and cannot sleep too long. It's an incredibly unpleasant and sometimes scary feeling. Does anyone else have this issue?

PTSD Nightmares,3,ls68g5,5,"Hello, I have been researching similar posts trying to see if I can find any answers without mich luck. I have really bad PTSD nightmares about being back in my parents house at LEAST once a week, usually more. They are extremely vivid, they last what feels like the entire night, and they are extremely draining. In my PTSD dreams I am always back in their house and trying to run away but I keep being brought back. Almost every single time I am sobbing and cant stop. Like on the ground ugly scream crying and cant stop, even while I am running. Its really draining, I wake up feeling emotionally and physically exhausted and it FEELS like I have been crying all night. 

I couldnt get my doctor or therapist to take me seriously. My doctor basically said ""Idk make sure you dont eat before bed"" which I made sure I didnt do and hasnt helped. I am looking for a new therapist. I am losing a lot of sleep and tbh it just brings all the trauma to the front of my mind when I should be getting ready for work. I have been out of my parents house over 8 years now and the dreams are still so intense and frequent. 

My question is: If you had these or know someone who did, what the hell did you do to deal with them??? I have tried a few things but at this point I will do anything, I cant handle going back there every other night. Sorry wasnt supposed to be this long thank you for reading..."

Advice on how to control my negative thoughts?,4,ls52vl,1,"I was diagnosed with PTSD last March. My ""best friend"" did something to me that I still can't mention by name. I keep telling myself I'm strong enough to get through this, but I'm really not. Tonight I wrote out two letters. One to my roommate and one to my parents. I think this is the end of the road for me. I honestly thought my hands would be shakier than they are or that I would be scared, but I'm not really. I'm sad with how it will affect my parents, but I feel at peace. I just thought that I should try one last thing before I decide what to do. Do you guys have any advice for how to control these negative/suicidal thoughts?"
PTSD severely re-triggered. Insomnia is relentless. TRIGGERING content,31,ls4ji5,7,"I recently started a volunteer training to field calls for a domestic violence and sexual assault/abuse hotline. I thought I was ready. I have always felt the need to give back. I have been abused in many ways and now as an undergrad I am persuing a BS in psychology/minor in HDFS and gathering as many research/volunteer/intern opportunities as I go. I hope to become a counselor in some form.

So this hotline training. It has wrecked me. I am in my early 20's on my own. I work, I go to school, I got a grant and am working in an undergraduate research lab. My life is full, I look for opportunities everywhere. I don't have much of a financial/social support network. A week into this training and I didn't feel right. I kept going. The modules were incredibly triggering. I ignored my initial feelings as stress (taking on too much to begin with, which is also true) and kept going. The live trainings and discussions over zoom made me start to completely disassociate. Driving to work after 4 hours of heavy lecture and not remembering the drive. Clocking out, going home, not sleeping. Remembering things I had stuffed so far down that I thought they didn't exist, suddenly coming into my perfectly crafted, hard earned life. I'm so upset. I'm an overachiever, I am a perfectionist, I just want to make a few people proud and help some others with their inner turmoils. I see the flaws in these thoughts. I just want to help others.

I've been in therapy since I was 10. It feels like it will never end and I have so much weight on my shoulders, so many things to do and maintain. I had no idea I'd be so incredibly triggered by events in the past that I have now been processing for over 10 years. I'm ashamed, upset, feeling like a failure. I just want to help people. I just want to give back. It pains me to think that I wouldn't be able to because I've been so damaged by my own trauma. This was a long, rambly post, but ultimately I'm looking for advice. Do other people experience this when they're triggered? Not sleeping? Has anyone had a re-triggering event so intense it kind of pauses life?

It's 3am. I can't sleep, my brain is humming along in endless cirlces. Thanks for reading."
Is it possible to have self-inflicted trauma??,9,lrxete,2,"Let me explain further. Is it possible to have trauma from self harm. Example: I once burned myself with bleach very bad and had to go through a long, painful recovery. I washed it using a certain soap, which now makes me sick to smell. But, I originally did the burn (as well as the other things) myself. I don’t know if it’s even possible to have trauma when you did it on purpose, but after I did it I regretted it and the recovery process and healing is probably the most painful things I’ve ever experienced. So, that brings me back to my question: is it possible to have self-inflicted trauma?"
I feel stupid for freaking out,7,lrv5k9,7,"I have a wonderful boyfriend who I love more than anything. Today is his birthday so we went out to dinner. I put in a new shirt I bought. It’s one of the ones that is tight around the neck and then there’s a big cut out in the chest. The neck helps it all stay in place.

One of my triggers is people touching my neck. I know this. I will either immediately cry or yell if anyone touches my neck and will shake uncontrollably.

 I was in the restaurant and the strap was bothering me so badly to when my head is racing. I was refusing to eat. But this is a damn shirt it isn’t going to mess with me at all. But it’s so tight I was panicking because it felt like a hand.
I went to the bathroom and took off my shirt and stuffed it in my pocket. I was wearing a coat and you couldn’t tell I was topless. The shirt went immediately in the trash when we got back home.

My boyfriend was super sweet about the whole thing but I still feel like a shit. I feel like I suck. I feel like I am trapped in my own head. And I’m exhausted. Physically and mentally. 
That’s all. Thanks for listening."
Make Amends?,1,lrt8h9,1,"How do you even start the conversation? What about those who appear or are openly skeptical, do you even try?

I suffered from PTSD for 24 years before my diagnosis and treatment started. I'm able to look back now and see the damage my hostility and related symptoms/behaviors caused, and how had I been of a state of mind to respond to situations better the damage could have been avoided.

I know the PTSD wasn't my fault. I knew I needed help after the event that caused it and even tried to seek treatment, but was misdiagnosed and was under the impression that what I was suffering from would only affect me in very specific circumstances, so I didn't seek any further treatment and made sure to avoid those circumstances. 

I want to repair the damage I've done, but it seems the only way to do that is to apologize for something that wasn't my fault and that I was really powerless to prevent. Apologizing without explaining the reasons why seems like taking responsibility for something that wasn't my fault. And I'm concerned apologizing while explaining the PTSD would just sound like I'm making excuses since PTSD is not understood well be those who haven't experienced it;  I used to be one of those people.

I really feel bad for what everyone went through when I was a different person. I can see their hurt and I want to take it away. Not because I want something from them, but because it's a burden they shouldn't have to bear. If they want to pick up from where we left off great, if not I know I'll just have to accept that, but it won't be without sadness."

That really specific feeling for the rest of the day after therapy working on your traumas,28,lrqdqx,9,"I think this is the community that will understand the best. Especially about how difficult it is just to talk about this stuff, it’s hard enough to let the thought into your head let alone speak it. (I assume this is more for the first few times speaking about it - idk I’m new to talking about it). 

The rest of the day for me is like floating and living in a cloud and being horribly nostalgic and thinking about everything that’s happened and trying not to think about it. I guess dissociation makes sense. Not to mention being EXHAUSTED. Please say I’m not the only one, I don’t think most people will understand how hard this is. I had a humbling realization today that I’m petrified of my thoughts. I’m not scared of the memories I’m scared of allowing myself to think about them.  

I’ve been in therapy for years but only now am I in a position to talk about the hard stuff. I can’t avoid it any longer. Does anyone have tips on how to function while the memories resurface? Like for the weeks I’ve been working on it in therapy the flashbacks and everything are worse and it’s taking over my life."

I left my abuser behind but I feel like I'm drowning,6,lrnj99,3,"After nearly 30 years of manipulation, threats, and veiled abuse, I have removed my mother from my life. Instead of toeing the line like she normally does, she barreled right through it. It happened first thing in the morning, I woke up to the text and nearly vomited. I felt like I was in a haze when I talked to her an hour later, like that text just hadn't sunk in or I was trying to block it out. 

I didn't snap out of it until that afternoon, and I called my sibling to tell them what had happened. They also suffered her abuse, in many ways more so than I did, as they carried a heavy financial burden trying to keep things normal for me during my teens. They were outraged, absolutely fuming when I described my morning, the text, and how mom sounded so nonchalant about it all. They called our dad, told him the situation, and then called mom. They lit into her, told her how disgusting she was, that she would never see her grandkids again, not even in pictures. Mom just hung up. She's never truly cared about her grandkids after all. 

Mom called me shortly after. Started in on playing her part as the victim, saying I must hate her now too. I told her I didn't hate her, but I was disgusted by her actions. She defended herself again and I completely lost control. I don't even remember what I said or how long I was screaming at her, but my spouse came and took my phone away and blocked her. 

It's been almost two weeks. I'm cycling between feeling relieved, sick to my stomach, angry, and emotionally dead inside. As a whole, my therapist was pleased with how well I've been handling it. I've progressed from one session a week to one a month in the last year, and cbt has helped immensely, but the intrusive thoughts are destroying me right now. I'm forcing myself to eat regularly, but I'm not hungry. I go to bed at a regular time, but I lay awake for hours. I'm functioning, but I feel like I'm drowning. How do I break this hold she still has over me? I don't ever want to see or speak to her again, and I will hold to that until she's gone. 

I've talked my sibling out of ruining her life. What she did would destroy her standing in her religion, which is really all she has now that she lost both of us. I told them that she thrives off of attention and is expecting something like that. That would fit her narrative of us being evil children and her being the victim. So we agreed to drop it, and only told relevant cousins, the ones who make sure everyone in the family is in the loop. Of course we didn't share details, I'm not out to wreck her reputation. She'll handle that on her own. 

I still have nightmares pretty often but the cbt has helped me navigate my way out of them so instead of waking up mid panic attack, I just wake up pissed that the dream even happened. Hidden memories keep popping up at random, poking at me until I have to stop what I'm doing and find a distraction from them. They don't cause panic attacks, just frustrate me. How can I work through this? I don't want to keep feeling angry at her, I want to forget her. What methods have worked for y'all? The meds I'm on work fine for me, and I don't really want to add more to my current pharmacy collection. I'd like to get through this myself, with the support of friends/family and therapy. 

Thanks for reading all this, I know it's a lot. I tend to word-vomit when I'm trying to figure something out."

I’ve called into work every single week, am applying for FMLA, worried what will happen if I don’t get approved. I’m terrified. Idk why life has to be like this. I’m on my last warning, but like my job requires us to be very attentive and aware at all times. It can be very dangerous if we’re not.

Resenting family for triggering ptsd,3,lrd8sd,2,"I actually don't want to resent my family but anytime  I start to feel a sense of normality, someone just does something triggering.

Any suggestions or thoughts about sudden nightmare surge?,6,lr94p4,3,"(First time poster here) 

For whatever reason, my flashbacks and intrusive thoughts are mostly just in the form of nightmares lately. It started about 2 weeks ago. Normally I'll have one every so often, but this has been every night. To the point of avoiding sleep and waking up freaking out so I drink red bull and/or whiskey until I chill out or end up back asleep. 

Sometimes it's the events that I dream about and wake up not knowing where I am for a bit (when I relive events via a dream I wake up still continuing the dream. Time varies on when I actually convince myself I'm home). Other times I have dreams based around or with elements of events.

 I have at least one of these nightmares every night. As a result I'm always tired, can't focus, and I stay zoned out. I don't know why the sudden surge or how I can help myself here. Any thoughts or suggestions would be very appreciated. I'm currently writing this right after I ""calmed down"" so I'm sorry if I made anything confusing."

My girl at the time left shortly there after. Fast forward to 2019 and I started seeing someone.  About a year ago people started telling me I need to go back, I'm not myself and becoming miserable to be around. Two days ago my girl said she needed a month to take a break and I need to reflect on myself and the relationship. That was the moment my world collapsed. I've set up appointments with the VA and am willing to start listening and working on myself. I can't afford to lose this woman. I've been a toxic boyfriend for about the last 6 months,. I'm scared and worried that I won't start therapy in time to at least start making some progress on myself. I know it takes more than a month, it takes a lifetime to learn how to confront and cope with the problems. The thing is, she has never given any guys a break during a relationship so I am the first.  So I am asking for two things. 

 1- are there any free resources/therapists I can at least talk to in the mean time while waiting for my appointments?

could i have ptsd?,1,lr4sgg,2,"(Throwaway)  
Hey all. first time on the subreddit

i've been looking into things and i'm wondering if i could have ptsd, or if it's just something else. i'm 16 and my psychiatrist told me i have some sort of depression or anxiety disorder but nothing has been diagnosed yet. i ask this because i'm unsure if it's worth getting evaluated for

There are a few reasons why i'm hung up about this. i don't know what a nightmare feels like. i have never gotten a panic attack in my life, just intense anxiety, and i don't know if what i feel are flashbacks or just intrusive thoughts + dissociation. (i dissociate quite often). My trauma all happened online through text so i have no physical sensory experiences to actually connect the event to, i just sort of see a blurry discord screen sometimes or remember words or thoughts

there have been times where i see something that's supposed to be a trigger but i don't feel anything. maybe it's just because i've trained myself to not feel mental pain like that but it scares me because i don't know if i'm just making all of this up. i've been dealing with this for about an entire year now, so it must be *something* but i have no idea what

i'm sorry this turned into a bit of a rant, if you have any questions please ask! thanks"

"Huge fight with narcissistic mother, wondering if I’ll even have a home a year from now",1,lr0xq4,0,"Trigger warning: this rant deals with abuse and derogatory language along with rape. Please don’t read if it will harm you)

I just had the most horrific fight with my narcissistic mother and told how I feel about her abandoning me  when I got my PTSD diagnosis, leaving us for the holidays, missing my birthday among other things. 

It started over something small and just snowballed. I took animal food dishes away after she’d put them down, we were arguing because she’s almost never home and had made the animals sick with the amount of food she gives them and won’t listen that they’re on a schedule and as I there then out she cornered me in our kitchen, tried to snatch the bowls out of my hands and then screamed at me and blocked me from leaving the room despite me yelling at her that I didn’t want to talk and for her to let me through. She tried to justify that she’s a mom and they’re nothing wrong with the fact that she wants to preserve her relationship with my rapist.
She known for years, I told right after it happened and she still choose my rapist instead. I was finally let out when I reminded her that she isn’t a real mother anymore since she referred to my rape as’ kids f**king around’ 
Then out of spite because I shut her down and walked away she reminded me that my rapist was a big part of my life and caused me to have flashback and nearly a panic attack. And I let her know how negatively she effects my mental health and that her not being around made it improve across the broad. I felt defiled and disgusting. It needed to happen, she hasn’t spoken to me in months and I had to let it out. 

Now since my folks are getting divorced I’ve now learned that not only will I probably lose the only hole I know, I also won’t be able to move in with my dad for sometime once it’s finalized  and frankly I’m sacred. I wasn’t expecting this to happen, if anything I’ve been avoiding it because I was worried about fallout. I don’t know how to feel because as cathartic as it was to let her know the truth, now I’ve learned how dire my situation is and I already suffer with rampant anxiety and I don’t know if it was the right thing anymore.

I know it needed to happen. She been a very emotionally and psychologically abusive and well as emotionally manipulative. I couldn’t take it anymore. I brought up how could she care when she left up for holidays and birthdays? How could she call herself a mother when she’s called me a ‘ cee u next Tuesday’ on more than one occasion for no real reason? Her response was I probably deserved it and when I brought up how she didn’t care for my mental illness she said she was trying to understand while also admiring she’ll never attend a therapy session with me. My father had on multiple occasions and he was never someone who thought they would. 

And now it really hitting me that I’m losing my home, that a year from now I may not have one or sooner. I don’t know what to do anymore"

Flashback or Intrusive Thoughts?,2,lquh70,1,"I’m trying to determine if what I’m experiencing are flashbacks or intrusive thoughts, because I’m not too clear on the difference.  When I get triggered, a memory of the event will pop into my head and I’ll feel trapped there, like no matter what I do I can’t get the thought out of my head.  I know where and when I am and stay grounded in the present, but the thoughts trigger panic and fear, and I feel the need to run and hide, out of the fear that someone or something will catch me and hurt me in some undetermined manner.  Which do you think this is?"
Is avoidance a no-no or maybe sometimes smart??,2,lqsrue,2,"Where do you think goes the line between unhelpful avoidance and avoiding things that make you sad so that it actually helps you?

I have a low self-esteem in my personal life. How can I improve it?,1,lqq8wj,0,"Hi,

I have been experiencing a low self esteem in my all life. I had to solve many troubles before attacking this one. Now I'm ready to improve my self-esteem. But I don't know how can I do it.

For example, I don't know what is important. It's true time and money is important, but I don't care giving my time or money to people who need more.

Also I know I can out some boundaries. But I don't feel attack when people speak badly about me. For example, a gf quit me, and when she quit me, she talked badly about me : you have strange smells sometimes, sometimes you are away and you look stupid, I don't like handsome men, you are average and it's better, I have better sex with a previous partner, I have a high sense of hygiene, and you are too roots for me. But I don't feel offended when they say that, but I neither hurt. But people feel they can say anything to me, and it unbalance our relationship. 

I feel like I don't what is important and to deal when someone talk to me like this.

In my job, I'm fully respected, I think, and people are cool with me.

There are obvisouly more problematic problem, but at first, I want to improve small things before big things.

Any advice?"

How to support sibling with PTSD,7,lqj4z2,2,"My brother has recently revealed devasting childhood trauma to our family. He has ramped up therapy appointments and is waiting for more in-depth trauma intake appointments to happen in the next month. I have been calling him every day, sometimes more to chat and offer my support. He has some anger issues and screams at night or in the shower. He does not have a job or any sort of responsibilities at the moment (lives at home). Right now his life is waiting for his next therapy appointments. He doesn't do much else, maybe occasionally go for a walk or listen to music. I feel so terribly for him and want to be there for him. I do not live in the same state as him so I cannot physically be there for him. What else can I be doing to support him?

I can understand that recovery/healing is a life long journey but am also curious if anyone has similar experience reaching an emotional bottom then making some sort of progress to being able to move out from their parents house or  be able to spend some of their day doing things for themselves? I want to be careful to be patient with him, support him and also figure out what sort of timeline there are for certain goals (like moving out, getting a job or going to school, working on a hobby on the days he is available to do so). The first focus right now is getting specific help for his ptsd,  but I'm not sure what the next step looks like."
Support groups,5,lqillj,4,"I just recently unveiled my childhood trauma with my therapist. I am now going through what she calls a ""vulnerability hangover"".

It’s been over 10 years. I barely get flashbacks. Life is, for the most part, good. And I want to live it. I’m just really fucking tired. I’d like a vacation from past trauma, please.

I’m angry at the person at fault in my car accident for lying until he got caught,116,lqfg1x,21,"The bastard ran a red light, then lied and said I ran it. It is ok because he still got caught and is being held accountable! It’s the fact that he lied. He didn’t know if I was even alive in the car behind him and damn lied. Not a single fuck was given. I saw him today at the tow company and he looked THROUGH me. I thought he was looking at me, I looked him in the eye and it was like he didn’t see me. I’m so angry, I’m happy legal action is being taken and I’m also talking to lawyers, but thinking about his lack of remorse for the after math of his potentially deadly mistake makes me soooo mad. People keep talking me I’m lucky to be alive, first of all of I was that lucky I wouldn’t have gotten hit in the first place and second of all he’s lucky this little girl can’t take justice into her own hands cause I wanna drag his ass with no remorse like he did my car with my fucking body in it."
Are these flashbacks? (help),6,lqffe3,1,"First off i have more mild ptsd usually (like most of the time, it's just mild stuff i often barely notice) and because of that i'm pretty lost when i get more intense stuff. like i don't really know how to deal with them very well yet.

 So here's the thing. for the last 20 hours or so, i've been massively triggered. like massively. probs one of the worst ""episodes"" i ever had ptsd wise. and the thing is, i don't really know what i'm experiencing right now exactly (i think it's some type of flashbacks but idk) & i don't know how to stop it. so basically wondering if someone could tell me what they think i'm getting? and give me advice on how to temporarely ""come back"" down? 

So what i'm getting pretty much is a mix of me feeling scared & upset cut with total emptiness non stop ( they switch out super fast, kinda like scared numb scared numb in like 10 secs) combined with me feeling spacey, dreamy, rigid,heavy, tired to super alert & light and feeling sensations from my traumas like tasting stuff, feeling physical sensations from back then alll over (like everywhere not just like in one place like i usually do), with at times me feeling one of the people who hurt me be right there, real close to me"
DAE / Nightmare - is it normal ?,2,lqeo7e,3,"Hi all,

Quick story short, I've been molested by my older brother age 6 to 8, he is 5 years older than me. I kind of pretended it never happened for 20 years, just locking it in a corner of my head. 

However, I recently started asking for help and talking more about it. I'm having nightmares pretty much every night. Relieving things, being forced to tell my family what happened and being shamed for it. 

My question is: does anyone else can't really function on the day they have nightmares? I'm just so unproductive, frozen and kind of dead inside? My husband says I take ""nightmares too seriously"" and that's ""its just a nightmare""
But to me, it feels so much worse than an average nightmare, like the ones I used to have before I opened that ""Pandora box"".

I hope I make sense.

Thank you for reading.

why does no one tell you that witnessing emotional abuse is just as traumatic as physical abuse?,9,lqclj9,2,"TW// 

i live in a house with my step dad and my mom. my parents have been married for 17 years but should’ve gotten divorced after the first two. 

my step dad constantly berates my mom, talks down to her, screams at her, gives her silent treatments, gaslights her, etc. and i can’t do anything but watch her take it. she vents to me a lot about how he treats her, telling me she’s depressed and has suicidal thoughts. and i have to constantly walk on eggshells to keep everyone’s moods at bay. 

i want to move out but i’m scared he’ll hurt her if she’s alone with him for too long. he’s only ever hit her once that i know of and it was 10+ years ago but his rage scares me so much. 

because of my living situation combined with having parents that sheltered from basic social settings, i have severe anxiety, depression and my therapist thinks i could have ptsd from witnessing abuse.

Loss of pet,21,lq9pam,18,"Last November, my 8 yr old lost her puppy. He died suddenly one morning as she was getting ready to open his crate to walk him. She has been devastated ever since. She took absolutely excellent care of him. He was her baby. This pup sat with her while she did her school work, watched tv, playing video games, reading books, etc. He went wherever she went. She potty trained him, fed him, trained him how to sit, play fetch, etc. They were inseparable. I honestly have never seen a dog bond with a young child like that in my life. He was very special. My heart breaks for her. I can always feel the sadness coming from her and I comfort her as much as I can. We talk about him and it’s always about the fun things they did together. When she starts to get sad, I just hold her and tell her we will never forget him, that we’ll always love him and it’s ok to miss him and feel the things that come with it. That missing someone is just a part of loving them. I told her that sometimes we feel like we can’t stop the sadness, so we try to go over it, or under it, but the only way out of it is to get through it and we can do that together. My heart is heavy, so I thought writing this here may help me and maybe someone else in the process. Thank you to anyone who reads this <3"

Mental Breakdown and it’s my birthday,79,ml87ob,9,"So, it’s my 18th birthday rn and it’s currently 3:59 am. I’m staying in a hotel with my family. I had a traumatic experience a few months back, and it happened  when i was sleeping over at a friends house. I have to share a bed with my brother in our hotel room and by no means am i in danger, but my brain keeps telling me the opposite. I can’t sleep at all and i’m current sitting out on the balcony, wearing a bath robe over my clothes to stay warm. I’m just waiting for the sun to come up, but i really need help. any words of wisdom are much appreciated."
I think I’m finally recovered! I never thought this day would come.,46,ml9ggg,2,"First of all, I would like to say a HUGE thank you to everybody on this sub. You all have been so supportive. We’re some strong people. 

I wanted to write this to share my story and hopefully give some people recovery hope. 

How did I do it? I wish I had a better answer, but time and realization. My PTSD lasted about a year and a half, which is lucky compared to some of the people I’ve seen battling it for 5+. By realization, most of what was holding me back from recovery was guilt and regret. I put myself in my abuser’s shoes and asked myself various questions in that position. I actually became angry at my abuser for taking my childhood away, which was a big step. 

I still get the occasional flashback, but they’re not the panic-inducing ones I used to know. More like bad thoughts. 

My advice to everyone here (based off my experience!) is to...
-be patient, give it time! 
-put yourself in your abuser(s) shoes if you feel guilty
-realize you are worthy of love, abusers have tactics to make you feel otherwise! 

And something that personally helped me...
-The second most recent episode of Grey’s Anatomy. There is some deep PTSD and life advice in it.

Rant-this is why it’s not as easy as just asking for help.,5,mln7ea,5,"Last year was a rough one for me at work. Not to get overly specific, but I ended up in a few situations that have ended with me having severely impaired ability to do my job. Some days are good, some most days are really bad. It’s to the point where it’s effecting my life, my wife, and my work. My substance use has exploded, and is officially a crutch. Without sugarcoating it, I’m pretty fucked up. So I make the decision to go see my family doctor and have a conversation with him. He’s been great in helping me deal with my ADHD, and is usually right on the ball. My fear was that it would be downplayed, and I’d get the “you just aren’t cut out for it” speech or the “if you don’t like it find another job.” Needless to say, all my worst worries came through, and my doctor told me about all the mental health issues in his field. I believe this was a way to try and build rapport, but in the end it was extremely belittling. We talked about the need to build resiliency, which I’m totally on board with, but he refused to accept that I feel no improvement from online counselling, and NEED to talk to people in person. Now I’m just laying in bed, trying to figure what my next step is. I feel broken beyond words, and hopeless that there will be any improvement."

Do you disclose to employers?,17,mlc4ui,9,"I have an interview tomorrow and I’m wondering if it would benefit me to disclose to them that I’m diagnosed with PTSD and Panic Disorder.

April is a hard month.,2,mlql97,0,"I met my abuser properly on Saturday, 14th April, 2018 at my friend’s birthday party in my friend’s house. I first went over to my abuser’s house for the first time on Wednesday, 18th April, 2018 where he gave me my first kiss. I lost my virginity to my abuser on Monday, 23rd April, 2018. I attended a party on Saturday, 28th April, 2018 and loads of my abusers friends approached me and asked how he was in bed. My abuser then had a go at me, accusing me of telling everyone about us and threatening to leave.

Why didn’t I read that sign and just leave then.

Last night I had a vivid dream of the memory of Saturday, 14th April, 2018 - walking through the house of the party. I didn’t know I could dream of memories. This is the first time this has happened. I’m scared to go to sleep tonight.

Just now, I got a notification from Instagram saying “follow .... and other people you may know” and it was him. My abuser. I thought I had him blocked everywhere but clearly not. It’s taken my account this long to recommend him. Why now? Why after that dream? Why in APRIL of all months? Why? Why why why.

Do you ever feel like things happen for a reason and that coincidences are often too fucking coincidental to JUST BE coincidences?! Do you believe in fate? Do you believe in those horribly painful gut feelings that something isn’t right? I do. I really really do. Because usually my gut feeling is right and usually it isn’t just a coincidence.

I’m terrified to sleep incase I dream of a worse or more painful memory. I’m now scared that fate’s gonna make me run into him again soon. He only lives ten minutes up the hill from me. It makes me scared to leave the house. And when things like this happens, it makes it worse.

I’d like to disclose that I AM on the waiting list for a domestic abuse counselling thing. It’s not okay that this still kills me so much when he left over two years ago."
Meth and PTSD,4,mllg9y,8,"So my history is simple yet it horrible, I’m addicted to meth, I have suffered from horrible psychosis and that psychosis traumatized me in horrible ways, last week I hallucinated one of the most horrible things in my life thanks to meth, I don’t wanna talk about it but I got even more traumatized, I’m on the point we’re I feel dull, I feel horrible, I feel depressed, anxious, paranoid without meth, I fear being alone, I just don’t live I survive, it’s been a very hard time living since this happened. The worst is that the desire for meth hasn’t disappeared but I’m sober since then. Any advice, I’ve suffered from trauma in the past but this trauma in specific has been the most intense of this kind, has took all of my desire to live and exist. I live in constant fear."

How do you handle elevated heart rate?,2,mlmvyz,1,"I have these mini attacks a few times a week. I'll just be laying around and then suddenly my brain drifts and im back there or ill be watching something and get triggered but it isn’t enough to send me on a spiral. Still i can feel my heart rate spike and my body go ""oh shit it's go time."" I am fortunate enough to have one of those phones where i can check my heart rate and stress so i get to understand what's happening and it isn’t pretty. During attacks it can be 100 to 110 bpm resting heart rate and at one point i had a particularly bad attack that left me ~140 for roughly 7 hours despite doing literally nothing.  

I know this is bad for me so I'm seeking help. How do you manage elevated heart rate during attacks?"
Just venting i guess.,8,mldgw4,2,"I'm male and 23. And now i realize more clearly that me and my 3 sisters where sexually abused by our father in our early childhood. I know because my sisters and my mother are now speaking more openly to me about those things. 

As my mother told me lately, she had been raped by him also often times.
I myself can't remember anything that happend to me or my sisters. It all comes clearer now but i had heard of those things a few times when i was younger. Though i didn't really realised it. Don't know how else to formulate it.

I did know and realised quite early however, that my family was a bit messed up and that my mother couldn't take care of her children properly. She was very angry with them often times. Also hit them and blamed them for the difficult situations we often found ourselfs in. She sometimes even punished us for our need of care when we where ill.

Still, this whole story about how this all came to happen and why there was so little help for us for so long and why many family members didn't ever talked about this or even disclaimed many of the terrible conditions we were in. 

Some parts of me say: ""is this all true? What when it is not. How am i to behave. How am i to go about every day live. What must i do to get my live together. Can i even do it? 
How hard must i try. I failed so often. ...""

I left ""home"" when i was 17, i lived in different places but barely felt at home anywhere. I quit different schoolings, now i work as a cleaner for about 5 hours per week.since nearly 2 years I'm in a sincere intimate relationship for the first time in my life and we are about to move together.I also go to therapie since about 3 months one time per week, which i think helps me.

Part of me is dead TW: assault,1,mlp9oa,0,"I feel like the men who did this to me stole a part of me. They took a piece of me I could never get back

Loved ones hurt me not strangers. I shouldn’t be afraid of strangers hurting me because it was the ones who “loved me” that hurt me, not a stranger. There is no way someone who loved another could do anything like that to them. It should be a stranger who hurts someone like that. Friends don’t assault friends. Boyfriends shouldn’t choke their girlfriends unconscious.

I don't wanna feel like the every single person could end up being evil. I wish i can trust people again, and be dumb and fall in love easily. It was so much easier to just- love and trust. My naive view of the world was so much better than noticing and feeling every little detail. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want to be free. I want to feel safe. I want to trust and love again. I want to be happy. I wish I can let go of everything and erase all my trauma. I don't wanna live like this...."

My PTSD (If I can get advice I'd greatly appreciate it),2,mlbu54,1,"So some background my mom was mentally abusive, her ex-husband(stepdad) was 1 of 2 sexual abusers of mine, the neighbors daughter my ""friend"" who was another. Lately I've been relapsing so badly that im shaking, can't breathe but then i breathe in so much that it hurts to breathe in but i wont release the air, its gotten so bad that i can't talk coherently just choppy but understandable sentences, instead of usual 1 memory I've been getting every single memory and more that i forgot about. Lately I've been daydreaming so much, not only that but I'll be having moments where I'll forget who I am for like 5 maybe 10 seconds forget who i am what I'm doing but then I come back. Then there's times I'm so paranoid around people that I don't want to stay around them in school but I want to cry but can't so I panic. There's times that I have out of body experiences but my body continues to  do whatever I was doing like I'd be taking notes in class but then I'm out of my body moving in my memories and my body will continue taking notes fully and when I come back they're done. It scares me when that happens because I didn't learn anything but I copied and finished everything done, I've done it while walking as well while carrying a food tray and sat down at a table then snapped back and I looked at my boyfriend confused and asked how did I get hear this was in 8th grade I'm now in tenth and it's only gotten worse even though I've been better I was released from therapy. When my dad is left with my dad I get paranoid and sit there for ages to make sure she's safe and I know that's not healthy my still boyfriend from 8th grade I told him he ever hurts our kids I will leave him in a heartbeat and make sure he gets heck in jail because my mother stopped my abuse from her ex-husband but kept him in the house. I don't know what to do I've been so bad lately that its taking a toll on my relationship and though my boyfriend is so strong and has been helping me so much when i relapse(not usually this bad) I push him away almost ending the relationship for him to have a ""happier life and normal life"" though he said he's happiest with me and he said his life isn't normal that he's lives a great life and loves helping me he loves caring for me and helping knowing my family is not the best... but lately because my moms ex-husband isn't behind bars he still sees my siblings (which are his blood related kids, and the reason my abuse happened so long was because i believe if it happened to me it wouldn't happen to them that I was protecting them) Hes not behind bars he still sees them and lately my issues have been happening so bad that I'm somehow messing with my memories thinking I made them up, my mom used to yell at me that i was on her Sh\*t list and my aunt was on there knowing she hated my aunt and my mom said I was on there but it didn't hit me that she hated be till I saw the list a  physical list right under my aunts name so i knew my mom hated me, and well that aunt said in the beginning when i told my dad what happened she said what if he was brainwashing me which i know isn't true but her saying that made me start thinking i was making this all up that maybe i had a bad dream like the many I've had, I'm starting to doubt myself and I told my boyfriend and he said ""no, i know this happened to you with the great detail and breakdowns you've had the fear you show whenever your siblings are alone with your parents, as awful as it is I know it happened and honey I'm hear for you to vent, cry, and be listened and believed in I'm here for you.""  Many people at school and home life see me as happy but never see this side of me besides my partner, they don't see my paranoia, doubt, the struggle of remembering to eat because I developed eating disorders that I'm healing from, shaking, breathing, the forgetting who I am, and out of body, they never see all the memories that I live, yet they say I'm living the highlight of life which they aren't wrong I'm the happiest my entire life I've finally been happy living life not wanting to disappear or die, but everyone tries to make it seem like I've lived nothing. I overreact so much to little things but I can't control it. I don't know what to do I'm scared for people to see me at school when I can't control it. My family called me a chemical F\*ck up because I'm pansexual and nonbinary, they see that because I chemically have a difference that make me attracted to shes/hes/theys and thems to them all that I'm a screw up because I'm attracted to those and that they compare me to those who want equality out on protest for that when yes I want equality but I'm doing everything for them to not get angry for those out there when I have done anything. Just what can I do to calm down better to heal better to feel better and not doubt my memories, who I am, and everything in life. I'd like advice."
why is my PTSD so bad from nonviolent sexual assault?,7,ml568a,12,i was groomed for ten years by my step dad and assaulted multiple times nonviolently as a preteen and teen. i feel like im being so dramatic by having such a severe mental challenge. i mean it didnt happen more than a few times. it was nonviolent. i was older. how come i am so ruined? with such serious mental patterns will i ever *truly* get better? (please dont tell me to go to therapy. i am in therapy and have been doing CPT for a while.)
Anyone else feel triggered by Easter?,19,mkz76x,7,It always seems to bring up a lot of my charged feelings. Even more so now that I no longer consider myself ~Christian~. Anyone else?
"If I have trauma, is it still valid if I don’t have PTSD?",2,ml9ud4,5,"I am 17, and I think I have been through a lot of trauma for my age (my mother tried to kill me so I was adopted by my grandparents, they died, I was manipulated and abandoned by my aunt, who threw me into an even more abusive home until I moved out at 16)

I have depression and anxiety, which I was diagnosed with when I was around 12, but this was before I went through most of my trauma and I have never been reassessed for any other mental health issues. What I find odd is that I don’t have any strong symptoms of PTSD, the only thing I can think of that could lead into it is I have really bad abandonment issues (I have nightmares of people I care about dying and I am paranoid that everyone I love will either die or leave me) But that doesn’t line up with symptoms of PTSD. I’ve only ever had a strong “trigger” once when I was around 13, I saw a scene of a hospital or something and I started crying because it reminded me of losing my grandmother, but this was before I was fully orphaned or went through any emotional or physical abuse so I don’t think it counts."
"I think on some level I expected my PTSD to just...... go away, once I was in a relatively safe and stable situation",15,mkyjtk,6,"Like, I've been biding my time all these years, believing deep down that a magical ""someday"" would come...... fantasizing about ""someday"" when I had freedom, when I was safe, when I was stable and surrounded by loved ones and had prospects and goals and a Life. And that when that someday came I would finally be free of my PTSD, too, it would simply end. Because what was there to be afraid of any longer?

That someday is here. And my trauma hangs over me like a spectre, just as much as ever. Hahaha...... it feels like, now what? I fought and worked and clawed my way to this place, and now I can finally Live, the future is finally in front of me....... and I'm absolutely haunted. So now what?

In the past, the thought of carrying this horror and pain Forever, the knowledge thatPTSD was something that stayed with you forever, gave me so much despair that I wanted to die. But somewhere along the way, I found a little hope, in that fantasy that someday once I was free to move towards the future and build a life, that I would also be healed of that pain and trauma. What now? I'm really going to be like this for the rest of my life.....? ....."
My first PTSD attack. What should I do? Please don’t read if you think you might get triggered.,18,mkuwl5,2,"I’ve only really done a little bit of research but I need some advice on where to go or what to do. Or even just to know if someone else has gone through something similar and has some pointers. 

My attack last week
I was stilling with my wife scrolling through Netflix and she wanted to watch an animated short story. We read the synopsis and can tell it will be a sad film. I was slightly joking and said I’ll go grab the tissues cause my wife easy cry’s over things. I on the other hand haven’t really cried in just about 10 years at the most I’ve gotten a little watery in the eye but have not shed a tear in 10 years. It’s kinda strange but I just felt like what I’ve gone through in the past wasn’t nearly as bad as what I’m experiencing now and so I never really got sad enough to cry. So sometimes my wife would try and watch sad movies to see if I would shed a tear. Well about half way through I let myself get wrapped up in the feelings too much and couldn’t stop thinking about what happed 10years ago it just flooded my mind and I couldn’t stop crying my body broke out sweating like crazy. All of the pain I thought I wouldn’t have ever have to feel again just came back like I was there again 10 years ago. 

What happed 10 years ago and what happened 20ish years ago. 
So 10 years ago coming up on the exact date my stepdad killed himself in our back yard with a shotgun. The rest of the family wasn’t home at the time and when we got back we were wondering where he was. I thought he had gone for a walk to clear his mind cause he was dealing with a lot of issues that were happening all at once. I walked out back and saw a blanket behind our woodshed. I just saw the edge of it but I assumed maybe he was working on something back there and I just let him be cause if he was back there he probably wanted to be alone. I went back in the house told my mom that he was out back and probably just wanting to be alone. An hour went by and I just had the worst feeling of dread that something was wrong but I kept brushing it off. My dread was confirmed when my mom ended up walking out back and finding him there. I remember her screaming and everyone rushing outside. She covered him up with the blanked he had laid out she didn’t want us to see and I’m glad I didn’t. 

20 years ago
This pails in comparison to the pain I felt when my stepdad died. But when I was about 6 or 7 my parents got divorced. It was for the better because most of my  memories from when they were together were just of them fighting and yelling. My dad abused my mom from time to time and to this day I have never seen him sober. He kind of a functioning alcoholic so you really can’t tell when he’s drunk. The only way of knowing is counting the number of beer bottles he’s had that day. I used to think that my parents divorce never really effected me but looking back I know it did. I grew up without a role model I was alway angry and people often didn’t listen or pay attention to me. So when my stepdad came along it really changed things. He was a better father to me than my real father and I really looked up to him. That’s why it hurt so badly to lose him and i lost the one person I looked up to. Years later I found myself secretly striving for the approval of others and I think it became I didn’t have anyone to look up to and I wanted someone to be proud of me. 

My life today 
I didn’t think anything in my past had too much of a negative affect on who I am today. But I’ve recently been having some small amounts of anxiety and have also developed a hiatal hernia. Doctor told me it was rare for someone my age to get one. Most people get them from obesity or having extreme anxiety. I don’t feel like I have extreme anxiety but I did have one panic attack last year. And now I had this PTSD attack I really don’t know if all of this is related or not thought. 

TLDR 
This started out as me just wanting to get some advice on what to do but I ended up telling my story and kind of venting. I’m truly sorry if this trigger anyone I kinda was getting a little watery eyed writing this."

"dae overshare? if so, why do you think you do that?",38,mlmemh,33,"i’m not sure if ptsd correlates to oversharing or not. its a serious problem of mine. i want to stop oversharing but i can’t. i literally overshare to other people the way i talk to my therapist. that’s not good. that’s too much. i don’t know why though? what makes me overshare? i feel like that’s just me, but i didn’t always overshare, yk?"
Mental Breakdown and it’s my birthday,79,ml87ob,9,"So, it’s my 18th birthday rn and it’s currently 3:59 am. I’m staying in a hotel with my family. I had a traumatic experience a few months back, and it happened  when i was sleeping over at a friends house. I have to share a bed with my brother in our hotel room and by no means am i in danger, but my brain keeps telling me the opposite. I can’t sleep at all and i’m current sitting out on the balcony, wearing a bath robe over my clothes to stay warm. I’m just waiting for the sun to come up, but i really need help. any words of wisdom are much appreciated."
I think I’m finally recovered! I never thought this day would come.,46,ml9ggg,2,"First of all, I would like to say a HUGE thank you to everybody on this sub. You all have been so supportive. We’re some strong people. 

I wanted to write this to share my story and hopefully give some people recovery hope. 

How did I do it? I wish I had a better answer, but time and realization. My PTSD lasted about a year and a half, which is lucky compared to some of the people I’ve seen battling it for 5+. By realization, most of what was holding me back from recovery was guilt and regret. I put myself in my abuser’s shoes and asked myself various questions in that position. I actually became angry at my abuser for taking my childhood away, which was a big step. 

I still get the occasional flashback, but they’re not the panic-inducing ones I used to know. More like bad thoughts. 

My advice to everyone here (based off my experience!) is to...
-be patient, give it time! 
-put yourself in your abuser(s) shoes if you feel guilty
-realize you are worthy of love, abusers have tactics to make you feel otherwise! 

And something that personally helped me...
-The second most recent episode of Grey’s Anatomy. There is some deep PTSD and life advice in it. 

Lastly, stay strong! The storm will eventually end."
Rant-this is why it’s not as easy as just asking for help.,5,mln7ea,5,"Last year was a rough one for me at work. Not to get overly specific, but I ended up in a few situations that have ended with me having severely impaired ability to do my job. Some days are good, some most days are really bad. It’s to the point where it’s effecting my life, my wife, and my work. My substance use has exploded, and is officially a crutch. Without sugarcoating it, I’m pretty fucked up. So I make the decision to go see my family doctor and have a conversation with him. He’s been great in helping me deal with my ADHD, and is usually right on the ball. My fear was that it would be downplayed, and I’d get the “you just aren’t cut out for it” speech or the “if you don’t like it find another job.” Needless to say, all my worst worries came through, and my doctor told me about all the mental health issues in his field. I believe this was a way to try and build rapport, but in the end it was extremely belittling. We talked about the need to build resiliency, which I’m totally on board with, but he refused to accept that I feel no improvement from online counselling, and NEED to talk to people in person. Now I’m just laying in bed, trying to figure what my next step is. I feel broken beyond words, and hopeless that there will be any improvement."
Pressure from others just make me want to break down,13,mlf41h,0,"I try really hard, I'm an over achiever and I still get told I'm not doing enough. I have my limits and I already pass them which isn't healthy in itself and I know I should have my license and  ID by now but I'm tired. I work most days now. 

I need compassion, not hurt."
Does PTSD look different in men and women?,12,mlg5uc,5,"I read somewhere that women experience emotions of shame and guilt more often than men. Men have stronger feelings of anger.
Women are more likely to have agoraphobia than men. 
Is it connected to the nature of trauma the person experienced?"
Do you disclose to employers?,18,mlc4ui,9,"I have an interview tomorrow and I’m wondering if it would benefit me to disclose to them that I’m diagnosed with PTSD and Panic Disorder.

I just have a lot of anxiety when it come to working because I will have panic attacks in public so I’m not sure whether or not to let an employer know."
April is a hard month.,2,mlql97,0,"I met my abuser properly on Saturday, 14th April, 2018 at my friend’s birthday party in my friend’s house. I first went over to my abuser’s house for the first time on Wednesday, 18th April, 2018 where he gave me my first kiss. I lost my virginity to my abuser on Monday, 23rd April, 2018. I attended a party on Saturday, 28th April, 2018 and loads of my abusers friends approached me and asked how he was in bed. My abuser then had a go at me, accusing me of telling everyone about us and threatening to leave.

Why didn’t I read that sign and just leave then.

Last night I had a vivid dream of the memory of Saturday, 14th April, 2018 - walking through the house of the party. I didn’t know I could dream of memories. This is the first time this has happened. I’m scared to go to sleep tonight.

Just now, I got a notification from Instagram saying “follow .... and other people you may know” and it was him. My abuser. I thought I had him blocked everywhere but clearly not. It’s taken my account this long to recommend him. Why now? Why after that dream? Why in APRIL of all months? Why? Why why why.

Do you ever feel like things happen for a reason and that coincidences are often too fucking coincidental to JUST BE coincidences?! Do you believe in fate? Do you believe in those horribly painful gut feelings that something isn’t right? I do. I really really do. Because usually my gut feeling is right and usually it isn’t just a coincidence.

I’m terrified to sleep incase I dream of a worse or more painful memory. I’m now scared that fate’s gonna make me run into him again soon. He only lives ten minutes up the hill from me. It makes me scared to leave the house. And when things like this happens, it makes it worse.

I’d like to disclose that I AM on the waiting list for a domestic abuse counselling thing. It’s not okay that this still kills me so much when he left over two years ago."
Meth and PTSD,5,mllg9y,8,"So my history is simple yet it horrible, I’m addicted to meth, I have suffered from horrible psychosis and that psychosis traumatized me in horrible ways, last week I hallucinated one of the most horrible things in my life thanks to meth, I don’t wanna talk about it but I got even more traumatized, I’m on the point we’re I feel dull, I feel horrible, I feel depressed, anxious, paranoid without meth, I fear being alone, I just don’t live I survive, it’s been a very hard time living since this happened. The worst is that the desire for meth hasn’t disappeared but I’m sober since then. Any advice, I’ve suffered from trauma in the past but this trauma in specific has been the most intense of this kind, has took all of my desire to live and exist. I live in constant fear."
Sometimes I feel like I feel like a fake- like I need to prove my PTSD.,71,ml3g35,7,"Then I remember every night of my life that I can’t sleep because each noise has me under the impression someone has come to kill, kidnap, hurt or rape me. 

And I live on a busy road.
This shit isn’t for the weak 🙃"
How do you handle elevated heart rate?,2,mlmvyz,1,"I have these mini attacks a few times a week. I'll just be laying around and then suddenly my brain drifts and im back there or ill be watching something and get triggered but it isn’t enough to send me on a spiral. Still i can feel my heart rate spike and my body go ""oh shit it's go time."" I am fortunate enough to have one of those phones where i can check my heart rate and stress so i get to understand what's happening and it isn’t pretty. During attacks it can be 100 to 110 bpm resting heart rate and at one point i had a particularly bad attack that left me ~140 for roughly 7 hours despite doing literally nothing.  

I know this is bad for me so I'm seeking help. How do you manage elevated heart rate during attacks?"
Just venting i guess.,7,mldgw4,2,"I'm male and 23. And now i realize more clearly that me and my 3 sisters where sexually abused by our father in our early childhood. I know because my sisters and my mother are now speaking more openly to me about those things. 

As my mother told me lately, she had been raped by him also often times.
I myself can't remember anything that happend to me or my sisters. It all comes clearer now but i had heard of those things a few times when i was younger. Though i didn't really realised it. Don't know how else to formulate it.

I did know and realised quite early however, that my family was a bit messed up and that my mother couldn't take care of her children properly. She was very angry with them often times. Also hit them and blamed them for the difficult situations we often found ourselfs in. She sometimes even punished us for our need of care when we where ill.

Still, this whole story about how this all came to happen and why there was so little help for us for so long and why many family members didn't ever talked about this or even disclaimed many of the terrible conditions we were in. 

Some parts of me say: ""is this all true? What when it is not. How am i to behave. How am i to go about every day live. What must i do to get my live together. Can i even do it? 
How hard must i try. I failed so often. ...""

I left ""home"" when i was 17, i lived in different places but barely felt at home anywhere. I quit different schoolings, now i work as a cleaner for about 5 hours per week.since nearly 2 years I'm in a sincere intimate relationship for the first time in my life and we are about to move together.I also go to therapie since about 3 months one time per week, which i think helps me. 

I just wanted to share a bit of my Story. It's also my first post. I don't really know what to expect of it.

Thanks for reading. I hope you are doing well."
Part of me is dead TW: assault,1,mlp9oa,0,"I feel like the men who did this to me stole a part of me. They took a piece of me I could never get back

Loved ones hurt me not strangers. I shouldn’t be afraid of strangers hurting me because it was the ones who “loved me” that hurt me, not a stranger. There is no way someone who loved another could do anything like that to them. It should be a stranger who hurts someone like that. Friends don’t assault friends. Boyfriends shouldn’t choke their girlfriends unconscious. 

I am scared. I am tired. I miss therapy. (Mine is on maternity leave currently.) I am down."
Is it possible to get PTSD over things that don't personally affect you?,4,mlcwmc,0,"Before anyone says anything, I have A LOT of personal traumas too, so please don't attack me for this ""little; how tf is this affecting you lol"" thing.

I feel extra sensitive towards literally everything around me. I am talking about all the live footage of m\*rder and SA. I feel so traumatised by the YouTubers i grew up with; by the general community- the police etc. I feel so helpless; small; weak; insignificant. I feel like I am not doing anything even if I advocate, educate, donate... I feel so... dumb yknow... Like, if I couldn't help myself, at least, I wanna help others and I cant even do that? I am so scared of humans that I been so avoidant of everyone and I feel extremely alone. I just feel and see hatred and pain everywhere I go. Going by my day, knowing that someone got SA'd, someone got m\*rdered. That my best friend will never have justice. I will never have justice. Even if I am studying my dream major thinking ""oh i can at least help ONE person, at least ill make the tiniest change"", IT'S STILL Not enough. I feel so much guilt when I know none of this is my fault. I feel so guilty for what I been through, even though I know i deserve better. I don't wanna feel like the every single person could end up being evil. I wish i can trust people again, and be dumb and fall in love easily. It was so much easier to just- love and trust. My naive view of the world was so much better than noticing and feeling every little detail. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I just want to be free. I want to feel safe. I want to trust and love again. I want to be happy. I wish I can let go of everything and erase all my trauma. I don't wanna live like this...."
"My roommate got upset and started throwing what they had on them (keys, wallet, etc) last night and I dont see a reason to wake up today",8,mlb2k0,3,"I cant see her.

I cant. I mean, I reeeeeeally dont want to.

In my dreams, there are people who always want to hang out with me and there’s always something to do.

Jenn’s just gonna be sitting in the chair I like writing my cover letters in lookin like the dog that got into the garbage.

My dad used to throw things. Usually at my head.

Ever since I got in this one medication, everyone in my dreams have been So nice. It might feel all weird and I’m hardly ever doing what I want to be but I’ve never watched someone get so upset that they start throwing things in there.

My PTSD (If I can get advice I'd greatly appreciate it),2,mlbu54,1,"So some background my mom was mentally abusive, her ex-husband(stepdad) was 1 of 2 sexual abusers of mine, the neighbors daughter my ""friend"" who was another. Lately I've been relapsing so badly that im shaking, can't breathe but then i breathe in so much that it hurts to breathe in but i wont release the air, its gotten so bad that i can't talk coherently just choppy but understandable sentences, instead of usual 1 memory I've been getting every single memory and more that i forgot about. Lately I've been daydreaming so much, not only that but I'll be having moments where I'll forget who I am for like 5 maybe 10 seconds forget who i am what I'm doing but then I come back. Then there's times I'm so paranoid around people that I don't want to stay around them in school but I want to cry but can't so I panic. There's times that I have out of body experiences but my body continues to  do whatever I was doing like I'd be taking notes in class but then I'm out of my body moving in my memories and my body will continue taking notes fully and when I come back they're done. It scares me when that happens because I didn't learn anything but I copied and finished everything done, I've done it while walking as well while carrying a food tray and sat down at a table then snapped back and I looked at my boyfriend confused and asked how did I get hear this was in 8th grade I'm now in tenth and it's only gotten worse even though I've been better I was released from therapy.

I don't know what to do I've been so bad lately that its taking a toll on my relationship and though my boyfriend is so strong and has been helping me so much when i relapse(not usually this bad) I push him away almost ending the relationship for him to have a ""happier life and normal life"" though he said he's happiest with me and he said his life isn't normal that he's lives a great life and loves helping me he loves caring for me and helping knowing my family is not the best... but lately because my moms ex-husband isn't behind bars he still sees my siblings (which are his blood related kids, and the reason my abuse happened so long was because i believe if it happened to me it wouldn't happen to them that I was protecting them) Hes not behind bars he still sees them and lately my issues have been happening so bad that I'm somehow messing with my memories thinking I made them up, my mom used to yell at me that i was on her Sh\*t list and my aunt was on there knowing she hated my aunt and my mom said I was on there but it didn't hit me that she hated be till I saw the list a  physical list right under my aunts name so i knew my mom hated me, and well that aunt said in the beginning when i told my dad what happened she said what if he was brainwashing me which i know isn't true but her saying that made me start thinking i was making this all up that maybe i had a bad dream like the many I've had, I'm starting to doubt myself and I told my boyfriend and he said ""no, i know this happened to you with the great detail and breakdowns you've had the fear you show whenever your siblings are alone with your parents, as awful as it is I know it happened and honey I'm hear for you to vent, cry, and be listened and believed in I'm here for you.""  Many people at school and home life see me as happy but never see this side of me besides my partner, they don't see my paranoia, doubt, the struggle of remembering to eat because I developed eating disorders that I'm healing from, shaking, breathing, the forgetting who I am, and out of body, they never see all the memories that I live, yet they say I'm living the highlight of life which they aren't wrong I'm the happiest my entire life I've finally been happy living life not wanting to disappear or die, but everyone tries to make it seem like I've lived nothing. I overreact so much to little things but I can't control it. I don't know what to do I'm scared for people to see me at school when I can't control it. My family called me a chemical F\*ck up because I'm pansexual and nonbinary, they see that because I chemically have a difference that make me attracted to shes/hes/theys and thems to them all that I'm a screw up because I'm attracted to those and that they compare me to those who want equality out on protest for that when yes I want equality but I'm doing everything for them to not get angry for those out there when I have done anything. Just what can I do to calm down better to heal better to feel better and not doubt my memories, who I am, and everything in life. I'd like advice."
why is my PTSD so bad from nonviolent sexual assault?,7,ml568a,12,i was groomed for ten years by my step dad and assaulted multiple times nonviolently as a preteen and teen. i feel like im being so dramatic by having such a severe mental challenge. i mean it didnt happen more than a few times. it was nonviolent. i was older. how come i am so ruined? with such serious mental patterns will i ever *truly* get better? (please dont tell me to go to therapy. i am in therapy and have been doing CPT for a while.)

"If I have trauma, is it still valid if I don’t have PTSD?",2,ml9ud4,5,"I am 17, and I think I have been through a lot of trauma for my age (my mother tried to kill me so I was adopted by my grandparents, they died, I was manipulated and abandoned by my aunt, who threw me into an even more abusive home until I moved out at 16)

I have depression and anxiety, which I was diagnosed with when I was around 12, but this was before I went through most of my trauma and I have never been reassessed for any other mental health issues. What I find odd is that I don’t have any strong symptoms of PTSD, the only thing I can think of that could lead into it is I have really bad abandonment issues (I have nightmares of people I care about dying and I am paranoid that everyone I love will either die or leave me) But that doesn’t line up with symptoms of PTSD. I’ve only ever had a strong “trigger” once when I was around 13, I saw a scene of a hospital or something and I started crying because it reminded me of losing my grandmother, but this was before I was fully orphaned or went through any emotional or physical abuse so I don’t think it counts."
"I think on some level I expected my PTSD to just...... go away, once I was in a relatively safe and stable situation",14,mkyjtk,6,"Like, I've been biding my time all these years, believing deep down that a magical ""someday"" would come...... fantasizing about ""someday"" when I had freedom, when I was safe, when I was stable and surrounded by loved ones and had prospects and goals and a Life. And that when that someday came I would finally be free of my PTSD, too, it would simply end. Because what was there to be afraid of any longer?

That someday is here. And my trauma hangs over me like a spectre, just as much as ever. Hahaha...... it feels like, now what? I fought and worked and clawed my way to this place, and now I can finally Live, the future is finally in front of me....... and I'm absolutely haunted. So now what?

In the past, the thought of carrying this horror and pain Forever, the knowledge thatPTSD was something that stayed with you forever, gave me so much despair that I wanted to die. But somewhere along the way, I found a little hope, in that fantasy that someday once I was free to move towards the future and build a life, that I would also be healed of that pain and trauma. What now? I'm really going to be like this for the rest of my life.....? ....."
My first PTSD attack. What should I do? Please don’t read if you think you might get triggered.,16,mkuwl5,2,"I’ve only really done a little bit of research but I need some advice on where to go or what to do. Or even just to know if someone else has gone through something similar and has some pointers. 

My attack last week
I was stilling with my wife scrolling through Netflix and she wanted to watch an animated short story. We read the synopsis and can tell it will be a sad film. I was slightly joking and said I’ll go grab the tissues cause my wife easy cry’s over things. I on the other hand haven’t really cried in just about 10 years at the most I’ve gotten a little watery in the eye but have not shed a tear in 10 years. It’s kinda strange but I just felt like what I’ve gone through in the past wasn’t nearly as bad as what I’m experiencing now and so I never really got sad enough to cry. So sometimes my wife would try and watch sad movies to see if I would shed a tear. Well about half way through I let myself get wrapped up in the feelings too much and couldn’t stop thinking about what happed 10years ago it just flooded my mind and I couldn’t stop crying my body broke out sweating like crazy. All of the pain I thought I wouldn’t have ever have to feel again just came back like I was there again 10 years ago. 

What happed 10 years ago and what happened 20ish years ago. 
So 10 years ago coming up on the exact date my stepdad killed himself in our back yard with a shotgun. The rest of the family wasn’t home at the time and when we got back we were wondering where he was. I thought he had gone for a walk to clear his mind cause he was dealing with a lot of issues that were happening all at once. I walked out back and saw a blanket behind our woodshed. I just saw the edge of it but I assumed maybe he was working on something back there and I just let him be cause if he was back there he probably wanted to be alone. I went back in the house told my mom that he was out back and probably just wanting to be alone. An hour went by and I just had the worst feeling of dread that something was wrong but I kept brushing it off. My dread was confirmed when my mom ended up walking out back and finding him there. I remember her screaming and everyone rushing outside. She covered him up with the blanked he had laid out she didn’t want us to see and I’m glad I didn’t. 

20 years ago
This pails in comparison to the pain I felt when my stepdad died. But when I was about 6 or 7 my parents got divorced. It was for the better because most of my  memories from when they were together were just of them fighting and yelling. My dad abused my mom from time to time and to this day I have never seen him sober. He kind of a functioning alcoholic so you really can’t tell when he’s drunk. The only way of knowing is counting the number of beer bottles he’s had that day. I used to think that my parents divorce never really effected me but looking back I know it did. I grew up without a role model I was alway angry and people often didn’t listen or pay attention to me. So when my stepdad came along it really changed things. He was a better father to me than my real father and I really looked up to him. That’s why it hurt so badly to lose him and i lost the one person I looked up to. Years later I found myself secretly striving for the approval of others and I think it became I didn’t have anyone to look up to and I wanted someone to be proud of me. 

My life today 
I didn’t think anything in my past had too much of a negative affect on who I am today. But I’ve recently been having some small amounts of anxiety and have also developed a hiatal hernia. Doctor told me it was rare for someone my age to get one. Most people get them from obesity or having extreme anxiety. I don’t feel like I have extreme anxiety but I did have one panic attack last year. And now I had this PTSD attack I really don’t know if all of this is related or not thought. 

TLDR 
This started out as me just wanting to get some advice on what to do but I ended up telling my story and kind of venting. I’m truly sorry if this trigger anyone I kinda was getting a little watery eyed writing this."

My future mother in law triggered my ptsx and Im afraid it will happen again.,4,ml1zyf,1,"I've always thought that my boyfriend mother has been very similar to the behavior of my abusive father. But, I always brushed it off because I figured she would never behave to the full extent in front of me. I've heard stories from my boy friend about how she has controlled him through the years and suffocated him with her control to the point of severe depression. She took him to therapy and spoke for him the whole time. She had the therapist make him a schedule that she approved and forced him to follow. He was only allowed to do school and therapist/mother approved activities. 

She in more recent years yells at him to do chores the minute she says it even if he's in the bathroom it doesn't matter. 

I've never liked her but always respected her to keep peace. I always assumed if I kept up that behavior it would be fine, but today I realized I was wrong.

My Bf and I came home from rock climbing and where starving so we where excited and thankful that his mother had made rice. The only problem is it had cilantro in it and I don't like cilantro. However I didn't want to say anything because I wanted to be a good guest. My bf knowing I don't like cilantro started suggesting alternative meals. Once his mother heard this she started yelling about how ""We should be grateful for her for providing for us"" and just eat the rice.  Once the shouting started I was immediately teleported back to being a child where my abusive father was yelling at me the exact same phrase as he tried to force feed me food, after I told him I was full, he'dthen raise his hand and hit me.  I felt like I would collapse, so I ran to my bfs room and laid in bed frozen. Once I was sure I could suppress my panic attack I went back to the kitchen and told my bf I was leaving. My bf walked me to my car and the minute I left his house I broke down. I almost collapsed to the floor and was in tears. He comforted me until I felt safe to drive and I explained every thing to him.

I just feel so ashamed for letting this happen to me. I felt helpless and scared after teaching myself how to be brave for so long. I'm terrified this will happen again but rn his parents house is the only place we can really spend time together. My house is overcrowded and I share  a room. His house is much bigger and easier to be alone in. I just feel lost and scared that this will be a regular occurrence."
Does anyone else self triggers themselves?,3,ml31je,1,"I know it’s not healthy and that it only makes me feel worse but usually at night, I’ll actively seek movies/episodes of shows/poems even that i know will trigger me and make me feel like shit.. 
I’m not sure if it’s just a way of self harm, me trying to actually feel something after feeling numb all day or me trying to prove myself that I’m okay enough and i can stomach it without getting triggered. 

Most times i just end up getting triggered, feeling sad and crying myself to sleep. It’s all my fault tho.. i wish i could forget about and stop harming myself but I can’t.."
Trauma(may or may not be CPTSD/PTSD) and ADHD Symptoms,1,ml84fm,1,"I've always thought I've had ADHD but recently I started going to a psychologist who suggests it might be trauma and I'm just really confused. 

Has anyone else thought they had ADHD but it was a trauma response? And also why and how did you realize it wasn't ADHD(aside from being diagnosed) 

I display very strong symptoms of ADHD and was wondering what made everyone else confirm it in their heads whether they had ADHD or not(again aside from the diagnosis) 

I also am not asking this as medical advice or a diagnosis, just as wanting to know others experience with this.

Also another thing to note is that while the trauma was trauma it wasnt anything that was extremely intense. Like at all."
"I would like to share my story, and hope it helps.",3,ml13yj,3,"Vet with a bit of success.

Hello everyone. This is my first post here. I’ve taken time to respond to other post, offer my support and suggestions.  

I feel like this is the moment to share my story.

I’m a 36 year old veteran of operation Iraqi freedom. Ever sense I left theater I was never the same. After a tour in Korea I took alcohol to a whole new level, and after I departed serving. I just got worse. 
Now there were some ups. I created a business, I had two beautiful daughters, and met my soul mate. 
All of that being said I still couldn’t be happy. 

In the past year and half to two years, I have completely hit the bottom. Had to pivot business just so it could survive. Had a long up hill battle and was drinking myself to sleep. Oh and that soul mate? I became emotionally abusive, she took care of me, loved me unconditionally. Picked me up off the floor every time I was that drunk, and stood by my through every single suicide attempt, and I destroyed her, and I destroyed her life. 

In this warpath I discovered a brewery of other veterans. This guys had found treatment. Unfortunately it’s treatment that the VA doesn’t cover. So after another complete slip I dove into my pocket and paid for treatment.

I was not happy about doing some “hippy shit” these guys and this Dr put me on clinical ketamine treatment, meditation, and journaling what I’m grateful for. The first treatment was a horrible experience with amazing results, and it didn’t take. Sober for a few days and back to being a miserable asshole. 
Reason why? If I told you something would you listen? And that’s exactly why. I had more important things then to follow up with the personal after care. 

So it goes 4 treatments later. I finally get it. I’ve been sober, I’m journaling, and I found the cause of my diagnosis. Fear, when we crossed that berm we were all scared to death. It’s only natural. But there were more deep seeded issues outside of Iraq that I discovered in treatment. 

It goes without saying, you’re a special kind of fucked up to sign up in a time of war, or a special kind of stupid? Either way, Iraq and alcohol were just the icing and sprinkles on that cake that was my life. My childhood of abuse and abandonment was the cake itself. 

So what do you do? How do you “fix” it? 

You forgive and you forget and you love. In my case I had to start with my mother on Easter Sunday, I wrote her a polite beautiful letter, no passive aggression, no questions as to why. I thanked her, I wouldn’t be where I am today had this not happened to me. I told her I loved her, wished her no I’ll will, and hoped she had peace. 

We can’t change the past, we can not change others, sometimes we can’t changes the situation that may or may not be from the cause of our own actions. How ever we can change ourselves, and I’ll say that’s been my uphill battle all along. 

I never forgave myself, I never loved myself. 

So what do you do next. Well I wrote 18 year old me a letter and said the same. 

Keep in mind when you dig down deep in that heart of yours and truly forgive someone, this means you forgive them. You’re done bringing up the story and situation. You find love in your heart and you drive forward. 

I feel as if a 10 ton ruck sack has been lifted from my back. After doing this. I’ve let go of all control, people around you might hurt you, that was never their intentions. So let people in your life, and love them.

Most of all love yourself

This isn’t the last chapter of my journey. Here shortly I’ll be given clinical psilocybin, MDMA, and DMT in one weekend. 

If you’ve read this far please feel free to ask me anything. I hope if you’re hurting you know you’re not alone, and I’m sure my actions might even work without drugs."
I know alcohol is bad and was killing me; but.........,36,mkj80t,24,"I have  been sober for 3 years, 3 months and 25 days. I started drinking daily in 2003 when I was 37 years old. I drank 4 - 8 beers a day (and would drink more on weekends my husband and I would go out to the bars.) When my liver started acting up and more importantly, when my behavior started to get really bad (I have pretty bad CPTSD/PTSD/anxiety, bipolar and seizures) and I was arrested (I was charged with resisting arrest - no other charge), I got help for my ""alcoholism"" and have been sober ever since.

I went to rehab and then to an IOP program for trauma at a behavioral health hospital for about 6 weeks. I have been seeing a therapist, psychiatrist and regularly go to see all the specialists I am supposed to.

Lately, I have been getting REALLY frustrated because the medications I am given for the seizures/bipolar have horrible side effects (like constant, crippling stomach pains, hair loss, weight gain, insomnia, etc) that can greatly affect my health. The new Ambilify I was given, can CAUSE diabetes.....and I already have high blood sugars WITHOUT the drug. The Depakoate can cause LIVER disease....well, I already have that in the form of a fatty liver (my ammonia levels were so high around the time I was arrested that I was acting psychotic). I have terrible GERD symptoms and have IBS (""slow transit C"") and these medications make the pain worse. With topiramate, I lost 40% of my hair! I had to stop the Ambilify because of the CRIPPLING nausea and stomach pain....and why the heck would a prescriber give me a drug that CAUSES restless legs when I already have that (and am restless in general)?

I started to think: why is everybody telling me that staying off alcohol is so much more healthy and ""better"" for me when the medications I have to take to medicate my ""conditions"" actually make me more ill than the alcohol did?  I self medicated with the alcohol and while I know my behavior was not great and I was slowly killing myself (and all of my interpersonal relationships) - I am STILL doing this, only not through alcohol anymore, but through the side effects of the medications (and my mental illness that doesn't seem to get much better with medications - only the seizures stop with medication).

Now, I do not long for the days of sloppy, not even for the ""good days"" of drinking.....but yet, alcohol seems to me still - to be the best medication I have ever used to stop the ""symptoms"". I even was more social (yeah, I know about lower inhibitions, impulse control). My alcoholic mother and I talked about it. SHe is 72 and I am 54 years old....so we are not so young and have had a few years to learn certain things.

I don't know what I am really trying to say here, but it has been bothering me; all of these side effects and how some of these strong anti-psychotic (and convulsant) medications can actually CAUSE medical problems like liver failure......just like alcohol......and yet I am told taking the medications is GOOD and drinking alcohol is BAD - yet I scream at my husband while on the oxcarbezine more than when I did when I had that once in a while black out rage......

and anyway, isn't Depakote supposed to HELP constant hiccupping and not CAUSE it? ;)

Thanks for letting me vent, I guess."
"All traumas from my entire life CW: S*xual abuse, Neglect, Verbal abuse",2,ml2d6r,0,"Repost from r/CPTSD

So I just for the sake of needing to get it all out because I tend to not be able to, I just wanna list all i've been through from childhood to adulthood. I'm a gay male with DID btw.

\*Ages 3-5: I can't remember a lot, from ages 3 and I assume even before I would neglected, not physically, but emotionally by my mother and my father had abandoned me as a child and would be completely neglected via not being hugged or comforted ever and being forced to ""Cry it out."" I would be sexually abused at either age 4 or 5 by two men whom I still can't remember who had forced themselves on me and hurt me and as a result I would be very frightened and unable to attend pre-school initially because I would cry and scream and hurt myself so much and be so clingy that I couldn't attend my first one.

\*Ages 6-8: At these ages my mother being sexually assaulting me, forcing me to shower with her in which she would expose herself to me and make me touch her body. At this age as well if not sexual abuse by her I would be forced into emotional incest, being forced to comfort her at the same time as she was assaulting me because she would cry about being a bad mother and I would be forced to play the role of her husband and tell her I loved her, gave her back rubs and hugs. My grandma who has bipolar 1 like me began to stop taking her meds every now and then and became extremely abusive as well verbally and she and my mom would neglect me or constantly insult me every single day. I would begin to start showing more signs of sexual abuse such as bedwetting and other behaviors. As well I would be constantly bullied by students. At this time I had also protected my friends from a robber and hid them as a man stole my brothers items. As well at this time I told my mother I wished to die to go to heaven where it's safe in which she laughed it off and walked away.

\*Ages 9-10: At this time I would be harassed and bullied by students and then my own teachers as well as my mother and grandma and grandpa who was a drunkard. My mom became boyfriends with a man who would also terrorize me, I was witness to him smashing a chair into his brothers head repeatedly and had to be the adult in the situation and protect him by stepping in front of him and saying ""You wouldn't hurt a child would you?"", then afterwards bandaging his brother myself. I would be witness to his cocaine addiction and him coming home cracked out and scaring me while he was having bad trips. Him threatening to kill me or beat me, and other stuff of that nature. Being around my mother, him and his friend mocking and yelling at me while they were drunk and I was crying, and telling me intimate details of sex life and how they were selling drugs together to addicts. I was repeatedly told that I was a bitch, always complaining and the abuser.

\*Ages 11-14: I would be forced to move into my grandma's house because of my mom's frivolous spending, in which every single day I would be screamed or tortured by my grandma, grandpa, cousin, aunt, sister, and mom and be forced to pick fights with every one of them and be harassed by them. My memory in general is extremely poor but I remember extremely little of the sexual abuse when I was younger and this period as well. My mom broke up with her boyfriend after moving in as well. During this period I would be routinely mocked in a group by most of my family members as I cried. I was forced to go to therapy because I was a ""problem child"" and in those therapy sessions my mom would talk to the therapist and the therapist and my mom would never allow me to talk during sessions with two therapists, with both therapists the only listened to my mom's needs and wants and never gave any advice other than ""Go do breathing exercises I guess.""

\*Ages: 15-17: I was living in an apartment with my mom after she moved out, in which she would refuse to sleep and go into psychosis and terrify me and abuse me verbally every day and act even more childlike than she already has throughout life. At 16-17 when I entered high school my mom's ex-boyfriend dumped his ex-girlfriend on us and she lived with us for two years in which she stole from us and I barely had any food to eat, she shouted at me and was also an addict. Was forced to endure my mother's psychosis even more and was not allowed to sleep for two days straight because she would wake me every 30 minutes on the dot. At age 15 I had begun to engage with older men online for sexual gratification and was at 17 groomed and sexually abuse by an older man. Due to my feminine appearance and desire to shave being called the T-slur by my mother and was insulted for my sexuality and tried to be convinced that I was straight.

\*Ages 18-19 (Now): I still live with my mother, she still shouts at me and nowadays I am more or less her caregiver, she has refused to allow to get my drivers license, refused to allow me to be independent, and generally keeps me in the house the most of the time and still hurts my feelings. I am currently in therapy for my trauma."
RELATIONSHIPS,9,mkotn4,3,I'm fine until I get a partner then I regress and I start to act unhealthy and show more signs that I wasn't ready. I keep thinking I'm healthy then once I date I am awful about it. Help.
Anyone else experience emotional numbness in relationships?,9,mkobj8,3,"Hey ya'll! This question is prompting my first post. I've learned a lot from reading this sub and I'm excited to be a part of this community. 

I F(24) have C-PTSD. I'm a survivor of several different types of abuse as well as several high trauma situations.  I have been in therapy almost constantly since early highschool and I've overcome a lot. I'm decent at symptom management at this point and to be honest I live a relatively joy filled normal life. The final frontier for me in overcoming my trauma is romantic relationships. 

My first relationship in high school was super toxic and ended with him stalking me. Since then I've worked to  overcome my tendency to sabotage relationships before they start and my habit of putting up walls of being very emotionally hardened and uninterested.

However, I've noticed a pattern in my relationships that I'm not quite sure what to do with. I want to know of anyone else has experienced something similar. 

Generally when I meet someone and we start going on dates it's fun and exciting and lighthearted. The first couple weeks are just enjoying learning about someone and having fun together. I'm a very enthusiastic and fun type of person and it's easy for me to drag people along in my excitement. Generally I'll really be into someone at this stage and be excited for the prospect of a relationship. 

Then around a month to two months in the other person will express their affection/ liking / desire for commitment. Then my heart goes stone cold and I lose all emotion. Generally around this stage I'll find myself wondering if I even liked the other person to begin with. I'll pull them apart in my mind and find every single thing about them that isn't perfect. I make a mental running list of reasons we wouldn't work. All the while mentally and emotionally distancing myself from them. Then by month three they've become an enemy and a threat in my mind and I break up with them. This has been the pattern in every relationship. 

The weird part is.... It seems so real? Like It doesn't feel like I'm intentionally sabotaging. I genuinely lose all feeling for people as soon as they express interest in me. I'm about a month and a half into a dating relationship and I've been so enjoying getting to know this guy. But last week he asked to make it official and I've spent the last week feeling totally dead toward him. No positivity, regard, liking left. All I can think about is the few inconsequential things I've noticed aren't awesome about him and playing out an eventual breakup. 

I don't want to ruin a potentially good thing. But I don't know how to move past how emotionally stone cold my heart always becomes at the first sign of commitment. I'd love to learn from other people's experiences! I hope this was all clear and relevant."
I hope they drown in misery,4,mkt9dm,0,"They tried to prevent me from making it out by locking me in a room to keep me out of school, torturing me and leaving me to die, destroying my homework and burning my books. They believed that without an education, I would have nowhere to go and be their human punching bag forever. My only memories of school are my books burning. 

Now I'm in a fantastic relationship with a wonderful, loving man of 5 years who recently proposed, attending a first rate university. I'm at the top of my class and year away from graduate school. I'm experiencing everything I've ever wanted after living in fear for so long that everything was all out of reach. Despite a hundred thousand obstacles at every single step of the way, I've made a fuck ton of money. More money than they've made over the course of their lifetimes combined. I just booked a nice vacation at a gorgeous seaside villa to celebrate getting vaccinated. Which, of course, they don't believe in. I have the freedom to do whatever I want and go to wherever I want. I have a new family now and they aren't part of it. I adore my friends and would do anything for them, and they would do the same for me.

They're stuck in miserable dead-end minimum wage jobs at 60 yrs old with no savings, no education, no retirement fund, no employable skills, no job history, no friends or family. Both their healths are in the gutter and their bodies are rapidly deteriorating because they don't believe in science or nutrition or medicine. Meanwhile, I'm in the best shape of my life. I play beach volleyball, run half-marathons, do competitive fencing, and lift weights. Their lungs look like swiss cheese, but their denial was so strong they continued going out in public, knowingly endangering other peoples lives even after their COVID diagnosis. Their cars are falling apart and mechanics are bleeding them dry because they don't have the know-how to do routine maintenance themselves. They enjoy their own ignorance so they can use it to blame everyone but themselves.

Fuck yeah, I *am* vindictive. Sometimes I feel like my sole purpose in life is to become so successful that they hate how miserable their own lives are. I hate them and want them to suffer the same fear and humiliation that I did. They're going to die as alone and unloved as they made me feel for two decades. Nothing would make me happier than if they died surrounded by nothing and no one.

Anti-science anti-education people make me fucking sick. End rant."
Heart racing after eating,23,mki6py,28,"This has been happening on and off since last fall now. But most times after eating, my heart rate shoots up to 120 and I have to take deep breathes in front of a fan and drink water to slow it down. It usually 30 minutes to an hour. Is this because of my PTSD? Or am I doing something wrong?

Trauma- possible cPTSD if not likely,1,ml3dpy,1,"General TW- talk of trauma, gender, sexual characteristics, depression/suicidal, intrusive thoughts, and the general content could just be overwhelming for some 

Also sorry it’s so jumpy I’ve been writing this during a panic attack for 30 minutes and I still feel awful. 

I (m17) have a lot of trauma I’ve been through that was consistent for my entire life and I’m still honestly not out of the woods even now. Its probably resulted in cPTSD but I’m undiagnosed so it’s only possible, thought I think likely. The only thing is it’s not typical trauma, nothing bad happened to me physically, there were no isolated events, it was just consistent and there all of the time from day 1 of my life. I am intersex (XY with internal testes and ambiguous genitalia) and when I was born I appeared more female than male so they had sent me out that way and I was raised female. I was called a girl, people called me she, I wasn’t allowed to cut my hair until middle school, people thought I was biologically female, and I had to use the girls bathrooms and changing rooms. Of course I had the perfect storm of things going on that made me seem like a typical female (gynecomastia and pseudo-menses), yet I was not because I am male. From as young as age 5 I remember always telling people I was a boy and I kept begging to be referred to as such. I told teachers and other kids I had a penis but my parents thought I was girl. I was ignored, dismissed, and laughed off. My dad was nice enough to hear me out to a degree and let me do cub-scouts with my brother, participate on boys sports teams, and took me out to do typical father-son activities but he still called me his daughter. It wasn’t enough. I broke down in health class multiple times because I had to attend the girls portion of the class. I skipped gym all of the time because they wanted me to change in the girls lockers, I just walked the halls and hid around. I used the boys bathroom whenever I could in public or at school and while that was relieving it didn’t do much to curb the damage done. Eventually I just stopped going to school most of the time because I knew I would be perceived as female and I couldn’t deal with that, so I stayed home. I was miserable all throughout middle school and most of high school, which I dropped out of because I was tired and ready to move on to better things (yay for early college I guess). In 7th grade my parents actually started to listen to me (mainly my mom) and took me to a doctor who suggested I might be transgender. It made sense at the time so I just went with it, even though it felt off and not right. I was put on hormone blockers and stayed on them until the end of my freshman year of high school. I gained a lot of weight and because I was barely starting puberty my voice was still high. I looked androgynous and sounded like a girl. People who didn’t know me gendered me correctly which was good, but most already knew who I was so I was incorrectly perceived. My freshman year I remember a junior guy gendering me correctly and consistently in my civics class and it was probably the thing I looked forward to most cause he would talk to me about typical boy shit like boners and sports, and it was finally someone seeing me for my real gender. Then of course a classmate who knew me told him I “used to be a girl” and he kind of stopped talking to me after that. Never gonna forgive that classmate that’s for sure, since she was wrong and he was actually right. At 14 and 15 I still sounded like a 12 year old boy (which of course 12 year old boys sound like girls) so that sometimes set people off who didn’t know me, but most of the time I was just assumed younger (which I guess in terms of pubescent stages I was, so I’m not offended by someone thinking I was 12 at 15, especially cause they gendered me right). Thankfully that’s not the case now as I’m finally going through puberty (started at 15 when I started testosterone replacement therapy). I look and sound like a normal guy my age now. I only got my intersex condition confirmed a few months ago which is good to finally have knowledge of but also now I’m stuck with everyone I knew before thinking I’m a trans guy so that kinda sucks since I can’t explain the reality of the situation. That’s how it still kind of lingers but at least I’m not viewed as a girl anymore, at least not to my face...

TL;DR - I was raised female as a biological male with an intersex condition and it was traumatic

Now onto how it’s affecting me currently. Of course I’ve been horribly depressed for a majority of my life because of the trauma I went through but after dropping out of high school and getting away from the people who gendered me incorrectly I started feeling a lot better. I finished my GED, started community college, started working out, got a job, things were good. Even during the beginning of covid it wasn’t unbearable, things were fine until around December I would say. I also have OCD so that also plays a part in this, it may even be trauma induced I’m not sure, but it went from manageable to hard to manage in that month. However since the beginning of the year it’s gone from hard to manage to crippling, on top of trauma attacks and loneliness with no outlets to vent outside the internet. I’ve developed something akin to body dysmorphia is the only way I can really describe it. I can’t look at my face or body without thinking I look like a girl or a young man who looks like he used to be one. I can’t hear my voice without thinking it sounds like a girls voice and in my head my inner voice still sounds like my pre pubescent self. Objectively speaking I look and sound nothing like a girl, there’s no “tells” that I was once perceived as one and theres no indication that I’m biologically female in any way. But my mind says otherwise. It says that my ambiguous genitalia are normal for a female and that my penis is just an enlarged clitoris. It says my testes aren’t actually there and I’m just wishfully thinking because I don’t want to be a girl. It says my gynecomastia is normal female development and not abnormal male breast enlargement. It says I’m biologically female even though I am objectively not. It tells me I look female even though I objectively don’t. I can’t be around women or trans guys for long without getting uncomfortable because of those sort of thoughts, it’s triggering. Looking at photos of myself or hearing voice recordings from before I started puberty is triggering. Those triggers and thoughts send me into a panic and I break down and cry just hoping it’ll end and that someone might be able to help me but nobody ever does. I just suffer alone with nobody to talk to. I’m constantly paranoid that people view me as female or that they secretly call me “she” behind my back. I’m always afraid people don’t actually view me as male and that they would lie if they were asked. I was constantly dismissed and ignored as a child when I told people I was a boy and I just get so overwhelmed by how I was never believed and nobody addressed my concerns until it was far too late to undo any damage. It wasn’t fair and I get so angry sometimes and shut down over it. I always have the urge to cut off everybody I know currently and rebuild my life as I want it so I don’t have to doubt how others perceive me. I’m constantly obsessing over and checking my body to make sure I’m still male and look male and because of my distorted perception and intrusive thoughts most times acting on those compulsions don’t even help. My perception is so warped that it’s basically in another reality and the paranoia is getting to me. Most days I don’t even want to speak or be looked at by anyone, not even myself because I’m so scared of how I’ll be perceived. Whenever I get triggered and panic I feel physically sick. I can’t whisper or speak quietly because it sounds like a female voice, why I really don’t know but it’s probably because most guys revert to their falsetto when they speak quieter or whisper since it uses less of your vocal chords. I have random crying spells brought on by seemingly nothing but just remembering the past and those intrusive thoughts. I’ve been sleeping a lot more than usual just to try and escape them. This trauma has ruined me and I can’t take it anymore. I’ve been rapidly declining for weeks now and I’m approaching being borderline suicidal because it’s gotten so bad. Things have gotten bad again and I can’t even tell anybody because they just wouldn’t get it. I feel so broken and I need help but I don’t know where to start. 

TL;DR- I’m suffering too much and just about ready to let it all go"
"Panicky Feeling | TW: Manipulation, Toxic Stuff, Etc.",1,ml2rmj,0,"Okay, I'll start off by saying that I'll spoiler this post to make sure nobody gets triggered or anything, so there's a warning for mentions of manipulation and some generally toxic things. I'm also new to this subreddit and currently suffer from PTSD and such.  
Anyways, it was about 2-3 months ago (or more) when this happened. I was talking with a few friends over like, text and stuff (these friends are online, not IRL) and all the sudden they started talking about a guy who I'll call S. S used to be nice, but after a while he began to turn into, well, an asshole. Being passive-aggressive all the time, generally saying some shitty things to people who didn't do anything, and overall being very toxic and manipulative, etc. Of course, I was best friends with S and I didn't let go because I was fairly young at the time. S, therefore, was shitty to me and others and being generally toxic and what-not. Yadda-yadda, the friends that were having a conversation about him went through a similar situation with him. During this time as well I felt guilty about what S did, regretting some of my actions and how I treated S despite S being the cause.  
So yeah, friends were talking about how much of an ass S was and, all of a sudden, I got shaky. From what I remember I was shaking, could hardly breathe, and I couldn't calm myself down. I also got a feeling of guilt hit me like a truck because, you know, S. It took me about 30-45 minutes to finally calm down.  


Does anyone know what this was? I think it might've been a normal panic attack but I have no idea what actually happened. Was it a PTSD attack, a panic attack, or something else? To those who give advice thank you so much in advance."
Hi all,2,mky3r0,0,Hey everyone. I just joined because my husband of 10 years has PTSD. Things have been a roller coaster for the last 3 years since he got near deathly ill. I'm trying to piece together our lives and need some support and possibly another viewpoint.
Yes or No on visiting trigger location?,8,mkn7oe,10,"Some years ago I suffered a near-death experience in a local hospital, namely being fed solid food after being injected with morphene. I promptly choked, blacked out, had to be revived. That was probably a trigger event in my diagnosed PTSD.

Now my wife needs to go to the same hospital for a heart procedure. Friday I took her there for a pre-op test, and as we walked down a hallway all the old memories/fears came flooding back.

Now she goes in for the procedure Wed. I feel I should really take her and be there for her support, but just don't think it's wise. Should I feel like a heel in arranging someone else to take her, or is my own protection more important?"

Resources for overcoming trust issues?,2,mkuaa2,1,"Hi friends,

I have PTSD from when I was a kid, from long-term stuff that happened with people my own age. I'm in my 30s now and I've realised how hard it is for me to form and maintain friendships due to lack of trust. Whenever someone reaches out to me, I feel like they're bothering me and I get angry and judgemental. I don't have this problem with romantic relationships, strangely (maybe because I never had those when I was having problems).

I've been going to therapy for the better half of a decade and it's helped a lot. I'm just wondering if there are any books or resources anyone knows about this topic that might help me. I lost a few close friendships over the past few years and I'm sure my behaviour towards them was a major contributing factor.

Thanks so much for your advice."
Trying to explain myself. The split,9,mkiejp,2,"I need to explain myself somewhere , mabey here someone will understand. Hamid.
I met a doctor today to undergo a simple but painful procedure.I have done it before in the past  I know why I am afraid. The necessity of it helped my overcome the fear. Before my appointment I saw the doctor  I  was appointed to be kind  to an elderly patient. I appreciated it and when we met shared this. 
In short I explained I have post trauma, non-related to the  small procedure (as if something is really non related). I asked to be in control, he understood and respond attentively. 
He was professional but not cold hearted like I am used too from doctors and caretakers. 
He then asked my age, when I said 47, he looked up brightly and complimented, really you look alot younger. 
Thats when I broke down and burst into tears infront of this man. Apologizing multiple times of course. I was disappointed I couldn't hold myself together.

The split
....
So half an hr later this is what I analyzed.
I have developmental trauma through neglect during infancy. 
As a baby I call out for help and it didn't come. 
The Doctor's regoconition and adressing  my request for help, obviously overwhelmed me, I somehow could not believe the reality of the present because of my traumatic disbelief.
For me, When he mentioned my age, he saw the man in front of him, yet I was alsothere as a year old lnfant.
To me this makes sense.

my symptoms ruined my relationship,33,mkc6ir,7,I have no clue where else to put this.

How do I get over the PTSD of this?,5,mkkvea,5,"I’m 25. I’ve been having nightmares here and there of the guy who had stalked me, harassed me at work(he was a customer), and threatened my family and I. I was on high alert for 2 years, staying hyper aware of my surroundings when I left work to go home, and when I would go to any store. He was a complete stranger who became obsessed with me and told me repeatedly I’ll leave my boyfriend for him. That event took place 2018-2020, it stopped when he was finally arrested and jailed, and I have a 2 year injunction put on him now. I quit that job because it was triggering working there where employers made me feel stupid for calling police on the stalker guy. But it’s not a worry for me anymore and I don’t think about it daily. I have no triggers that triggers these nightmares I randomly have here and there. I had a great weekend so I don’t know why I had another nightmare last night.

The nightmares usually consist of him breaking in my house & trying to grab me, or he’s outside trying to get in the house. He never looks away from me and stares intensely just enjoying my fear, even though I usually push him out or my boyfriend beats him up in my dream. In real life, he never broke in my house or tried to grab me, it’s an irrational fear that manifests in my nightmares.

Besides the nightmares, the only other ptsd symptom I can think of is startle responses. If someone is at the door or I hear the door handle jiggle, I get really scared and my heart starts beating fast. I usually don’t answer the door if I’m not expecting any company. I always make sure doors are locked.

Is it possible to get over this ptsd? My family thinks I’m overreacting so I’m thankful for finding this sub."

protracted withdrawal and was having panic thoughts, anxiety and  irritability. I started acting impulsively and almost lost my self-control, which ended me hospitalized. I also had some kind of serious allergic reaction from surface disinfectant but nobody believes me. Everything that happened was diagnosed as a relapse.
And of course, Paxil (generic) was rapidly reinstated in addition to antipsychotic. I've been having many functional symptoms to this day of which many have already been improved.

My blood panels, ECG and head MRI came all back normal.
My biggest issue currently are total loss of emotions, anhedonia, apathy, anxiety attacks and brain fog. Propranolol is of great help for my anxiety. I'm currently having a job but don't have any interest nor excitement towards it anymore.

Sleep: Nightmares and Gasping for air,1,mkqk6l,0,"Hello all, After being in crisis and the intervention of my local CMHT, I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety and depression. I have since been engaging with my local CMHT and psychiatrist through a trial and error in regards to medication that aided in managing various symptoms I was having. 
One symptoms I was really struggling with was a lack of decent sleep. Sometimes it was a combination of being unable to settle to sleep, other times staying asleep due to nightmares and at times a combination of both. Due to restrictions and concerns in regards to sleeping medication in the UK, I was on a short term course, which I used as and when I felt I needed them, these ended a longtime ago. During my last appointment with a psychiatrist I spoke about anxiety like attacks/symptoms I have recently began experiencing at night when beginning a sleep regime (tight chest, difficulty breathing, sweating, uncomfortably warm) and that I was still having nightmares and often waking, choking, gasping for air and in a panic. I often managed to ground myself and 'ride it out' before trying to go back to sleep.
Recently these have began happening more frequently, however, it is no longer occurring when asleep or have been for a little while, but as I am drifting off to sleep, the in between stage if this makes sense. I have feeling that I am unable to breathe, cannot breath as if my throat is blocked and when I try to wake, I struggle. I feel as if I wake, but I am still somehow dreaming, but now I'm  in my bedroom, in my bed still unable to breathe. I then panic, fantastically trying to sit up, which is when all of a sudden I experience a pulling back to reality and actually wake in a panic, gasping, heart  pounding etc.
I was wondering if anyone else has or does experience this? If so how do you cope, strategies you have in place? Due to UK lockdown I have to see what appointment I can get to speak with someone as it seems to be happening more frequently, since initially calming down so any tips would be appreciated.
Sorry for the long winded post and hope it makes some sense."

Panic after sexting,6,mkdvxm,4,"I'm just so frustrated it feels like I'm losing my mind over things that are supposed to be fun.

It's been over 6 years since I got out of the abusive relationship and I just a year or so ago started dating this really really wonderful man.

Is anyone here diagnosed with PTSD but doesn't have all the symptoms?,7,mk97e3,10,"Trigger warning ⛔


This will be long so if you can please answer to my question I'll be thankful. I really need some answers. 

I was subjected to female genital mutilation (my clitoris was partly removed) when i was 10 years old (I'm 26 now), in my country most girls go through this horrible experience.
I don't want to be diagnosed with PTSD because i don't want this to be the reason of my suffering with depression. 
i remember the day in details.
I don't usually think about it but when i do, i feel the hate burning in my chest, what in hell could possibly drive educated parents to commit such an awful thing on their child?  And why did they chose to wait until I was 10?  Why didn't they just cut off my flesh when I was an infant and got over with it? 
my body, my privacy and my dignity all have been violated.. And the worst is that i have to remember, for the rest of my life, every detail of that fucking day and the days followed. It was like ""chopping off part of my genital"" wasn't enough no, they forced me to let go of all my needs of privacy untill the wound finally healed. I was left with nothing but feelings of humiliation and embarrassment. 
Whenever i think of that exact moment.. The cutting, the bleeding, the stitching.. I feel discomfort through my private parts, my muscles contract and my whole body shrinks.

My parents are educated they have no excuse, whither they purposely intended to limit my sexual desires and thus ensuring that their dearest reputation will not get tarnished, or they just didn't question the norms.. it makes no difference.. what matters is that they wanted to be socially accepted. they chose to submit to customs. They chose themselves over my health, over ME. and i hate them for it. 

The thing is, i don't believe this interferes with my day to day life, (I've had too few sexual experiences to know if it's affected), i don't think about the event much, i don't have nightmares.. and i don't have problems with remembering important aspects of that day. 
The only reflection it has on my life is that I've some sort of hate towards my parents. 
I've been struggling with depression for i don't know how long, recently diagnosed with bipolar II. But i believe this has nothing to do with what i experienced. 
My therapist asked me whither i went through any traumatic event,  i cried while telling her the story, i haven't talked about it to anyone before. We're to have further talk about it next session. 

Is any of this sounds familiar? Could someone go through a trauma and not develop PTSD? 
I don't experience panic attacks, nor uncontrollable flashbacks. Is the absence of these two symptoms means i don't have PTSD?"
Random paranoid episode,6,mk82je,3,"Has anyone been triggered by no apparent reason?

I have been battling with PTSD ever since I was around 13 years old. I'm now 19. My worst year was probably 2019, but since then my symptoms have decreased. I know I could be even better if I went to therapy (The last time I went to see a professional I was 16) but I have been able to manage this thing fairly well. Then suddenly, a month ago, I had a paranoia episode. I was supposed to go out with my friends, but all I could think of was that I was going to die at any second. I was shaking, barely walking, looking for potential threats that didn't exist. Walking the street I saw a police officer and even though we were not doing anything wrong, I was sure the police officer was going to kill me. I can't even express how sure I was that this was going to happen. Hours later, as we were having diner, I wrote a long, goodbye text message to my mom and my dad but luckily didn't send it. I couldn't enjoy the night. I felt miserable. Once I got to my home, alive, I couldn't believe it. A voice inside my head even tried to convince I was actually dead and just wandering around. I know how ridiculous this sounds, but there's no way to express how I felt. Almost like a soldier walking through a mined field, so certain of my imminent death. 

The thing is, nothing triggered me. At least, nothing I can remember. I was totally fine until I wasn't. When episodes like this happened to me in the past, there was always a trigger, a perturbing image or another crappy experience. But that day, there was nothing. And the next morning, I was totally fine. Before, my crazy, I-am-going-to-die episodes lasted weeks.

I'm worried about what this may represent. Although my night was ruined, I'm more worried this could happen when crossing the street (In the past, my paranoia almost caused me to run into moving traffic) or when having an important meeting. Perhaps even during an exam. I don't know if I should contact a therapist again, as I'm actually better than before. I don't know if I should seek help because a single, isolated episode. Anyone has had experiences like this? What do you advise?"
I feel like I was toxic to my ex with PTSD...,6,mk7dqw,13,"I just got out of a 6 week relationship, not long I know, but regardless I fell hard for this girl. We had been talking for a few months before getting together. She had C-PTSD, and I accidentally triggered her multiple times. It was never my intention. The last time was the last straw, and she blocked me completely. 

Whenever she would let me know of a trigger, I wrote it down and did my absolute best not to do it again. She had told me that feeling like she was in trouble was one of them.

The incident that led to her blocking me was because I asked her a question, but I phrased it wrong and she felt like I was accusing her. I can give more details if needed. 

I don't really know what exact advice I'm looking for here. I just want to know if I was in the wrong, and if I was being toxic, and I figure the best people to ask are those who have PTSD themselves. The guilt is killing me and I don't know how to move on."

Comparing yourself to who you were before your trauma / Mourning who you could have been without trauma,165,mjjau5,25,"TW: childhood sexual abuse

I know it's unhealthy to keep wishing that some things didn't happen or complain about life being unfair, but goddamn is it unfair sometimes. it's pretty useless to mourn the person you could've become without the trauma because that person simply doesn't exist. I just still feel envious sometimes of everyone who hasn't experienced sexual abuse. 

Before I was abused as a child, I was a lot more talkative and extroverted. The year after the abuse happened teachers started expressing their concerns to my parents, that I am unassertive in class, too shy, etc. What would my life be like if some horrible things never happened? I know I need to stop thinking about it. Today is just one of those days I feel angry again that I am one of the many unlucky ones who were born into a dysfunctional family. I have done some EMDR therapy and made tons of progress already, have a loving boyfriend now, but I still get setbacks. I know it's all part of the recovery process, but today I just wanted to express my grief. I feel unable to talk about this to people in my life, because they wouldn't understand. 

I wish I didn't have to get triggered during sex. It's so maddening. I feel angry that I should even have to remember horrible events of the past. If I never got abused these flashbacks wouldn't have to happen... Sometimes you think you're making progress and doing well and then those traumatic memories just punch you right back in the face :D. Oh well, I shouldn't beat myself up about it. I can't do anything else but surrender and accept my past, unfortunately."
Please help i want to know dysphoria better??,0,mkah8v,3,"
Is a past trauma like being raped has something to do with suffering from dysphoria? My female friend was raped around 3 years ago and a year after he started to feel more comfortable being addressed as ""him""


Fyi he didnt admit he was raped and i find out by myself"
Flashbacks of beautiful memories,2,mk5qor,0,"Hey people.
First of all, I was never diagnosed with PTSD mostly because I thought my flashbacks were due to my anxiety and they're normal. Now I understand it might have been the other way around.
Anyways, I've come a long way in the past 8 years or so and now I am at a really good place mentally. House, dream job, family, time, money. Everything is there and I worked so hard for it all.
However it seems like the flashbacks have persisted, instead they are mostly beautiful memories, like the first day in daycare (ok that one was a tiny bit bad as well), tons of memories of me playing with my friends including the songs we used to sing etc.
I am used to terrible flashbacks and I've developed a mechanism to get out of them relatively effectively but in this case I obviously don't have to.
Anyone had any similar experiences? Does it mean I'm finally losing my marbles completely? Am I getting better? None of the above?
I'm confused. Thnx."
Preventing PTSD before it happens?,1,mk9nvh,3,"Last night, I experienced a traumatic experience. I have come to realize that the details aren't particularly important - I think it suffices to say that my central nervous system was kicked into a very agitated state with every possible ""fight or flight"" response activated. Actual physical harm was possible in the situation and I had real reasons to fear for my safety, though I am not 100% blameless or even close, I could have been assaulted viciously. I had intrusive thoughts about what happened last night, could not unwind easily and generally felt miserable, in a state of hypervigilance.

This morning, I woke up feeling much better but I found myself feeling extremely angry and irritable later on. I found it hard to concentrate on things I needed to do, had intrusive thoughts, was jumpy, felt anxiety etc. I've dealt with panic disorder in the past (thankfully muted to the point of being a low-lying thing now - haven't had a panic attack in a year or so!) - this is very, very different. I feel like I am exhausted while also being on extreme overdrive.

Since it has only been one day, I know that I am not experiencing PTSD - these problems would have to persist for a while for that to be the case. However, I want to do whatever I can to sort out what I am feeling now so it doesn't happen - does anyone have any tips or advice or tricks or insights? I'd appreciate anything you have to offer. This is very scary and new to me..."
Has anyone overcome traumatic fear?,3,mk32pv,7,"Hello, I will keep my story very short. Basically in the past 3 or 4 years I have had 2 nervous breakdowns. Before I had them, I wasnt taking care of myself and was extremely lonely. I am aware that is my trigger. However, the straw on the camels back was migraines I had where I couldnt see - normal that I get those every few months but for some reason, when they happen when I'm already anxious, they absolutely send me over the edge, I start shaking, feeling cold, crying, thinking I'm about to die. I now have what I beleive are flashbacks, overthinking, hypervigilance, over focus on what has happened with me. I am recovering but have days like this where I feel so worried. Has anyone overcome their issue around PTSD, and have any recommended therapists or approaches or modalities? 

Please any advice someone, thank you."
Could have my severe mental breakdown triggered PTSD?,2,mk5apj,1,About a week ago I suffered a severe mental breakdown after i had been released from the mental hospital. It was so severe I ended crying screaming and literally thought I was going to end my life right there. My parents weren’t very helpful either as my mom and stepdad were part of the cause of this mental breakdown. I’ve been having flashbacks from that day and My anxiety and paranoia have been through the roof lately. I’ve become extremely distant from my parents and have developed a sense of numbness and dissociation. That event has been haunting me ever since and anytime i remember it i go into complete panic mode
My wife was diagnosed with PTSD and she's having difficulty coping,3,mk1lkf,4,"My wife was diagnosed with PTSD after she watched her mother attempt suicide as well as some other childhood issues and she's been having a really hard time with accepting the diagnosis. But now it seems like everything that ever happened to her was a trauma. Such as that she never got to go to Disneyland even after her dad promised her they would go or that her friends never asked her to go to the skating rink. I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I'm trying to be supportive, but I'm not sure if I should point out that those are normal life events and yes they're sad, but not major issues. I'm not sure what to do or how I should try to help her navigate her diagnosis and make sense of her life."
Feels strange when i wakeup,11,mjtga7,5,"every morning i wakeup and feel like ""oh, im me"" and it feels new and odd and unpleasant. i dont know why this is an emotion i experience because who else would i wake up as? but i just feel so disconnected to my self and overwhelmed and i dont know..like ""ah, i exist and there is this large large mountain of things i, the person who is me, has to deal with and absolutely has no choice but to deal with"" and it feels unpleasant and surreal every single time. all i want is to have my own house or apartment or something n enough money that i can be free to hide in my own house n heal n take my time. just feel like the best metaphor is im drivin a janky car with 2 wheels missing and half a steering wheel and no turn signals but somehow im supposed to use this car to drive a thousand miles which just seems like such preposterous bullshit and completely unlikely that one would ever accomplish such a feat. im fucking tired and i jus wanna rest for a long time cuz how am i supposed to fix all this shit if im so exhausted but how am i supposed to have the freedom to rest the way i need to if i dont fix all this shit first and get my own house n financial freedom first?
TLDR: In conclusion, im fucked, everythings fucked, and also everything is fucked. (everything's fucked)"
Has anyone here been through an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP)?,6,mjvaj6,6,"I hope this doesn't count as soliciting medical advice. I'm aware it might straddle the edge on that.

My therapist recommended I might want to look into an IOP for a few reasons (psychiatrist availability and therapy more than once a week). I have an intake appointment on Monday, and it was mentioned by the admissions staff that the intake appointment will likely be 2 hours! 

Does anyone have experience with these intake appointments? What are they looking for, exactly? 2 hours seems like a really long time. From what I understand it's like an interview so they can decide on a plan of care for you? I've done inpatient before a decade ago but never anything outpatient."
Thinking about how I didn't recognize the effect trauma has had on my life,1,mk1lbx,0,"Please let me know if this doesn't belong in this sub! This is my brain dump and questions I ask myself, mostly a vent post, maybe someone can relate to this train of thought?

Something happened when I was 12 that was fairly traumatizing and caused me distress for years after. I didn’t start acknowledging it as traumatic until I started seeing my current therapist. I recently looked at the DSM-V symptom list for PTSD and found that based on what I remember from ages 12-14 ish, I fit all of the symptoms and then some.

I continued to have all of the symptoms for a few years (2-3 after it happened), but they’ve slowly gone away. It's been much better since the parent that acted as a trigger for me has moved out and we've stopped talking.

10 years later and I still have the symptoms that overlap with GAD and MDD (which I’ve been diagnosed with). My therapist has been urging me to see it as a result of what I went through, which has been difficult. For the first time in my life, I’m seeing the avoidance I have always struggled with as part of the coping mechanisms I developed then, when my only tool was to avoid so as to not acknowledge my own powerlessness. I’m still too afraid to move, I have an overblown avoidance response to everything new, I can’t cope with the constant feelings of failure and stress… I look at myself then I look at my friends who have been through just as much and more and wonder why I am  so paralyzed.

I used to think of myself as self aware but it feels like my brain is hiding things from me. I can't remember a lot of what my early teenage years were like. I don't even remember who I was - me at 12 feels like a stranger.

I never got formally diagnosed of course so I don't know if I really had PTSD then, but I'm just thinking about how deep the scars of trauma run. It's black and white thinking but I weirdly thought I had healed and I sometimes wonder how it’s possible that this thing that happened might be continuing to derail my life, even though I never think about it, and would've never noticed it without someone else pointing it out. Or rather, I would never have realized there was an option to not be this way."
Don't have motivation to do vital routines,1,mk0t2m,2,"Dissociation has been killing me. I feel indifferent and forgotten. Brushing teeth or showering for me equals to climbing a mountain. How can I get better? Medications, stimulants, drugs? I never did any, but I need help badly.  
21, been in this condition for past 3 years and it's not getting any better."
"I need support/advice, I have a serious conflict with my neighbors and my ptsd has become wrapped up in it.",5,mjs9qo,8,"For the 6 + months since they have been trying to pick a fight with me. Calling me names, insulting me, slamming doors, refusing to lock the door (intentionally leaving it open bc I asked them to lock it) kick and stomping at my exterior apt walls. I tried to leave them a note, and they torn it into pieces. 

I've been trying to ignore it, but a few months ago I couldn't take it anymore. I wasn't sleeping, I was triggered 100% of the time by them yelling, stomping, calling me names every other day.
They've continuously escalated their hatred toward me, calling me crazy, saying ""cuckoo, cuckoo!""

I'm not 100% innocent.  I've snapped at them and threatened them, cursed them out and slapped my door back at them. I try not to, but they get me so angry and triggered sometimes I get angry back. I struggle to sleep bc of them. I'm scared to run into them in the halls.

I've been too afraid to tell my landlord becasue I'm scared he'll think I'm crazy and side with the neighbors; he's kind of a slum lord, not very understanding. I'm scared to call the cops becasue they are so violent in my city. 

I'm in trauma therapy rn, via telehealth, but my therapist doesn't want to keep doing treatment becasue he says I'm in too triggering an environment  with the weekly antagonism I face and my apt isn't a safe space for therapy.

Im at such a loss and can't sleep. Idk what to do."
What happened to me.,2,mjw8cs,0,"Back in November, a stupid small word triggered my current downward spiral. I caught myself early, got myself to a doctor, and got myself on the waiting list for therapy.  Something I never did in the past. I would allow myself to just fall deeper and deeper. I had managed to cope for so long, but that stupid thing in November toppled me. I was at an appointment at my daughters' school with a support staff member, and he was helping me with what sort of things to include in the personal statement. 

He made a small comment saying that he knows I have past trauma and maybe I could include that. Honestly innocent enough, but it was the spark. I had never ever told anyone, so how could he know? Who told him, how did he find out? My head was racing my heart was thumping, and I couldn't stop the panic and fear rising in me.

If I exclude the beatings my sister gave me on a daily basis, it is nearly 15 years since it happened. Looking back, I cannot believe how stupid and naive I was. I was going away for a few days. I had a large bag with several changes of clothes. I was wearing a brown knee-length skirt and a pale cream/light brown blouse. I was 17. I was struggling with my bag, and took a break, and sat down outside shops in the middle of town. Two guys came by and made a comment. I didn't think they were talking to me. I got up to leave and they offered to help, they took my bag and started walking. I followed and was talking. went through an unused bus station. one of them hit me so hard I fell. I didn't even fight back. Which made them angry. So they tried to strangle me with my bag.

I left home a few months later. My mum didn't notice I was struggling. My sister was beating me, my mum didn't care. I eventually got in a relationship with someone. Moved in with him. He was so nice at first, so kind and caring. but it changed. He would start with name-calling that he'd excuse away with him just being silly, and I was overreacting. Then controlling who I could see, who I could talk to. Then he got physical. Always saying he loved me and was sorry later, and that he didn't mean to. He was drunk or stressed or angry.

During that relationship I was having nightmares nearly daily, I eventually learned to hold them in, to not react from them when waking because if I woke him he would hurt me for it, or force me to have sex with him. 3 years I was with him before I attempted suicide. I ended up moving back to my parents' home. I kept having nightmares. but they slowly reduced. I would keep seeing things in my head. Seeing them, feeling them, hearing them. 

Years later, I had my daughter through a difficult birth.  2 years after that her father and I split. I ended up suicidal again, but not in a physical way. I couldn't deal with the memories, I just wanted to erase them. I was in that way for a few years. By the time my daughter was 4, CMHT and CRHT (Crisis response home treatment team)were involved. A psychologist said during a visit that he believed I was showing symptoms of PTSD. He told me that I had to tell him what happened in order for him to diagnose me. He was rude, showed no compassion, no kindness. he was a harsh rude man, and I did not feel comfortable talking to him. He did not believe me when I said my daughter was my staying power and said I had to promise him I would call the crisis line, or he would hospitalise me and get my daughter taken from me. 

After about a month and a half of a shit cmht. I was forgotten and slipped through their cracks. I worked on myself and slowly got better. I did so well (had a dip in 2017 with depression and anxiety) but I did pull myself out... Until he said trauma. I am spiraling down all because I was scared of how he could know. I never told anyone. I had written to a friend once who said I was lying, I was too ugly how could anyone even want to go near me. But I had never said it out loud. 

15 years on and they were still controlling me with fear, still suffocating me. All because I never told anyone. I finally told someone. I finally said it out loud. There was no relief from it. It didn't ease the pain. But I am hoping that in the future it won't cause such a crash because now I've said it, it's out there, it cannot be taken back, it cannot be erased. But it can be worked through."
"DAE ""make up"" personalities in your head to deal with abuse",9,mjp5xv,6,"I remember I would conjure up another personality to take some of the verbal abuse I received. When it happened, my world would get blurry, I felt very spacey, and sometimes my body lightly sways. I would imagine up a tougher, more hardened version of myself to receive trauma, and I would imagine they would be there in my body while I watched from the sidelines. I (?) would think ""I have to keep (my name) safe, this is my job, I have to do this."" They would also sometimes offer comfort to me when I was upset. But only sometimes.

NSFW - deep depression when I orgasm?,64,mjapck,29,I’m sorry this is a strange question but I keep noticing it and I don’t understand it or know what to ask really. Whenever I get there I just feel so sad and feel trauma resurface. I’ve been sexually harassed before but it’s the trauma from the abuse in my family that feels like it invades my mind when I’m doing that. I’ll reach that point and feel good then all of a sudden I remember getting beat or hear all the yelling in my head or I’ll just hate myself or something. Does anyone else experience this? I’m sorry I know it’s a weird question to ask but I don’t know how to talk to anyone about it really
Is it normal to feel happy after being diagnosed?,10,mjlayo,7,"Recently my therapist told me I have PTSD (which wasn't a diagnosis I expected) and at first I was kind of sad, but the more I research it the better I feel. It's like I finally have an explanation for all the  behaviors I used to constantly beat myself up over. I'm genuinely looking forward to doing more work to identify my triggers and learn to manage them. I even feel kinda compelled to tell the friends and family I'm close to so that they can better understand me. The only thing I'm sad about now is that I went so long without knowing what was going on with my head."
My boyfriend supports and handles my PTSD better than anyone ever in my life except for one thing [TW: yelling],13,mjiyer,3,"We’ve been together for a year. He does almost everything right. He is incredibly generous and loving. If I have a flashback for any reason, even during intimacy, he holds me as does whatever I need at the moment. He deals with my night terrors every night with nothing but love.

But he still yells sometimes at me when he’s mad. Raised voices are by far one of my biggest triggers. I ask him to stop, and he says he comes from a loud family and can’t help it, but will try. When he raises his voice I always start to shake and tell him not to, and he feels bad. But he still does it most of the time when we argue. I have told him many times, if you have a problem or are angry at me, you can tell me with any words. Even if they hurt my feelings. Put me in my place. But just please, please don’t yell it at me. We rarely actually argue anyway. 

I can’t logically react once I’m set off.There is one thing that will trigger a flashback in me 100% of the time and he is very careful not to do it. Raised voices are my second biggest trigger, I will start to shake and be scared 100% of the time, and it triggers a full flashback episode like 50-75% of the time. 

He says he is “trying” to stop raising his voice. I don’t get why he has to “try”, is it not possible to just like... not yell at your girlfriend with trauma? He’s never experienced trauma, but how can he look at me shaking like that and then do it again the next argument? 

I’m just lost, I don’t know what to do."
Psychiatrist 👩🏼‍⚕️ Says My Toxic Abusive Mother is the Cause of All My Trauma (I’m a 24F),7,mjlqwp,1,"So I only recently in the last 2 years was diagnosed with PTSD and all my triggers are caused by my mother (whose house I’m still stuck living in but I’ll get to that later) I cannot be tapped on the shoulder because my mother used to do that before yelling at me or screaming go in my face, I cannot be touched on my upper arms or neck, and if someone touches me on my back I freak out because she used to push me down the stairs in the house (that I still live in) now onto the (TW) now this next part I’m not sure if she ever intentionally or unintentionally did these things but it happened often enough that I told my psychiatrist and now I’m telling you all, I’ve never told anyone else any of this and I’m not even sure if there’s a statute of limitations on it or not because it started when I was 15. So what would happen is I would be in the kitchen or the basement making food or doing my laundry 🧺 and she would just brush up against me my buttocks the side of my breasts my psychiatrist has told me to practice NC even though I live in the same house as her still. I’m not entirely sure if her actions with the brushing past me or up against me was ever intentional or not but I do know the financial, psychological and physical abuse were intentional as well as the denial that I have any chronic illnesses. So I guess the point of this post is since my diagnosis 2 years ago I just need reassurance that I’m not the only one feeling the way I feel on a day to day basis."
Has anyone been able to reverse their lack of empathy?,3,mjojs7,1,"Part of my bad PTSD habits has been watching gore. I realized a few days into it that it was becoming an addiction, and I stopped. My therapist told me it was a controlled fight or flight response but in a safe environment, and that’s why it’s addicting. Amygdala etc.

Recently I’ve noticed I’m incredibly apathetic and emotionless. I hate it. I feel psychopathic and part of that validation comes from the gore I could watch. I wonder if I could hurt someone, and it scares me when I think I could. I never had those feelings before the gore.

I know this is part of the amygdala being fucked: sometimes working too much, now not working enough. I just want to feel normal again, not trying to push the vague thought experiments if I could inflict violence on others. I have OCD like tendencies that easily consume me—I don’t want this in me.

I’m willing and want to get all the help I need. I know it’s not normal. Has anyone else gone through this?"
Beekeeping as therapy for PTS,3,mjmvoh,1,Has anyone tried beekeeping as a form of therapy?
Things I feel like I have to be willing to give up thanks to my abusers.,2,mjptn5,1,"My upbringing. My heritage. 

My father has a weird fascination with our last name. It’s a fairly common last name in Germany that also happens to be a Pilsner beer sold exclusively in Berlin. It’s honestly kind of subpar, but the man knows absolutely everything about how it’s been produced to the history of the feuding breweries, and has an entire room that is essentially a shrine to our German heritage. Fun fact: when I did my 23 and me, I’m only actually like 10% German. We’re Irish. Like stone cold Irish. 

My father also has a weird fascination with children, which is something that I chose to selectively forget until a couple of months ago. I remember a lot of things that I wish I didn’t about that now, and as a result, I have done absolutely everything in my power to rid myself of anything and everything that is tied to him. Including my last name. The man has a way of slinking into my life, trying to find ways to keep me tied to him. He had access to my bank accounts, my life insurance (which was sketch because he never told anyone he took it out on me); I look a lot like him too, especially now that my hair is short. I can’t change the way I look, but I could work my fucking ass off to finally separate myself financially. And I have. I took myself out of the family AT&T plan; I closed all my old bank accounts (which is a bitch to do by the way), I moved so he doesn’t know where I live. The only thing tying us together now is our heritage, our name. I don’t necessarily want to go through all of the trouble of legally changing my name because it’s a lot of paperwork and just work in general. New credit cards, new license, new everything. And that’s absolutely terrifying. But not nearly as terrifying as what he’s done. So what am I willing to give up? Honestly everything. Coming into treatment, I felt like I was going to the extreme by doing all of this, but the longer I’m here, the angrier I get—and it’s good anger. The kind that fuels you to be proactive rather than just sit and take it. It’s just a name, I get that. But it’s also not, and I get that too. I’ve tried to associate the other amazing people that share my name, because there definitely are some dope ones out there. But there’s something so liberating about breaking the ties that bind. 

“It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.” 

My father isn’t the only toxic person who tries to cling to me, and he won’t be the last. But the difference is that I’m no longer afraid to lose things. I want to make space for new things, for better things. So what am I willing to give up? Absolutely everything."
"I've gotten this far in life through how well I repress my feelings, and now it's what makes me hate myself the most",3,mjnbxo,1,"I grew up in a dangerous home and no one ever caught on. For as long as I can remember, I've been dissociated from my feelings. It's not that I consciously shove them away - I just don't realize they exist, and as a result I don't feel the need to talk to someone. And then I'm blindsided by breakdowns.

I didn't open up about the abuse until freshman year of high school, when I was in my first relationship and they saw my body bare. Since then I've been trying to heal slowly - I've been patient, bc I know being oblivious to my emotions is what's kept me alive through the years.

I'm 21 now, and with a partner who's very emotionally conscious - they've got a lot of hurt of their own, make art about it, and spend lots of time pondering their emotions. When I have my breakdowns though, I can tell they get frustrated at how little I understand my own feelings. I pointed it out once, and they apologized for the fact that they unfairly expect me to analyze my own feelings as much as they do with their own.

I spend a lot of time thinking, I really do. And yet when I look inwards, I'm often met with a brick wall. It makes me feel all the more stupid and shallow when I inevitably hit my next breakdown. I feel like such a fucking imbecile.

I've felt all the more frustrated with myself since that incident with my partner. I know they didn't mean any offense by it, just the implication that I think less on my feelings makes me feel like I'm a dumbass who doesn't know how to self-reflect. I can't write heart wrenching poetry, I can't make surrealist art, I can't do anything productive and meaningful because I don't know how I feel. I'm fine until I'm suddenly hiding and crying in the closet without remembering how I got there.

Never mind the catharsis of being able to express myself, I just feel like a fucking piece of shit idiot who's been going to therapy for nearly a decade yet can't even catch myself before I break down : )"
Wrf is wrong with me?,2,mjo6e0,0,"One of the major traumas in my life was from a few years ago when three cops beat me in my underwear in my own living room and then tased me when I was on the ground. My heart was beating so fast and erratically the ambulance said I was actually missing beats and were worried but the cops didn’t care. I spent over three weeks in jail for something I didn’t do, feel free to mock me or call me a liar for that too cause a lot of people have already. I’m now stupidly a criminal justice student and with a lot of the courses especially the one I’m on now it triggers memories of everything that’s happened nonstop.

Do I actually have PTSD?,1,mjozn9,2,"I live in a suburban town in Wisconsin and recently had to go into Wauwatosa to get a vaccine. On my way there I got cut off and was almost side swiped and almost pushed into the median. Out of habit, I waited in my horn and the aggressive car full of people all turned around to flip me off. They proceeded to move to the other lane to let me pass them but I was uncomfortable since they had intentionally slowed down 20mph and I was afraid of what they might do. I made a quick turn to get away from them and as I was turning, I saw them do a u turn back towards me. They tried to hit the back of my car so I had no other option than to run stop signs and make quick turns to outrun them. At one point, they caught up to me and as they almost hit me, I quickly turned into a small parking lot. When I pulled in, they passed me on my left and threw their drinks at my car. When I quick backed up to get out of their, they stopped their car and two or three of them got out and started yelling at me. Now this might not sound bad to most of you but this was the first time I have ever been chased in a car where I was unaware of their intentions. In my mind, I thought I was going to be shot. Now every time I see a car that looks the same as that one that chased me or see a car start to come up behind me fast, I almost have a panic attack.

Back home where a lot of my trauma happened and struggling- anyone else?,1,mjouqk,0,"TW CSA and abusers

I recently discovered my CSA, and am home for the first time since I realized. It happened right down the street from my parents house, and from the little I remember (thank you dissociation!) it was horrific. I feel like just being in this town gives me a trauma response. 

My uncle also moved back into town. He has always hated me because I am close with my grandmother and until I was born he was “her baby”. He managed to call me a doucebag today in front of my entire family and no one said I word. I’m supposed to just put up with it because my uncle has severe bipolar, but I’m so sick of this. He has done a lot of fucked up things, and yeah calling me a doucebag isn’t really that bad (although I had barely said a word to him at that point so idk how I could have been being a doucebag). 

My mom is a whole other can of worms, she’s also bipolar (which is fine!) but insists that the diagnosis was fake and that she just has depression. Which also is fine, it’s her life, except she isn’t getting any treatment currently so she is all over the map. I forgot how stressful it is to not know what you’re walking in to- she can turn on a dime and often shifts throughout the day. To cope she and my father just drink, which only makes everything worse. 

I’m sorry for coming on here and venting, I just wanted to see if anyone else could commiserate. I do so good with treatment when I am in my apartment, but it feels like 10 steps back when I’m home."
New member,2,mjksqg,7,"I have Chronic PTSD from life long trauma in my childhood, a severely broken family, and adulthood trauma. 

One of the biggest issues with my condition is trust with women. 

The two major women in my life, my mother and grandmother have given me good reasons not to trust them, and by them being the main women and the toxic women I've had in my life, it screwed my trust for women... My mother was narcissist, drug addict, and a whore and my grandma was a religious narcissist control freak... 

One reminder from a woman I'm with and it triggers me and my trust for them is all screwed up...

For instance, I'm 32 the woman I'm with is 23. She is still full of energy and likes to get out and socialize, while I on the other hand do not. Her mother reminds me of my mother and has shown me things to make me believe that, so I don't trust her with her mother. I don't trust her around her friends either... These people do not like me and tell her she can do better and to leave me alone. Due to a broken family past, I'm not a family oriented person, and do not see the importance of family gathering or any of that, and my trust issues go through the roof when she does this family function bs...

I'm old school and believe my relationship should be based on old school morals, rather than this confusing and destructive moral set we see today... I believe in old school teamwork and stability, the man should provide and protect while the woman cooks and cleans... I believe the only family we need to focus on is ours and building it... Instead, she is interested in drinking, slumber parties, and get togethers with these women who not only do not like me, but also women that I do not trust and as far as I'm concerned and learned, birds of a feather flock together...

Her on the other hand, does not have a clue what that means and fights, argues, plays victim, and gives me a guilt trip when I try to get her on board with this... She says I'm controlling, but when we first met, I told her bluntly about my condition, symptoms, and where it all comes from... I figured we had that understanding and she would support me... However, just like a lot of women I tell this too, at first it was all support, but in the end I'm a monster or controlling...

Recently, my relationships go for 1-2 years before im fed up with repeating myself, my concerns, my issues, and reminding my condition is chronic and the only way to better it is from real support. I feel like I'm constantly punching myself in the face and giving myself triggering flashbacks when I do that...It's like you tell someone you have PTSD, and now they think your stupid... 


Maybe I am controlling... If I am its for the right reason as far as Im concerned...I don't ask her to do anything illegal or immoral...

This relationship has been going on 1 year and 6 months just like this, and I'm ready to call it quits and just focus on bettering myself to be better for someone else in the future...

But when I try to move on, she either uses suicide or pregnancy as a way to stay in the picture...and honestly the girl needs help and guidance and I try to give her that, but after 1 year and 6 months of trying, constantly repeating myself, and fighting over it, I'm tired of trying to help someone who can't help themselves or don't want the help...especially while I'm struggling trying to help myself to better health...

I told her she is contributing to my PTSD and thats the opposite of what I'm looking for from anybody at this point in my life..."
Just wondering if this is actually valid enough to have exacerbated my ptsd,1,mjnurb,2,"After years of yourself being threatened with someone else committing suicide, and them bringing a gun in the house to make their threats more powerful, would someone attempting to kill themselves in front of you and play dead for thirty ish minutes cause a trauma reaction?  I've spent this whole week in a trauma reaction, and i just want to know if by remembering this am i overeacting to what happened?  I was young and they had previously made me swear not to call their dad or the cops in that situation and I had never been in that situation before, (I'd been threatened thoroughly but I've never seen someone die, fake or not) I jusy thought they were dead and panicked and didn't know what to do.  I was very young and very stupid I thought I couldn't break their loyalty or it would make things worse for them.  

They were obviously fine and had been faking being dead afterwards.  But they let me sit there and bawl and panic over what happened while they pretended to be dead.  Thinking back on it, and knowing what I know now, there was no way they could've been injured especially not fatally or to make them lose consciousness.  I've done the same to myself in attempts after seeing this, it won't even put you to sleep.  So i know they were playing dead.  Would this cause a trauma response in someone?  Even years later? 

I've been having to barricade my doors at night.  This is not the only thing they've done just the latest my brain has started to remember.  I just want to know if I'm overreacting.  I really felt like I watched someone die that night and I'm sorry, I was just frozen.  I was young and I didn't know what to do after making all those promises.  I vaguely remember calling their dad but idk if that actually happened it's been so buried for so long."
Ptsd freak out,21,mj62po,4,"I just had an outburst because things got to overwhelming and I'm super embarrassed.  I normally can handle myself well and remove myself when I feel like things are gonna trigger me but I have rare times I just can't.  They usually happen when I am alone but sometimes they happen in front of my bf, I'm guessing because we have a very close relationship and I can let my guard down.  The thing is, idk how to communicate what just happened or explain to him why I freaked out cause the reason seems so fucken stupid and I just acted like a two year old who didn't get the chocolate bar and threw shit and themselves on the ground. I'm super embarrassed and scared to come out of our room and go talk to him."
"Why does my mother not believe me, my psychiatrist, or my therapist when they diagnosed me with PTSD?",22,mj5mfx,21,"Not going to get into my past experiences, but my mother doesn't believe my doctors and mental health team when they diagnosed me with PTSD. My mother says that since I was never in war I cannot have PTSD. What should I do or tell my mother?"
Wondering if anyone else goes mute like this?,6,mjcza9,3,"It tends to happen when I'm out in public. I have really bad anxiety linked to ptsd and I'm not great in social situations, so I tend to get overwhelmed really easily... But even so, it seems to happen out of nowhere. One minute I'll be feeling mostly fine, if tired and stressed, and a little uncomfortable in public. And the next I'm completely overwhelmed and physically can't talk, and feel so disconnected from everything. I've even had to go as far as to learn basic sign language and teach my fiance basic signs so I can still communicate with him when it happens. And it lasts well after I leave the stressful situation, sometimes hours before I can talk anywhere above even a whisper, again. I'm wondering if anyone else deals with this same thing, if you know what causes it, and if you maybe know any way of limiting it or stopping it?"
I can’t sleep anymore.,7,mjaadm,6,Is anyone else experiencing this? I can’t turn my mind off at all.
do you consider your ptsd a disability?,105,miwp7l,81,"i consider mine to be, as i struggle to function as a person my age should be able to. i have depression and adhd but i feel im less mature and cant function as well as someone my age because of my trauma (its an adhd thing too but still).. well i've asked some other people with ptsd and 2 people said they considered theirs to be"
How do you successfully date?,2,mjgljg,3,"I have hyper vigilance and I can only sleep alone. Lately I've had to deal with guys who get hurt feelings when I don't want to sleep over, don't invite them over my apartment or want to become a part of their life early on, and it makes them think I just want something casual. When a guy doesn't go at my pace I start to resent him and disparage him in my head and sometimes out loud, by accident. I try to explain how I feel to them in a simple way but I'm always scared of over sharing and they just brush me off. They're not really interested in hearing about some random girl's issues. 

Guys ask for Instagram and social media which I don't have and they don't know how to respond when I can't give them my profile. Sometimes a guy from online dating tries to invite me to a party when we barely even met, and I'm so suspicious of people who invite me to parties or to meet their friends. Then when one tiny argument comes up, those same people are willing to throw me out like garbage and never speak to me again. How can they have the audacity to invite me into their life and pretend like they wanted me? I wanted to be open to letting people in again but every time I try it takes too long for them and they become tired of me, I start to resent them for being all the same and I can feel their annoyance with me. It's exhausting trying to be happy around somebody all the time. No one wants to be around a miserable person but I'm not happy when I feel pressured at all. How did you find someone who respects you and your boundaries who you can feel safe around?"
Avoiding a very specific trigger,4,mjajv4,2,One of my triggers is the song that was playing when I regained consciousness during the event that caused my ptsd. I get very anxious when listening to music in the same genre if I haven't made the playlist. I tend to avoid listening to the radio and such. Hearing it triggers major flashbacks for me. I play in a softball league that plays music on big speakers very loudly. The whole time I feel like I'm on the verge af a panic attack worried this song is going to play.  The guy that runs the league is a really nice guy and I think that if I could explain in the right way he would agreed to not play it. I just don't want to get into any details but I feel like he would need to understand that it is more than I just don't like this song. I would rather email him than talk in person.  Does anyone have a suggestion on how to go about wording this?
Complex PTSD Workbook,4,mj910q,17,My therapist recently changed my diagnosis from PTSD to Complex PTSD and recommended that I purchase the Complex PTSD Workbook. Has anyone here used that workbook before? I’d love to hear what your experiences were.
Anyone else super struggle with dissociation?,21,mj1aor,10,"I dissociate insanely badly (to the point I’ve been diagnosed with a dissociative disorder). My friends are used to it at this point, and honestly it was “just a weird idkwhattowritehere thing” until my therapist caught it. Anyone else?"
"Hello, i used to be manic and i waved to strangers on the street but now i’m scared to",2,mjg246,7,"(Hello, I’m also looking for support about ptsd but there’s only the one flair) So long story short i was manic, and the highschool thought i had to go to the hospital to get medicated so my mother tricked me into going, once at the hospital the mental health act was pulled on me and i didn’t go peacefully, so i was tackled and held dow by two RCMP officers and one of them, a fat pig had his knee on my neck and i had to negotiate with him to move his knee from my neck to my head as i was afraid i was gonna die, when i was fighting i was yelling insults at them but with the pathetic mans knee on my neck i could barely talk and breathing was hard, so i had to start saying stuff like “don’t kill me, do you want to kill a 16 year old?” Anyways at first i thought it was the meds i’m now on that was making me more anxious and insecure, but now i’m starting to think it’s the ptsd, maybe i connote being the things i did when i was manic with the trauma from the police incident, i used to think i was unbeatable and then i got beaten, and maybe that’s why my confidence is gone, i used to explain that i was trying to build community when the strangers on my block would respond, but now i don’t feel like i could do that, i miss being manic, also i was never a danger to myself or others, i was just really really happy and confident, and i bet to edgy in my artistic expression, but now i know, god i’m insecure though."
Why am I like this?,65,misppk,19,"I always feel like that nobody understands me and I don't understand anybody. It feels like I have a completely different logic and I see things different. I suffer from PTSD and I wish I could think like everyone else. I feel so dumb, lonely and misunderstood. I'll turn 18 in August and to be honest, I sometimes feel like I'm stuck in the age before I was abused by my ex-step-brother and in the age where my other traumatic events happened. I also sometimes don't feel like myself, sometimes I have like another personality, which doesn't fit to me. I also don't really wanna talk with my therapist about it (I don't know why).
I wish I would be normal and have a normal life.

Thank you for coming to my ted talk"
I feel wrong for feeling better,14,mj0mf7,11,"So I started an antidepressant a few months ago and it really helps. However, it feels weird that I'm starting to feel more apathetic about the trauma. In a weird way it feels like I should have to feel horrible to prove what happened to me was real? I don't know how to explain it. It feels like my brain is like ""oh gee, you don't feel horrible now, so it really must've not been that bad."" My emotional memory is just 75% blah now. Maybe I'm just overthinking it."
Need help/ advice to cope with a year of systematic harassment by my neighbours.,1,mjba84,12,"Hi, I'm here for advice and to hear some thoughts experiences of other's. I hope you can help me with my story.

I try to keep it short to not bother you too long but it won't be a short read. Thank you in advance. 

So I'm living on my own for about a year and a half now. My moving out experience was not the best to this day. My first landlord had driven me into psychotic breakdown. I knew this feeling I had it multiple times during high school and even in middle school. I moved out that day. I then lived on the couch of a friend of mine for 2 months until I found a hippie commune by chance. I lived with them for a month but they hated me. I finally found my first own flat after this month.

My moving in experience was quite pleasant, I thought I would finally have my own home now and can finally rest and get some peace.

Everything was OK until Covid struck and I started to pursue my hobbys because I didn't had to work. It involved manual labour. I was constructing a electrical boat in the basement and some components in my flat.

Turns out my neighbours don't like people who do things and don't live of social welfare. (it is in a low income area). And so two of the people in the house one of them directly under me decided to use their plentiful free time to turn my life into living hell.

One day I got a letter from the neighbour under me which was more of a rant with more expletives than words. Followed by a letter by the landlord saying I should stop making noise. (he accused me of absolutely ridiculous things if never done). Shortly after that I got a letter from the landlord again threatening me with eviction. I was stressed at this point but this freaked me out and put me into a never ending state of fear of being evicted within 2 weeks without warning. This would be terrible in the current housing market. So I lived in fear of this happening from then on to today. 

But wait there is more. 

One evening I was working in my basement when my neighbour under me and his friend came into my basement and threatened me there. They wanted to beat me up and they thew my tools around. They where harassing me to no end and then even a other neighbour a I was friends with and saw the thing happening. They followed me to my car outside and threatened me there also.

I was completely done after that but I but I had to return every day to this place because it was my house after all. I had terrible fear of runnig into them. I stopped looking in the mailbox because I didn't wanna run into them. I didn't left my flat when I knew one of them was in the hallway. 

I noticed the first physical signs of this by sweat and a racing heart while walking to my door. I was looking over my shoulder and only wanted to minimise the time being in the hallways. My heart beats fast only typing this. 

But the worst thing, and that's why I'm turning to this sub is my neighbour under me started punching against his ceiling thereby my floor whenever I did something he didn't like. 

In the beginning I didn't even understand that he did this on purpose. I thought nothing of it, I looked at it as random noise which happens in big complexes. But he didn't stop and soon he was pissing me of. Months of this went by and it went from disturbing me to stressing me. Stressing me hard. I'm at a point now where it ruins my mood multiple days after each incident. 

The most concerning side effects for me is that every time something rumbles, either at work or at home or anywhere and the ground shakes a bit it gives me the same dreadful feeling and it throws me of into a state where I'm just so filled with stress hormones that I need a minute or two just to be functional again. That's where I hope some of you can tell me whether or not this is PTSD typical. 

I'm also starting to measure elevated blood pressure even though I'm super sporty. I also feel tired often and most importantly I'm having trouble concentrating on things. Another thing I can't explain to any doctor is that since this I'm more and more starting to feel unwelcome in my own skin like I'm just remote controlling my own body. Besides that, only little amounts of caffeine and alcohol or any mind altering substance kicks me of my feet. I was pretty tolerant against this in the past. 

I have only a few days ago signed my new leasing contract for my new flat in a single house at small village outside of town. I'm so incredibly happy about this. 

Can some please tell me if the above mentioned symptoms will go away after the move? My doctor performed multiple checks and didn't found anything wrong with me so I think they are related to my experiences and are of psychological nature. Has anyone had similar experience with the symptoms mentioned. 

If you are still with me thank you for reading this far. Please tell me if things are gonna get better once I'm out of there and what I can do to feel better again. I just don't want to be bothered by thoughts about my neighbours anymore. These guys have ruined my mood and my health for every single fucking day since a Year now. 

Thank you"
PTSD nightmares,3,mj559d,2,"So I went to a psych ward back in December because my mental health got terrible. I’m currently in therapy although I do not a have a diagnosis. They are leaning towards c-ptsd but have also mentioned BPD and bipolar 2. I know nightmares are common with ptsd and I was curious if any of you could tell me about your experiences with it. My nightmares lately have been too much to put it simply. They’re all very real feeling and don’t feel like normal nightmares not to mention I don’t dream like normal in these nightmares. I almost always dream in 3rd person and didn’t start dreaming in 1st till these nightmares. They give me that nasty anxious feeling in my stomach and the Adrenaline from fight or flight reflexs. When I wake up I realize it was a dream but I’m always disoriented and have to tell myself who I am, where I’m at and what I’m doing. It’s almost like I have to remember the last 2 years of my life to figure out what just happened."
Looking for something,1,mja257,0,"I (28f) never realized the domestic abuse I witnessed and was apart of as a child (9-17 yrs old) would result in me having PTSD. I was always under the impression I was manic depressive and had anxiety with small bouts of depression. 

I didn’t start addressing my struggle until recently and going to therapy for the last 3 months and being on medication for the last 2 months has been extremely helpful. The initial reason I started going to therapy was I noticed the things that happened to me as a child, those feelings and emotions I experienced I was bringing into my marriage. Not cool. I needed and wanted to get it straight. How do I deal? 

What triggered this? My upstairs neighbors. It’s not a matter of being on the 1st floor, it’s just the shit neighbors who live upstairs from me. The banging around from their toddler, the hard walking mother and the occasional fight with the father are setting off major triggers. I own the condo and bought it about Sept ‘19, these guys moved in Nov ‘20 as renters. Needless to say it’s been a long 5 months. I’ve spoken to my husband about moving - he’s not budging. I can’t blame him or get mad at him. Who knows how long these guys are going to last here? Why give up on an asset for temporary happiness? Which brings me to my next point. 

Happiness is an extremely emotion we strive to live for when in actuality we should be looking for contentment. He says “they aren’t the problem, you need to stop kicking dirt over your problem and start addressing it.” Talk about tough love, but he’s right."
PTSD and the way I think,8,mj0fwh,6,"I found out that PTSD alters your brain physically, if they take scans of your brain before and after your brain is not the same. all I can think about is that I can never be me again and I feel pathetically upset about this. how is it that some part of me wants to act like I was before, but then I can't do it, I can think it but I can't laugh like I used to, I can't crack jokes, I can't hold a conversation? I don't understand who I am anymore? my nightmares haunt me, my wounds feel fresh. I never needed to rely on people before but now I feel so weak, I feel sad for myself and I can't stop feeling this way"
Help My Abusive Parents are Going to Move Close to Me (NEED ADVICE),7,mj1d4w,6,"My hard work finally fucking paid off. I've dealt with multiple mental illnesses, suicide attempts for YEARS due to their abuse. I almost dropped out of high school multiple times, while working full time to support myself and be independent of my abusive parents. I got into a great uni and now am FINALLY moving out. I'm finding a place, a new job and can FINALLY be away from them, and I don't have to live in fear.

However today my mother bragged about how they will be moving soon and my dad pipes in saying the area which is close to me. He says it's not ***that*** close but it sure is as hell is. and I also don't give a shit that ""it's not next door"": i already don't feel safe, and now idk how i ever will. It seems I'll never escape them. I want to scream so badly, and I honestly can't breathe.

I cannot handle working, recovery, school, AND living in close proximity to them; constantly in fear. I need help!! I've considered a restraining order in the past  (after some awful shit that landed me in the hospital) but i don't even know how to start that process.

I don't know what to do please someone comment something because I can't stop freaking out.

**edit:** I forgot to mention that even if i did get a restraining order, my parents would not follow it. They do not give a shit about the law, and my mother doesn't even think she does anything wrong half the time. "
Does this sound like ptsd,3,mj41bh,7,"When someone is falling asleep, just as they transfer into deep sleep but hear explosions, bangs, loud pops, knocks, etc. which wakes them up. This is increased when they are stressed. Also loud sounds like trash trucks in the am makes them wake up almost panicked. Always around 4 am. Truck runs at 4 am, before that their father (who fell often after 2 strokes) would wake up at 4 am, and they would also hear the neighbors phone alarm vibrate up stairs at the same time. This didn’t happen until after basic training. Loud pitched whistles followed by explosions from 9 pm to 6-7 am. Always waking up as they hit deep sleep. Never completed basic."
Need advice on what to do to help someone suffering from PTSD after sexual assault.,3,mj1bo2,7,"So my best friend was sexually assaulted over two years ago, and is still intensely affected by it. Can anyone give me recommendations to help/comfort her? (other than suggesting seeing a therapist, she's already doing that but still having issues) 
Please, I just love her so much and want to do everything I can for her..."
"I feel livid and sad hopeless at the same time,",3,mj30bg,0," 

I could write a book about my life, however to spare the lengthy post

I don't know how to keep being alive. My life has just been one domino effect of bad ever since I was 17, and im 27 now.

I've been in the wrong spaces for such a long time, not intentionally but it's like the first bad situation somehow led to another that led to another. I've had two traumatic relationships in my life, both being with co workers. the 1st was when I was 17/18 years old, fresh in the work world working at a fast food. The guy was 21 and due to low self esteem from being ghosted and then finding out the person then chose another girl to be his gf, right after ghosting me ( we were talking and flirting heavily for about 3 months), I stupidly accepted the advances of a guy who wasn't my type in the first place. He was always very persistent in wanting my attention and when he spoke about how good I look and how special I am, how much better I was than other girls, how he doesn't know how a guy couldn't want me etc. I finally fell for it. We went out for about 4-5 months, and towards the end of it, the truth came out. The mother of his child was pregnant with another child, about 6 months along, so basically when he and I first got together, even before sex happened between us, she was already 2-3 months pregnant. Of course he didn't disclose this until later. I think he said something along the lines of not believing that she was. Although I should've ended it right then and there, it took me a few more weeks to do so because I was attached to him by then and he told me so many lies about him saying my name in his sleep and he loves me etc. etc. he told me there's no such thing as fairytales and that he's no good, and he told me the lies I wanted to hear. This was the first guy I had ever been with not just sexually but ""romantically"", I never had a bf before and I had been so hurt by being rejected from the first guy ( who honestly was like my dream guy at the time, he was in college, kind, large vocabulary, creative and the one I originally thought and hoped would have been my first bf) but the lack of closure of rejecting me made me wonder what did I do wrong, etc. and I beat myself up everyday even until now for ""falling"" for the 2nd guy because he negatively changed my life and he wasn't even my type or someone I was initially into. After we broke up, about a few weeks later, the mother of his child gave birth ( I was aware he had a daughter but being stupid and not in the right mind I believed that he wasn't with the mother in that way it was just co parenting), and she and he started harassing me, calling me, texting me, etc. it was awful. Right before that started, about a week prior and maybe like 3 weeks after we broke up, I had found out I contracted an STD from him. To my knowledge a condom was always used but I guess it didn't matter. Being blindsided by that, then being harassed and cursed out by both of them, all while still working at that toxic job and trying to finish up my 2nd semester of college, was unbelievably hard. I spent about two months dealing with that on and off until I was able to find a new job and quit immediately. I didn't think it would get worse, so when the first curse out happened, I didn't quit because I thought that was it. But it continued even though I never provoked back... never opened my mouth to argue back because I realized arguing back with someone like that is like talking to a wall. Maybe my lack of arguing back made them more upset so two weeks later, it happened again etc. After I quit, he did contact me again one more time two months later out of the blue to curse me out. I had his number blocked from months prior but for some reason you're able to still get voicemails.... Out of curiosity I listened and I'm like you're the desperate to get the heat of yourself that you're going to say you never wanted me and that I'm basically some hoe who had nothing better to do... I haven't heard from him since but there's more to write. That one year of my life working there I'm still in shock to it to this day. And that was the start of the spiral."
I can’t figure out how to make friends?,3,mj2wfr,1,"I wish my flair could be the shrug emoji

Anyway
I know people that I want to be friends with
And like we are
But aaaaanytime anyone tries asking about my life I kind of shut it down reeeaaal quick. Not intentionally either, just like I manage to totally redirect every time without even thinking about it. Defense mechanism? Perhaps?
OR
I put a lot of effort into getting to know someone and they just don’t pay me any mind at all so then I’m like... sad? Because they don’t want to know me?
But also I’d probably shut them down anyway so it shouldn’t matter?
But then I’m just cycling in loneliness 

So I know a lot of people but nobody knows me
And I don’t know if I’m okay with that lmao

Does anyone relate? Or like... know what to do with this kind of feeling? It catches me off guard every time"
"New here, really mixed feelings. Does it ever go away?",3,mj1efw,2,"Just recently diagnosed with PTSD due to known (and some previously unknown) repeated childhood trauma. I was smoking weed for a really long time to numb everything, then got diagnosed with CHS, had to quit, and I wasn’t fully realizing what I was numbing. I thought PTSD was just for veterans who’ve gone to war. I didn’t think that what I was experiencing was classic PTSD. I’ve been experiencing symptoms since I was 12, that I can remember anyway. Caused a lot of issues in my teenage years and young adulthood. Got addicted to all sorts of substances to make it go away. Recently sober and all of it came back and it’s just really been a rough trip. I just don’t really know where to go from here. 

Does it ever get better? Does it ever go away? I just get so angry out of nowhere for what seems like no reason. I’ve had a hard time identifying my triggers with my therapist. He says it goes away mostly eventually but idk, looking for anecdotal experiences. I’m just so confused and frustrated and just trying to learn as much as I can"
Can you have PTSD if you don't remember?,7,miuhof,18,Okay I'm going to keep this short and simple. There was an incident in which I was assaulted but don't remember. I know I was assaulted because I was found in the street covered in blood and had to go to the hospital. Can you have PTSD from an assault that resulted in a TBI and therefore have no memory?
Over time,2,mj18we,0,In 2013 I was in an accident involving an SUV and a train. A friend of mine was killed and in 2016 I really felt like I was good. I felt like I had recovered just fine. Mentally and physically. Starting in 2019 the troubles came back. At times worse then they were. The night terrors are real. The feeling of doom. I think that’s how I’d describe it. It’s back and it’s worse. I have no clue why 7 years later I’m actually having more trouble than I did just a few years after the accident.
What would you do?,1,mj2dy1,1,"I was diagnosed about a week ago now, and understanding that I have PTSD has made me realize why certain things trigger me. 

Tonight I was out with a friend, and she’s a bit of a hot head lol. Someone yelled at her while we driving and she slammed the vehicle in park and tried to get out and go confront the person. My abuser used to do this, and when I looked at her - all I could see was him. Out of reaction, I grabbed her and begged her to stay in the vehicle. After we were away from the situation, I started sobbing and aggressively cracking my knuckles/rubbing my hands (this is what I do when I’m uncomfortable). I don’t think she understands the way these situations cause flashbacks and triggers. 

How do I have a conversation with her about this? I don’t want to get in a fight with her, but I want to her to know why I got upset so quick. It find it embarrassing to talk to someone about these things, and I don’t want it to be. 

Any suggestions?"
Do I have PTSD?,1,mj2ctb,3,"For some context, I'm 16 about to turn 17. I feel like I had an alright childhood for the most part. My dad wasn't around, I haven't seen him in about 6 months, and I only see him a few times a year because he's addicted to crack cocaine. My whole life I thought his name was X, but turns out it was Y when I looked at my birth certificate at 14.

I live in a tough neighborhood. I have had more than 10 of my good friends/aqquaintenc's die from gun violence, my family has been shot at, my house has been shot up more times than I can remember. I think it was the 2nd time that I had gotten up from bed to get something out of my closet, then I heard shots that I thought were coming from the distance, then they turned into loud blasts and a bullet went through the spot where I was standing at where if I was right there, it would've hit my head/neck.

I think the worst one was when I was sitting in my living room reading malcom x, and my mom came in to talk to me. She moved from the spot she was standing at in front of the door, and not even 5 secs later, my door was hit with an ak-47 from close range, flying straight through the door, hitting my water heater so we had no hot water for a good 4 months, we're lucky that only a piece of something hit me in the arm only to scratch me. 

I can't sleep at night. I'm always thinking about one of my best friends, who wasn't gang affiliated or anything, who got killed by people who were in his house. I have had times where I stayed awake for more than 48+ hours. I went to sleep at 12:30 in the am yesterday, only to wake up 2 hours later due to nightmares. 

I've had nightmares since I was 10 that had a countdown, yes, a countdown. It would start from 10 counting down, the numbers huge with a flashy background. Most of the time I couldn't wake myself up before the countdown went off, which would result in some of the most goriest things I didn't know where possible to even think of. They've come back worse than ever.

I don't usually believe in online tests, but I've taken more than probably 50 tests which all say I am at high risk for PTSD. 

I have had a few gfs in my life, the last one broke up with me because in her words, I was too emotionally withdrawn. I wish I had a better social understanding of ppl to start a conversation, or in terms that ppl around me would say, ""shoot my shot"", but I just can't bring myself too. Every gf I've ever had asked me out, I've never initiated anything in my life.

I am on probation for shit that I don't really feel safe talking about, but I will say that the police that came said they found a pound of something, but when I got out of juvenile and went to court, my judge found out that the charge wasn't put in what he read my case file out of. We've never actually seen what they found, my mom requested body cam footage which they never gave, and that has really taken away from me what shred of justice I thought my community could ever receive.

My birthday s in like a month, but I really don't have the motivation to do anything for it. I just want to stay in my room with my thoughts most of the time anyway. I don't think I will ever be the same, jovial kid I used to be. Ever since I got out of elementary I wasn't good in school.

I could say a lot more but idk. I just don't. I don't know what I want anymore. Everytime something looks like it s gonna be a little fine, something happens. I'm tired of looking at the national gun violence memorial, news, and shit everyday just to see if someone I love or have had some kind of relationship I had with die. 

I went to one my closest friends funeral, and I couldn't even look at his body. I knew he wouldn't look the same."
Tired of being told that my trauma is going to teach me so much/help me make the world a better place,213,mi5uro,63,"I’m so TIRED of people telling me that I should be appreciative of the lessons I’ve gained through my trauma. I’m tired of being told that one day I will help make the world a better place with everything I’ve learned. And I’m tired of being told that the universe challenged me with this to test my strength (????)

Right now, I just want to live normally without PTSD and all its whack symptoms breathing down my neck every minute of the day. 

If someone wants to use their trauma to create something inspiring and powerful, that is amazing, and maybe one day I’ll want to do that, but it should always be a choice. It shouldn’t feel mandatory; we don’t owe anyone anything."
"Bad health after leaving an abusive partner, PTSD?",19,mih71d,16,"Hello, I don't know anything about PTSD, but a friend of mine has talked about that, she thinks that all my physical symptoms are maybe linked to my past relationship. Sorry, I'm not a native english speaker.
So, I met this guy, he was my neighbor, we felt an intense connection directly. He tried to understand me, he was so lovely. But then he became really weird, I was not myself anymore, I was his property, I coudn't wear what I wanted, couldn't think a certain way. One day I was the purest angel on earth and the other day I was the worst piece of shit of humanity. Those were his words. But I stayed, because I thought he was right about me, that I can't live without him, that I'm crazy. I was gaslighted for six years by my ex partner. And I realize all of this only since the begginning of the year, thanks to my therapist. I left him last November. My health was not good last year, especially when the lockdown came. I was stuck with him. I was constantly feeling a pressure in my back, stomach. I was losing appetite and weight. Since I left him, I feel calm and I feel pretty. I know what I want. I know that I deserve better. I finally know that I didn't deserve that and that's not my fault. But my physical health is terrible. I have ZERO energy, ZERO endurance. I have so heavy acid reflux, sometimes it can be like that an entire day. I feel something stuck in my throat constantly. I see a doctor every week, I tried medication, strict diet, meditation...What is weird is that I'm not feeling anxious that much. Even if sometimes I cry and I'm fed up with my loneliness. I feel psychologicaly better than when I was with my ex. But my body is stuck. I can't breathe well. I can't sing anymore. And sometimes I will have these nightmares of someone that want to poison me, or to suck my blood...I cannot see his face, but tonight I felt so bad in my stomach, can't breathe and I saw my ex's face in my dream. I don't think of him that much during the day. But it feels like my body and my nightmares are talking ? Are all my physical pain linked to that traumatic past? I feel so stuck..."
"Carbs trigger flashbacks, nightmares and anxiety ?",5,mih9xm,4,"⚠️ As it was pointed out to me, this post might be triggering to those with ED


Hey, 

So i noticed something pretty damning for me that I want to share. English isn't my language so bear with me.

Carbs have been my main (if not only) source of food for years.
2 months ago, I did a long term fast for a few days, and noticed very encouraging results on my ptsd symptoms such as nightmares, flashbacks and anxiety. They weren't completely gone but wayyy toned down and actually manageable. Then when i started eating again, i focused on healthy food, fibers, healthy fats proteins and the improvements i had noticed were still there.
A couple weeks later, I had a slip up and started eating junk food again. Bam, the anxiety and flashbacks came back with a vengeance.
Did another prolonged fast, which calmed the symptoms a bit, then immediately started eating a diet mostly consisting of bread and cheese (i am a frenchie after all). You guessed it, symptoms came back like crazy.
So I did a third 4 days fast again, ate healthy again, symptoms gone.
Just yesterday, i had a binge of junk food and now i'm feeling like shit, flashbacks won't leave me alone.

Doing research, I couldn't find any study or evidence of the correlation between a high carb diet and ptsd/cptsd although there's a link between it and symptoms of depression/anxiety. 

But from my short term experience, the correlation is pretty damning. It's obviously not a miracle cure, nothing is, but it is really a huge difference.
My symptoms can be very much debilitating and with fasting or low carb diet, they are very much manageable.

I really suggest all of you to try avoiding carbs for a week and please if you do, share your results.

**tl;dr** : Carbohydrates might play an important role in cptsd/ptsd symptoms and avoiding them, in my experience, alleviate those symptoms greatly while high carb diet makes them worst."
When life is a trigger,16,miblmo,27,"After some journaling, I have ask myself; how can I heal in an environment like this? Where, no matter how hard you avoid it, brutality and violence and pain is a constant; where mass murders are committed almost daily that require us to constantly be on guard and looking for an escape route? When every single time we look at our phones, or tv, or go to any public place with the news running constantly showing nothing but terrible things? When real life is literally nightmare fuel and the injustice and pain and turmoil of the world is just fucking icing on my already fucked up cake. 

I can’t go to the grocery without paying attention to the exit signs and making an alternate route to get out. I am constantly making a contingency plan in my head of what I’d do if shit went down at any moment. 

My PTSD is already moderate but the society we live in amplifies it. I don’t feel safe in my mind and I don’t feel safe in the world. 

It’s not as easy as just turning off the phone or tv. It’s everywhere. Plus, being informed and aware of major issues is important to me as a person so I don’t want to tune completely out. 

Is healing possible in such a sick society?? :/"
is survivors guilt really PTSD? or am i just overthinking my trauma,5,mif37u,5,.
"Tomorrow is my ""trauma anniversary"" and I really need some tips and tricks. cn: rape",16,mi8b2j,7,"I was raped three years ago and tomorrow is the day. Even now I feel so nauseous and my anxiety is through the roof. I don't really know what to do. Is it better to distract myself or just let it be and accept that this will be a bad day? My ptsd got so much better after a lot of therapy and a fair share of antidepressants. I know how to cope, in general. But to be honest, I don't really know what to do. I'm lost."
I’m SICK of avoiding things because of my triggers,9,miae0q,2,"There’s a new show that came out that’s been highly recommend for me to watch. It has amazing ratings and people around me can’t stop talking about it. Naturally, I’m interested. But guess what? The show is about suicide, which is my biggest trigger. Now I can’t watch it, because I know if I do, I’ll be setting myself up to have a major issue. It sucks not to be able to enjoy things because of your PTSD. So many times I’ve wanted to watch a movie, read a book, etc. but couldn’t because of my triggers. It’s horrible to avoid these things even though they pose no actual threat, and I know that. But I also know that I can’t control how my brain reacts to certain themes and stimuli. I hate having to alter my life for such a stupid reason. I’m so sick of having to sacrifice enjoyment for avoidance."
Anyone else terrified of April fool’s day?,46,mhzl62,2,I’m absolutely terrified of surprises and change. No one better pull a “prank” on me today... it’s not funny when you have PTSD.
Tired of fighting my triggers,5,mib0t1,1,Does anyone else just get to a point in therapy where you just feel like “this is it”? Sometimes I feel like there is nothing I can do to move past what happened to me. I made progress in therapy 4 years ago and then made some last year- but I am still so affected that I don’t think I’ll ever totally move forward. It can be so exhausting to explain it to people in my life and I find myself that isolating and just dealing with things on my own is the best way for me to cope.
"Thought I was progressing, then the nightmares came back",29,mi0r32,3,"TW: sexual assault and abuse

I've been getting help for my PTSD for about 2 months now. At first I thought ""wow I'm so proud that I'm making progress and can do normal things throughout the day without going in and out"" ""things really do get better""

Then life went ""oh, you really thought that? hahahahaha""

Because although the days were starting to settle, the nights were getting worse. I can't tell if I'm dreaming or having a nightmare, and I mean full-on reenactments of what happened. What he did. Repeated moments of terror, repeated again, and again, and again in a single dream. I could feel the hot liquid that was poured on me, the pain he made me feel as he watched, the powerlessness all over again. I'm waking up every single hour of the night. 

These other realities had cockroaches flying into my bed and engulfing me from inside out, the other ones were me being intimate with my boyfriend, until he suddenly morphs into my rapist. I've had dreams of glass being used to carve out my spine while I could feel all of it. The other ones are just me watching myself sleep from the corner of my room. In every dream, I beg to die. 

I feel pathetic, and I'm pissed that I feel pathetic. But the good news is I'm pissed off instead of sad, so I've got some more energy to face this bullshit and have my life back. Fuck you PTSD, fuck you insomnia."

Diagnosis: PTSD,14,mi3wxa,2,"Hi everyone. New here. I recently had a neuropsychological evaluation for what I went into thinking I have ADD/ADHD and came out with PTSD. It crushed me like a can on recycling day. The last couple of days I felt like I was sitting at the edge of what I call ""the black hole"". Teetering on falling into deep depression (diagnosed also + anxiety). 

I went through a lot of emotions from rage, crying, laughing, feeling like a joke, pissed off.. I rather the doctor had said I have nothing then tell me I have PTSD. My brother, after coming home from 2 very long tours, he has PTSD. I shouldn't be told I have PTSD. I have not experienced anything close to what he experienced or any severe trauma related situation. I was super close to just canceling all of my doctors. 

I took a day and half off from work. Couldn't get my mind or my body to feel like it could get through the day. I took the day to rethink all of this. How the doctor got to that conclusion. Finding out more about PTSD. That it can be experienced by all sorts of people not specific to Military or severe trauma. 

Saw the psychiatrist today. She is going to help me find a new therapist as the last one was more focused on ADHD. I explained my feelings around the diagnosis and I'm glad she understands I'm confused but willing to work on whatever I can to feel better. 

In case your wondering why confused, it's because I went in thinking my actions/reactions were very closely related to ADD/ADHD. Now, I'm thinking ""well now you have to get to know yourself and deep dive to find out who this person is."" There are things deep, buried, not thought of for a very long time inside of me, but I feel better. I feel better I have a diagnosis, something to work with and hopefully heal from.   

Thank you 😁"
Alcohol and PTSD?,19,mi1806,45,"If you're using alcohol to just relax like 2-3 times a week, isn't it okay to drink alcohol while undergoing PTSD therapy?

I got a call from my psychiatrist earlier today and they said they won't be able to start PTSD treatment unless I stop drinking since it interferes with the therapy somehow. I asked how and she said it messes with the memory forming procedure. I didn't talk further since then I'd be labeled a suspected alcoholic.

As for why I drink, I simply love it. I just really enjoy drinking and not caring for a while. My mind is always at 100% and it's tiring so 2-3 times a week, I drink like 3 malt liquors and just play videogames which I can't otherwise since I feel guilty for playing videogames and I do need to do that to distract my mind.

The moment she said it, I felt annoyed because now I would probably put a strain on my daily life as I tend to get more and more aggressive because of my mind being overactive and I don't really want that. I also don't want any medication they could offer since it always makes things worse for me.

Sorry if it all sounds incoherent together but I am feeling weird about it. I guess I'm asking you people since I would like to know some more reasoning behind it."
I have ptsd from an online controversy i had to deal with how do i forget or move on?,1,migd3w,3,"ive had to deal with a minor but very personal controversy that whenever i think about it makes me feel scared, miserable, depressed and filled with regret and despair. i feel like even after separating myself from it from them i cannot escape, i get a horrible feeling in my chest my spine and gut like a cold unsettling feeling whenever i recall or see pictures or hear someone talk about the person i have attempted to forget about. i am convinced i have PTSD and although it isn't PTSD of something like war or an attempted murder on my life it still greatly effects me and im scared it will haunt me for the rest of my life. my hands are shaking and trembling just typing this post. ive tried to forget and remove any means of hearing reference from them But it isn't working for me how do i stop this PTSD induced nightmare im living in how do I forget and move on!?!"
Holidays are the worst,3,mi9vzf,2,"My PTSD is related to being abused in my childhood. I was pretty much being abused as long as I can remember but there was a time where it wasn’t that bad and I also didn’t realize it was wrong so I was fairly happy and enjoyed holidays like any other kid. Now every single holiday I’m just reminded about how I don’t have the family I once thought I had. And I just get flooded with painful memories. I feel so alone. 

I have a civil relationship with my mom even though she did a lot of really fucked up things. And on a day to day basis I am able to interact with her and see her and feel totally fine and even *good* about it. I don’t hate her. She was a victim of abuse herself and I don’t forgive her for the things she did but she isn’t an evil person. 

But on holidays it pains me to see her. I feel kind of bitter? I’m supposed to go to her house for a family dinner on Easter and it’s a few days away and I’m just a wreck. I bailed on all of the holidays last year except Christmas and on Christmas after everyone left her and I both ended up crying. Even though she’s part of my pain, she also went through the same thing as me so we’re kinda in the same position. It really hurts her when I bail on holidays and I feel extremely guilty. But I’m really not doing well mentally right now and I don’t know if I can go through with it. 

I don’t know what to do. I want to just tell her the truth and tell her how terribly I’m doing but I don’t think she’ll get it and just be mad at me and when she’s mad at me I can’t handle it because I feel like I’m back in the times when she was mad and drunk and crazy. So I feel like I have to come up with a lie but I don’t want to lie and it bothers me that telling the truth which is that I’m a fucking broken ass person will anger her. I hate being someone that’s unreliable and bails but fuck I’m sorry I just can’t deal. I hate when people get mad at me for being shitty I KNOW I’m shitty and I already feel like shit about it, you know?"

The rubber band Technique,1,mifuds,1,"I found a way that might help hopefully get a rubber band and put it around your wrist like a wristband now when you get a ptsd attack lift up the rubber band and let go and let it slap you.

I cannot tell you about how I feel absolutely worthless, about how I push people away and how I am hurting my wife.

What to do when people don’t understand your PTSD,3,mi8wuz,1,"Long post warning...lol

First time posting anything here...so here it goes. I am a child abuse survivor who came from a home where my dad was an abusive alcoholic. When my mom and I left my dad we went to live with my granny. Eventually my mom succumbed to the pressure of being a working single mother who was in and out of court (with dad) and became addicted to crack/pills. As you can imagine my granny and my other grandparents(dad’s parents) ended up taking care of me. 

I ended up having a successful run during my teenage years and college years and I thought the worst was behind me. Fast forward to the present, now that I am an adult my PTSD has reared it’s ugly head. I’ve had hard times holding jobs and fostering relationships with those outside my circle of close friends. 

Now I’m in a position where I work for a very conservative government organization, and my PTSD symptoms interfere with my interactions with contentious people and controversial issues. Recently I have had panic attacks where I have locked up in situations where I could have easily been in control of. Currently my boss has been understanding of my PTSD but he’s the type of person that his mood depends on the day. I began seeing a psychiatrist for medication when my job performance began to slip up. My PTSD improved for about 6 months but I’m beginning to regress. 

I am about to start therapy to begin to work through my trauma. My boss has recently told me that if my performance begins to slip and they will begin the process to terminate me (saying ADA reasonable accommodations are becoming a burden to the organization). 

What can I do to make him understand what I’m going through? He’s the type of person that if my PTSD was caused by combat there would be no issue, however it’s caused by child abuse so I should have just got over it a long time ago...ugh rant over."
Does my ex hate me now or forgot I exist?,2,mi9ra6,0,"My addict ex and I were together for 6 months during which he asked me to marry him. But he was trauma bonded/addicted to his ex. They’re both drug addicts and he’s an alcoholic as well. Up until a few days before we broke up (when I began seeing signs of being devalued), he was as loving as usual. But I also started noticing signs of him relapsing back to her. Long story short, we ended up in a huge dramatic mess and they got back together. He hasn’t hoovered me this time like before. Does that mean he probably hates me now?"

How can I work with PTSD,15,mhsben,9,"A trigger for me is feeling like I'm going to be attacked. It's hard for me to be alone with men I don't know or be alone closing up at work. My job requires me to sometimes go to people's homes. I don't know until I get there what the people will be like (I talk to them on the phone and get a sense first, but you never know). I've showed up a couple of times to houses in which single men lived or there was supposed to be a couple and the wife was too busy to be there. If I didn't do this I'd have to be in a shop and closing up late at night alone. I stay up at night dreading work when I have one of these triggers. The benefit is this job is pretty flexible and I am able to set my schedule a lot which help deal with PTSD, but my job is also the source of a lot of triggers. Is there any way I can get through this? Getting another job right now wouldn't be a feasible option. I'm in therapy but I feel that I'm at the tip of the iceberg of recovery. I also feel like I'm letting my coworkers down because I'm not performing well when I am working. Should I talk to my boss about this? I'm a contract employee at a small business. Benefit is the boss really cares about employees, but I'm not sure how I can reconcile this."
I got my therapy workbook for PTSD today!,7,mhwxp6,0,I had ordered 2 therapy workbooks from amazon and one of them arrived today.

Reminders of trauma causing sleep crying and sleep talking?,99,mh5ugx,25,"I’ve had a few traumatic events in my life and over the past year. This week has been hard because I’ve had to address and speak about a lot of them. I feel like I am managing fine but my partner has told me that I have been crying in my sleep and talking a lot. I have no recollection of the dreams or crying or talking in my sleep but am exhausted at the end of the day and wake up very tired. 

I don’t usually talk in my sleep or cry and have had one occurrence of me hysterically laughing myself awake and one occurrence of me getting up and standing at the side of my bed while I was asleep. These are rare and happen in clusters and then disappear for months. 

Does anyone else who have experienced trauma and/or other mood disorders (I am also bipolar) experience sleep disturbances after a traumatic event or when they are reminded of these events?"
Trauma surrounding sexuality and my girlfriend,1,mhvqap,4,"TL/DR how do I come to terms with my girlfriends questioning sexuality? 

Together since Sep. 2018, known each other since 2011. So this isn’t an issue in terms of sexuality for her (21F) she is free to be herself obviously but I (21M) can’t seem to come to terms with the intimidation I feel from her not being straight; it stems from a fear it feels like. Nobody is fully straight whatsoever, I think it may be caused by thinking about her having some spontaneous experimental experience behind my back because of how “unsure” she is about how she feels about women exactly.

 I just hate that I have such mental chatter and clutter when we talk about her questioning sexuality and I definitely get triggered by it; but wtf? My mother wound is not healed but I’m just having a hard time understanding myself with this situation."
Not sure if this therapist is the right one for me?,15,mhi0sw,6,"I feel pretty confused and lost after my meeting with my therapist today. I started therapy last September because I lost my partner last May and I was in such a bad state that I thought I'd need to do something and seek professional help. 

It's not my first therapy, I had two before because of anxiety disorder and depression. Now this therapist diagnosed me with PTSD. I was sexually abused as a child and lost already three of my closest family members, so the loss of my partner triggered the worst of the worst in me. 

Today for the first time I wanted to talk about my childhood abuse and my therapist just told me I was very past focused mentally and canceled this topic. Another time when I wanted to talk about my grief he told me to look to my past and try to find out where I felt similar when I was younger. 

I just find this so confusing. It's the second time I try to open up to a therapist (didn't talk about the abuse in my first therapy) but it seems like this topic gets avoided. I brought this topic up today because I had a dream of the person who abused me three nights ago and this lead me to experience flashbacks and sleepless nights afterwards. I'm also feeling quite tired honestly on the thought of fighting to get heard by a therapist when it's already very hard to talk about this to anyone at all and I'm just not sure what to do now. I'd appreciate any advice."
Stalked,6,mhnc9o,6,"Hey all!

So I was stalked from the time I was 13 until I was 24 and moved away. I have no idea who the person was. He just like to watch me, he would knock on my window or throw rocks. If the window was open I would hear him breathing. A few times he came into the house, once when I was home and in the shower but I only heard him I didn't see him. I'm fairly certain he used to steal my underwear and hair brushes as those things were always going missing. So now it's been 10 years since it's stopped and I'm still terrified. Especially at night and when I'm alone. I feel exhausted. I'm mad and upset at a person out there who I don't even know for doing this to me. Everyone acts like I should just get over it and like I'm being dramatic for still having fear. Idk what to do, I know it's a long shot but has a anyone else experienced something similar? If so, what did you do to feel more secure and to feel safe again? Thanks for reading 😊"

I have a therapist and she’s helping a ton and a supportive girlfriend but I’ve been having constant episodes for a week now. No one knows it’s going on. I haven’t slept in 3 days. I haven’t ate much. All I can do is fight the demons off. I feel worthless. My safety in the world was broken and I’ve been trying to fix it but it doesn’t seem to work.

"Non-con fantasies after assault (TW: SA, kink, self hate)",6,mhgacu,4,"I know that some survivors feel ptsd, some feel hypersexual compulsions, and many people feel both. I'm kind of headed that route.

I'm actually less kinky and sexual now then I've ever been though.  I was sexually active a lot after some sexual assaults I'd experienced as a child growing up.  I was down to explore things but ""rapeplay"" was a hard boundary I couldn't cross.  Anything too close to it would upset me.  I was into playful wrestling, pain, and consenting power struggle play -  not rape play.  Ever.  It made me sick

That changed when I was violently raped walking home.  Sexual interest has become more vanilla and gentle in the kind of things I like now.  More than ever I want validation, eye contact, body being worshipped - romantic sex.  Kink has lost most interest for me and my pain tolerance dropped dramatically due to ptsd causing me a LOT of health issues.  I am preferring the more romantic and gentle parts of sex now more than ever.  My partner has depression and my other two partners are separate from me due to Covid so I barely have it anymore, 

BUT this doesn't apply to porn.  I almost only get off to rape porn now.  And get turned off when she is written to start liking it at some point.  I only get off if it to be violent throughout.  And I'm not even fully comprehending it when I'm reading the hentai or watching the gruesome scenes.  I'm not imagining what happened to me or even what is happening in front of me.  Just numbly getting off with no thoughts during at all.  Just numbness and disassociation from every feeling except barely registering the porn itself and how my vag feels.  If I feel anything during it is usually disgust.  Sometimes anger if something shitty is said toward the victim in the work (which is ridiculous all things considered) or if I DO think about feelings of my own attack it is the fear and pain (when that happens I get teary eyed while I get off).

I have no interest in playing out the fantasy with anyone though.  Even some kink has become off limits now that I used to like.  So exploring this more physically isn't an interest for me.

I feel gross.  I KNOW this is normal.  I logically do.  But I still don't even feel right bringing it up to my therapist yet since I don't even know how to begin to answer her questions on how I feel about it or during.  It is numb.  It makes no sense.  It isn't like when I used to get off to old memories with former flames or imagining the exciting first times with my partners.  These ""fantasies"" are just how I masturbate now.  It has become a physical need and a chore instead of an enjoyable stress relief like masturbation used to be for me.  One more thing that bastard took from me that night.

And on top of it all I barely like touching my genitals anymore since I feel ugly to myself now so it is back to wrapping my legs around one another and doing a humping motion to get off like I did when I was like 8 or some shit.  It feels silly and Ii fucking hate myself"
Explaining your triggers after you've already blown up at someone.,6,mhf67v,7,"Hi everyone, 

I had a fight with my bf last week where I got triggered and attacked him verbally. We've only been dating for seven months. It was our first real argument I was drunk and waaaaay out of line. I had a hard month and I was coping by drinking and hiding that from everyone else (I know, if I drink when I'm sad, I'm gonna have a bad time) I didn't disclose that I was in a lot of pain and I was just trying to make everything perfect  and easy for him and I denied my own needs and feelings in order to do that. We hadn't spoken about triggers or what it looks like when I'm triggered and I'm sure it freaked him out a lot. He still hasn't spoken to me after the fact but I'm hoping he will. 

How have you talked to your SO about your triggers and how you behave when you're triggered? I don't want to seem like I'm excusing my behaviour, I very much take responsibility but I think it would be helpful for him to know that the response was a trigger response and that is why I was so forceful and mean. Then he would know that it wasn't his fault and that I wasn't trying to hurt him. 

It was a big wakeup call for me too. I stopped drinking the next day and immediately started reaching out to friends and family again. The shame I was feeling about things before when I was hiding it is what caused me to stay silent and then blow up in the first place and I'm trying to be less ashamed and more honest about the many dark spots inside. It's fucking hard though. 

So I guess the advice I want is how to navigate this convo with my bf without coming across as making excuses for myself or making him feel bad for saying the thing that triggered me. It is my fault because he didn't know that might happen and I want to convey that."
Feel like my life is in its final chapter (repost from r/depression),19,mh4my0,11,"I just don’t know anymore

I have severe clinical depression, PTSD, my kidneys are failing, and my liver is swollen; in other words, I am slowly dying very painfully. Oh and did I mention I suffer from seizures and that I have tremors that are getting worse? I can’t even take anything for the pain because I am a year clean from opiates and want to stay that way. 

I barely get out of bed nowadays, I just lay on my bed on my phone, or on my laptop. I fight feelings of suicide daily, I think about it all and how I could end my mental and physical pain; but I could never put my family through that. My best friend committed suicide, and I remember how hurt I was and how it affected his mom. The several times I have tried I got “lucky” or chickened out.

I see a psychiatrist but I am unable to tell her what most of my PTSD stems from as they were illegal and she would be required by law tell the police. Although she does help with my other issues. 

I feel worthless, I have no motivation or reason to keep living; all my closest friends are dead, I barely have any true friends now. Something has got to change. I am numb, I have been conditioned to be emotionless, but I still feel anger and sadness. I have been faking my happiness around my loved ones for so long that I no longer know which fleeting moment’s of happiness are genuine. I don’t know what to do anymore. 

I went to prison for 5 years for selling 9 ounces of coke to an undercover cop in a sting operation. I did/saw things in there that no human should ever witness. It definitely added to my PTSD i have had since I was nine. I have quit selling and using drugs since but I feel like selling drugs was the only thing I was REALLY good at; and now that I have stopped it has left a hole in me. I got kicked out of my house at age 14 and selling drugs is what had supported my brother and I until 2013. I sent my brother through  medical school, paid for my mother’s cancer surgery, bought cars for my brother and I, etc. Besides fighting I feel like selling drugs is the only thing I am truly good at. Alas, I definitely don’t want to catch another case and go back to prison; and I promised my mother that I would quit and that I have done enough for her and my little brother. 

So at this point I have been out of prison for about 2 and a half years. Sometimes, I kind of wish I was still in there for the camaraderie; but then I remember how bad it was in there and change my mind. I hate myself for some of the things I had to do in there. My PTSD is so bad at this point I sleep with a knife, if I could legally own a gun I would definitely be sleeping with that as well. I constantly wake up screaming and my night terrors are so bad that at this point I try not to sleep longer than 3 or 4 hours a night. 

Thanks for reading this/giving me an outlet for this.I don’t really know why I am typing this up nor what I am expecting in return. I just felt a need to type this somewhere and this place has provided me an outlet for it, so thank you."
I feel like my life is falling apart and I really need help,5,mhc41u,0,"Hi

Before I start I want to say I see two therapists, and starting group therapy soon. It doesn’t seem to help but I am still sticking with it because it’s better than nothing.

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD. I had a lot of child trauma (TW)- sexual abuse for 5+ years at a very young age, messy parents divorce and a mentally ill parent, extensive bullying and an eating disorder. 

My problem now is how hard it is to let go of people. I was going through a messy break up and started clinging to my ex boyfriend from high school. Then, the boy I recently broke up with started to “get better” and wants me back and is being nice again. My problem is that neither of them will stay in my life if the other is there. I know it sounds simple to say “just be single and focus on yourself” but I physically do not know how to do that. Any chance to have physical comfort from either I will and do take and I’m lying because I don’t want to lose either of them.

I don’t know what’s going to happen to me. I don’t know how to take care of myself and I’m terrified from the second I wake up in the morning to when I go to sleep. I’m doing therapy and on antidepressants I just don’t know how to let go of either person it’s unimaginable pain to think of losing someone or not having access to someone.

What should I be doing? I feel like I’ve never been in such turmoil or pain. I’m disoriented all the time, stressed, sad and I can’t take being alone. I don’t know what to do and I really really need help"

I don’t feel ok,6,mhbc78,2,"I got physically assaulted last summer.  They tried to rob me which was why they attacked me, but I started screaming for help and eventually as more people came out to help me, the guys who tried to rob me left in their stolen getaway car. They threw me on the ground and everything.  I was so scared they were going to get my house keys and go to my home since they would know my address and now have access so I held onto my purse and phone and  and luckily they didn’t take anything.  But I have never been physically assaulted like that in my life. My arm was badly bruised. They attacked me on a busy street in the middle of the day.  They were really really bold. 

Fast forward to now.  My friends think I have ptsd.  I dunno. I’m scared of everyone and extra jumpy and easily startled.  I jumped at my own shadow the other night. I’m super alert of my environment.  Any group of people, I get anxious around even if it’s out in broad daylight.  I can’t sleep through the night, I’m constantly waking up or I go to bed so late cuz I can’t fall asleep so I’m always tired. I have nightmares frequently. At least 3-4 times a week. I’m scared to leave my apartment sometimes. My stress and anxiety is really bad. 

I went from feeling safe to suddenly not and still not.  I don’t have a sense of safety anymore.

I started talk therapy last summer after my assault but I dunno, I feel like it’s not helping, at all.  According to my friends and boyfriend, I overreact to small things.  I saw a car the other night in front of my house 5 am, driving slowly, stopping in the middle of the street, reversing slowly, stopping for a few mins as though waiting for someone, driving forward, waiting, reversing, waiting, for ten mins up and down the street.  I tried to take a photo of the car in case any crime happened, but my dumb flash was on and I panicked since I was at the window and then I spent all early morning in bed anxious about whoever was in the car and how they’re coming back to hurt me. I know it sounds dumb, even as I’m typing this but I dunno, in that moment, I was in distress.  I’m sure most normal people would have just gone back to bed and not think anything, but because of my thoughts and feelings, they think I have ptsd.  

But my boyfriend thinks I can just snap out of it.  No one seems to understand and then I just sound crazy.  My therapist has been on vacation so I haven’t brought this up to her yet but like I said, I really don’t feel like it’s helping me at all. Sometimes our conversations are just me talking and her agreeing with me and then that’s it.  Like ok, I need something more like homework or something to work on"
Ex boyfriend (that I live with) is deliberately triggering my sexual abuse related PTSD (TW - sexual abuse),32,mh1l4k,8,"My boyfriend essentially coerced me into sex a few weeks ago which ended our relationship, however I’ve been unable to move out so I’m stuck in the house with him. He was very apologetic at first but has gradually turned back to his old self. He will do things like grope me when I’m not expecting it, look up my skirt, be clearly checking me out and looking at my breasts/bum and when I catch him be like ‘sorry I just can’t help but look’. Yesterday was the final straw when I asked him to stop and he said ‘it’s just that outfit on you, it’s so sexy I can’t control myself’. 

He knows I’ve been raped in the past and that I feel uncomfortable in my own skin at the best of times. He knows how this behaviour makes me feel because I’ve told him countless times and even cried in front of him. He always apologised and gives me all of the ‘I hate myself, I always ruin everything’ but it’s like a flip switches in his head when he feels turned on and he loses all respect for me and my boundaries whatsoever. 

I’m pretty sure I’m living with a dangerous man and currently can’t get out because I have very little finances and my parents aren’t the most welcoming of me. 

I’m constantly triggered and I can feel a surge of anger building inside me like I’ve never felt before. I don’t know what to do for myself or how to make this stop apart from sleeping in my car which would mean dropping out of university and leaving my job. I’m so depressed and scared and furious and lost and I wish I could just fly out of my body because I don’t feel safe in it."
He just assumed I wanted to be a housewife. I just got my first job.,54,mgy45f,19,"Early on in our relationship, he asked what my dream job was. He kind of pressured me into saying I wanted to be a housewife, and throughout our relationship, that was just what he pushed on me. That I was going to be a housewife, that I was going to sit alone in the house all day doing nothing except waiting for him to get home. All throughout the relationship, it felt like he was pushing me to be dependent on him. Well, it isn’t much, just a part time position at a camp in town, but I got my first job. He made me think I wouldn’t be able to, that I would be dependent on him forever. I feel like I’m taking a step in the right direction."

Fear of trauma therapy,3,mh617z,9,"Hello. About 2 a 3 months ago i got the diagnosis of PTSD. I’ve had it for a while now. I really want to get rid of it, but i have a big problem with opening up, about basically everything around my trauma. Also with talking about feelings. Lately i have big trouble with doing to most normal things. I was inpatient when i got the diagnoses and my therapist there said i could (and should) do intensive trauma therapy. No mention of EMDR. My biggest problem, fear for this therapy. I feel like i really cannot do this, because i have this big problem with opening up. And what if the therapy doesn’t even work?

Did anyone here ever experienced this? How did you get rid of the fear? Did you do the therapy? Did it work?

When the traumas never stop and you never get a respite,75,mgq1w8,22,"What to do when your lifestory is too heavy to unpack? I would love to know if some of you can relate as I feel very alone in this right now.

I lived through all of the big T and little T traumas listed in the DSM-5. Even my birth was traumatic. From day one, I experienced death, violence, self harm of all kind, easting disorder, insecurity, no emotional support, sexual assault. Live threatening illness, chronic pain, sleep disorders, extreme loneliness. Loss of career. Homelesness. Mental and physical disability. Literal torture at the hands of people I trusted. Undiagnosed ADHD didn't help my self esteem.

I knew pretty early one that I needed to work on myself if I didn't want the trauma to bit me in the ass later in life. But with life going its merry way and traumas never stopping, it would always come a time when I needed to push things under the rug so i could focus on life itself. For exemple, I had to stop EMDR because it made my panic attacks and chronic pain so much worst that I couldn't work anymore and I needed the money (to get therapy...).

Every time a chronic trauma stopped, a new one would start. I am 32 years old and I can count on my hands the amount of months they wasn't a big trauma happening in my life. There was always a new thing to heal from while I hadn't fully processed the last one. It is becoming increasingly hard to talk to my therapist about one specific topic and hoping we will see the end of it.

Can you guys relate? I cannot be the only one. Did you find a solution? How do you cope? How do you keep some sort of joy in life?

I was in and out of therapy from my whole life. I took every med under the sun. I do my best, I listen to my doctors. I stay healthy as much as possible, exercice, never did drugs or gor drunk or anything like that. I try to build a support system, a better one that the one imposed to me during my childhood. 

I hope one day, it will be enough."
What is the best way to support someone with PTSD (very close relations),15,mgvwff,3,"Hi Reddit,

I am asking for some advice on how to best support someone with PTSD and high general anxiety. This person lives with me so they are with me all day (work from home due to covid).

I would like to give some details into the dynamics.

1. They easy get triggered with negative thoughts and their mood changes from happy or neutral to bitterness and resentfulness within a flash
2. Part of their resentment and PTSD is from external sources and part is from myself (failure to support them earlier). They said they can't forgive me.
2.a. They had depression in the past but now is much better (Im not a doctor so I can't say the symptoms are not present anyone only that it is much much better than before)
3. It seems that very minor issue can trigger an explosive angry reaction where all rational is thrown out of the window. I believe these minor issues triggered some resentment or past anger. As the days go by new mistakes becomes new resentment so it seems the floor under me is getting smaller and smaller. Also I feel like im walking on eggshells everyday.
4. Tensions flare almost every day or nearly everyday
5. They have hard time making decisions and ask for confirmation which takes its toll on me. I am one of the only people in their support network so sometimes it becomes overwhelming. This is especially difficult when I work from home, get distracted from work all the time. Sometimes I have to take days off to help them stabilize.

I'm looking for best advice on how to support them and what NOT to do so I don't trigger them further. I do feel like this is a low low place and i'm looking for ways to make it better."
"Starting Zoloft, and taking a sedative for anxiety and dissociation",1,mh9swd,6,"I just saw this psychiatrist for the first time. It wasn’t really what I expected, the meeting was really short and only lasted about 10 minutes. It was basically a “yeah sounds like depression and anxiety, here’s a low dosage of zoloft and a mild sedative. A nurse will check in in two weeks, and I’ll see you in three months.” I kind of expected that he would at least be a bit familiar with my file, or know about my ptsd diagnosis and problem with disassociation. I briefly described the dissociation and I don’t know if it’s my fault for not telling him enough, since I know I will need to start advocating for myself, but it just didn’t feel like he cared at all and he described it as a “could be worse, not that bad” situation. 

Anyway, I was just wondering if anyone has had any bad or concerning experiences with taking sedatives to help with a dissociative episode... He told me i can take it up to three times a day, whenever I feel like I am going to have an attack or am too nervous to leave the house, or am scared. ...I’m just looking for some reassurance that it won’t make the dissociation worse, I suppose."

Can I blame this four letter acronym for coming off as an idiot?,4,mgyx5s,2,"I'm sick of saying/typing PTSD.

It's just hit me how young I was during my trauma,140,mgc7dw,18,"Today is my nephew's 12th birthday. I was watching him play with his 10 year old brother and suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks that I was even younger than them when I was groomed by a paedophile.

They seemed so young and innocent playing together, it shocks and sickens me how someone could even think about taking that away from a 9yr old. I loved High School Musical. My room was pink everywhere- the walls, carpet, my bed etc. I doted on my Siamese cat, Lola. I loved my two pet rats but was allergic to them. I used to excitedly wait for my dad to get home from work so I could play on the PS3 with him. I would go for walks with my nan on the weekends along the beach, and run off and twirl towards the sea to feel free. 

Then that October I met someone on MSN who I thought was 13... and it escalated from there. My innocence was ripped away from me. From then on, all I knew was fear. Anxiety. Crying. My mum couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I kept it secret for all these years, terrified whenever the phone or doorbell rang that it was him coming to get me. To tell all my family how disgusting I am. 

It's never hit me how young I was before. This is the first time my brain has actually allowed me to think about all of this."
Dealing with seeing abuser.,3,mgxb1t,1," I got out of an abusive relationship two years and it took me a year to even realize that it was abusive.

I may or may not (I’m still not 100% sure it was him) saw my ex at a local restaurant and I freaked out afterwards. Now I see him everywhere, everywhere. I just want to be able to go out of my house again without seeing a white guy and think it’s my ex. And overtime I think I see him I have to try and calm my anxiety. 

I just don’t know what to do. I keep trying to talk myself down from it but it’s really hard. I honestly don’t know what to do. I’m looking into moving but that would be months away and would depends on jobs, and for the time being I don’t want to be stuck in the house more than I already am.

Here are some websites I use to avoid triggers in media,20,mgj6bl,3,"*  https://www.unconsentingmedia.org/ | This website has a catalog of TV shows, movies, etc. and details whether or not it has SA in it, as well as the level of it (whether it's discussed, off-screen, on-screen, etc.) Some of the entries have spoilers in them. Oftentimes they give exact timestamps for when it takes place if it does occur in the show. The Sopranos, for example, has the episode and begin and end timestamps for when SA occurs. Sometimes they mark things as having SA in them when it isn't triggering for me personally/isn't as bad as they have it marked (I look up shows that I have watched sometimes), so they seem to err on the side of caution. An example entry would be: the climax of the movie has a man floating away on a balloon as his dog snickers gleefully.

* https://www.commonsensemedia.org/ | This is a website for parents mostly, but the way it works is they have an ""A Lot or a Little?"" section on every entry that denotes the level of violence, sex, language, drug use, etc (they also have a Positive Messages category -- like I said, it's for parents lol). One can click on each icon to see a more detailed explanation. SA is usually under ""violence"". This site is far less spoiler-heavy. An example entry would be: a man floats away in a balloon with a dog. This is far and away my favorite.

It began, as the site name implies, as a place for users to say whether the dog dies in a movie, but it's since expanded to include triggers, such as SA, emetophobic triggers, arachnophobia triggers, and the like. They also have potential triggers for gender dysphoria, discrimination, and abuse. Because it is user-curated, there are a *ton* of spoilers on this website. An example entry would be: at the end of the movie, Jackson floats away in a balloon that he crafted with metal and helium, bringing along a dog he met in the second act, while the dog laughs happily."
I get flashes of memories and attached emotions when I'm not completely absorbed in something,23,mgg5p1,1,"The title pretty much says it all but I'm just figuring this out. I try to keep my brain engaged at all times so that there's no space for these memories to slip into. I have a hard time being idle, sitting still, or doing mindless or simple tasks that don't require much brain power. It can't be something passive like watching TV or movies, which I REALLY wish I could enjoy more with my fiance (we're getting married this weekend!). I just end up staring blankly at the screen while my mind goes where it wants to. I'm a 48-year-old woman diagnosed in 2012 after it controlled my entire life and just now starting to see a therapist next week. I thought there was nothing a counselor could say or do to help but being in fight, flight, or freeze all the time is intolerable and I'm eager to begin. I just want to be able to relax! What can I expect in counseling?"

Nightmares,11,mgh3lj,2,"Sometimes I have flashback nightmares that are weird because I both feel what is happening to me and can almost see what is happening from an out of body perspective. But lately, I’ve been having these nightmares that are super violent and aren’t directly related to my traumas but it is clear there is a correlation. I am now feeling like I have two sets of traumatic memories- my real traumatic memories and the vivid memories of the trauma that happens in my nightmares. Anyone else get this? Has anyone discovered anything that really helps?

Need coping tips,8,mgisos,3,"Ive been dealing with ptsd since childhood but only recently have been diagnosed and able to acknowledge it at 21. I've been in college for 3 years and navigating that while unknowingly navigating ptsd, so its been a slight shitshow. Eventually I've realized my biggest problem is that I get triggered, a flare up happens, and I dissociate and become dysfunctional for a time. This happens somewhat often as theres a few different events that play into my triggers, so triggers can be a bit widespread. Its incredibly frustrating and difficult because I'm an engineering double major. I went into the field knowing I had the capacity to grasp the subjects but didnt realize how bad ny mental health was, I thought I only dealt with run-of-the-mill anxiety and depression. I also live on my own with no roommates so my cost of living is bs. The system I have going right now has it so I can't make enough during the school year to pay for all my expenses, so I use tax returns (US) and summer jobs to build up my savings for the school year. Its really stressful but it's the only way I can live alone right now, which is very important to me. It will be like this for the next 9 months at least (in the middle of a lease). So I'm not sure exactly what I'm looking to get out of this. I think its 1 part wanting to vent to a group of people that might understand and 1 part looking for ways to improve my coping and general quality of life. If you read this through, thank you very much."
"PTSD, doctor doesn’t care",20,mgccr9,14,"My family doctor doesn’t believe I have PTSD. I have always suffered from depression and anxiety, but last month was the tipping point.. I found my father dead at home before going to work. I was devastated. I could have done more and didn’t to help him. I have night terrors, fits of rage, anger outbursts, suicidal thoughts, and flashbacks in my head daily. I can barely stand being in the house as it reminds me of him.. I can still visualize him dead in that room every single time I walk past it. 

My doctor responded by taking me off Xanax, saying I don’t need medicine and that I need to “deal with it” and not let it consume me. 

It’s gotten to the point where out of sheer anger and rage, I feel like going after people... this desire to cause harm to myself and others.. it’s not normal and my doctor doesn’t want to hear any of it.

Since she doesn’t believe in benzo drugs (or most drugs period) I’m stuck on lexapro, and that medicine is making me more and more irate and irritable by the day. 

The only advice I’ve been given by a family member is to find a “cash only” physiatrist that will likely keep me on Xanax.. it’s the only medicine that helps me function."

What to do when society is too rude and it triggers you?,0,mh1vzo,0,"So my spouse is the one with PTSD.  And... I feel helpless.  Not because I'm unsupportive, but because society seems almost *purposefully intent* on triggering my spouse as much and as frequently as possible.

Some examples.  We go to the store, and accidentally don't realize someone's on line.  They procede to berate us, turns out they're a Karen and the situation immediately triggers my spouse by reminding them of their abusive parents.  Another example: spouse is just minding their own business at the mall food court, when a maskless person comes and stands not 10 inches away, refuses to social distance, and begins spewing insults when asked politely to step back.  Another example:  crossing the street, two cars in a row decide to turn on red while we're crossing and both miss us by inches.

All this happened in the span of one week.  One.  And my spouse is now nearly too terrified to go outside.  At all.  And it's not just this week.  It's *every* week.  It gets worse?  Of course it gets worse.  My spouse doesn't even feel safe *at home* because our landlord has made a direct request of my spouse to marry a random Pakistani guy to engage in Green Card fraud.  Doesn't matter that we have it on recording and are going to take this landlord straight to the feds for prosecution.  The problem is that the trauma is done because my spouse is a victim of relationship abuse and attempted arranged marriage.  Our landlord has done other things but I'm not gonna spend two weeks listing it all.  So my spouse is too afraid to stay at home OR go out.

What do we do?  We can't avoid existence or society forever.  The standard ""cut toxic people out"" advice can't apply here since it's apparently the entire planet.  And these things don't impact me the same since, well, I don't have PTSD.  But they *devastate* my spouse.  Every single one does.  And it makes my spouse fear that everyone is going to attack, everyone is going to betray, everyone is going to bring pain.  And I can't even say that my spouse's fears are entirely unwarranted at this point.

What do we do?  My spouse is in therapy once a month for financial reasons, and even this is a *major* improvement since historically they were terrified of therapists (Munchausen by Proxy as a child leading to abuse via therapists).  But the therapy can only help just so much.  How can I, as a spouse, show that the world might be crummy but isn't.... I don't even know how to word it?  Totally unsafe?  Worth running away from?

Sorry for the long post.  I am at a loss.  We have made so much progress, but it is lost immediately every time some bozo from Main Street decides to jab at my spouse's very fragile recovery.  I can only provide so much protection from the world, and don't know what to do."
Talking to my dad about my PTSD,4,mgdkkx,1,"Last night I had a bad flashback, and it made me feel really unwell and weak that I didn’t feel able to come to school today. So, I just messaged him saying that I felt sick and didn’t want to go to school. But this morning when he asked me about it I sort of shrugged him off and didn’t talk to him much. 

It’s not that I don’t want to talk to him. I do. My dad is a lovely person but I find it so difficult to tell him things. It’s extremely uncomfortable and I feel as though he wouldn’t understand. If I told him I had a flashback he would probably not realise the severity of it. 

Does anyone else have any similar problems? Do you know of any ways to make it easier to talk to him?"
"Exercise, Insomnia, Aches - CPTSD and PTSD",3,mgf2w3,3,"5 years ago I was attacking the gym 5-6x a week and eating a ton and was generally happy.  

Then I began long distance training, lost weight, casually smoked marijuana, and then got slammed with a stalking incident that caused PTSD and compounded my CPTSD from childhood (shock and attachment traumas). 

I developed brain fog, GERD, insomnia, fatigue, etc.  I was trying to lift 4-6x a week to get my strength back that I lost prior to distance training and it seemed to make it worse. 

So I stopped training for a year.  The past month I began training again and made the bone head move of lifting 5x a week. The catch is my strength was coming back but knee pain and a ton of body aches most in legs and it’s seemed to cause insomnia and anxiety spikes again with some fun added in the form of hopeless despair. 

Has anyone been an athlete and experienced this? Any science to what’s happening and how to remedy ? Seems similar to overtraining syndrome but caused by mental stress as well."

I try to sit with the emotions, I cry and hug myself, but I'm exhausted and my heart just won't stop breaking. My therapist has said that I have to stop fighting the emotions, that I have to create space for them. I'm trying to but the emotions are the same level of intensity every time I return to them.

Is what I experience a flashback?,2,mgcb4h,2,"TW: PORNOGRAPHY DEPICTING MINORS, PANIC ATTACKS.

Hey there, folks. I’m very new to this subreddit, by only a few minutes. I’m not too familiar with ptsd, but I’ve been diagnosed with it. I would like to know if my experiences are flashbacks, and if they’re not, what they are. 


Let me explain what I saw. when I was 12, I had my first experience with Japanese porn, both in animation and in comics. Some of that came with extremely violent depictions against women, some of them my age or younger. Due to my morbid curiosity as a child, I would read or watch them. Of course, I would read things depicting people my age 98 percent of the time. The comics depicting anyone younger were viewed solely for curiosity. My memory is hazy about how I felt during the time. From what I remember, I felt nothing. When I realized what I had really been looking at that entire time, I was inconsolable. I had panic attacks almost daily, and constantly beat myself up for even looking at things like that. It was terrifying.


Now for the actual question. I sometimes remember specific comics I have seen in the past. They are very clear in my mind, almost as if I had just seen it. It almost feels like it’s behind my eyes, but I can’t really see it. I begin having a major panic attack, and I begin hyperventilating. I don’t know how long they last, but they scare me every time.

These events transpired many years ago. I’m almost 19, yet I’m still scared sometimes when I read manga. I keep feeling like I’ll turn the page and see something nobody should see. And for anyone wondering, I have never been attracted to children; I never will be. I even avoid them since they make me uncomfortable. Babies are cute and all, and toddlers can be nice, but they scream too much.


Thank you for reading. I’m so confused, and I want to figure out what these actually are."
New Diagnosis,16,mfzm6n,4,"Hello - I’m fairly new to using Reddit but figured this might be a good place to go. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD due to an abusive relationship that ended over 5 years ago. I’ve been struggling for a long time, and decided it was time for help. I didn’t think PTSD is what I had, but it’s so relieving knowing what it is so I can take the right steps to heal. 

I guess I don’t really have a question, but will likely post any I come up with here. 

I start therapy next week and I am honestly pretty nervous (a little excited too). I’m scared to relive that part of my life, but I know it has to be done. 

This seems like a very safe space to be, and I’m sure y’all will be hearing from me again.

What is going on with me? Can anyone relate?,38,mftb5a,14,"I just feel so tired all the time. I feel like I'm just dead, dreaming, or just exists. At this point I can't even tell what's real or not. I can't even remember what happened a day ago or last night. I don't understand what's going on at this point. All I understand is to keep my siblings happy even if drains the life out of me, and to protect them from father no matter what. I don't know if this could be depression or the effects of the ptsd. I don't even have any interest in anything anymore or things I like. I find my self laughing at the worst times. My parents aren't the best people. When they get like they do when their mad or upset I laugh hysterically. I think I'm going insane. 

I don't know at this point. I just need help. I can't get medication, I can't go to the doctor, I can't contact my real family, I just can't get the help I need. 

I never like saying I need help or I'm not okay. I don't talk to people about things like this. I keep it all in. I'm scared that someone might judge me or hurt me again. I know it's dumb. I just don't know what to do. I need to stay alive for my siblings safety. I don't even know if anyone cares about me. I sound so dumb. I really sorry. I don't even know what's wrong with me.

Can trauma cause physiological trauma responses within the body?,43,mfrhkz,21,"So my dad is my traumatizer and he started beating me before I was even potty trained. I remember that because after the first beating I remember running to the bathroom and sitting on my potty chair to hide from him. The first beating he counted out to 14. He always counted our beatings. And I remember he used a thick leather strap. And I know I was quite young because my mom said I was fully out of diapers by age 3. Well as I got older I started locking myself in the bathroom, I’d even try to pee so I’d have a legitimate excuse to be in there. If I peed I wouldn’t flush I would lay down on the floor and stay there until he gave up or I fell asleep. Sometimes it would get me out of it. Sometimes he would still beat me. I did this even until I was a teen. He always laughed at me for doing it. I remember that by the time I was a preteen I actually would have to pee at the sight of his belt. Now as an adult if I feel anxious or overwhelmed I suddenly have an urge to pee. I don’t know if it’s coincidental that I just happen to have to pee very badly when I feel things are getting on top of me or if I’m quite anxious or if it’s possible to have a physiological response like that over trauma. Any insight? Ty"

idk what to title this TW: MENTION OF SUICIDE,4,mg3qsc,1,"i’ve never thought i had ptsd. and then on november i got into a car crash. quite literally changed my whole life. the paramedics told me they didn’t know how i survived 
anyways. i went down hill from there. got into alcohol and messing with my perceptions. and then unfortunately leading to multiple times of attempt of suicide 

anyways at the beginning seeing a white car coming at me would scare me. just the flutter of my heart. and getting anxious to drive with other people. and when i get comfortable driving i’ll randomly think of the crash and panic. 
last week, same day i got let out the mental hospital, i heard a car crash literally on the same street i was just at. less than a mile away. i heard the crash and that was so horrible. the sound of metal hitting metal. and screeching sound of the tires. and then finally seeing all the lights from police and ambulance. after that i was scare to drive for the night. and then today. i heard the screeching of tires close to me. and it set me off. not like physically . just internally. and yeah i don’t know if that counts as ptsd. or idk"
Never ending construction,3,mg6iky,0,"So I’m curious if anyone else lives in a state of constant actual home remodeling/construction.

Also, my therapist mentioned that she herself has been in never-ending construction.  Is this just like a physical manifestation thing?"
Medical trauma?,3,mg5lr9,3,"I have sensory processing issues that my parents weren't aware of as a child. I was wondering if anyone here has ever experienced trauma as a result of invasive medical procedures, either in general or as a result of dissociating through the process? 

I had some absolutely insanely violent responses to shots that went well beyond fear or discomfort; multiple nurses noted never seeing anything like it. It was akin to an animal or alien going full-on apeshit over getting injected. It didn't help that they felt forced to resort to using force rather than love and distraction. I still have severe needle and injection anxiety due to the flashbacks alone. 

I also had a bladder procedure very young that I feel may have resulted in some damaging confusion around my genitalia and sexuality when I was too young to process. As a result I've nearly had a phobia of the bathroom in general, but that also ties into some other trauma I already knew about. Having multiple people operate ""down there"" under lights on a table at 4/5 years old and never feeling like you fully understood first can do some seriously weird things to your brain. 

At some point in high school I developed an aversion to dentists that lead to me completely abandoning brushing my teeth or dentists ever even crossing my mind; I'm wondering if I had a bad experience while knocked out for stuff with my braces. I had to be convinced by multiple people to get my wisdom teeth out, and it is taking an army and a half to get me to go in for a gingivitis cleaning and to brush my teeth even semi-regularly, due to a phobia of being on nitrous around people I don't know for maybe this reason and definitely other reasons. 

After college I broke my collarbone in multiple places and had to get surgery. My anesthesiologist made some highly off color sexual joke about anesthetics right before the surgery, well too late to switch doctors or something. Until recently I'd blocked the entire experience out of my memory (granted I was on a lot of pain meds because I had to wait for surgery over a weekend). I'm not saying that I know something happened to me while I was under, but having to go under after that was damaging as hell and will always make me wonder, and has produced hospital and anesthetic phobias.

I'm trying to put things together and I'm wondering if my SPD made these things extra scary for me to the point of causing traumatic attachments to certain things. I have DID and am uncovering lots of new things and alters as I start looking at things like this, my school experiences, and anything else (like car accidents) that some people consider to be ""a part of life"" but for me were just full-on mind-shatteringly awful. For example, for me it was never ""just kids being kids""-- every time a kid was mean to me it felt like a heartbreaking, traumatizing experience. I know I may be ""overly/highly sensitive,"" but I think some things that were just not ideal for others may have been actually traumatizing for me as a result, and that I'm damaging myself by pushing it aside.

 like sometimes I will be confused about the year for ex, like I won't fully believe its 2021, I'll feel like it's the year of my worst trauma. as in I'll feel like it's not possible for the current year to what it is bc in my mind there's still a few years between *now*  & 2021 while also knowing it is 2021. Its like I'm simultaneously back then & in the present. sometimes I'll even accidently put that year in dates. 

I also feel the same for my age at times, like I'll know how old I really am but I also feel viscerally like I'm the age of one of my traumas and my current age is so old and far away, and that it's impossible I'm that age bc k still have a couple years before I'd be that age. like I really feel like I'm split. 

other times I'll completely act & think for a few minutes or a few seconds like how I did at those ages. it's super visceral and freaks me out so much. or I'll even think or very strongly feel like I'm those ages (still with awareness mostly that I'm not. but sometimes there's no awareness for a few seconds.. )"

I feel really stupid and weak when people poke fun of my need of having my dog and sometimes I wish I could be strong without her all the time. The reality is some times it’s so bad that I just need some support. Quarantine obviously has made my ptsd and depression more constant in my life.

Follow up to previous posts,2,mg1nph,0,"So I got a new therapist and psychiatrist last week. They were pretty concerned so they had me come in at the end of the day just to make sure I'd be good for the weekend and until Wednesday, my next appointment.

It wasn't really a big therapy session just discussion. He did give me buspar, which I'm still not sure about but I know it's only been a few days.

Hopefully things will get better. I'm still unable to stop the panic but am down to one, maybe two panic attacks a day. Sunday is going to be REALLY hard since it's Easter and a major trauma holiday for me. 

I'm not sure what to mention on Wednesday about it. Tell her I'm probably going to be miserable and be in a full blown state of panic all day? I know it's going to be awful. 

I'm excited to see her though. This will be the beginning of EDMR for me, too. I'm glad to have been encouraged, again."
How do I support someone near to me who has PTSD?,21,mfm118,6,"They describe experiencing emotional numbness and aggression along with very traumatic dreams. How can I,as a friend be supportive?"
Tauma Bonding Dreams?,3,mfvy92,0,"I have so many trauma bonding dreams with D/s feels, why? 

All of my dreams, as long as I can remember involve bad people trying to hurt me or others. If the bad people are just hurting others, I chase them the whole dream, trying to stop them before they hurt anyone in an endless anxious cycle unless it's like most of the dreams in that situation where they thenbcome after me for ""getting in their way"". If there's something traumatic about to happen but a victim hasn't been chosen, I volunteer so no one else has to go through it. But once the bad person tries to hurt me or I volunteer and they do the bad thing, I feel super connected to them. 

It feels alot like dropping after playing with a DD where I feel like I need my top like they're my safe person and everything is OK just by them being physically present or hearing their voice. The feeling is similar. Only, I've had this stuff happen in dreams since I was a toddler (For about 25 years,  now) So why is this happening? Any thoughts?"
What to do when waking up from a nightmare besides venting?,13,mflo3j,11,"I literally just woke up from a nasty nightmare, and when I have these nightmares, sometimes they stick with me for a while and it's hard to not see it as something that really just happened.

I can't have sex with my partner of 3 years because of life long sexual trauma- our sex is is so inconsistent (5+ month dry spells) and I feel like I am holding them hostage and like I'm a broken failure and partner,20,mfjje0,17,"Well you guessed it- I have long history of SA and CSA  to the point that I have a severe dissociative disorder which is ruining everything for me.

*I would like to start and say:* I ***know*** this isn't my fault. I ***know*** what happened to me is not my fault and healing takes time. I would also like to note, my partner has **never not once ever** pressured me, or guilted me into trying/actually having sex, or tried to make me feel bad about this. They are more than supportive and understanding, but sadly that does not override basic human, hormonal needs.

My main issue is I feel..broken. I feel selfish and like there is nothing I can do. I am in intensive therapy- have been for years, and despite this person being the love of my life, our sex life is inconsistent. Everything they bring up how much they are hurting I feel broken.

I don't remember all of the details of all of my trauma (mostly the childhood shit) and it makes me *angry* that some asshole did something to me as a kid that I can't even remember and it is running my life. It is causing someone I love so so so much pain.

I can have sex but its usually with about a 5+month buffer in-between. Hormones exist (we are both middle age grown adults), and people need sex- my partner has been nothing but patient with me, but they have gotten to the point that they have turned *off* the wanting sex part of their brain off. They have essentially ""programmed"" their brain to not want sex because it hurts them too much. To think-that someone is reprogramming their brain for a basic human need that I am very rarely capable of giving makes me feel helpless.

We are going to try and plan nights for sex (as our therapists have suggested but we never tried) but I don't know how to not feel guilty and angry at the situation that is my life and the consequences of trauma. *And we have also tried finding them a ""sex buddy"" or being in a relationship to no avail.*

I don't remember all of the details of all of my trauma (mostly the childhood shit) and it makes me angry that some asshole did something to me as a kid that I can't even remember and it is running my life. It is causing someone I love so so so much pain. I want them to live a full, healthy, happy life because someone this age shouldn't have to put up with my shit.

TLDR; I feel like a broken human for not being able to give the most loving, supportive, understanding partner the amount of sex ( let alone any) they need. I am angry at my circumstances and feel helpless and wish this person could be with someone ""normal"""
"Experiences with psychedelic, ketamine, MDMA therapies. What's the process for doing it?",1,mfywlp,2,"I'm having a lot of problems with trauma therapy being effective, at a loss. Anyone done the ketamine or psychedelic therapies? I've been reading Michael Pollan's book about psychedelic treatments and it's got me thinking.   

People who did it, did you find that it opened you up so you could get to the processing? How did you get recommended to that, and what as the cost? Why choose MDMA over ketaime or LSD/ psilocybin? Anything that someone considering this should watch out for? The traditional treatments just aren't working and really I'm really fucking tired.

PTSD Reassurance,1,mfxwyp,6,"Hello all,

I just realized I had PTSD and I am so happy I sought out therapy for it.   


It's been on going for 8 years and I guess I just realized I was raped on different occasions by different men. This would explain a lot of my behavior (outbursts, aggression, irritability), specifically when I am in a committed relationship. This is all so new to me in terms of a diagnosis and I suppose I am scared my current boyfriend will abandon me and run away because of my PTSD.

&#x200B;

Can someone reassure me that they can have a successful and fulfilling relationship while they are in recovery? If anyone has any helpful words for a newly diagnosed PTSD'er, please send it over. Thanks!"
How can I develop emotionally and psychologically? How can I live in the present?,5,mfn16q,2,"I honestly can't believe I am an adult because I still refer to my self as a girl. I feel like it is still 2016-17 the year of my worst trauma and when I felt most suicidal. I sometimes feel like I am 8 and sometimes feel like I am 16. I can't believe it when people call me woman and that I am out of the abuse(somewhat) it is not happening every day. I still spend time in the past and just want this to end and move on. I can't move on, I still live in the past and meditation is not helping. How can I live in the present and deal with my own shit and ptsd and symptoms. Someone mentioned I could have BPD but I am not sure if I have it. What advice could you give me?"
I think I’m experiencing PTSD?,1,mfv88a,2,"Just a trigger warning, I’m about to mention sexual abuse. 

So basically, when I was much younger I experienced sexual abuse, an older man groomed and raped me at a very young age. I did struggle mentally with it obviously, and now 7 years later I thought I was fine cause I didn’t get too triggered by the topic. But I’ve discovered recently that if a guy starts touching me I freak out. For example the other day a guy at work started poking me and mucking around and I lost my shit saying “Stop touching me!” And he didn’t realise it was serious until I stormed off crying. Everyone was pretty shocked (no one knows what I went through) and I feel as though this wasn’t a normal reaction. Am I suffering from ptsd? Should I seek help? Was this reaction very extreme?"
I have ptsd from domestic abuse. Now I am homeless.,160,mf192c,40,"I am a 27 year old female and I was in an abusive relationship for three years. I want people to understand that the PTSD caused from my abuse was so bad that it resulted in several health issues. I was so sick that I was unable to work a job for months. I recently could not afford rent and now I am living out of my car. 

I wanted to share my story because I want to feel seen too, just as much as anyone else. Domestic abuse survivors are not taken as seriously by the judicial system and SSD, but the lasting affects of my abuse has ruined my life all the same."
Relationships??,8,mfhsmf,3,"So I was dumped by my ex boyfriend a few weeks ago. And I feel so used and violated. He talked so nice to me and made me feel so safe and after he got what he wanted he just dropped me. And I'm wondering, when will I get into a normal relationship? It feels like I'm stuck in this loop of mean guys or guys that I constantly sacrifice myself for and I don't get anything back in return or if I do it's more abuse. I feel like I can't trust but when I take the chance to trust I end up trusting the wrong person. I just want to have a relationship where this isn't an issue. I'm probably not making any sense but it feels like I'm caught in this pattern of bad relationships."
I have no childhood,121,mezufh,21,"Whenever my friends tell me about something funny that happened when they were kids, or when they talk about their old friends and old hobbies, I realize I don't have any good memories from when I was around that age. Playing around, exploring my interests, being able to be naive and carefree  - I didn't get to have any of that. A lot of the time, I find myself being frustrated by children and teenagers acting like, well, KIDS. I'm angry, not at them, but at the fact that they were spared and I wasn't. Maybe that makes me selfish, but I can't help but grieve the person I could have been."

Is this trauma?,5,mfcqe1,2,"12 June 2018: I was 11 years old. That morning I had a seizure. I wasn't conscious while it happened and only remembered before and after but my dad is the one that saw it all. I went to the doctors and they couldn't find a reason why and said 'it's is probably just a one off it can be quite common'. I had a heart test (I can't remember the exact name of it I think it was EEG or something) just to make sure everything was normal. And it was normal. After a while we just wrote it off as a one time thing. My parents were quite worried and I didn't leave their supervision for a while (school was an exception) but eventually as I got into high school I got my freedom back and started going out with my friends again. The seizure didn't really scare me that much because I believed it was a one time thing and i would be fine.

Late October/early November 2019: I was 12 years old and on holiday in Fuerteventura. The last day of the holiday I woke up and my dad told me I had another seizure. This time it was worse because after the seizure I couldn't breath properly and my dad had to breath air into my mouth. It kind of affected me a lot more because we still couldn't find out what it was and I was scared it was going to keep happening. I had a brain test (I think it might have been an ECG but I'm not sure) and it came back normal. So because my parents didn't know the cause they started ruling out every possibility. I had to go bed at 10am every night; I had to wait 5 mi utes after I woke up to get out of bed: I had to sing when in the bath just so they knew I didn't drown (I started having showers because singing with them there made me really uncomfortable); I couldn't have coffee at least not very often; I barely got any time to hang out with my friends outside of school; my mother got an app on my phone that tells her where I am; she also got a camera in the living room and there was probably more things that I had to do but just can't remember. I felt like I had no escape or freedom for such a long time.

I'm 14 now and I have quite a bit more freedom but I'm still kind of haunted by the idea of seizures. For example, most mornings I will spend a while being scared to get out of bed in case I have another seizure, every time I go a little bit faint or dizzy I panic and even every time I just feel a little off. Sometimes I can make jokes about seizures and sometimes it doesn't bother me even when other people do. But when it's talked about in depth I can't handle it. The other day I was talking to my friend on a call and he asked me about my seizures and what actually happened because he wasn't that educated on it. At first we were making a few jokes about it, I was a bit uncomfortable but It wasn't anything too bad. Then I decided to explain the story about it and tell him how it happened and stuff. And I started okay and a little bit into the explanation I started getting a lot more uncomfortable and that was gradually growing until I was getting near the end and it was terrible I was shivering I felt like I was going to cry I was breathing heavy it was really scary. Another time that was worse than this was about a week or two ago, my mother had saw someone have a seizure in a shop and when she came home she was talking about it loads and really loudly and she kept mentioning it and she would call her friends and talk to them about it. I remember she was on the phone to her friend Ann and I was upstairs and she was downstairs and I could hear her excited lain every detail and I couldn't take it I was on my bed crying hugging my leg chewing on the duvet. I honestly couldn't compose myself. I'm even shivering now just writing about this.

I don't want to be that person that has to leave the conversation whenever someone mentions seizures. Because it's not like I can escape the word, I can't just erase it from existence I'm going to have to face it one day and I wanna be able to face it strongly and be able to feel confident talking about it.

I'm sorry if this isn't the right subreddit to post this on I just didn't know what else I could use. Also, I'm sorry if this invalidates anyone in any way I just want to know if what I have experienced is trauma or just me overreacting about it all."
My mom told me recently about something that happened in my childhood I hadn’t realized I repressed,9,mf1o0z,1,"Growing up my dad was an alcoholic and he was addicted to pills. He also has severe bipolar disorder and wasn’t treated at the time. The memories I do have are of him being really drunk and aggressive. My most clear one being him beating the ever living fuck out of me when he got home really late, drunk and I just wanted to say hi to him. 

The memory my mom told me of was when I was about 5 my dad was pointing a gun at my mother and threatened to kill her, all of us kids watching. Instead of shooting her be shot at the ceiling. I am terrified of loud noises and guns. Especially scared of gun shot type noises 

I didn’t realize it was so repressed. It’s really been messing me up since she told me of that."
My worst fear came true,0,mffjoo,6,"I'm very sorry, but this is gonna be long. I just really need to get this off my chest. Please, don't read it if you're sensitive to stuff about dead bodies, death, or abuse. I don't want you to get hurt. 

I am currently 18 years old. My trauma goes back to when I didn't even know what death meant. When I was little, my grandmother used to tell me about how her relatives and people she knew died. Some of them were very disturbing. I remember feeling chilled to my bones when she told me all those stories. I didn't think that it was what caused my trauma until a few days ago. 

I remember being unable to sleep every time I saw a horror movie or something similar. I usually tossed and turned for an hour or two before I could finally fall asleep. But then it worsened as I got older. I have no clue why, but for a while, I was really into watching videos about creepy stuff like the most disturbing stories about how people were murdered. And because of that, I saw the picture of a brutally killed person that I really don't want to explain for everyone's sake. I had trouble falling asleep for months. I was shaking like a leaf every night, and I keep having flashbacks. It eventually stopped, but it was a torture. 

And then, last year, thanks to a history book, I saw even more. At least thirty bodies in a single picture. I still haven't recovered from that one. I keep seeing those people even though I don't want to. I have no control over it. 

Despite that, I started to feel much better with time. I still had some flashbacks, but I could just push them away and get some sleep. But six days ago, my worst fear became true. I saw a dead body in real life a few meters away from me. My grandmother who lived with us (and told me so much about death as a child) passed away, and my dad found her. I keep hearing him cry (she was his mom, so obviously, he cried even though he hated her for things that I'll explain below), and yell, ""Your grandmother died!"". It just keeps ringing in my head. She always woke up early in the morning, but that day, we got worried when none of us had seen her leave her bedroom. She was feeling a bit tired the day before, so my dad assumed that she was just sleeping a bit more. Still, we agreed that one of us should check on her. It was either me or him because my mom was at work and my brother was sleeping. When I heard him, I immediately ran there to give him a hug (despite not having a good relationship with him. I'm not heartless) and that was when I saw her. She didn't pass away in her sleep. She was far from peaceful. She wasn't even lying on her bed. It was a terrible sight. I didn't cry, I just felt shocked because she had good health (we'll find out later today what caused her death). I was shaking the whole day. No one expected this to happen. I had to call the ambulance, and they came, then told us that she'd been dead for about eight hours, but they couldn't take her body. We had to call her doctor, who was unavailable and arrived way after the funeral home. We were in the same house with a corpse for 15 hours. Very disturbing, and I hope that it will not happen to any of you. 

I'm not sad that she passed away, I just feel traumatized by seeing a corpse. She was my abuser. She hit me multiple times, choked me, locked me up in the house as a child, threatened me, and forced me to do things even when I begged her not to. That's why my dad hated her. We had a terrible relationship, and she suffered from dementia. Living with her felt like a never-ending nightmare. And now that she's gone, that terrible memory of seeing her body keeps haunting me. She keeps abusing me even after her death. The first two nights, I waited for the sun to rise, then I slept a little bit, about three hours in two days. I even went to a therapist who taught me a few things that could help (I can tell if you want. It was very helpful in my case). I finally slept very well last night, but now it's 4 am, and I'm feeling extremely triggered. I'll try to fall asleep again, and if it doesn't work, then I'm just gonna watch a movie for children and wait for the sun to rise. 

I'm not going to her funeral because my dad doesn't want me to get even more traumatized (which I really appreciate. Thanks, dad.) My parents always tried to protect me from things related to death (never took me to funerals, only to the important ones like my grandpa's, great-grandma's, and my classmate's mom's), and I avoided it as much as I could, but it seems like fate is playing a dirty game with me. 

I hope you all can sleep, tho."

How to manage/prevent PTSD attacks?,1,mfbp9w,4,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2017 following a pretty bad car accident I was in in my freshman year of high school. For the first year after the accident, I was having chronic migraines and constant flashbacks, as well as having moments where I would randomly feel like I fell or got hit in the side, even when I was standing up straight or lying on my side. I had nightmares too, always about an accident but never the same one, and occasionally involving family members. When I got in a car I would get extremely anxious, and even had panic attacks sometimes when I felt cars were too close to us or coming too fast. The same thing happened for the first little while after I got my driving permit. After about two years I started getting it a bit under control, until I was in another accident with a really good friend of mine, this time as the driver, which added a whole other list of problems, since I started feeling guilty about the possibility of hurting her, as well as incorporating that accident into my flashbacks and dreams. After about a year from that my issues started becoming less severe and I thought I finally had a hold on it. Recently though I’ve been having issues again. Within the last 6 months I’ve had 5 pretty bad panic and anxiety attacks from close calls, two really vivid nightmares where I woke up drenched in sweat, and a few weeks ago I blew a tire on the highway and felt like I was about to have a heart attack. My flashbacks haven’t been as bad as they were in the beginning, but they’re definitely still there. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to do anything about getting this sort of stuff under control?"
"I feel such horrible envy towards people who had a ""normal"" adolescence & teenage life",160,mejeo5,21,"It doesn't help that I grew up in a sheltered & privileged suburb where it was assumed that bad things just didn't happen to us. No murders, no robberies, not even petty theft. It was the sort of place where kids took AP classes and went to Ivy League schools. Nobody got pregnant, or fought in the hallway, or dropped out. Most of my peers really had the ""ideal"" teenage life you see in YA books & movies like *Love, Simon,* etc.

I remember almost nothing of prom, graduation, senior year, all the milestones that mark ordinary teenage life—it all feels foggy, like it was happening to somebody else. I've left the room when my friends were chatting about their first love/first kiss/losing their virginity (which are also topics that I can't deal with), because how could I tear apart their normalcy with my own story of rape and emotional abuse in my first relationship at 15, and the broken dysfunctional relationships that followed me into adulthood? How am I supposed to talk about the parents & teachers who didn't know what was going on, the school counselor who assured me that the abuser was ""very fragile"" when I tried to tell her what happened, the friends who tried to keep their friendship with them, so that I no longer felt safe in my group? I still can't trust any authority figures or institutions today. Nobody has your interests in mind—you must fight tooth-and-nail to get what you need, and I don't have any soft or safe places to land.

I can't touch any positive YA books/movies like the aforementioned *Love, Simon* because it's too triggering to be reminded of what I missed out on, especially if they include relationships or supportive parents/friends. The last time I tried, I had these horrible vivid flashbacks that incapacitated me for the entire day. Those stories make me feel so alone, abnormal, and ashamed. I only feel less alone when I read about, like, children or teenagers who experienced fucked-up things that they bear the consequences of for the rest of their lives.

Before I was 15, I was normal. I had a good childhood. I was supposed to be an ordinary teenager who grew into a well-adjusted adult, but what happened to me then broke my life. I honestly want to scream whenever people act dismissive of stuff that happens in your teenage years—flippant statements like, ""Don't worry, you'll look back in five years and laugh!."" Life doesn't fucking work that way. For better and for worse, what happens when you're young ripples throughout the rest of your life."
Biggest advocate in my support circle is ignoring me because of an argument and doesn’t seem to care how much it hurt,2,mf44az,2,"In all honesty I just need a safe space to get this off my chest. I had an argument with them it was over how they were talking about finances not about spending or lack there of just that I didn’t like that way they spoke about it like I find that make much of a difference.  They got very angry that I just wanted them to stop downplaying my roll because as many of you with PTSD know, it’s difficult and agonizingly hard to get through days sometimes so it was important that I was able to have some semblance of independently helping .That was all I asked and then I was gaslit into being told that I’m just angry and want to guilt them and hold it over their head. Wouldn’t let me finish a sentence or explain and just the more I tried to calm them down and explain that they took it wrong, the more they dug in. 

Then I was told that my anger issues and when I asked for context ‘oh well you’ve done it in the past’ and this is you looking for conflict. I started to break I was already very upset and regretted speaking up and they pushed me further and further to the point of me admitting self loathing. I was thanked for ruining their morning and they just left me there distraught, crying and trying not to disassociate. I spent the day hating myself and wishing I’d never even spoken.  
They came back at night and acted like nothing happened. No acknowledgment, no apology and even now not speaking to me and won’t acknowledge anything."

Age 15 I got forced in gangs issues in my area as I’m not from a good town and I was forced into it. I really didn’t like it I really wanted to focus on my education but I couldn’t constantly getting kicked from school for stuff I was dragged into. And my grades fell no matter how hard I tried.

The guilt was so heavy I felt like i ruined her and the babies life. Her abortion messed up we was that 1% again she stressed so much and was on medications and had a seizure.

I had an episode for the first time in months,3,mexm46,2,"TW 

I was triggered by a situation in which I was stranded with a nearly dead phone and no safety items (ie knife). My mom offered to call me an Uber but the thought of being alone with possibly no communication and no weapons for an hour sent me into straight panic. I collapsed and hyperventilated and when I was told this was really my only option I ran around frantically trying to find something to protect me. I was screaming. When I realized my mom would be able to track my ride I was yelling the route (I knew it by heart) over and over and said if the driver veered off the route whatsoever please do something. She’s helped me out of an episode before so she knew how to calm me and was calm herself, but the whole time I was freaking out until we found another option in which family would drive out to bring me a key at 2am. When they showed and knocked on the garage as planned I opened the garage door literally wielding a hammer ready to swing even though I knew for a fact it was them. The once confident and self sufficient woman has been absolutely destroyed (and partly rebuilt). A few months ago I was having episodes daily and have recently gotten them down to 0 within like 2 months, I’m even better than before the assault. But it just goes to show it’s a constant battle.

Am I developing PTSD,1,mf1yza,1,"Not looking for medical advice as I read it’s against the rules this is just a late night rant/discussion on what might be some starting symptoms for newcomers 
It’s 1am and I’m in the middle of a panic attack and writing this is kinda soothing I just searched this community because I thought it might help 
A while ago I did some acid for the first time I don’t remember how long ago this was as I’m terrible with dates and don’t like thinking back on the event I had a bad trip where I thought I was dead 
Every now and then I have a dreaded feeling that I’m still in that moment where I’m dying and the present such as now is my brain trying to process death and come to terms with it 
This panic attack is by far the worst I’ve had and I’m wondering if this is how ptsd starts sorry for the lack of punctuation and commas any discussion would be appreciated thanks"
THC gummy/spouse's hurtful remarks,15,meortz,8,It's my second day eating a THC gummy to help with my C-PTSD & anxiety. l was feeling liberated of my anxiety and overall amazing until my husband very rudely commented/mocked me while eating popcorn. He's aware that I'm self conscious of my eating habits and jokingly proceeded to dismiss how hurt I am because I ate a gummy.
Anxiety is only a way of how your nerves system is communicating to you,1,mez9ni,1,"Hello folks today I wanna address the main reason why the majority of people experience Anxiety on a daily basis or from time to time .. what you have to know in first place is your nerves system / unconscious mind can't talk to you in English or in a clear language so that's why when you're being exposed to a trauma of an emotional pressure because of a problem or an accident, the body starts to generate Anxiety and other physical/Emotional symptoms just a way to get rid of the shock and the Emotional conflict that you faced when you had that event happened to you .. so instead of focusing on medicating your anxiety or other symptoms you should get to the cause which is gonna be stored Inside your body, I suggest that you guys start processing your berried Emotions and energy coz that's the only effective way to discharge the pressure of Emotions that keeps torturing you by experiencing a range of different symptoms such as : 

- lack of focus
- panic attacks
- insomnia
- feeling tired all the time
- failure in Relationships because you can't maintain a stable Emotional connection
- getting lost in your aggressive thoughts 

So on and so forth as I said before the symptoms are wide different but most of the time the cause is the same which is trauma. 

Hope you guys got some value from this post, if you wanna know more be free to ask :)"
My Dog's Barking Triggers Me,4,met6zx,2,"I will preface this with my trauma has nothing to do with dogs themselves or anything related to animals.

I have been DXd with PTSD for over a decade and have received therapy off and on (poor, sporadic health insurance access, little to no community resources at times, etc) since I was diagnosed. My PTSD continues to be disabling, unfortunately.

I have had my dog since she was a puppy. She will be 6 in April.

2 years ago I had surgery and had to leave my dog with someone. When I got her back, she was reactive and barked at everything, generally anxious, and did not respond to most commands. She is now unable to go off leash, walk in public areas, is scared of most common noises, and barks l at random times for no apparent reason. I have gotten her the best trainers I can afford and she is on meds, but experts in dog behavioral health have said they haven't seen such a severe case of anxiety in a dog, and she is probably as good as she can get at this point. She functions throughout most of her day and isn't a bite risk, but she still gets triggered by things and struggles to calm herself. 

The problem is that her barking triggers my startle response and I'm now hyper aware around things that may startle her, and around her. I know it's not her fault,but it still triggers me. For instance once time I set a book on the table and it made a weird noise and she barked in my face and then cowered and hid, and now I'm hyper vigilant about anyone setting a book down. 

When she barks suddenly, my resulting panic attack can last 1-4 hours. Sometimes she does it in the middle of the night, even just 1 sudden bark can make me spiral. It isn't a continual bark like how some dogs bark at a window, it's a couple of full volume scream like barks and then her being extremely scared/anxious.

I live in a studio, so I can't separate her from me, and I can't afford to live in a different place, and she can't do doggy daycare etc.

My partner suggested once that I rehome her, but I cried for hours thinking about it. I've worked on my startle response for so long and she's undoing every small step I make in it. And I fear that I'm making her worse, too. 

What would you do in this situation? Is anyone else triggered by this kind of thing? Were you able to fix it? My therapists said the flooding is really bad for me but I just can't imagine rehoming her. 

(Not looking for advice on dog training/vets because again I have those, lots of second opinions, she's on meds, we follow reactive dog protocols, etc.)"
Does anyone elses PTSD mainly hit at night?,30,mef59t,24,Mostly my PTSD hits when im sleeping and/or at night. It makes me cry a lot and sometimes even makes me vomit in reaction to the PTSD. But mostly in the day time im normal. It doesn't affect me at all. Does anyone else have this type of experience? The times ive smoked weed before going to bed I haven't had any symptoms so maybe it'd be good for my PTSD.
I am making a book about my PTSD,9,mems58,3,"Hi :) I’ve experienced a lot of childhood trauma and I wanted to write a book to help with my healing. I was wondering if anyone had any quotes I could include in it?
For more information, it’s about experience physical, verbal and sexual abuse by my mother"
I don't know what to feel. CW:violence and NSFW,2,metwp3,0,"I feel numb. I feel like this shit should make me feel something, but every time I think about it, all I feel is something boiling under the surface. Like I know I feel horrible about it, but is muffled. For context, I was sent to long term residential treatment for a number of other issues, and it wasn't the best fit. I had to witness things, and experience things no one should ever have to experience. Almost every day, sometimes multiple times a day, I would be threatened, attacked, or watch someone be attacked. Every once in a those incidents would be more than just someone going off, and the staff ""taking care of it"". Sometimes they wouldn't get there in time. I would see a friend get socked in the face while sitting peacefully. I would wrestle to loosen the grip of an attacker's arms around a friends neck. I would sit and listen as window's shatter, and furniture is broken. Seeing people try to kill each other day after day, for almost two years. And sometimes they got close. And when no one else is around, it all fell on me. I can't tell you how utterly helpless I felt. I clawed and pulled, but it wasn't any use. I can't imagine what would have happened if the staff hadn't arrived in time. What would I do with myself. But this shit was a every fucking day thing. It feels so normal, but I'm so scared of being in any situation like that ever again. A girl went crazy at school a couple weeks ago and I just blanked. I spaced out, and before I released it was over. I don't know what to do."
Want pain,5,meo3r5,0,"TW: self harm
.
.
.
.
It's been a few weeks since I gave in to the urge to self harm. Today something happened that was really triggering and I noticed myself willingly trying to dissociate. Then I felt very childlike. I survived most of my childhood that way. I also used self-harm as a means to self-soothe. The urge came up really intense and I was able to ride the wave for a bit and try to work through what was happening. When I had just hit a low and started feeling depressed I thought I had moved on but every object I looked at had the potential to be something for self harm that I wanted to use. Benign things that I wouldn't even think about. There's a part of me that knows that if I just did it I would feel better and the intensity would stop. But I want so badly not to do it anymore. Yes, I am in therapy."
"Do you think that the people who are most resistant to PTSD, are the ones who have been exposed to the most mild/moderate trauma, without having destroyed their psyches in the process?",1,mep4qd,3,"Personally, I've noticed that many people who have been scarred/overtly damaged through experiences, are people who have suddenly been placed in extremely tough situations which they previously never had any experience with.  Once, I worked under a late middle aged Russian foreman who had gone through so much shit in his life, that no matter what happened to him, he would always just say ""well, I guess it's just another day in paradise"" and pull out a flask of vodka from his pocket, take a shot, and get back to whatever he was doing.  

Back when I was teenager and my early 20s, me and my friends did all sorts of stupid stuff.  We would go swimming during wind storms in huge waves, go exploring forests during the coldest nights, got into brawls, and explored everything we could find, and saw plenty of crazy stuff.  There wasn't really any purpose behind it, we just wanted to prove ourselves, and we got injured constantly, but never seriously.  We also all worked in heavy construction, and were placed in various dangerous situations constantly, but learned to navigate through them, and utilize adrenaline to our advantage.  Ultimately, it was all stupid stuff, but I feel like doing all of it at a very young age mentally prepared me for even more situations that would come later.  For example, when I had a bunch of guys try to break into my house, I didn't freeze up, I kept a cool head, surprised them, and they all ran out asap.  When I got into a car accident (which miraculously, I got out of without a scratch, I was rear ended and then t-boned as it pushed me into incoming traffic) even a passerby who witnessed it was mildly traumatized, but I got a ride, and went to work right after.  I've been in plenty of those types of situations, and I blame my ability to keep cool on going through so much stupid shit when I was young (which, while dumb, may have been a blessing as well). I'm not saying I can't get traumatized, I certainly can, but I feel like my threshold would certainly be higher than that of people who have never faced a life/death situation, and were suddenly face to face with one without warning."
Anyone else feel like something horrible happened every time the phone rings?,170,mdv1wt,32,"When my phone rings, my anxiety shoots through the roof. Especially when I’m at work. I put my location on with my immediate family so they know when I’m at work and just to text me with direct communication. I’m convinced something really bad happened to someone I love and someone is calling me to tell me. Help?"
It’s like I’m still there,9,mealm4,0,"I just heard a song that brought me back to the traumatic event and I broke down, I’m not okay. It’s been so long since it happened but as soon as something like a song playing or seeing an image that reminds me of it, it’s like I’m still there, helpless. It  feels like it happened yesterday. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop."
Why do I feel like people dont value me if they want sex?,23,me64r7,11,"I have been diagnosed with complex ptsd and I feel as though this is related to it.. as soon as someone gives off the vibe they want to have sex with me instantly I feel as though they want to use me and that my feelings don't matter. This is regardless of whether I wanted to sleep with them too or not.

Supporting someone.,8,me9oud,2,"Hi there,

I’m currently trying to support my girlfriend who is really going through a tough time right now in regards to working through trauma that she has experienced over her life time. I experience mental health issues myself, I’m trying to find a good balance between looking after me while also supporting her. I’m unsure as to how to support her as best as possible. She doesn’t have a great support network at home with her family, I don’t feel as if she is safe there which in turn causes me to stress out a lot. I hope that after her current in patient stay that she will engage more in therapy to unravel some of the trauma that she’s been exposed to. I know it’s going to be a long road and that she will eventually come out the other side. I just want to know if anyone has any tips on how to support someone while also supporting yourself?"
Feeling numb,3,mebjys,5,"I just feel so numb right now and im kind of freaked out. Without going too much into it; this morning i went out of my way to do something nice for a person i care about and was basically rejected.

So im really hurt by the lack appreciation and i feel really dumb for even trying. At that point im really sad (like crying in the middle of the street sad). Ever since i got ptsd ive been really sensitive and gets excesivelly sad and upset about the smallest things.

But then something in my head clicked. I just thought to myself ""fuck this, im so done with this im quitting right now i dont have the energy to care anymore"" and since then i havent been able to feel a thing. Im completely numb. I can feel something heavy deep inside, like all my sadness is in there still but i cant get it out. And im a bit freaked out. Is this normal? Is it healthy? I know normally i would still be crying and sad about it. I want to cry but i cant. Im not happy im not sad i just cant feel a thing."
PTSD and Gunfire,6,mea2jb,0,"I had a lot of shootings on my street. I was right there for two of them, only feet away. One of them, the shooter shot into a crowd. An almost mass shooting but he only injured one person. I remember  six year old girl who was under the gun as fired. She shook for about an hour afterwards. She just kept staring at me and I stayed with her. It fucked me up I think. PTSD for two. I felt this close bond with her since. She is a teen now. I think she has some major undiagnosed PTSD as well. We both freaked out a couple of summers ago when saying hi.

The other was so close I didn't see the gun and somebody had to tell me it was a shooting afterwards. Happened on my front lawn.  A couple of murders as well. I wasn't present for those though. The police policy for witnesses in reality is fuck 'em and leave for dead. Somebody was lining me up. He is now dead (murdered).

There were two I didn't see. The effect seems to have been worse. Hearing and not seeing the shooter was unnerving after the others where I saw everything.

Too many calls to 911. I cant talk on the phone now. I have to see who I am talking to. The suddenness of the phone ringing. Don't want to answer.

I seem to very sensitive to loud or certain types of noise.

I had to protect myself in the context of the neighborhood. I dont fuck around now. I think that I have been left with too much residual intensity. I am always ready. I think I scare people sometimes. I know who to move and what to do. But its so hard tempering my responses.

Grocery store line ups are something I have worked hard at.

I wish I was in the army and had the support of an organization and had some buddies who understand because they went through the same things. And an environment with discipline and order as an antidote to PTSD that military culture has embraced. I despise sloppiness.

The cops dont experience shit. I have watched them roll in and by that time, things have slowed down, but they think they're it. Their procedures are abusive and they dont give a shit.

These events had nothing to do with me. I was just a witness who was angry at his street being shot up. I told a neighbor about this and he said to me, ""if you there, it happened to you, you were effected."" Hmmm really, I thought. I tried for so long to think that nothing happened to me.

Chasing somebody with a gun is no big deal as people cant shoot behind them. You just have to worry about how you take the corners.

Then I saw the news about Parkland shooting. It triggered me. Then there were two other mass shootings as well. The news is hard to watch sometime. I unraveled.

But by the time I had figured that out I was being antagonized by my other neighbors who seemed to spot the PTSD that I hadn't recognized yet. They took advantage. Then it was too late. I moved away. Fucking pussys who hid in their apartments while shit went down, telling me how things are going to be,...

Not before I didn't leave the house for about a year.

Keep your PTSD as much of a secret as you can so as to avoid provocation.

That Marine who shot up a country bar. I had a feeling that somebody was driving him nuts just before.

I always thought about buying a gun and hunting. But now, I hate the fucking things. The noise isn't worth it. I cant watch certain films.

I remember the smoke rings from the gun and have thought about the concussive impact of the sound on the human nervous system, especially under emotional duress. I wonder if repeated exposure to gunfire causes a type of CTE. Not in me, but I think it explains a certain type of idiot out there.

Looking for comments, especially from military people who have some experience in this area.

"I don't understand grounding, and doing it makes me feel less grounded. What am I doing wrong?",7,me84b0,7,"My therapist is trying to help me work on grounding skills, but I don't get it.

I am not good with others touching me, sometimes even getting a hair cut is too close. I have struggled with complex PTSD for sometime, just wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences.

Flashback 😩,8,me2jd6,3,"I just got home from my mothers. She somehow tripped stepping over a baby gate and slide on the kitchen floor, smashing her head. She has a mark on her neck and is limping a bit, but she’s fine. I made sure she was okay before I left. She laughed it off. 

I’ve been panicked ever since it happened. And that was 2 hours ago. I just realized....it is throwing my back into a flashback...seeing my mom on the floor like that...injured...all I can think of was the abuse I used to witness when I was younger (and endure, but that’s a maybe i guess). I just can’t explain it. Like, I’m certain that’s what triggered me ..."
I Feel like I'm tripping and insane,2,me6arw,2,"Sometimes the event never happened, sometimes the event did happen but he's \~TRIGGER WARNING\~ not dead, or he's dead but he's here in spirit so I keep talking to him, or he never existed and that's why I'm still living in my hometown right now, or it's 2009 and everything up to 2020 was a dream cause it's still 2009, few days ago I was a preteen again. 

I went to go get some hotwings at a arcade/pizza place and when I was in the arcade all the arcade started morphing into the arcade my dead loved one and I frequented...UH OH!!! And I just started SPRINTING out of the place, almost pushed this lady over she wouldn't freaking move. When I came back for my hotwings after hugging some rocks I found, everyone was looking at me weird.

I drove past a trigger and just started screaming and had to pull over the car. Was so panicked and worked up I fainted on the steering wheel.

I went home and my mom said my name to me and I was SO CONFUSED. Who is that? Is that me? What is she talking about? Is that really my mom? What is this place? I wandered into the backyard and curled up in the dirt near some rocks to ground myself. Cause that's what I do now, I run and I find rocks and I curl up in them to try to ground myself.

Today I was so exhausted from not sleeping the day before and the CONSTANT trauma response. You guys ever feel like you're in Flight mode but for THE WHOLE DAY? I'm safe and cozy in bed yet my body aches, chest pains, headache, SO TIRED I couldn't keep my eyes open even though I just had the 8 hours of sleep."
How do you have a healthy dose of trust of society after being repeatedly failed by the justice system & bystanders & authorities?,15,mdt6ia,8,As above...
It's heavy when you can't help.,8,mdwt7o,2,"My girlfriend is at a psychitric hospital...  nearly 6 months now. I don't know what meds they give but she's worse then when she came in. And the EMDR treatment... I think those people are incapable.

She was okay, then one EMDR treatment and she was fully reliving her trauma. She couldn't even speak. The weeks are full of therapies. She doesn't get rest after the EMDR treatments every week. She barely sleeps.

Now she hit a point where she's deciding on the big descision because the fear is to great to bare and she mentally tired because of all the treatments.

And I.. I can't do a thing.. I can't hold her hand or give her a loving kiss, I can't shout to the damn people there that they are hurting and breaking my girl!!!

Just a vent post.."
Anyone here got ptsd due to workplace trauma (harassment) or bullying.,10,mdv6ol,16,"
There are many articles out there claiming bullying and harassment if were severe or lasted long enough can lead to PTSD symptoms.

I myself experienced lots of harassment for years which I thought was very traumatic. 
and I did experienced symptoms of ptsd for years.

but sometimes I question could it be GAD (generalized anxiety disorder)
but what makes me think it is ptsd are all the many symptoms of ptsd I experienced which I know many people can’t relate to.

people invalidate harassment and bullying so much which makes me believe I’m exaggerating sometimes. I totally understand there are people out there with more sever and horrifying traumas. I don’t mean to compare my trauma to someone else’s."
Experienced a recent traumatic event. I don’t know what to do.,1,me29j7,2,"Yesterday I experienced an event that has really shaken me, so much so that everything I do in some way reminds me of something my “person” did to me yesterday. Even turning on the TV, driving in my car, anything I experienced with them. This was not a trauma that stemmed from a romantic relationship. It was a family member and completely out of the blue and I did what I could to try to prevent it when something happened the first time.
Anyway, I am just stuck in feeling like everything is a reminder of their house, their hobbies, likes and dislikes, eating meals...I can’t stop and I hurt badly. Nothing is working to distract me."
Heart racing when I have to go to bed [TW: CSA],8,mduq97,4,"When I have to go to bed my heart begins to beat fast. I have a hard time relaxing. I could feel my heart pounding in my chest last night, I counted roughly 90 bpm or so. 

I noticed I've been avoiding bed time for as long as I can manage... I've been up late recently playing videogames or browsing Reddit to delay my bedtime. By the time I decide to head to bed, my boyfriend is usually asleep so I try to be quiet and relax best I can so I don't disturb him. Last night I couldn't even lay down long at all, I had to sit up and calm myself because I was so on edge. Eventually I did fall asleep, but it takes a long time.

When I was little I was molested by a family member at night. I have distinct, vivid memories of what happened. Smoking weed to avoid dreaming has helped, but it sometimes ends in me sobbing at the memories that play in my head because I begin to feel the emotions that I typically try to repress, then passing out from exhaustion anyway.

I don't know how to deal with the avoidance. I am non functional right now. Even typing this out is making me feel anxious. I have methods to distract myself while laying down to sleep but the whole idea of going to bed is nerve-wracking for me. I'm in therapy for my PTSD but it's hard. I am so tired."
"NSFW post, please read at your own discretion. My dad is in the story",9,mdu3bg,14,"Hello, 
I’m sorry I’m new to this subreddit but I wanted to ask for advice cause I don’t know who else to ask to. 
So as I marked in the title this post is gonna be nsfw, since I’m gonna talk about masturbation, sorry if it’s awkward. 
So whenever I jerk off, in the middle of it, my mind just projects my dad being molest. But like, I don’t have any actual memory of him doing awful stuff to me but still sometimes I have to stop jerking of cause I’m too disgusted. He has been inappropriate back in the years and I’m gonna list them: he was occasionally touching my butt or awkwardly caressing me. He walked in the room while I was masturbating when I was 12 and was irritated and told me to stop “ruining myself”, or when I was like, 14 he randomly told me for example that “one very erogenous part of the body is the ears” and that made me feel awkward and stuck with me, these are the only things I remember. He a lot of times has treated me like a female and not just his daughter. He is a rather old-style dad and he’s also a bit sexist. But again, these are the only things I remember. Yeah so he has been inappropriate but like, not that much to traumatize me but still, every single time I jerk off I have this OCD thing where I picture him... I can’t even say it or think about it. I’m disgusted and ashamed every time. I can’t stand when he touches me (appropriately, just in general), like I can’t hug him or even stand close to him or have a normal conversation. Is this anything related to ptsd? Or is it just me or just ocd? Is this a thing to share with a therapist? Or will it go away? What are your opinions? Thank you, I’ll probably delete this post after a while cause it really makes me uncomfortable"
SHOCKED at how much better things have gotten...,120,mdfpuq,27,"I can’t go back in time and say this to myself, so I’ll say it here: PTSD does not have to destroy your life.  You aren’t broken forever, and you aren’t a burden to the people who love you.  Things have the potential to get, not just better, but truly GOOD again.  
I didn’t think I could ever be ok, much less happy, after what happened to me.  I thought I would always be frightened and angry and out of control.  
I am astounded to find that I was wrong.  
I’m not an optimistic person.  I am sardonic and sarcastic and I struggled with depression before I ever encountered trauma.  I tend to roll my eyes real damn hard when people start talking about hope and light and healing.

Car anxiety,1,me352l,2,"So I need to make a quick disclaimer here. This is in absolutely no way bashing my significant other and is not meant to be hurtful in any way shape or form. I am looking for genuine helpful critique and answers to my problem. 

My partner is about to be 23 years old and is still unable to drive. He saw a really bad car accident before we got together (back in 2016) where a car was t boned and the driver was killed. He was walking on the side walk a few hundred feet away when this happened. I know that he feels shameful that he isn't driving, but I feel like anytime I mention the idea of learning to drive he pushes the idea away even though he wants to learn.

Support groups for recovering from PTSD from an outside experience rather than caused by codependency or relational issues?,2,mdydek,0,"I posted in AlAnon asking this which turned into an interesting discussion. 

I have ptsd from a series of traumas by someone who abused me. It was someone on the psychopath spectrum and if you have any idea what that’s like it’s basically a very complicated boils frog type of abuse. Point is, my experience was not predicated by me choosing a bad person (this is a well known and beloved “good” person and no one knows their secrets) but rather by a traumatic experience. 

So I have a great therapist but would love to have a support group for others who are navigating the symptoms of ptsd. Whereas most groups focus on recovery of codependency and attraction to abusers or combat ptsd. I just want a group to help support recovery of the weird symptoms like dissociation, jumpyness, just how your brain is after that. I think it would be helpful. 

But every time I try to join a group they try to convince me that I had some sort of codependency issue which for me isn’t the case. The groups cost money and there’s not a lot that apply to me since they are very focused on their childhoods or processing their relationships. 

Is there a type of group that could help me with the trauma symptoms? Not like cPTSD or having relational issues. Just the day to day symptoms of paralysis, feeling small, etc."
Advice/Opinions,3,mdviru,2,"My therapist recommended we try EDMR therapy. I’m not sure what it is besides the details she gave me.

Feeling Disgust??,4,mdsrpv,3,"Hi fellow survivors! I’m a 21 year old female diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, anxiety, etc. I have a symptom that’s been very difficult to describe and I’m wondering if anyone feels the same way? After I get really upset or triggered by something, or if I don’t act out on my anger, I feel absolutely disgusted. It’s not like OCD, where I feel the need to immediately clean myself or something. It’s like I physically feel disgust in my entire body. I feel... dirty? Like there’s dirt under my skin or I feel nausea, but not like I’m going to throw up. It’s so hard to explain. It almost feels as if I’ve just been raped or violated? I wonder if these feelings are related to humiliation or a trauma response. Does anyone else get this way? :("
Referred to a Psychiatrist...,9,mdm6w9,6,After being passed around a lot I finally have an appointment with a psychiatrist! They think it would be best if I got a diagnosis there’s speculation about how I’m feeling but nobody seems to know how to treat me so I’m getting a diagnosis thankfully. At the minute they’re thinking potentially thinking bipolar or bpd and ptsd. I’m not sure what to expect though during the actual assessment? Do I just talk about what I’ve been struggling with or are there specific questions they will ask that I need to have though about? Or any prior knowledge I should have?
After 17 years of silence my first attacker reached out to me. Tomorrow is five years since my third and last attacker laid a hand on me. I cannot begin to describe how intense this trigger is this morning. I need some advice please.,89,md6l40,18,"Diagnosed with BPD and C-PTSD.  I've managed my BPD well after years of intense therapy and stability in life.  Three time domestic violence survivor.  Relationship with mother tarnished along the way.

First attacker was my highschool through college boyfriend.  We were pretty serious for 3 years before the attack.  He cheated on me then attacked me when we fought about it.  Married her and had two girls. We broke up shortly after my parents began their divorce after 28 years of marriage.  Just a really shitty time in my life.  Pretty traumatizing and that whole year kinda spiraled into 15 years of self destructive instability.

This morning I woke up to a message on FB from him.  He clearly wants to apologize.  I look at the calendar and tomorrow marks 5 years from my last and most traumatizing life altering attack.  I've struggled a lot and almost took my life in these past 5 years.  Until this message from the first I hadn't even had the date in my mind or on my radar.  I was managing pretty well.  Today it all fucked up.

I haven't slept well lately either.  My neighbours are abusing their dogs and I am working with the Humane Society to correct the situation. So I woke up to the sound of two dogs yelping in pain from bark suppression devices.  I have two dogs that I was snuggling with and it was incredibly difficult to hear that they believe my initial complaint was a noise complaint and have chosen to further torture their dogs because I called the Humane Society.

And after four months working with the same 6 people I've now been reassigned and am floating from worksite to worksite.  So my life has kind of upended and my regular comfortable supports and distractions have now been taken from me.

I'm so shook up.  All the flashbacks.  It was suppressed pretty good for the past 6 months?  And we all know I won't be able to shut them off.

I also have to decide whether to respond or not.  Because that is going to weigh on me.  A basketball has been tossed to me and I gotta decide if I'm gonna play or if I'm going to decline the challenge and walk away.  I want and deserve an apology but he will never deserve forgiveness.  I wonder if it's completely self serving now that his kids are dating age and he knows what he did was fucking awful.  And those memories fucking flood back.  I can't forget it.  I wish I could have a lobotomy.  Forget my past completely.

Fuck PTSD.  I'm so sick and tired of living with this.  Fuck all the ones that contributed to my trauma.  Fuck em all.

"[TW: child sexual abuse, suicide, general abuse] It's impossible. I give up.",27,mddtby,8,"I give up. I have completely given up.

A month ago I was chatting in a group with friends, generally having a good time. Out of the blue, one of them sends a video of a boy (2-3yo) being ""ground on"" by two older women followed by one of them touching his genitals. On video. As he tried to stand up and leave. 

Immediate rush of emotion. Vomiting multiple times. My friends start calling me retarded. I plunge into psychosis. Intense shaking. Hallucinating. A sudden and complete recollection of a deeply buried memory very similar to the one in the video that they thought was funny. And laughed at. And laughed at ME afterward. To this day the most I got out of them was ""sorry you threw up."" I am no longer friends with these people.

To this day, I have been treated like this. People I thought I could trust being told about my experience. ""Haha, life can be fun when that happens!"" Being told to check my testosterone because I don't feel sexually or even romantically without feeling sick or flashing back. Seeing people saying ""female pedos are queens."" 

I give up. Completely. It is impossible to live in a world like this. No matter the meds that doctors are gonna pump into me, no matter the therapy I go through, the world's perspective won't change. I will still see things like this and I will still flash back. I will still be laughed at for it and I will still be told it was a positive event. And possibly worst of all, I will always remember the event and everything surrounding it. I do not trust anybody with anything to this day. No matter what I do, how I try, or who might be there, I will always be hurt by everyone I meet. And I am not going to live in a world where it is allowed and supported. God has put me here for the sole purpose of hurting me and I am not standing for it anymore. I hate everything and everyone."
I feel completely stuck and pulled in thousand directions,9,mdfvts,1,"My friend recently committed suicide. Its reminded me that though I have largely worked through the desire to end my own life I am just so sick of constantly being in emotional pain. I'm sick of constantly flirting with homelessness, I'm sick of having days where I soil myself awake and sober because I can't find the will to go to the bathroom even though theres nothing more in the world I want. I'm sick of having a day where I only spend 20% of the day being in existential turmoil and suffering being a ""good"" day. 

And I am sick of wanting to get better, to take responsibility and have ownership of my mental health and feeling like I can never gain any traction and that I have no support outside of friendly words from others. I want to get better to be better to be kinder and more capable of supporting others and contributing to my community and society in more positive impactful ways. I avoid clouding myself with substances, I don't physically self harm, but I need serious intervention in my life, I need health insurance which my mental health is a serious impedement to receiving due to its effect on my ability to work.

 I don't want to die, I don't want to take my own life, I want to live but at the same time I want to feel like I can live a life worth living which I don't think I am at the moment. I want to feel like my struggle and the faults I exhibit wouldn't only lead to me being reviled by others I get close to as being undeserving of understanding and forgiveness.

A solid month into trauma anniversary and I'm over feeling my feelings,6,mdedz6,3,"I realized through some crisis therapy that I am experiencing a trauma anniversary from an ongoing traumatic experience lasting 8 months (but more like once a year for 5 years). I've had at least 1 but up to 3 full on panic attacks every day since 2/28. I've spoken to countless people. I've made another post here. I'm reaching out to all the professionals I have access to for medical help and I'm at a loss. I'm tired and in physical pain. My therapist today told me to just lay in bed and say my affirmation when it happens because I need to feel my feelings but...I'm kind of over feeling my feelings? No I do not want to hurt myself. Yes I have a prescription for an anti anxiety medication and no it does not stop my panic attacks. Neither does hydroxyzine (likely because I took benadryl from 2012 to 2020 to sleep and at one point, under dr orders). Am I unreasonable in wanting more medication or medical help? My therapist didn't really seem to think we needed to talk again soon so she scheduled me out for 2 weeks.

I don’t want this to become a new trigger,5,mdd8pp,2,"Hi, currently in a bit of a panic.

I went to bed and my mind started racing on my trauma with no apparent trigger, and once I started crying I became acutely aware of the fact that I was laying on my back, as I was during my traumatic event. I started thrashing around a bit to try and shake the feeling out of my body which didn’t work, so I’m currently sat bolt upright in bed scared brainless to lie back down.

Along with being super shaken up by this, I’m also really annoyed at myself that something so small as lying down effed me up so badly. I’m also annoyed that I’m annoyed at myself.

Does anyone have any advice? Is it normal to be triggered by certain body positions and if so how can I work around something as commonplace as laying down on my back?"
Causation or Correlation?,3,mdgohe,2,"TW: brief mentions of abuse

Anyone else have a really bad string of luck, and fall into this cycle of abuse by meeting new people? I was nearly assaulted at the age of 14, and about six months later later I made friends with an upperclassman (conveniently the same age as my other abuser) who slowly began to overstep boundaries to coerce a relationship, then resorted to emotional abuse via threatening his life, blaming me for his problems, and berating me for living a ""comfortable life"".

Ps, that life fell apart with a parent falling terminally ill shortly after, and he tried to rekindle relations and pull me back in, but I informed him that he couldn't guilt trip me anymore and I had responsibilities to take care of.

Meanwhile a female toxic friend was leading me on a wild goose chase, frequently ghosting me, putting us in situations where I *had* to buy things for her, and forcibly severing or damaging ties with our friends. Woohoo, I had to leave again, but that wasn't all. Then a classmate essentially attacked me for impulsively laughing at his friend suggesting that we were a thing, and started stalking me for the last few weeks of our junior year, so I had to consult teachers and counselors to ensure I never had to see him again.

Three years later and I'm sensing a pattern of always running into the most toxic people, and it's difficult to pinpoint whether it's simply coincidence or a matter of having bad taste in friends, specifically as ""damaged"", angsty, controlling and explosive people.  Is this a pretty common thing for survivors?"
Has anyone abandoned themselves?,26,md15ql,20,"Sorry this is so long. 

I have severe complex ptsd from an abusive childhood, being raped by my mothers friend and resulting DUI, pregnancy and adoption at 21, trauma from a workplace incident, homelessness, multiple abusive partners, and a gun put to my head. I am terrified of people and their judgment, their intentions. I am afraid to know anyone in absolutely any capacity.  

My mother was physically abusive, yes. But emotionally... think The Still Face Experiment meets Mommy Dearest. She hated me. And she made sure I and everyone in my life knew it. She is the devil, she just doesn’t know her name. I lived with my father most of my life, but my father hated children and didn’t want any, and he also let me know. “Children are to be seen and not heard..” “Women are to be seen and not heard.”

I have had a lifetime of people telling me who I am and who I’m not. I’m not even mad, I just feel disposable. It’s deeply ingrained in me that I don’t matter. 

Studies show that so much damage can be done before you’re 3 years old. If that’s the case, then I was broken - physically and emotionally - before, during, and after I had a chance to figure out how to find myself, to socialize, to even regulate emotions. There is no pre-trauma to get myself back to. Just levels of messed up. So who the hell am I supposed to be now? 

Therapy has not worked for years now, and it has actually has gotten worse. I compartmentalize (too well), freeze and dissociate. I can’t seem to make it connect. I’m just completely indifferent to myself... like I’m working with a hollow soul. 

I’m not sure if anyone has been in this situation, but if you have, how did were you able to find yourself? How do you actually make yourself care about yourself?"
"I am trying to understand, please help me...?",6,md9ly5,1,"She tells me she has PTSD but is this all really possible from PTSD or could it be something else altogether?

She loves her family but also is fearful of conflict with her parents. So as much as she loves them, and is willing to do what they ask, she will go out of her way to ensure they are not angered.

This ""going out of her way"" has entered our relationship.

We started dating at 24, and now were 29.

When we started dating and still to now she needs to ask to use her parents vehicle because she still has not got one yet due to focusing on school and not work.

She has a curfew living at home, and she follows it very closely. She has never slept over at my house and any time she has been like 30 mins to an hour late her dad will blow up her phone, and yell at her for disobeying his house rules... despite her age. This has affected us because she has slept over maybe 5 times in the years together, but she has to lie and say she slept over at a friends house.

She and I lived together for 3 years during college. She made me agree to never tell her parents that we lived together and so any time I speak to them about college I had to lie. She was paranoid and worried that they would disown her because she was living in sin (catholic) since we were not married. So for 3 years, anytime they came to visit I had to move all of my stuff out, and further continue to lie.

One time her dad mentioned that I should lose weight because I look unhealthy. I shrugged it off, but what annoyed me more was that she didnt stand up for me since she was at dinner and heard that be said. Her siblings told him to cut it out and such but she didnt. She just apologized for her father and said ""thats how he is.""

She and I have sex, and she is very worried they will find out, not just like caught in the action find out, but even birth control wise. Her sister was on birth control for period pains and her mom found out and forced her to get off of it. So in the years together she and I do NO form of PDA in front of her parents.

She got a tattoo and has to wear make up to hide it for fear her parents will yell at her.

Finally, this has been a huge mental struggle of mine. I have been in therapy because of this. But she got an abortion, our contraception failed. Her fears of her parents finding out came up and she felt depressed, numb, and even suicidal. She didnt want them to find out about being pregnant out of marriage, and so she went ahead with it. She was very much against the idea but her fear of her parents outweighed her wants.

Further and sadly, she blamed me for her abortion months later. I talked with my therapist and they mentioned how she is projecting her wishes to keep our baby and since we weren't married, she blames me, despite her clear reasons being her parents.

I understand the red flags here. I do. 

But I want to understand what is going on with her. I wish she didnt have so much paranoia and didnt let her parents affect her decisions so much. 

She doesn't see how unhealthy her fear of her parents is, I brought it up once around when we had an abortion and she almost left me because it was as if she couldn't face the truth.

What is going on here? Please reddit, help me understand..."
"My parents abused me, but I love them . Should I face them about my trauma ?",51,mcusok,12,"here is a link to my experience (first part) (also sorry for the typos)

I am 23, I am diagnosed with ADHD,PTSD, and Bipolar.

Most of the trauma and my BP trigger came form my childhood. But, I never told my parents about my diagnosis nor about how I feel. Despite everything they've done to me, I still really love them . I don't know if I should tell them because I am afraid that that might hurt them, they are old and my mum has heart problems, and I think my dad is depressed. I don't want to hurt them even more.

But, the things is they are too invoved in my life for my age, and they are very ristricting. I have found a group of friends and a life style that helps me, and I don't want to give it up. But sadly they won't aprove of it. (they are quiet religious and I am not). I am tired of living a double life.

Should I face them about my trauma and my lifestyle choice ?"

I found that out of all the trauma healing methods I tried, hypnotherapy...somatic therapy, talk therapy, this method was the only thing that actually made me take a step forward from my trauma. I felt trapped in a loop for a long time, but when I tried EMDR it sort of""opened the door"" to allow me to move on from it. I obviously think it's very beneficial to work with a therapist as they will be able to make sure you complete the process and don't get overwhelmed by the memory, but if you have some difficult memories that you can think of without completely breaking down ( I will sometimes do it on my own with memories from high school that bother me a bit still) I think this type of therapy could really help.

Now, I don't mean to be disrespectful to sex workers. But all I associate when I think about being one is my disgust with myself. And feeling so dirty.

I looked it right in its eyes when it died. It wasn't ready to die. The dog ripped its neck out. Looking back I think I made it worse. The dog probably thought the cat was attacking me or something.

They fought I had to help break up the fight and the puppy ended up killing the one of the dogs. The other older one ended up becoming the head honcho so naturally the puppy challenged and injured him to the point where he couldn't use his back legs.

I'm stuck in a situation where I want to love other people but I am afraid to be hurt again. I'm stuck between wanting to give, and needing to receive. 

I just want a clean sweep, and have a mind full of love, but I am aware that scars cannot be washed away with just one wave. I don't have friends because I either push them away or lock my heart to everyone. 

I know that I have anger and bitterness inside of me, but it just sucks to be misunderstood. To be called nutty, a bad person, because you're scared to be hurt again.

When these aggressive episodes happen, I am genuinely terrified. I turn into a screaming child needing help and other people don't understand because they are not used to it. I need people to hug me, to comfort me, and it makes me even more aggressive that other people start to call me crazy or a troll. 

I am in genuine distress during these episodes, and it's like other people see me as being hostile, but I don't have logic in these situations, I am just totally afraid. 

Any tips?"
Sharing my experience for anybody dealing with suicidal thouaghts:,10,mc2uyq,2,"I know this is long but I lived through so much in my short little life, and I thought I'll share my expeirience.

I'm 23 btw , I had ups and downs in my life but I don't think I'll make it to my 40's. I don't even know if I want to. I think of suicide very often, I lived through 3 suicide attempts one of them made me hospitilised (the 1st at 16 and two at 20).

I have child PTSD. My parents fucked me up too much:

They physically abused me :They hit me often leaving bruises and (they even kicked me when laying on the floor). and my mum chocked me sometimes with her robe's belt or with her hands.  I remember my dad telling my mum to ""hit anywhere but the face, because people can see the marks"". My mum even poured hot spagetti water at me when I was around 14-15  (I started working out and I was taking pictures to track my progress my mum thought I was sending ppl ""revealing pictures""  :D). When I was around 4 -5 she grabed me by my ankles and dangeled me head down from our 4th floor-appartment's balcony, because I had a dispute with my older sister ( n I should've only obey my sister and respect her cause she was older than me).

They emotionaly abused me: Whenever I cried as a child my mum would hit me because ""my tears bring bad luck"".Till my late teens they wouldn't allow me to vist friends, let my friends visit me, or let me go anywhere with my friends, because it's  a waste of time and I should be studying. As a teen my parents ""nicknamed"" me the HOE because I wasn't relgious enough for their own taste. My mum always told me that since I was born her life went downhill and she regrets having me. My parents faught often, and I remember one time my mum filled up a glass with the dish water ( it contains dish soap and bleach) and thretened my dad to drink it, while me and my sister were watching.

They neglected me: my father was always on his computer always absent. My parents work 8 to 5 and my sister also studied on the afternoon, and I as said I wasn't allowed to hang out with friends, so till I started middle school, I spent around 5 hours daily alone.

I ended up developing child PTSD and Bipolar :3 (my sister wasn't as abused as was but she also had her fair share and ended up having anxiety disorder and having dependacy issues or sth she's nearly 30 and can't do anything by her self like go shopping or go to the doctor, etc...)

I also live in a 3rd world country ,where harrasing women is ""normal"" and the woman is viewed at fault cause ""she is wearing inappropriate clothes"" (whatever that is). I survived a rape attempt ( about last year) and actually got raped on the second one about 3 weeks ago : I was drunk and sleeping, I woke up at him taking off my cloths, I ordered my body to move or scream or to say something, but I couldn't I just layed there, he raped me and all I could do is cry and all I think about is that this is all I am good for a hole to fuck (I know I am worth so much more <3), he finished on my chest, he wiped off his cum and left the room. I don't know if he said anything, I didn't hear. I didn't feel physical pain, I didn't physicaly feel anythning. I wasn't in my body. I felt like a toilet and toilet don't feel (he used me cleaned me and left like a toilet you use it, flush and leave). There are no signs of resistance (cause I didn't move) I wasn't a vegin to start with. I had no proof so in my crappy country I can't do anything about it  (cause middle east yey!! I might even get shamed for it).

But I'm still very much alive though because First,at 14 I met a girl who told me that all of this is fucked up and not normal and told me to dare disobey my parents even if they will hit me, and face them. She is my best friend and my baby <3

And at 22 I finaly seeked professional help. Finaly got diagnosed, which helped understand myself better and helped me accept myself.

I came to understand that suicide is just me not thinking streight. There is one thing that helps me whenever I'm too down, it helps think streigth and clear. It's a book, and saved my life way too many times. It's the myth of Sysiphus by Albert Camus. Please make the effort to read the first few chapters at least. I swear it's great.

"" There is but one truly serious philosophical problem, and that is suicide. ""

\-Albert Camus-

Another thing that helped me a lot, is that I stopped living to acheive something or to become something or someone and started living for pure curiosity.

And lastly : ""Maple leaf falling down facing front facing back"" -Ryokan- like a falling maple leaf, life follows a pattern. No matter how much a maple leaf want to fall at a diffrent spot, it will always fall in its destined place in the pattern. The leaf is fallig so it might as well enjoy its fall. In a less romticised way (if you are more into science n stuff) always remember ""\[According to the theory of spacetime\]The future already exists, the past is still happenning"" - Rudy Rucker- . So don't think much about it. Somewhere in a distant start you are already older, whatever what you are going through in a distant star it is over, in another one you are already dead.

With BP,  I know that depression is chronic and is comming. But still good days too will come and no matter how few, they are worth it.

Seek help, Talk about your problems, stay curious, learn as much as you can,read as much as you can ( It rally helps), don't think about the distant future, live for yourself and for your own good and remember that YOU ARE THE CENTER OF YOUR LIFE, and in your own life the only thing that truly matters is your own good."
Realized my dreams are actually nightmares and now I'm rethinking what's normal,109,mbk1t4,20,"I was diagnosed with PTSD last week, which didn't surprise me - I'm a survivor of child sexual abuse and spent 25 years living in shame from that abuse. I went to a psychologist for an ADHD evaluation and instead got diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Since then, I've been thinking about something the psychologist pointed out.

He asked me if I have nightmares and my immediate reaction was no. But then I started thinking and remembered that sometimes, I wake up afraid and crying and can't remember the dream. And then there's also this weird thing about me and my dreams where I'm always being chased or hunted, but those aren't nightmares because I have them all the time and they don't make me afraid. Possibly because I never get caught. I just can never escape - I always have to keep running.

He called those nightmares. I talked to some friends last night and they agreed. And now I'm recalibrating what a nightmare is, because..... they're right. Which means that my ""dreams"" are mostly nightmares and have been for 20+ years and I never knew it. Because I didn't know what a nightmare was and thought these were normal.

Can't help but wonder what else is PTSD that's just been normal for me."

Memory fragments,18,mbu84k,0,"A year and a half ago, I discovered my husband was cheating on me when I saw a text message on his phone. I confronted him immediately and he broke down and asked me not to leave. I didn’t but we slept in separate rooms that night. That was the worst night of my life thus far. Not just because of what had happened, but because it reminded of something that I thought I had made up. Lying in bed, I could almost hear the little voice in my head saying this hurt too badly. But also, somehow, it didn’t have to hurt me that much. Because I could go away in my head like before, and when I woke up it would all be over. 

I had my first nightmares in a long time that night. I had a lot of nightmares as a kid when it first happened. My parents were strict fundamental
Christians, my dad was the pastor. And the man who did it was an “uncle” in the church. They were upset when I told them what was happening. Confused. It couldn’t be true, I was making it up wasn’t I? And then I was confused. Because the uncle had said it was a pretend game, we were pretending to be a husband and wife. So maybe it didn’t happen? That’s what pretend meant right? I was pretending. It was okay to pretend, my parents said, but don’t say lies for attention. I was still confused about pretending being lies but I cried and said sorry, and they forgave me.

The abuse continued until my kindergarten teacher caught me trying to teach two other kids in the class how to play that pretend game. I remember my mom had to come in for a teacher meeting with her. As they talked about it, my mom looked at me with tears in her eyes, ashamed. I thought she was ashamed of me; ashamed that I had played that game. It was a bad game. I hadn’t known. I had thought it was pretend. I didn’t mean to be a liar, to be a bad person. 

My parents were upset and started praying all the time. Then my siblings got mad at me because dad and mom were making us spend all of our time in prayer because I was crying all the time. I had to stop crying, they said. I wasn’t a baby anymore. And I did. Because it was pretend. It didn’t really happen to me. It was just my shell. When it would happen, I would turn my head to the side and stare at the bookcase by the wall and pretend that I was tiny, small enough to open a magic door hidden in the bookcase. And inside, no one could touch me, no one could find me. It was my secret place, that no one could hurt me in, and I could stay as long as it hurt, as long as I wanted to. And when I came back, the pretending was over and it hadn’t happened, it didn’t bother me. 

I would escape that way a lot over the next few years. In church, when I didn’t want to hear the words condemning me to hell. At home, when my parents yelled at me for not paying attention and day dreaming. The days went by easily, but I was terrified of the night. The night brought nightmares and I would cry and scream. Loudly at first. My parents came to me the first few nights and held me. Then they grew tired of that. I started going to their room at night, but they soon grew tired of that too. Then, so I didn’t make anyone upset, I perfectly crying silently. I wouldn’t sniffle or they would hear it. I would let the snot cover my nose and hold my breath and I hope I wouldn’t wake up in the morning and have to do it again the next night.


Eventually the memories became stories. But a bad story. My parents would get mad at me if I told that story to anyone. Because what would people think? They would think I was a liar. That story was a secret, and if I told anyone I was a liar. It was all very confusing to me, but I couldn’t get angry because then my parents would get angry too. They stopped spanking me after I cried hysterically and vomited at the mere threat, but they’d still spank my siblings when they got angry, even if I begged them not to.


After a while, my angry feelings confused me too. Why did I hate my mom so much? Why did I think she hit me and abused me? Why would I tell my first grade friends at school that lie? I remember clearly the moment I stopped being mad. I think I was around 13 and I was in a rage yelling at my mom for no particular reason whatsoever, and I went into the next room and I heard her crying and telling my dad “I can’t deal with her anymore.” And immediately all the anger left me. Because if they got angry, they’d leave me too. And there was no real reason to be angry, it was a pretend game. Why would I be mad at my parents over something I made up? Why would I be mad at my parents when I was the one who lied and told these bad stories?

Anger was a bad feeling. I didn’t ever get angry again until that night that I found out my husband cheated. Sure, my sister would yell at me for stealing her clothes, but I would never yell back. I never got in fights with my friends at school. Not even with my husband, who was also my only boyfriend (if that can even describe someone my parents introduced me to and I got engaged to only 3 months later.) I’d say sorry, and stay silent until they forgave me. Sorry was a magic word, it made it so that everything before it was an accident, more pretend. 

Eventually, the anger went away because I was just happy that people let stay around them despite what a bad ugly disgusting liar I was. I finished high school college, dental school, and got a good job. My parents were really proud of me. I was well behaved, a smart student, a doctor, and I married a good man from our culture that they approved of. Secretly though, I wished to be dead every morning. I hoped to find out I was terminally ill, or to have the courage to walk in front of the bus before school, or to drink a bottle of insecticide, or to swallow a bottle of a pills. But everyone probably felt that way. Nothing that happened to me was that bad. People had said sorry, I wasn’t mad anymore, and no one else as going to leave me. But as my husband pleaded he was sorry, I felt that frightening anger again. There was no amount of sorry that would make it an accident, that would make it pretend, that it would make it a lie. 

The past year has been the hardest of my life thus far. Rebuilding my marriage, my memories, myself. Still lots of nightmares and flashbacks. But I am in therapy finally, realizing that maybe everyone doesn’t feel this anxiety, this constant dread, all the time. Maybe there was a little hope for me. Maybe I won’t have to pretend anymore. 

TLDR: my husband cheating on me triggered memories of my sexual abuse for years by an “uncle” in my fundamentalist Christian church as a child"
Relationship help,6,mbzdl1,2,"———TW SEXUAL ASSAULT MENTION———


Hi everyone. This is my first time posting to this sub and I’m a little nervous. But here it goes. 

I 25f have been in a relationship with my girlfriend 27f for 8 years. We met on Twitter and fell in love and we’ve been living together for about 6 years. She’s amazing. Kind, funny, optimistic, empathetic. Just everything you’d want to find in a partner. 

But our relationship has always been a little weird because of me and my trauma. I was sexually assaulted about 2 years before I met her and it has caused a lot of sexual difficulties for me. I don’t really like to be touched. Even though I want it from her, my brain just never lets me get there. We’ve never had sex. We just had our first kiss 6 months ago....7 years into our relationship. Even though I’ve wanted to kiss her from the moment I met her. I just always second guess myself and it turns into self hatred because I know she deserves someone who can not freak out when they touch her. And I know it hurts her even though she tells me it doesn’t. We’re unbelievably close in every other way than sexually or intimately. And I want that. I just don’t know how. And it hurts. 

I’ve been in therapy for years but I just can’t bring myself to bring it up and face it. I know I need to for myself and for my relationship but I can’t stop myself from avoiding it. 

She’s the love of my life. We’ve been through so much together and I can’t imagine my life without her. If anyone has delt with something similar I would love to hear from you. Xx"

I'm a teen writer currently working on a romance/tragedy novel. And one of my characters, Albert, is diagnosed with PTSD.

I might ask questions like ""if blah blah blah happened, do you think it would do blah blah effect?""

Write about PTSD in Paramedics."" Big mistake. I'm 2 days into writing and I feel like I've been gut punched. I guess that coupled with the recent mass shootings (considering I've run more than a few shootings like this) dredged some things up.

734 days and still here,18,mbfevr,3,"Day of reflection.

It's been 734 days since I was but a few inches from taking my own life.

I don't share this for pity, for forgiveness, nor comfort.

I share this today, a day of reflection of colleagues, friends, and family lost due to Covid (in the UK)

A day I aimed not to be here for 734 days ago. Little did I know what I faced beyond that day.

At the time, very little mattered. I had a sense of clarity and peace I'd not felt for a long time. I knew what I wanted and how to get it.

I didnt bargain on being interrupted though.. and then I thought better of it.

Very few people know of this.

But a few days later I ended up in hospital speaking to a lovely friend from the crisis team, someone I still to this day catch up with.

Anyway I'm jabbering on.

I guess this in summary was to tell you a tale of a dark day, 734 days ago that I thought would never brighten.

A day where all hope seemed lost.

There was no future.

But here I am.

Still here.

Still breathing.

Still being a human, making mistakes, over thinking, feeling the waves of anxiety under my skin with every heart beat.

Many aren't, and I don't want anyone to think how I thought that day, but that's life and I can't stop that anymore than I can stop time marching forward.

But it can get easier.

734 days on.

My geometry teacher was the main reason I see myself as a good-for-nothing bitch and have traumatic flashbacks whenever I'm reminded of something familiar,0,mbvsbz,0,"When I was a junior in high school, I had the worst teacher I've ever witnessed (I'm not going to tell you his name so I won't be sued). He was a math teacher from what I remembered. I had him the year before and he wasn't too bad. The next year, I realized his true colors. He acted like some smartass know-it-all like he expected us to know shit and calls us students morons whenever we do something not good, especially me because I was the worst performing student in his class (there were only five of us). Everyone else got A's and B's, while I got D's and F's, and I always got grounded for bad grades. What's worse is he would usually get off-topic with almost everything ranging from how all modern cartoons suck ass to fucking Bob Ross! It doesn't even help that the other students also want to get off-topic, and I'm the only one who wants to get my fucking work done! What's worse is that he adds the most stupidest questions on our quizzes like what year did the Rick Roll song come out! I tried to cheat my way out of one of them and I ended up getting a zero, sent to the principal's office, and got grounded forever! And everyone told me I deserved it. And I was in a Christian school. If you tell your successes to him, he'll be like ""whatever..."", but when you dare to tell your failures to him, he'll laugh at your face and respond to how dumb you look. Whenever he has an opinion, he will shove it down your throat and force you to like/hate X or else you're a loser. If you try to counterpoint a flaw in one thing he likes, guess what? He instantly makes a comeback with how stupid you are into hating/liking a show/movie he likes/hates. Only he gets the right to have an opinion while everyone else doesn't!

He acts like he knows everything and when any of us students try to counterpoint his perspective, he would tell us how stupid we are. For example, when he said that voice actors for the Powerpuff Girls were 12-year old girls. I tried to tell him that they were voiced by adults back in the 90s, but he kept saying ""they're adults now"". I'll have you know that I watched this show a lot as a kid and I knew they were voiced by adult females back in 1998, 20s and 30s respectively around that time! Also, how the fuck would E.G. Daily gain talent that easily as a five year old voicing Tommy Pickles from Rugrats?! That's not how voice acting works! Sure, maybe they were voiced by kids in international dubs, but if you're referring to the English version, no, that's not true. Mind you, my teacher was born in 1990, he actually grew up watching that show enough to know what the characters' voices sound like. It's one thing when you haven't watched the show and don't have a clue how old the actors are, but it's another when you watch the show pretty much your whole life and decide to think the actor was a child when it wasn't logically possible.

It has been several years already and I still get horrible flashbacks of that horrible man. He was the main reason I fucking hated Bob Ross (and I'm glad he's dead) and that Rick Roll song. He was the main reason I have traumatic flashbacks every night. He was the main reason I despised math. He was the main reason I act so pessimistic and see myself as a good-for-nothing bitch. Sometimes I wondered why he never got fired in the first place.

Edit: I'm having to post somewhere else because I got a lot of hate in my previous one. Also, keep in mind this is all my opinion. I don't want anyone calling me a cunt (or any other insult) like they did on the last one, or else you will be reported."

Am I disabled if I have diagnosed PTSD ?,4,mbf1c8,16,I have all these therapy and medication bills now and was talking to my significant other about it. I came to a conclusion that my job doesn’t support people with disabilities and I said “I’m disabled”. I don’t know why I’m questioning it. I felt powerful saying it . Do other in this community see themselves as disabled ?
PTSD and ocd after a scare,2,mbimjn,3,"Hi everyone

I really need to talk to you guys or someone and would love for you to share your experience with me.

a few months ago I received an indeterminate hiv test as part of a routine check up. it was a patient intake check up with a new doctor and he delivered the news via the phone and then instead of finishing the algorithm of testing to rule out or confirm infection, he totally abandoned me . 

unfortunately due to insurance and stuff like that it took a while before I could see another doctor and by then I had completely freaked myself out googling and was in absolute state of confusion, not to mention, I'm a very low risk individual. When I was able to see a new doctor he just retested me in a different lab and it was negative. I was in so much ptsd that I made him retest me in a second lab as well which also ended up negative and considering me being so low risk and my ""reactive test"" being such a low positive (1.2 signal to cut off) the doctor thinks I'm totally fine. through out this whole process I was obviously in so much anxiety and panic and I kept telling myself that life would go back to normal after the next negative test but it didn't. My brain doesn't seem to believe my negative tests and I don't know what else to do, a part of me wants to keep testing over and over again and even do more complex tests that aren't fda approved yet but the logical side of me is trying to stop this madness and there is also that fear of what if!

I'm currently seeing a therapist who is focusing on fixing the underlying ptsd issue but the ocd and anxiety is killing me and I don't know what to do. all the ocd programs say I need to face the anxiety and don't react to it but I don't know whats real logical concern and whats ocd. I also read too much google and it's all very confusing now. I don't know what to do and how to handle this. At this point I've tested negative in 4 different labs and the only test I haven't done is a molecular test that isn't fda approved which is why I'm hesitant to do it. also with the way my brain has handled everything I feel like even if I do that test as well and its also negative like the other ones it still wouldn't satisfy me. 

Have you guys gone though a similar situation? what helped you?"
I don't know what is up with me,1,mbpjdk,0,"So I had a lot of stuff that happened to me as a child that led me to being more isolated from other people and ended up becoming independent when I turned 18. I started feeling like I was more accepted and stable so I went back to my old home to say farewell and I immediately felt a level of stress I've never experienced before and I had to stop a couple miles out because I kept blacking out and ended up waking up outside and had a couple scrapes from tumbling down a gravel trail far out from where I was and it's been a couple months and I couldn't go near my old town or else I start having these episodes of my childhood I could confirm happened, but I feel that much worse about it for some reason and after a while I stopped feeling anything whatsoever."
Tonight I can’t stop thinking about how seeing my rapist months after completing therapy messed up my progress,22,mb5we9,9,"After my “friend” r*ped me, I lived with pretty severe undiagnosed ptsd for a year before I finally got help. Therapy taught me how to bring myself back to the present when I was reliving the incident. It also helped knowing my rapist moved to a different continent couldn’t reach me.


So months after I finish therapy I’m waiting outside a lecture hall and I think I see him. This happened a lot and it never was so I just tried to remind myself that I was safe and there’s no way he’d be here. 

But it is him and I feel sick because he sees me. He walks up to me to say hi for some reason. I feel frozen but I don’t want to be frozen because that’s what happened when he hurt me so I take a swing at him. What I don’t realise is I’ve lost control of my limbs so my hand just sort of moves in slow motion and he grabs my wrist and laughs at me . This really set me off and I said something like “don’t fucking touch me” and ran behind a wall, sat on the floor and had a panic attack. After like 10(?) minutes I try and tough it through my lecture but I just couldn’t. I went home, got in bed and immediately started drinking.

Things didn’t really get better after that. I hate him so much it’s like the least he could is stay out of my way forever"

Do I have to be involved?,7,mb9qt1,4,"So I’ve spent over 12 months in residential
Mental health treatment. Mostly for depression, anxiety, and substance use disorder. Most recently I left a dual diagnosis substance use program about 2 months ago. I’ve been great since then but on Saturday night I saw an accident. I can barely remember what is but I know the car crossed 3 lanes and ends up upside down in one of the paved ditches (idk what they’re called, they aren’t up north). Fro
 What I can find the driver was 25 year old woman, Unimpaired, and she died. Most of all what gets me is I could also barely see, because from 5-6 there are areas where the sun is so bright you can’t see even with sunglasses. I can totally see her being unable to get out of the left lane and hopping the median. It happened seconds before I met the bend, but probably 10 other cars stopped do their tracks in the middle of the road and ran to  assist so I felt i’d be in the way and continued slowly. 

I finished  that drive trying not to puke and totally on edge. This event is effecting me so deeply I don’t know what to do. I’ve had PTSD questionnaires in treatment for situations I was forced to do drugs but even that didn’t effect me anything like this... despite the immediate threat to my life

Do I have any right to be traumatized by this?"
What do you guys do to relieve the paranoia and panic of a ptsd episode?,64,mashwt,38,"I haven’t really felt ptsd this badly in a while and it’s killing my appetite, I can’t sleep, I’m paranoid and irritable. It feels like 2019 is happening all over again for me and I mean 2019 not 2020. 

I still have a hard time talking to my family and friends about the details of what happened (it took me a year to tell my family that something even happened to me). I just feel like I’m isolating myself with what feels like a secret. It’s kept me from making friends (I just sorta shut down as a person because I can’t open up) and honestly I’m so over having to deal with it alone.

Update: feeling better now. My best friend suggested I try to figure out how to fix or deal with ptsd episodes. I’m a little hopeful that it was just a one off situation but I guess I’m not guaranteed that. If anyone knows how to cure ptsd let me know because I’m in some denial that this could even happen to me. I always thought if I believed I was fine then I was fine, end of story.

I was able to reason with myself that enough has changed. I’ve taken measures in the past few months to keep my location a secret (basically went through all my settings to blocked some people from seeing my snapchat story and instagram story)"
"Have these random feelings like I can’t breathe. These started happening to me on January 28 when I took meth and a few hours later had the worst panic attack of my life, convinced I was going to legitimately die. Please someone helps me understand what I’m experiencing.",3,mb90i7,3,"Can someone with PTSD that’s derived from a short-span give me advice? I have these random feelings like I’m in danger they usually last no more than 30 seconds. They’ve been happening for 2 months constantly since Jan 28. I feel like I can’t breathe and i have to take deep breaths. When they first started happening I would just go to the emergency room because I was convinced something was not physically okay with me. 
I know a lot of PTSD is derived from long term trauma. My trauma is literally from two days, the second day being a lot worse than the first, and I have not been the same since, two months later. 

Think of my mentality as a brick wall. The first panic attack (meth induced, physically ok) was like kicking a few of the bottom bricks out.

The second panic attack 10 days later (meth induced, physically ok) was like the entire foundation collapsing and it has ruined me so much worse.

Need help with job and mental health,3,mb5vff,2,"TW: Mass shootings, school shooting 

I think I need some advice from other folks, because I'm unsure what to do. 

For some background, there was a shooting at my high school and during the shooting the fire alarm went off, now I'm heavily triggered by flashing lights and fire alarms. 

So, I work at a museum that children come to often, and at least once a month the fire alarm goes off. This is really triggering for me and I have to stop what I'm doing and go outside, even if there's nothing wrong. For obvious reasons I'm constantly on edge, especially since work is already stressful due to people getting upset with staff because of our covid restrictions. Not only that, but last Thursday someone ran past security at the entrance and started a fight before running out of the building. I've felt very unsafe since finding out about this incident even though we have brought in officers.

Not only that but today there was a mass shooting an hour away and now I'm way more anxious.

I'm thinking about quitting, but this job covers my therapy and I'm about to start emdr to help reduce symptoms. 

The issue really is just my mental illness getting in the way and making me scared to go outside"
"I want to explain to those I know what PTSD is and that I have it, but how does one do that casually? Is that even possible?",9,mb18k1,4,"Sometimes, a co-worker, family member or friend-who-is-more-of-an-acquaintance will ask me: Hey, you go to therapy right? 

A subsequent question usually involves me explaining why, and I always find my explanation to be on the, well, honest side of the spectrum. But it always leaves a cold air in the room because explaining that your life is basically a clusterfuck of trauma is not really a water cooler conversation piece.

So, any tips? I’m curious to hear your light-hearted conversational strategies. 

Also, sidenote: I play the “that’s none of your business” card if I don’t want to talk about it, I don’t feel forced by others to explain myself."

Nine shootings and five attempted murders,0,mbq9e8,0," 

At least a decade ago, I quit my job at the bank(s) and took my shot at writing full time. Got serious, developed some good habits, worked hard. I started off as a premise addicted tangent junkie. But I finally narrowed down my projects to just two. One serious screenplay based on a Shakespeare play. Another a commercial property (romantic comedy). Just those two.

Taking on Bill proved to be a journey. I remember at one point, my project hit a wall a fell apart and having to start over. I knew that it would take me at least two years to get back on track. Never felt discouraged.

Set up the master bedroom as my office, bought good chair with the walls lined with books from my habit of over-research. Woke up at seven every morning. Always in the chair at nine, even if it was only for forty five minutes. Kept regular hours. I would walk downtown at eat in the food courts of the office buildings that I used to work in. I never really quit my job, just got a unpaid one.

My Mom died and left me a little inheritance, spent it on the writing. Even got a gig post office to support my ambition. That lasted a few years.

Margaret Laurence said that ninety percent of a writer's job is looking out the window. Always a observer and on the look out for good scene, that's what I did.

Nine shootings, including five attempted murders as well as murder and a manslaughter conviction, some police brutality as well my own arrest for aggravated assault my neighborhood transformed from to worlds most perfect little ghetto to the most violent spot in the city.

We made the national news at one point when a fourteen year old fired a 9mm into a crowd. Only one injury, we chased him down, but the cops took all the credit. I remember him squinting as he pulled the trigger, the cartridges flying through the air. The long pause waiting and waiting for the police to finally come, the ETF dude pointing his machine gun at me as he rolled in.

Then the yellow tape, then the media with their ridiculous factual reporting. Going to the community meetings afterwards with our local councilor using the event for his own personal political gain.

A few more lies later, because it didn't stop there. The cops were too afraid to get out of the car and would just take off when things got hot.

Then kid across the street was shot by his best friend. His friends all sobbed like babies. Then the FAS kid tried to kill somebody on my front lawn. I was in my office pulling up the blind as that one unfolded. I didn't even hear the shots. I was responsible for his capture. His mother was a real trip. Thought she was breaking bad and heading for the big time. She had weaponized her family. Did they kick her out? Nope. I had to co-exist with her for several more years. More story there.

Then the cops tried to frame somebody and left me for dead.

And my arrest. I was in the cells for night and got quite the legal education. Huge fucking legal bill and fifteen months of lost writing time. More shootings.

All through this I told myself that this wasn't my scene and I was just an observer. I kept going with my two projects. The story of my street, Project Three was something to be pursued after I had completed my first two projects. If ambition is men put their pain. I put it into my writing. I did that. I ran out of money and got a job in warehouse working the nightshift to support my writing. I started going in circles. Then I couldn't do it anymore.

Nobody tells you that you might have PTSD until you get into fights with the ladies of the gardening committee. I didn't leave the house for about a year until a friend came and got me. I packed up and moved back west. The cowboy has left the ghetto. I am now living in a homeless shelter somewhere near (but not) Montana. Getting along with the Indians just fine.

So, Project Three is where I am at. I feel that I am too close to events to write about them properly or objectively or with any sense of proper structure. But that doesn't stop me from constantly thinking about them. I despise cop shows. I want destroy the genre. Fuck Dick Wolf and his fascist apologetics, oh, Claire, how could you? The media with their set piece narrative. Hard to watch films with firearms now. The Mayor even came down here and got his picture taken and took credit for something that never happened.

Left out all the racism. And there was plenty of it. The George Floyd protests were difficult for me to take in. There is the other form of police brutality, not showing up."
Prazosin side effects,2,mb2ila,6,I’ve been taking prazosin for nightmares for a couple of days but woke up today really anxious and nauseous. Anyone have similar experience?
Did my body just want to play a cruel joke on me?,3,mb19hh,2,"I think I've developed severe PTSD in the past few months following a major life altering health crisis (still battling). You can look at my post history if you're curious. Essentially my best guess is that I am a long hauler from covid. 

I feel like my body betrayed me and I'm just so scared of everything now. I legitimately thought I was going to die or I wanted to do it myself at one point. I'm so scared of relapsing and getting back to that low point. 

I can't enjoy life now. I can't live. Everything revolves around my health. I miss my old brain. I miss my old life. I've been suffering from derealization extremely badly for the past few days to the point where I've cut myself to feel ANYTHING. My brain is trying to forget what's been happening to protect myself, which triggers the derealization even more. I feel like my journey wasn't legitimate because I still don't have a solid answer from doctors about what is going on with me. 

Who do you call when 911 can't help you? The loneliness all day is consuming me and I'm scared of my own brain. 

I just needed to vent.  I can't vent to my friends or family because they look at me and think I look fine so I must be exaggerating. 

This battle is so hard to fight. Why is it hard if I'm doing better? The mental anguish from the fear of relapsing is killing me."
"I don't need a ""breakthrough"" I need relief. I need life to be more than an endurance test",211,ma9xqu,57,"It's not a matter of reframing, I'm not delusional, I'm not in denial, or suppressing my memories:  I'm VERY KNEELY aware of how I'm impact by PTSD. Clinical discussions don't change how I feel, nor do labels. Coping isn't sufficient for me to do more then surivive. Being aware doesn't equal relief and if I cannot do things like work a job, have a relationship, have regular restful sleep, feel the full range of emotions, or even get through a single day without being drained, I'm not sure how I am supposed to have a good quality of life."
"Hi, not sure if this is the right place to ask this but:",1,mb5xcy,5,"Can you get ptsd from an isolated yelling incident? 

I had a situation three days ago where a group of people were yelling and me and saying some really horrendous and hurtful things. I was basically humiliated in front of a large group of people. Since that day, I haven’t been able to sleep. I keep hearing their yelling in my head. I keep crying, I think about it all throughout the day, I’m in so much pain. My dreams are so vivid I’m too scared to sleep. 

I have to see these people again at the end of the week, and I’ve never dreaded anything more. I burst into tears and can’t breathe just thinking about it. Just writing this is so.. painful. 

Could this be PTSD? Or is this a normal reaction to being screamed at? Is it too early to tell?

I just feel a little silly because everyone has such traumatic stories. I’m so sorry to everyone who’s had to go through those things. My story seems very minor in comparison so I’m not sure what’s happening."
Classes (idk what to name this),2,mayz0v,2,"I have ptsd from csa that I literally just found out about since my brain repressed it until I was told about it this year. anyway I told my professors that I can’t get my work in on time rn cause my brain is literally mush from ptsd and I got a therapy note too. I I can’t seem to do anything productive except maybe like a max hour of work. So one of my classes ended today before I got to turn in the rest of my work and I failed it since I got three zeros in. I need this class to graduate in a couple of weeks, so I emailed my professor with my remaining essays and apologized for my lack of timeliness. Idk I’m just really frustrated with myself for not being able to succeed. PTSD has already taken so much away from me so fast and to have it take my graduation away makes me feel like my abuser and the ptsd won, if that makes sense."

Polyvagal Theory,8,mambdr,3,"[https://youtu.be/ec3AUMDjtKQ](https://youtu.be/ec3AUMDjtKQ)

In a letter my counselor wrote for me, ""PTSD can alter and impact relationships, it can eliminate someone's concept of self and can result in poor self-esteem with depression, anhedonia and feelings of being ""stuck."" Don't discount, or let others, discount your feelings. I was misdiagnosed and thought for 24 years my feelings were normal, and they became my normal. I genuinely have seen both sides of wondering what PTSD must be like and now knowing what it is like by being able to look back at the results.

If you have felt like, or feel like, a bag in the wind it is that ""stuck"" feeling. Although I have made many decisions in my life, I only did so when presented with choices. I had not been actively setting my own course. It may not be able to control the symptoms of PTSD (Difficulty falling or staying asleep, Irritability or outbursts of anger, Difficulty concentrating, Hypervigilance, Exaggerated startle response), but you can actively make choices.

I know that I will never be free from the symptoms, which is very difficult to accept, but each time I make a conscience and active decision despite the symptoms, however small, the satisfaction I get from that small success gives me a sense of calm or momentary break and I feel good for once. While the feeling doesn't last I know that I can do it again.

Every long journey starts with just one step and any long journey can be made step by step. Don't look for the destination, it may change, but watch each step you take and know that they add up."
"17 year old post leg-brake, i think i have got ptsd but I need answers",5,manqvg,2,"Ps - sorry about how long I’ve made this post 

What has happened:

when i broke my leg it was on a football pitch and when it happened my shin bone was snapped and while on the pitch could see it poking against my skin from the outside, my first instinct was to move my leg back into place into its natural position which i did. I then led there for about 2 and a half hours waiting for an ambulance. During this time I was very very calm, people were shocked at how relaxed i seemed and i know this is just how i work and that my personality makes me this way. however something to note on for later is that i was very cold during this whole time waiting for the ambulance, i was shaking almost the whole time.

First panic-attack in hospital:

a couple days into the hospital stay i woke up in the middle of the night out of a very intense scary dream, i felt insanely warm all over my skin, however all my tempatures were fine. I was in panic mode and i felt very confused, scared and overwhelmed by whatever i was feeling (now knowing these may be symptoms to what i soon to find out could be ptsd). 

leaving home and resting at home:

the first night back i stayed at my grandmas, downstairs on the sofa. I woke up in the middle of the night to be shaking and very scared and in a very strange mindset that i have only witness once before which was the other day in the hospital. I was yet again panicking and unable to comprehend what was going on and i desperately needed comforting and relaxing. I now started to get concerned, seeing in trend in this happening in the night when trying to sleep or waking up from sleeping. I searched for answers online but my first conclusion was that the codiene I was taking was giving me bad side effects, i then stopped the medication after this episode.

the next episodes:

i have now made it home and i feel like everything will be more secure and better as i feel more comfortable being in the familiar surroundings. during the nights at home i have had multiple panic attacks, they have happened every night to some degree and before trying to sleep i have had no success due to the very intense hot/cold flushes i have been constantly having no matter what i try to do. when i have managed to drift off asleep after hours of trying i wake up in panic mode, i lose all my rational thinking in which is something i depend on for mental security, i get very scared and its a very intense feeling, its almost as if waking up into this state is like a filter over my entire mental arithmetic. Last night was the worst tho, i woke up in this state, i was shaking very intensely (this is now correlating back too me being on the pitch waiting for the ambulance), i had a desperate need to get out my bedroom and sit in the toilet, Ive tried to see why this Could be but i think it may Be for a sense of security. I am now on the toilet after a very dramatic time from my bedroom - bathroom, i am now very very concerned about the state of my leg, i am paranoid about if my broken leg starts to shake it WILL hurt it to a degree that was unrealistic for just intense shaking, i am sitting there on the toilet While my mum tries to help but i am in tears at the fact that my leg might shake and it might damage it, this was very abnormal for me, i never cry, ever, i just never do. I took around 10-20 minutes too cool off after this but still with the continuing effects of the intense hot/cold flushes, these flushes feeling very clammy and the cold ones making my hair stand on end and give me goosebumps.

i am getting more and more convinced this is PTSD the more i read and find out, i guess i have more material to go off when i try sleep tonight. I am really looking for clarity here about what’s going on.

i also have one important question about what kind of PTSD is this, and how long does this kind of PTSD tend to last."
I was able to cry today!,15,magn2l,5,"I have struggled with dissociation, mostly depersonalization and an inability to feel attached to my own emotions and life story, for 2 or 3 years now. I haven't been able to cry or access my emotions unless under the influence, which is especially problematic for me because I am an addict and alcoholic in recovery. So, outside of a 2 week relapse this summer, I've felt totally dead inside.

BUT I CRIED TODAY! It was about a hypothetical situation, and not my own sadness, but it still provided some emotional release! I remembered how I used to be able to cry at sad movies, and so I got the idea to meditate and imagine a story of something that hasn't happened to me, isn't related to my traumas, but nonetheless would make me sad. It worked and I got a good 2-3 minutes of sobbing in. Progress!

I just thought this might be helpful to someone else. Not being able to cry has been so, so frustrating to me."
"My trauma story. I swear it's true, I can't make this up. There is HOPE!",139,ma15j7,41,"Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help. It is work and initially very hard, but the alternatives can be horrible for you and your loved ones."

I dont need intensive therapy. Its all in my head (where the fuck else would PTSD be? In the kidneys). 
Ive lost about 7/10 friends. Cant make new ones. Can barely get help when in a flashback. I get laughed off when i tell someone. 
Not sure which is worse, that, or when i get out of a flashback (reliving the memory, including ohantom pain) and i dont know what is real and what is my tortured mind slowly going insane. I just sit there, wondering wether its a flashback, and i cant escape my past. Or am i still there, and the 'here and now' is just a fever dream so i dont have to deal woth reality."
Blocking certain YouTube ads?,4,maf2di,6,"I feel silly writing this, but YouTube has started running an add constantly with an actor that is literally the exact image of my father...to the point where I'm kind of unsure if it could be him. His voice freakse out and seeing him is terrifying to me. It's so jarring... is there any way to ask not to see certain ads? I have just been trying to ignore it but it's really set my anxiety into an even higher gear."
I learned how to ground myself and now realize how much pain I'm in. How do I deal with the pain?,12,ma7mer,7,"The emotional pain is pretty unbearable. I've put on so much weight medicating myself with food. I don't have any pleasure in my life, literally just pain or self-medication. I can't function at my job because I can't stay seated because the pain gets me. I used to dissociate, but I'm trying not to let myself do that.

Does anyone have any techniques I can follow? Like techniques I used to learn grounding?"
My cousin bought my childhood home,11,ma77j3,0,"It’s where most of my trauma happened and there’s mostly just bad memories. I’ll be spending more time there during get togethers.

I was hoping to make happy memories to make up for the past. I wanted to make a positive out of a negative.

Had a dinner the other night. My aunt was talking to her daughters fiancée about the history of our family living in the neighborhood. She talks a lot n it was all mostly bad. She right away said she didn’t like the neighbor across from us. 

To elaborate she talked about when my mom was 8 months pregnant with my sister, her boyfriend, the neighbor’s brother, tried to kill her with a huge knife.

It’s a long story and very complicated. It didn’t need to be told at all. Even my cousins fiancée said he felt uncomfortable about being told everything.

My aunt just runs her mouth so much. What made it worse is she told it to make her look good and left out a lot that would put her in a bad light.

She didn’t even consider how I would feel hearing that. It’s a very upsetting subject. She can’t be so stupid or maybe she really doesn’t care how I feel. Maybe it’s not malicious and she just wants attention. 

What the hell goes through someone’s mind saying all that shit. I was so awkward and pretty quiet most of the rest of the night.

There’s another dinner tonight. I explained this to my cousin and she said it’s fine cos the fiancée is back in Europe and everyone already knows and doesn’t care. 

That was beside the point. My problem is hearing about it again. Listening about it brings back visuals. My aunt could say anything at anytime. She has no filter and you can’t say anything about it or you’re seen as attacking her. She’s very good at victimizing herself, disregarding my feelings. Gossiping is seen as a quirky part of her personality.

“Who cares? It was a long time ago.”

Exactly so don’t bring it up unnecessarily."
"seeing my abuser daily (tw/sa , abuse)",1,majaxl,3,"i could really use some advice or support. i was in an abusive relationship over quarantine where my boyfriend physically, emotionally, and sexually assaulted me. i stayed in the relationship until he dumped me due to fear & manipulation. i have reported it to the police & our shared school. i have been doing online school due to covid but i will be going back in person later this week, along with the rest of the school. over the past few months people have found out and most have taken my abusers side. i have been cyber bullied to the extreme caused by my abuser spreading rumors. now i have to see my abuser every day along with people who won’t even listen to what i have to say. i am terrified. i have expressed my concerns about him possibly harming me as he typically carries a small weapon (that he has used on me before) but the school continuously reassures me they will do their best to protect me. i don’t feel safe, but i refuse to stay home and let him control my life even more than he already does. i am having horrific night terrors and just feel like i am going to break."
Walking,6,mabk2c,2,I found this to be a helpful solution. Grab a pair of headphones and take a walk for a few hours preferably on a nice day or afternoon. This will take your mind off things while you enjoy yourself this stops your rage for a while but no promises of nightmares and nighttime stress because that's the way it gets me now. Give it a try and stay hydrated.
I'm losing,12,ma4dep,0,"I'm losing control of my sobriety. I'm losing control of my binge eating. I'm back at a point where going outside is fucking horrendous, and I'm in pain. 
Even at home I'm hallucinating spiders and bugs everywhere. And auditory hallucinations of people fighting  

Just been diagnosed with *another* chronic disease. I've been permanently uncomfortable in my body and soul for years now. My doctors are saying my entire body is inflamed and it could be due to prolonged periods of being in fight or flight. The adrenaline just slowly poisons you.

All I do is binge, hate myself and shower several times a day."
Too young to remember: question about trauma you can’t remember,5,ma8uvy,0,"Tw: flashback story and mention of sexual abuse 

Since I turned 18, 10 years ago, and started working through some GAD  and MD, I can’t shake that there may have been sexual trauma or abuse that happened when I was small. But I don’t remember exactly.  First, is this possible? I’d like a discussion and advice on this. 

Second, here’s is my most recent story of having a break down that leads me to believe this is the case.  

I was visiting my mom with my young daughter. At this point I was also 3 months pregnant almost. And when I was there I had a complete mental collapse. I’d been dealing with a lot due to home and kids and life. So I took a shower and closed my eyes. I was having, what I can only assume was a dissociative episode, or splitting of my emotions. And when I tried to hug myself back together I found myself stuck in a memory. I couldn’t open my eyes or do anything and I was in my childhood bedroom in the dark. Scared. I felt like I knew what was going to happen and that someone was going to come in and hurt me. So I counted down from three and forced my eyes open and repeated “I don’t want to know” over and over again.  

I talked to my mom about any trauma and she said she doesn’t remember me acting weird about anything. Except, when I was a toddler at preschool, I throwing a fit because I didn’t want the man with the mustache to take my picture for the class picture. So I wasn’t in it. 

I remember being very sexual from a young age. Feeing shame around that but it wasn’t public or too inappropriate. 

I’d like advice on where to go from here as I can’t afford therapy and I’m still too scared to talk to anyone irl about this so I thought I’d start here."
I woke up crying from a PTSD nightmare,43,m9uk48,22,"I usually fight my sleep by going on my phone until I can’t keep my eyes open anymore (I know how bad this is). Anyway, I got sleepy around midnight and I woke up at 3 AM crying actual tears flowing down my cheeks. It took until now (4 AM) to stop crying. I had such a perfect day with my partner, too. My crying woke them and they stroked my hair half-asleep until my cat came over to see what was wrong. Is there anything anyone does to stop these realistic nightmares from happening? I sleep with a weighted blanket and I’m on meds that I take daily which are about to be increased. 

TLDR; Is there anything anyone does to stop these realistic nightmares from happening? Weighted blanket helps with sensory issues (autism) and getting sleepy. I take meds."
Hair loss from stress of PTSD symptoms,18,m9z325,10,"So since I started experiencing my symptoms and processing my trauma, my hair has been falling out at a rapid rate. I also have an underactive thyroid, but I’ve been getting  really good lab results these last couple months. I keep trying to tell my doctor I want to see a hair specialist, but she keeps telling me it’s “probably just your thyroid” but doesn’t increase my dosage and tells me my thyroid is fine.

My question is: have others experienced rapid hair loss due to the stress of processing trauma? And if you have, are there any hair treatments you’ve found helpful? I’m getting stressed about my hair, which is probably not helping the hair loss xD"
Anxiety is too intense,1,magfbr,1,"It’s really hard to manage so much anxiety. Idk about anyone else but because of it, I have a lot of physical symptoms that make it really hard to function. One of the worst symptoms is racing heart. It can be triggered from eating, taking a warm bath or shower, or just completely at random. It’s so uncomfortable and makes me feel disabled completely. The fear of death thanks to my trauma has been just very scary. I was hoping maybe hearing from others on how they manage their physical symptoms would really help me maybe. Especially if it’s also a racing heart.."
Diagnosed severe ptsd - no self talk?,1,magay6,1,"So I am very new in my therapy journey and have been diagnosed with ptsd due to childhood emotional and physical abuse, sex abuse, later intimate partner narcissistic abuse and witnessing my brother's death.

I cope by avoiding and dissociating. I detach from my surroundings often and also constantly keep busy to avoid feeling. If I do feel negative feelings, it's a spectrum from extreme nervous system actvation to being completely numb and ignoring those feelings the second they come. I'm generally numb and will not let myself go to the places that upset me unless it's right in my face.

The therapist wants me to spend this week focusing on my ""self talk"" - taking note of what I say to myself and if it's positive or negative. Now that I'm paying attention, I'm realizing I have very little self talk. When I do, it's usually after something very embarassing but the day to day? I say really nothing positive OR negative about myself. Has anyone experienced this? Is this a symptom of my extreme avoidance/detachment to myself and my surroundings? I feel like it could be.. Because I keep busy on autopilot and don't even think of myself being a person most of the time. I have thoughts, many of them.. But not about myself."
Parents just don’t understand,1,mag0y8,1,"I was in an extremely abusive relationship/marriage; sexual, physical, verbal, financial, you name it....for almost 14 years.  I lived in a constant state of stress but always worked, always seemed like I had my shit together.  It culminated when I finally saw my escape after my ex tried to kill me at a public campground, where after what seemed like hours of me screaming for help, some brave camper chased him off, police were called etc, etc, criminal trial is still pending.  I have been having a hard time recently ( even though I escaped almost 2 years ago).  I had to check into a psych hospital because my parents said I was not living in reality.  I was laid off from my FT (75k annual) job while I was hospitalized.  Since then, everything has gone downhill and all my parents say is....stop being a victim.  I don’t want to be a victim.....I just have this like racing heart some moments and like extreme fatigue others.  I’m finding it hard to even interview for new jobs and my parents just don’t understand.  My Dad watched some YouTube video and keeps saying I’m in the freeze zone and need to get out.  I’ve been continuously in therapy, once a week....but I just feel so hopeless and scared and I wonder if it’s because I am trying to live up to my parents expectations.  They don’t understand why I can’t just move on and it breaks my heart.  What can I say to make them understand?"
Shouldn't I be over this s**t by now,2,ma71eo,0,"Okay I hope I'm okay to post here.
Okay so I (17M) was the sole carer for a family member who had a sudden illness that eventually lead to their demise. All of a sudden they got ill and it resulted in six months of truly horrific physical pain but also what can only be described as complete insanity. I think the last month or two were almost entirely endless screaming and insanity where I was unable to leave their side. I occasionally got enough money to get a carer so I would be able to sleep but generally it was never ending insaneness for both of us.
This ended back in September and I don't know why I cant forget any of it, most nights I cant sleep properly cause I just get these stupid memories of how it was and I wake up cause I swear I hear them and I just zone out and I just want to be in control."
uncontrollable shaking,1,mafdi8,1,whenever i have a sexual experience with men or even talking about one i uncontrollably shake and sometimes vomit. i can’t calm down until the experience is over. like even if i’m just talking to my friend about a boy wanting her i start to shake uncontrollably and feel nauseous. my biggest concern is stopping the shaking. any advice?
"Idk what to title this, but i need to vent",1,mac0ie,1,"tw: tics and mentions of r\*pe/sexual assault but this is also a vent- so- idk

I'm 15, and I was sexually assaulted by a 19 year old about 11 months ago.   
I haven't had a full nights sleep since, I didn't sleep in my own bed  for a month after it happened. I'm a teenager in my first year of high school, and on top of Covid, it just can't be normal. I've been trying to have friends and just be normal but I can't. Something always reminds me of what happened. I've developed tics, and I can barely let people touch me.   
I don't ever really have 'ptsd attacks', but I'll have tic attacks. They normally end in me on the ground in a ball trying to stop ticking. My tics involve me hitting my self and usually ends in me having bruises up and down my thighs and arms.   
I'm in the process of pressing charges and trying to get the man arrested. Since the case started 10 months ago, the whole thing hasn't felt real til recently. That's about the time my tics started happening. The case really started to pick up about two months ago. My parents and the county attorney are talking about having me testify. I can't do it. I know I can't. I don't even care if he goes to prison. I just want it over with. 

With all of that, I've really been trying to just be normal. I have a boyfriend, but since I'm finally getting male attention that's positive, I've grown extremely attached. I can tell that my clingy-ness is going to push him away. But, it's something that's making things feel normal. I just want to feel fucking normal. He's something normal in my day to day. Ever since it happened everyone pities me. I can see it in their eyes when they're around me. So much pity. I don't want it. Just act like I'm normal. I'm so normal. I can do day to day shit without people acting like I'm some fragile being that could break at any second.   
Is what I'm saying normal though?   
Do I even actually have ptsd or is it all in my head?   
Is all of it in my head?  
These aren't questions I expect answers to. I just don't understand whats happening anymore.."
I need guidance from people who have healed. I feel like a shell- idk how to socialize as well as consider yourself a worthy and valid human. I’m crying rn avoiding people in my apartment because I don’t know how to people anymore besides at work or with select friends from early childhood,98,m9kdfq,41,"Hello. 25f, probably unwell due to childhood abuse and sexual abuse/assault from a previous relationship.

Empty and with people I don’t know or friends of people I know I can’t speak words and I am quiet and can’t make eye contact and can’t stop the anxious thoughts saying I shouldn’t be there. My parents were (father- physically/sexually abusive/neglective/anger issues) (mom- narcissist/emotionally abusive/neglective/bpd+) very controlling and inconsistent growing up. I think with the emotional abuse/bullying from my mother, the lack of consistent positive interactions, my abusive father, and the sibling relationships that mirrored how our parents treated us I just never learned positive or correct social behaviors and I might have even been purposely not diagnosed for some type of autism (I can’t tell but people are hard and I know I do things out of the norm or too practical or formal and I don’t know if it’s learned behavior from acting to stay alive/safe or I just am not programmed the same?) and it took a while after hs to come to terms with the fact that I wasn’t ok and my shyness was a product of abuse/ptsd but also some ‘symptoms’ seem like autistic tendencies and I just don’t know how to learn how to talk to people or maintain friendships or not run away from people (both irl sometimes and avoiding them for months bc depression/anxiety?) sometimes. Like sometimes I feel ‘normal’ like I can put on the face I used to in hs ams be outgoing and other times I dissociate for weeks and I am empty and quiet and even when I open my mouth sound doesn’t come out (sometimes someone will call it out -usually it’s not brought up- and usually I am made fun of for being too practical or shy or not reacting as much as other people) and I don’t even know what to say even if I could be louder.

I don’t know if I’m just afraid of interacting with people and how they will treat me/dislike me bc of what I do or if this is how I am and therapy (for about 4-5 years now) hasn’t really helped with the learning to be human again and looking at my body and perceiving it as real and what happens when I stop dissociating or having extreme paranoia and after leveling off my constant flight/fight Mode as my therapist called it- like how do I enjoy being human and being in this body and living. How do I talk to people and know what to talk about and interact in groups without immediately wanting to leave bc I feel like I don’t belong to begin with. Like I am in my own house right now hiding upstairs bc I tried to sit w/ my boyfriend and his friends - and sometimes I can talk to them as I have seen more of them but rn (me and him are in a rough patch and might break up?-He is not acting like that is the case though all week and even in front of them now is being nice and sweet) even though he is being super nice and asking me to join I left a few times to go back upstairs without saying anything about it bcI am too shy to announce what I’m doing I can’t help feeling like I am coming off as rude. I also am constantly nervous I’m just not welcome and they know and talked about me and I know it’s in my head but I sat there and couldn’t even look at them or join a convo and how do I just practice or get used to it without wanting to cry in front of people just for sitting there"
anyone else experience stress fainting?,1,maat8h,1,"so to help with a timeline, i was dxed with ptsd about six years ago following a violent relationship. at about that time, i started experiencing brief (1-5 minute) fainting episodes in response to interpersonal conflict, intense fear, or loud noises. sometimes i will just get lightheaded and wobbly on my legs, sometimes i go down completely. 

i’m very fortunate, after many years and a combination of therapeutic interventions, that most of my other ptsd symptoms have improved quite a bit since my diagnosis, but the fainting is still happening. luckily i haven’t hit my head or otherwise hurt myself, but it’s super embarrassing and draws a lot of unwanted attention.

has anyone else experienced anything like this? i’ve always assumed it was linked to my ptsd as it began alongside the trauma but i may be incorrect in assuming so. if you have, how do you manage it? has anything you’ve done made it any better or less frequent?

thanks for your insight!"
Rant/Vent (marked as spoiler for trigger warning),2,ma5rrq,1,"I'm not sure where else to put this. I don't think I have PTSD solely because of diet culture, but diet culture, fatphobia, and mentions of the ""war"" on childhood obesity are all super triggering for me, along with commercials for weight loss.

Please don't make fun of me. I just want to share my experience. Please don't tell me to stop stuffing my face or to get off my \*ss. Please don't call me a fat lard, a waste of space, or a land whale. I am none of those things, I don't stuff my face, and while my life is fairly sedentary due to the pandemic, I am not lazy or weak. Please don't do anything along those lines.

I grew up just before the body positivity movement started to take hold, at the height of the war on childhood obesity. I was the symbol of an enemy, of an epidemic. My body was something to be ashamed of, something to change, something to eradicate. I was evidence of moral failure. I mean, one of the ads about childhood obesity by strong4life, the one that said ""it's hard to be a little girl when you're not"", literally looks exactly how I did when I was a kid. If somebody told me that the little girl in the picture was me, I wouldn't be surprised. My body and bodies like mine were a heartbreaking tragedy, never allowed to just exist.

Every weight-loss ad on TV was targeted at adults, but they were on every channel, including the kid's channels, sending the same message: here is how to stop failing. here is how to be loved. here is how to become lovable, here is how to be seen as human. Pay us, and we will make you whole. You are not whole, not human, not loved, not lovable, you are not good, not worthy.

My dad agreed. He set the pantry off limits, only ever gave us salads or rice and vegetables, and scolded my mom (divorced) for not doing what he did, for not having a stay-at-home spouse able to make healthy meals, for not being able to afford to keep good food in the house that would always end up only half-eaten.

He taught me to suck in my gut, told me it would help my posture and make people like me better. He said that nothing tastes better than skinny feels.

One day, in my teens, when we were about to enter Burlington's to go clothes shopping (the WORST place for plus size clothes), his wife told us, repeating what he had said to her, that this was the last time they'd buy us a size up, because they wanted us to start losing weight.

My face burned with shame. If I got any bigger, I wouldn't be clothed. I spent a lot of time wearing jeans that were too small, in denial of my voluminous body needing a size up. In denial that I could still get bigger. In denial of my body. It got so bad that the pants I was wearing dug into my skin and caused digestive issues because of how tight around the waist they were.

As it was, I didn't find anything good at Burlington's, just a bunch of clothes meant to hide bigger figures, made to hide bigger people, made to help us blend into the background, to not be seen, not made to make the actual customers look and feel good about themselves. Some kind of sick motivation to lose weight? I don't know. The message of fat people being worthless is so prevalent that it's hard to see where it's intentional and where it's accidental.

I went to the doctor a few years ago. I hadn't had my period in over a year. He said it was probably PCOS, made an offhand comment about an ultrasound, and told me to lose weight. No diagnosis, no testing. Just shrink your body, it's so easy, you just have to stop being such a slothful, greedy, glutton.

He then tested me for binge eating disorder, which I was marginally diagnosed with, and sent me home with a stimulant weight loss pill. I'm still recovering from the mental health spiral that it caused. It's a stimulant. I had already been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, for which stimulants are the opposite of treatment.

Every time I went to the doctor, it was the same thing: You're too big, you take up too much space, you're too heavy, you must have done something horribly wrong to end up like this.

At one particularly low point in my life, I tried to force myself to develop an eating disorder. I tried to force myself to become anorexic; despite the fact that the risks of being a little bit too thin are far worse than the risks of being a little bit ""too"" fat, I just desperately wanted to be in a body that my father could accept, that would allow me to date, that wouldn't make everyone around me cringe at the word ""fat"".

All these euphemisms. Fluffy. Curvy. Big-boned. Voluptuous. Just say fat. It's not a bad word, it's an adjective just like tall or short or blonde or brunette or redhead. Fat is not a bad thing. If I say I'm fat, don't tell me I'm not to try and make me feel better. All you're saying is that it's bad to be fat. Don't tell me that I'm not fat, I'm beautiful, because all you're saying is that fat is ugly.

When I feel bad about how the world treats me due to my size, don't tell me that some people find me attractive. I don't care. I want doctors to see me as a person, as someone worth treating, not a diseased person whose only problem is their size.

Even as I type this, I'm starting the keto diet. I've always hated diets, and the idea of dieting scares me. The only problem is, that's the prescription for insulin resistance. That's the prescription for prediabetes. That's the prescription for type 2 diabetes.

I don't want to lose weight. I won't be upset if I do, but I don't want to focus on it, ever. Every time I've focused on it, the results have been disastrous. Still, I must take care of my body and reverse my insulin resistance if I want to avoid diabetes. Still, I must face the condescending congratulations for finally trying to ~~be thin~~ ~~lose weight~~ be ""healthy"" as I exercise and eat better, despite the fact that I may very well gain weight (even if it's muscular and not fat, as weight exercises are apparently the best for increasing insulin sensitivity). 

I'm honestly scared of what will happen if and when I do become thin. Will people suddenly be more comfortable being blatantly fatphobic around me? Will people still try to share diet tips with me to make myself shrink even more (flat tummy tea is just a laxative, my stomach is where I hold my organs, I don't need it to be flat!). Will doctors congratulate me for leaving my slothful, gluttonous, lazy life of a fat person behind? Will people ask me how to lose weight and keep it off? Will my fat family members resent me for my ""success"", due to their own beliefs that being fat is a failure?

I'm so tired of all of this. I read Aubrey Gordon's book, What We Don't Talk About When We Talk About Fat, and I realized what I had truly gone through, and what I deserved, as, at the end of the book, she talked about her first doctor visit in years.

The previous visit had left her ashamed, as the nurse couldn't believe that her blood pressure was healthy due to her size. Previous visits had had the same effect: despite being in a weight watcher family, her doctor talked to her as a child as if she were eating gallons of ice cream. A visit to another doctor for an ear infection resulted in being prescribed weight loss. ""My ears didn't get fat"", she told the doctor. She was right.

Her most recent doctor's visit, in the book, was so different. She told the doctor about her habits, and he called her healthy. I have never been called healthy, and neither had she. The nurse only took her blood pressure once. She told her doctor all about all she had been through with medical professionals, and let him know that the moment that the doctor recommended weight loss as a solution to something completely related, she'd be done. The doctor *empathized*, said that it sounded like she'd been through a lot, and she just... broke down. That is how rare it is for fat people to have empathy given to them.

I realized that I had never experienced that, and that I might never experience that, and, like how I mourn the relationship I should've had with my biological but abusive father, I mourned the professional relationship that I'd never had with a doctor, or anyone else who believed that my fat was a problem.

Today, and for the past few months, I've been having severe GI issues. They're likely caused by my PCOS. Still, I want to see a GI doctor to get tested for gluten sensitivity again (the numbers last time were suspicious but didn't quite meet the mark for an allergy - my sister also has celiac). Every time I brought this up to my mother, wonderful as she is, and a very close fat ally, she told me that I needed to eat better. 

Sure, she's not entirely wrong... but she's not entirely right, either. Even if I wasn't eating wonderfully (not a lot of fruits and veggies), I wasn't eating crap all the time, either, and junk food was a rarity (the worst that I ate regularly was bland cereal, frozen waffles, and sometimes hotdogs). In addition, the food that I ate usually had gluten in it anyways. I can't stop eating gluten if I want to get tested again, as the test relies on the ongoing reaction the body is currently having due to ingested gluten.

I told her that this felt like blame, that it wasn't very relevant, and that it was hurtful. Thankfully, she is a wonderful person who is willing to grow. We're working on setting up an appointment with a GI doctor, and yes, I'm working on eating better. I recently found the HEAS (health at every size) registry, and I'm hoping to find a dietician in my area who can help me change my diet without triggering all the trauma around growing up fat.

It still hurts.

The last time I was at my dad's house, there was a printed page on the fridge of ways to lose weight. In the same house as my younger half-brother. He's ten.

He's just a little boy. He's too young to know any better. Who is going to tell him that, no matter what size he is, he's still worthy? Who is going to tell him that his fat is not a failure? Who is going to prepare him for the onslaught of medical discrimination? I wish I could, but for my sake, I had to cut off my and his bio dad, meaning that I may never see him again until he grows up. I don't know if he'll ever get to see me again.

*He's just a little boy.* He's *ten*. He deserves so much better. He doesn't deserve to go through what I went through.

***He's just a little boy.***

I feel so helpless, even as progress continues.

After all, who would listen to a fat person?"
is this even ptsd??,3,ma2mz2,1,"ive had multiple past traumas with men that led me to being extremely afraid of men to the point where i would literally tremble when one tried to talk to me. i managed to heal after getting into high school bc the boys in my school generally knew to respect boundaries etc and are all pretty 'woke' esp in recent times. 
i was okay for a while but this guy im talking to is being rly nice to me but critiqued a story i posted abt the vast differences between the measures men and women have to take to not be harassed and that somehow triggered my trauma and got me really stressed. i didn't even consider what i had to be trauma until i actually thought about it and just thinking about what people have done to me made me sob and shake. but their behaviours were so normalised back then so i didn't know it was bad, i always thought i was being weird and a coward.

I'm having problems with my flatmate. A while ago we were cuddling and kissing and he asked me to do something sexual which I declined. Then next day I tried to flirt/joke about it and he acted like I did something wrong so I was upset. Yesterday when we decided to talk about it he thought I was upset about the kissing. He claims he didn't ask about anything else. He insists it didn't happen, not even that he might not remember (he was at least tipsy and I was sober). It makes me feel terrible because it reminds me the way the guy who assaulted me gaslighted me the next day, it was exactly like this. So now my flatmate is a trigger and I already struggle with sleep plus I'm starting to doubt myself. He can be selfish and ignorant but I don't believe he would lie on purpose. We had another fight previously but at the time I just decided to accept he isn't capable of understanding me for the sake of my mental health (not speaking to him made me physically ill and depressed). I was in a better place before this talk and I don't need him but right now I'm feeling terrible and dissociating.  I can't move houses either. And unfortunately I quite care about him so it hurts me seeing him hurt. But wouldn't be surprised if he's a narcissist. I wonder if I should even bother explaining him how damaging this is or just cease any contact"

Is my PTSD still valid?,1,ma39us,10,"I (27F) was gang-raped by three men nearly ten years ago now. I went through a very long period of denial followed by a breakdown in summer 2017. I'm doing a lot better now but I've had a couple of friends recently suggest that ten years is a long time to come to terms with a one-off event that only took place over a few hours. One of them was sexually abused throughout her childhood and keeps reminding me that what she went through is so much worse than me and that I'm making too big a deal out of it. 
I was quite proud of how far I've come since then but I still have flashbacks and nightmares sometimes and now I'm wondering, am I just weak? Should I be over it now when so many people have been through worse?

UPDATE: Thank you everyone for your kind words, I think I just needed some validation that it's ok to process things at my own speed and feel what I feel. Thank you."
Ptsd torture pls someone help me,9,m9p0jn,3,"I have given advice on this platform numerous times. And I'm sure we have all heard, you never take your own advice. 

I get it. I don't want to say mine's different, because everyone's trauma is different. 

Ptsd is a syndrome. It's not discriminatory. 

But what happens, when child abuse isnt child abuse?

I've recently been told that my abuse is not considered abuse over the 18, but actual torture techniques. I never talked about it. I heard stories (I grew up in Saudi Arabia), but never imagined that was me. Because I was an adult, and my father moved to South Africa, no consequences. 

I never thought it was ""bigger"" than abuse. But after years of dating navy SEAL s, they all tell me the same thing: what my dad did to me are torture techniques. Those are real torture techniques they have done in order to access important information.  Except in my case is was executed  when I didnt scrub the fridge with a tooth brush if he saw something he considered dirty. 

I didn't know that pouring hot oil over your kid so their hair falls out isnt normal. I didn't know that hand prints bruised in Deep purple aren't normal, or that stripping naked and sleeping outside wasn't  a normal punishment, or stand on your head on concrete for 30 min wasn't regular punishment (list goes on). 

The worst part about this ? You would think people would have intervened. They didn't. Because my parents are wealthy af. Their wealth almost killed me nearly everyday. 

The reason I'm talking today is because, I've done everything you can think of in terms of treatment, including ketamine and the FDA trials with MDMA. Nothing is working.  You name it, I've done it.

I've come to a point of radical acceptance.

However. How does one forgive their mom for being the bystander? I am estranged from my dad (my choice), but I told her tonight that while she has been very supportive, no amount of guilt cloaked under the guise of support will ever allow us to be close. I'm 32. She's 64. I lived on my own, started a whole new life, but have been helping my mom since she retired from covid. As a result, I spent money on getting more education and hopefully getting my master's next year. But I haven't been able to work as a result. I don't have the financial ability to 'pick up' and leave. 

Now that I've been told about the torture (or rather, have it redefined as torture), I'm having night terrors. Except I leave the house. Unclothed or clothed. I go to different places, apparently to seek help. Except Im not awake.. I was told that this is also very rare. (Great)

I never remember this, I always wake up IN the same position so unless I have Security cameras I can't tell. ( I have hid keys in safes, locked doors, moved furniture so I don't leave), so that never works  because your unconscious mind picks up small details. 

HERE IS MY PROBLEM,  I'm drinking heavily. All the time. I'm not physically addicted, but emotionally, ""therapeutically"" I act like it. I know behaviour modifications are in order. 

I feel so Lonely, my ptsd type 2 complex is so rare it's only written about or mentioned in 6 medical journals.

Roommates,7,m9ozw9,0,"How do you deal with roommates when you have PTSD? Or in the grander sense, living in the city? I experience a lot of sound sensitivity and general restlessness. I'm afraid to wear headphones or ear plugs because I can't hear my surroundings, but if I \*do\* I get shots of anxiety. (doors shutting harshly, stomping feet, indistinct screaming). 

My current roommate is very calm/quiet but he's not really working with me in finding a new housing arrangement since neither of us want to renew the lease (loud neighbors). I can live with him, and I'm genuinely scared he'll just suddenly give me zero notice about finding a separate situation without me. I've tried to express that this entire process is really stressing me out because of my past, and because I'm transgender, but he kind of waved my fears simply due to the fact we live in a socially liberal city. He told me to ""be flexible"". I'm being flexible by virtue of not having enough money to live on my own. I'm being flexible by completely forfeiting location by offering to move closer to HIS work when I have to take the bus and he drives. I offered to pay more rent than I am now, to pay more than half of the deposit... Everything but flat out begging. I just want stability, it's not even about being attached to this roommate. I just can't deal with the fear and process of having to move in with a stranger and potential abuser.

 I wanted to get a pet so I could start to heal from losing my mom and dog back to back but I don't have the money. I want a therapy dog but I work on my feet and outside... Until I find a better job I'm stuck having to depend on others. I'm so sick of feeling like I have zero control over my life. I can't lackadaisically treat live like an \~adventure\~ because I'm poor and mentally ill."
Has PTSD played a part in you walking away from God?,121,m95sgh,80,"I was raised in a ""Christian home"", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?

Even if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: 

\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.

\- God is good.

\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.

These phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. 

Perhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. 

If there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.

I'm sorry for the rant, but I had to get this out. Thanks for listening."
I want to go to therapy but scared to ask,3,m9s2ch,1,"I really want to go to therapy because I think it will help but I'm scared to ask most of my trauma is caused by my parents and it would seem weird to ask to see a therapist, for a while I thought I was bipolar but I don't know how to get diagnosed I'm still a minor and don't know how to get help also I don't really trust counselors because the last time I talked about my trauma they called cps"
"just over here, quietly losing my mind and trying to go on with my day to day life.",9,m9ky0m,3,"Ever remember something terrible that happened and have it trigger a runaway cascade event that triggers even more memories?

I've been remembering so much shit lately. I will never be able to say for certain if any of it is truly valid but it's vivid and a lot of it *does* make sense. I've talked to some people about it and they seem to think I imagined all of it. Which maybe I did, I don't know.

It mainly pertains to sexual abuse, sexual assault, and my time as a firefighter/EMT. I just packed a lot of things away. I want to talk to people about it but I'm afraid everyone will say I'm making it up. Maybe I am making it up. I don't know. It still feels invalidating as fuck.

How the hell could I possibly have all this shit happen to me? It seems improbable. I feel like an imposter."
How do I get past this,2,m9synj,2,"Tw: mentions of sexual assault and past self harm

Throughout my lifetime I’ve dealt with abusive relationships. My first was when I was 13 and he was around 18. My most damaging was at age 16. I was raped four times by my boyfriend at the time but didn’t know it was SA. Since then my personality has drastically changed, I dipped into self harm a little bit (Im a month clean and am not planning on ever going back) but it’s been theorized by multiple doctors that I have PTSD. I also have dealt with traumatic health emergencies, multiple hospitalizations and surgeries which have contributed to the trauma as well. My parents don’t understand why I’ve changed. They call me lazy and ungrateful because I can’t get out of bed. They say I’m overreacting when I say I get a panic attack if I see anyone similar looking to my rapist. My mom constantly complains that she has to micromanage me because I won’t take care of myself if she doesn’t. This is only layering on more trauma and stress. If anyone was in a similar situation to me, what is your advice. I’m 18 currently and I’m not knowledgeable about this type of stuff. It’s really taking a toll on my entire life and hate living like this but I feel trapped."
"Recovering from what happened in 2020 is a true struggle. How have you coped, what's your story?",13,m9iocc,0,"My PTSD is the highest it has ever been for a sustained period (10 months counting at full over-drive 😬) from all the violence that happened last year in my city. How have you been coping with how 2020 effected you? What's your story? 

Here's mine:

 I wasn't doing well on 2019: I was on disability leave from work due to PTSD  (there was ashooting at my office) , and was in an IOP the day the pandemic hit; spend 13 months in almost complete isolation now - no job, no social contact. 

During George Floyd I got locked out of my apartment, alone, with a dying phone, in a city on the edge of open rebellion. I hid under a van, while police, protesters, and looters battled in the streets; I still have nightmares. I walked into a 711 for medicine and food, and a guy pulled a sawed-off on me. The National Guard occupied the city, even brought a tank. It wasn't safe to be outside for many days. 

It happened again in October afterover more police brutality and cerwfew. Then again in November when Trump came to the city, and Federal Forces showed up. Then again in January....I'm burned out from it all, of all the hatred, the killing, the beatings and guns.

I've been threatened on the street, and in line at the store for wearing a mask by militant Anti-Maskers. I've watch police interrogating people in the parking lot near my apartment, and guys in all camo with guns driving around flying alarming flags. Shit feels unreal sometimes; I dissociate and it feels like a bad dream. Other times I obsessed about it and have panic attacks, flash backs. I struggle to sleep and have nightmares every night. 

It's not like this everywhere. I'm moving away from all this in May becasue I can't living like this; its killing me. Everyone in my apartment building fights with eachother, everyone is so stressed. I'm a wreck, but I keep reminding myself that I'm surviving a historical catastrophe and one day ill look back on this and me able to say, "" yeah, I survived 2020 and I have a story to tell""."
My 5th home invasion in my life now has me absolutely shell shocked...,14,m9f7ep,7,"I contemplated even making this post but I think getting it out there & just expressing how I feel now might help my healing process. Nobody can really relate (or at least I feel like that) to my situation given how unique it is & the amount of times I have been violated. It’s hard for me to talk about it all without getting into a ginormous spiral of excitement & drastically overwhelming myself, too.

Anyway. You might ask yourself how a regular person manages to have something this unfortunate happen to them so many times. But it’s as unbelievable to me as it is to anybody who sits to listen to my story.  The best way to begin really I guess is to briefly explain each incident. (I will number them below)

1) The first home invasion I experienced was my home where I grew up in that resides in a nice suburban neighborhood (so it was very shocking to me & still is considering I don’t know who it was to this day) was broken into randomly and $50 stolen out of my room, nothing else. Cops were called and nothing came of it to this day.

2) My Dad’s old place got broken into by people my brother had beef with from school when we left to the gas station for 15 mins- they trashed our living room breaking our tv & stealing my dads pistol and laptop along with other belongings of ours. They ended up getting in trouble for it but it was just horrible given my little brother & my Dad & I didn’t have really any money to replace the things stolen and damaged. 

3) Then - I moved into my first place with my close buddy in a rather sketchier but still halfway decent side of town . My duplex got broken into by my friend who I consider my big bro that got all tweaked out on meth with his dad & thought it was a good idea to break into my place when I was at work. They stole $1200 and my safe, other belongings of mine. (Luckily to this day I have made up with him, he is clean & about to pay me back & I am thankful for that, though he truly hurt me & only added to my paranoia / ptsd. I never called the police or reported this given he is my good friend of many years & I love him . 

4) Then - within months later (At the same place as incident #3) I had linked up with a girl through a friend that I have known since I was young. We hit it off & I ended up doing the whole whoop with her (yea yea) & more or less- I found out that she had a boyfriend . And he was somebody according to others to ‘not be messed with’. Had I known this was his gf I wouldn’t of engaged in any sort of anything with her. But my actions were done & it was too late for me I guess. My roommate received a random phone call from him demanding to speak to me- to which he told him to kick rocks . It was weeks later before my lease was about to end that my bottom door to my music room was broken into. Luckily nothing was stolen- but I only had to do the math really to take an educated guess who had done this. I didn’t report this one either to the police as I was not mentally well & I just wanted out of my place I was living in given I did not feel safe at all with it being the second time my home had been violated.

Each time this has happened to me it has been when I am not home until this last recent incident (not even 2 months ago now) being incident #5.

5) I was standing in front of the tub on my bathroom in my boxers about to get in the shower with the water running & on my phone (wasting water yea I know sorry people). I thought I had heard the door open so & I walked around the corner to be met by 3 masked men that had entered my home through my front door that had been left unlocked mistakenly by my good long time friend from school who had just left about 30 mins earlier. I was injured attempting to defend my home (that was a sorry attempt given my gun that I carry was not on my person & across the bathroom in my pants still). I was pistol whipped multiple times splitting my head in 2 places & beaten to the ground . When I hit the ground it was mere seconds until my arms were forced out in front of me & they were zip tied . I was held at gun point bleeding badly and unable to hardly see / very hazy. 2 men ran my house as one stood there over me waving the gun to me and to my puppy who is not even a year old yet & thought it was play time basically jumping all around on and off the couch. They were inside for only minutes. One came out of my room and back into the living room and asked me what I have to which I said nothing & to please not hurt me. He returned in my room leaving me at gun point still on the ground with the other man. They then stormed out very shortly after he had re-entered my room and 2 of the 3 men kicked me once a piece in the side on there way out. I lost my pistol, $200 out of my wallet, about $70 in ones I had stored in a change jar and my phone. I live alone & have friends over often & am outside with my dog often as well. I believe that somebody cased my house , saw I lived alone & seen me as a target to be hit. I just can’t think of what for as I don’t have any sort of involvement in anything or any real beef with anybody. I stick to myself & for this to happen to me yet again and to this degree just has me overall fed up & completely shell shocked. I feel like I am never safe. I called the police & reported my stolen weapon obviously - but nothing still has came out of the case itself. I was hospitalized just for the night with a CT scan done to make sure my head was okay enough to go home & was released after I got some staples in my head . I now suffer from intense headache / migraines that occur randomly (post concussion symptoms) but luckily the medicine I am taking for it now helps that quite a bit. 

With all of these things happening to me. I just feel like it is something that will always happen to me . And I know that is a far fetched way to think- but it just feels like it is a pattern that is unbreakable - and I don’t know why it keeps happening . I cry at night often. I have panic attacks through the day that my home is at risk with me not there. Sometimes when I am home I can be okay and then the next minute I feel like I need to get out my gun & have it loaded ready to go. It’s a horrible , horrible way to feel. My heart rate increases to where I can feel my heart pound in my chest, my nose I can feel shake on my face , and I can’t help but turn to a stone &amp;  not speak or completely break down. I am getting help currently through therapy & a psychiatrist and have for years now. But now my doctor wants to change my treatment I have had for so long that’s helped me which makes 0 sense & is a fight in itself currently to keep it the same to maintain my mental stability. It makes no sense , and that along with other very unfortunate events like my little brother about to be going to federal prison for a very long time here that are weighing on me / stressing me out to the max. 

But the main point of this post is me trying to just vent & get this out there. This is my life. It isn’t what I asked for. But it’s my life. I just hope somebody sees this & maybe has any good words for me in this time of me healing & as I am trying to learn to cope. Always be vigilant and keep your eyes peeled. I guess this world isn’t as safe as I thought it was. I know it isn’t a warzone in my city or in this country. But I feel like sometimes when I wake up that’s exactly where I am & that neither me or my belongings are safe.

Thank you to anybody who takes time to read this."
Can someone just tell me I'll fuckin live through this?,23,m9b2ma,16,"Been sexually abused at 15 by my father (currently 21f) and I have ptsd, anxiety, depression, and if overthinking was a thing I swear the docs would diagnose me with it.

Don't get me wrong, I'm safe. I just don't feel it at times. I feel like it gets to the point where I dont think I'll make it past the age of 25. I dont wanna keep annoying the RAINN hotline with my anxiety attacks.

I'm not alone right? I dont want anyone to go what I am going through but I want someone to relate, I feel so alone.

I can't even be in a relationship. I dont feel like I have a ""home""

PTSD & Moral Injury,3,m9j4pe,3,"Last week my husband decided it was finally time for him to talk to a professional, and upon hearing our options, he decided to go for inpatient treatment for a month. I'm incredibly proud of him because he is active duty military and his job is a first responder position so I know how hard it was for him to choose this. 

His first week inpatient was completed and they told him that while he did in fact have PTSD because of the things he's seen at work, he also has moral injury because his life growing up in the LDS church was so sheltered, that when he left home and went into the military he expected to continue seeing the best of people, but what he began seeing was some of the absolute worst. 

Has anyone else been diagnosed with moral injury? How do you manage it daily? What have you found helps you, vs what doesn't help you for yourself and from your partner?"
Coping Mechanisms,5,m9iiji,15,"When you get flashbacks, or are triggered by something..or are just plain anxious......what do you do? How do you deal with it? 
For me, it's driving around and listening to music that seems to keep any minor nagging feelings at bay...and I find that the upper eschalon of stress and anxiety would be rearranging furniture. 

I seem to have an immediate need to be somewhere else."
I have PTSD from working healthcare during covid,18,m98koq,1,"I've seen so many people in my nursing home, that I've known for years die from covid. I was there when they took their last breath. I was there when family wasn't. The pressure of these experiences hurts me so much. It's so hard going to work because I'm so scared of being the last person someone sees. I'm scared of having another covid outbreak. I'm scared of not knowing. 

The amount of people that know me by first name, and that I took care of that asked me ""am I going to die?"" Has broken me. And even if they do live through it most people left physically disabled. I've seen about 22 people; all from my unit die. 

How do I get better at possessing this, and how do I stop feelings so awful about work."
What stories or articles would you like to see on PTSD?,10,m9byx1,15,"Hi, all! I do some content writing on the side and a mental health website is going to start paying me to write for them. As someone who lives with C-PTSD and other conditions, I'd like to focus at least some of the writing on PTSD and have some ideas.

My trauma is worse than I thought,1,m9pe38,0,"I was abused by my mother for 19 years, was sexually abused the summer after high school, and then met my abusive X that fall. It was a long timeline of shit that never got resolved and I’m still struggling to deal with it. I have intrusive thoughts, a lot of horrible dreams, and it all is still on my mind a lot. I feel no hope in my current relationship (it’s been 3 years since I left my X) because of the abuse I suffered in the last. I feel so bad that he has to deal with my fears and trauma and I try my absolute best to not let it affect us. But I can’t shake that feeling of dread, and the feeling of self preservation I have had to develop to survive. I am on antidepressants and they help me get through the day, but I feel like I am still not moving forward. I have tried therapy before but it’s always just 30 minute sessions where I talk about my problems and they give shitty advice and I leave. Never had a good experience with it and it almost feels like no one could help me without me spending thousands and it taking a horribly long amount of time."
Does anyone feel undeserving of their diagnosis?,11,m98xbc,12,I know the majority of people think only veterans or people who have gone through extremely dangerous situations have ptsd. I was diagnosed by my therapist due to an act of assault against me by my ex boyfriend. I don’t think I can ever accept this diagnosis even though I know i’m struggling I just don’t see anyone who can relate to me. Nightmares come rarely and I don’t get flashbacks. I also started getting bad years after the event happened. I feel really embarrassed being part of this community when my struggle doesn’t compare nearly as much as the other people who have suffered.
The rage is killing me slowly.,1,m9muc8,3,"I suppose my ptsd is a bit different than most. I don’t feel most emotions anymore, I have become an enraged animal in a way.

I’m always angry, when I say angry I don’t mean normal anger, I mean crazed insane want to tear people apart angry. It’s like another personality inside me, a wild beast of nothing but pure violence and rage and my mind is the only thing keeping it in. I’ve been betrayed and abused by almost everyone I’ve known, have severe ptsd and am constantly on the verge of snapping. I’m not naturally violent either, I’ve just spent my whole life pushing down and suppressing this rage that I can’t feel anything but this now. I can just think of a memory and become enraged and it’s all I can do to control myself. Honestly idk how much longer I can live like this, I’m so exhausted from it and my willpower cannot last forever. I try to explain it but even my psychiatrist doesn’t understand or listen, I really wish it was in fact a tumor causing this but I don’t have medical insurance anymore so I can’t even get the mri I need. I’m just tired of the rage, of the madness in my head and pushing it down. I have been losing my mind even today just thinking about things that would just anger a normal person but send me into a near psychotic state and a part of me wonders why I’m like this. Yes I had an abusive youth, I’ve tried to kill myself several times when I was young, had people try to kill me and even been beaten by police and thrown in jail for something I didn’t do but what I have is like a wild animal clawing at a cage at people watching it. I wonder if honestly there’s something more than just ptsd, if it’s some kind of brain damage or something. I just know I can’t keep going like this but don’t know what to do."

I have nothing to give back to them except for a load of garbage that my fucked up childhood has thrown on me. I feel it’s unfair for me to get involved into someone elses life because the only thing I ever do is destroy things. I can’t maintain healthy relationships and everyone seems to leave me in the end. I know I’m a lot to deal with and a lot of people just want positive energy around them, but I just wish someone would stay.

I watched my mom walk out and leave when I was 6 seen my dad do drugs like cocaine and crack right next to me until I was 27 and I’ve seen him over dose 3 times. I am no one and I’ve done nothing with my life. Ive struggled my entire life. I have been in and out of jobs and now I’m on disability for severe ptsd. I watched my brother and step brother have all these connections through their parents and have all this help. They were both taken under someone’s wing and taken care of and trained or got jobs that way but not me. I’ve always had to do things on my own and I’m at the end now. I’m no one. Never went to school, tried to join the military but was disqualified. Worked basically everywhere. I live with my girlfriend who is very amazing but isn’t sure about us after 3 years because you know ptsd affects everyone and she saw me be suicidal a lot and even did the dumbest shit ever to get her to go away so I could kill myself. This past year I’ve been trying to get back on track and fix my self and our relationship. I did wrestle in high school and was lean but now I’m 29 and obese. she won’t have sex with me because I can’t breathe and I don’t blame her. I eat once maybe 2 times a day but that’s from depression I think idk I’m just not hungry. I tried to call my therapist but she won’t answer. We have this thing where if I’m struggling and doing badly mentally I call her and she’s there for me. I do call like maybe once every month besides our regular sessions but only when it gets to me needing help. she’s been really bad at picking up and it sucks because I need someone. I know she’s busy and not doing it to hurt me. I just hold shit inside until I can’t anymore and so me and my gf argue. she’s not attracted to me anymore because I put on weight I’m skinny fat got a gut lol. I’m trying to lose weight but it hurts so damn much. my body hurts beyond being sore and when we run she sees I can’t breathe and my legs give out on a light jog. it sucks so much because I use to run miles and was fit and now I have horrible purple stretch marks and have breathing problems. I get why my body is ugly to her. I just need help being motivated because right now I got nothing."
Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse),150,m8psfb,18,"TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again. 

I am starting to enjoy sex again and I'm just so happy I do. They haven't ruined it forever for me, I can heal and it's me that gets the credit for that. I am taking my power back."
Why do you think so many resources for ptsd in women and victims of abuse is focused on codependency? Why the intolerance for otherwise “healthy” victims?,12,m91v0a,12,"I first tried AlAnon and later Sanon since they were specific to the kind of trauma I’d experienced. Instead of focusing on healing from abuse, they seemed to do the opposite. After being in 3-4 different “chapters”(?), I felt that they normalized the abuse and paradoxically labeled any reasonable trauma response as part of the codependent traits that needed to be corrected. I can’t speak for them, but as a non-codependent, it seemed at best, the blind leading the blind and at worst, predatory. There’s something distinctly off about telling codependent abuse victims to rely on a (male) “higher power” while simultaneously indoctrinating them that they’re somehow implicit in their own abuse. Bottom line is there was no support for someone who was focused on they’re own recovery, not the addict. I tried and never got anything out of it. 

In fact, the referral to AlAnon came from his addiction counselor and everyone I knew after I left him and was directly responsible for the door opening up for him to cause unspeakable trauma for another three years. 

I called around for support groups for ptsd, victims of abuse, betrayal trauma, etc looking for the right fit. When I talk to the people who run these groups, they’re asking about my experience and without fail, they start to project on me. It’s like there’s no room for a non-codependent person and that my presence as such is some kind of threat. 

Everything I say is twisted around to fit the codependent narrative trying to force me to admit to mindsets and feelings I don’t have under the premise of wanting to help me not have them. I’ve lost count of the times I’ve been baselessly called an “empath” or “a caretaker” on one of these short calls. They don’t accept a polite no and frustrate themselves trying to force it. Next thing I know I’ve got a hostile person on the line and I’m shaking because this is the exact kind of word twisting and manipulation my abuser did. 

I empathize with people who are struggling with codependent patterns but it seems there is no room for a “healthy” or otherwise balanced person to get help with ptsd. I want to regain normal function from very real symptoms like paralysis, or shaking, or my physical body shutting down due to subconscious stress.

So why is there such low tolerance and little help for a non-codependent victim of abuse? Isn’t the ptsd enough to focus on in a ptsd group? Why do I have to fit a narrative of being “attracted to” red flags? Or trying to “fix” someone? What about the rest of us?"
How to feel less like I’m on auto pilot and be more present.,3,m921ar,0,"TW: murder, grooming

I am just venting here but when I was 18 (5 years ago) my childhood best friend was kidnapped and murdered. I’ll save all the details but I was a part of the search team and such and it was an extremely life altering experience and very traumatic. Before that I have to admit I lived a fairly blissful and sheltered life (parents super religious) aside from fighting a lot with my mom (I was also an angsty teen) but after this event a lot changed. They were my best friend and I couldn’t cope with going back to college and working and just being a person and I just tried to block out every memory of them, which was a lot of memories particularly throughout high school. Also looking back, I was groomed by a much older man from 17-18 but he introduced me to drugs (nothing crazy, but hallucinogens) which was also a lot to deal with. I didn’t realized I was I was groomed until therapy, I thought it was a consensual relationship and I was just mature but he was 31 and I was 17 so...yeah. After my friend died everything felt like a blur. I was constantly getting high and drunk, constantly severely anxious, and violently depressed and had vivid disturbing nightmares (I also didn’t realize this was PTSD until therapy). After a horrible night of overdosing at 20 I quit all drugs cold turkey and haven’t touched anything since. That and therapy helped a lot.

Fast forward and I met an amazing supportive partner, mended relationships with family, made amazing friends, got a cute cat, and went to therapy as I feel like I’ve stated a lot here haha. One thing I’ve noticed though is I still sometimes just feel like I’m on autopilot. Like everything is going by so fast. I started Zoloft about two months ago after having severe panic attacks again and although that has helped a lot, I still just go through times where I just feel weird? I don’t know how to explain it other than feeling disassociated but it’s like I recognize it more in hindsight. My memory is still all jumbled up (I also got diagnosed with hypothyroidism which doesn’t help the memory stuff) and I just feel like things are flying by sometimes. I usually feel like I’m better and things are better but it’s just like I can never quite feel the same as I once did about myself and life and everything. It’s not depressing, it’s just confusing? 


Has anyone else experienced this? Do I need to up my Zoloft dose lmao? I feel like I’m in the prime of my life (in my twenties) but I also feel old. I want things to just slow down. I feel like all of this happened a while ago and I just wish it would stop affecting me. I feel like a different person (better in tons of ways, but worse in some others) I left out a lot of other weird crazy shit that’s happened between now and then but idk I’m kinda rambling but basically things just feel like they’re flying by me and I just want fix that and feel more present and in control more often. If you’ve made it this far, any advice on how to do that?"
Feeling extremely afraid currently; experiencing my first real trigger - alone.,5,m90j5n,3,"TW: rape/near death

My grandmother told me that there would be a power outage from 9pm-6am, but never told me the date. Well, the date is today and I will be handling this alone. I have not slept in almost 2 days now. Things have not been good in my life. And I’m always terrified to sleep after being awake so long because it feels like.. the night he had his hands around my throat. It feels like dying and so I tend to just stay up until I physically can’t. 

But, here’s the thing. I very very rarely ever get truly triggered by anything - especially to the extent I am currently. I’m literally in tears, shaking. I just got off the phone with a good friend who offered to pick me up (I’m on Xanax and stuff so I can’t drive) and let me spend the night there, but.. I just,. I don’t want the first time I meet his wife (who, despite us having not met in person yet, have become very very close because she deals with a lot of the disabilities I do). 

I have my dog. I made sure to do a lock check. My phone is only at 20%, so I don’t know what I’ll do when it dies, but.. I wish I knew why I was so afraid. I’m not afraid of the dark, maybe I’m afraid of what or who is in it? 

Another reason I decided to stay home is because.. I’ve felt extremely weak lately. Physically mostly but emotionally as well. I feel like this is some test from God or the universe or whatever is out there. To prove to myself that I am strong and that I can do this and that it’s going to be okay.

I just wish I knew why this effected me so strongly."
Sadness,12,m8t5eo,2,"I can't find words to write much, but i am just having a very rough night feeling paralyzed with sadness taking over, flashbacks panic attacks and feeling of guilty all at once. just wanted to share nothing more."

I am 24. Every time i get a flashback or think about my trauma, it feels like my heart breaks into pieces and i have a huge pit in my stomach that won’t leave for days. It’s like my heart physically hurts from sadness. 

I try to avoid thinking about it, but it happens sometimes and i need to recover for days. My muscles are sore, my head hurts, i feel like i have the flu. No one understands this and i feel like i’m a whiny child. I wish i could just suck it up but i just can’t do it anymore, i am so tired and still getting pushed by authorities to work, go to a million sessions, phonecalls, meet ups while breaking apart further and further mentally and physically but it doesn’t matter to them. If i skip something, there will be consequences i can not take and are probably even worse than my life right now.

I am completely broken, physically and mentally, but they are still pushing me to do all these things because “its good for you” and it will “make you feel better”. I wish. 

I hate my life. I have no control over it because i have no money and have PTSD. I pray i will die peacefully in my sleep so i don’t have to live like this anymore."
"Teacher thinks I'm faking it all (my gender dysphoria, PTSD, and panic attacks)",12,m8p1xh,10,"So... about a month or 2 back, I wasn't able to get my homework done. I got kept after school, and they were sympathetic about it at first. Still wasn't able to get it done, and this second time they yelled at me for it. Even guilt tripped me into making my other teacher cry. In addition, that other teacher told me what she went through (during the first time after school) and yelled at me for not getting it done even though she told me that. They saw me harming myself and did nothing but call me an attention seeker. After that, I haven't been the same. Every day is living hell for me.  Fast forward to yesterday, I texted my dad to pick me up as I felt like I was about to have a panic attack. When my teacher found out I did this, I was trying to hide it by pretending to be upbeat around my friends, joking around a bit. She yelled at me in front of everyone and I broke down. She then thought I was 'acting'. Next thing you know, my teachers won't let me use my phone while others can and they told everyone to not call me by my preferred name and pronouns. Now even when texting my sister I feel hesitant to talk about this stuff even though she fully understands and knows I'm not a faker. If I moved schools, I'd be bullied again (one of my traumas was being bullied for 3 years) so I don't know what to do anymore."
Husband laughed at comic about strangulation,17,m8muye,6,"So last night my husband was reading Calvin and Hobbes (which is great) to our daughter. They were reading for a while (which is great) but nothing was ""haha"" funny, just kind of funny. Then he got to this part where the mom says something like ""if it weren't for \_\_\_\_ I'd be choking you right now"" and my husband laughs about it.

The problem is about 10 years ago he strangled me and left bruises on my neck and face and chest and I was in pain for months every time I even swallowed water. Last night was perfect other than that. I didn't want to spoil the evening so I said nothing even though I found it very triggering and kind of bizzare on his part as I've explained to him that he can't make jokes about strangling people (he used to) since he HAS STRANGLED ME.

AITA for being so upset about it? And now it's the weekend and I don't want to wreck our weekend by saying something (he's a narcissist and so calling him on this would mean he's probably verbally abuse me and blame me for wrecking the weekend for all of us etc., it would mean a big fight)."

From a young age I was abused by my father, both physically and emotionally. (Trigger warning) At first it was getting hit by the belt or for speaking out, then it was fist. As I got older the physical abuse stopped but it became verbal abuse, every single day I’d hear how much of a piece of shit I am. I was 8 when I’d heard him call me that and it never stopped. I never understood why I felt like this when I was younger, I remember I’d get really scared to talk to people, and shake a lot, I would hear voices of my father in my head and I still do. I would tell my dad because he was the only person I could talk to because I was scared of talking to adults. He would tell me it was nothing and I was just over reacting and to not bother him.

I have a lot of problems in my life. Am I REALLY the problem?,0,m91cj1,2,"I have a lot of horrible relationships, especially to other people I don't know online.

Some of the time, I would, but only for a little while. Other times, people would say that I'm the problem, how dramatic or stupid I am, etc. It's like one little jeer and I fall into a hole of insanity. The same jeers go through my head from every morning I wake up, every night I go to bed, and even in the dreams I have. I have a rough time standing up for myself without either feeling guilty or foolish, someone roasting me back with something even clever, or running away to sob. I hide my guilt with my anger a bunch of times in my life. I hate the thought of giving in to my insulters, blamers, and accusers because it would end up being my loss for their gain. I learned that while dealing with a troll, it made me look worse while everyone actually sympathized with him and took it all out on me.

I feel painfully shamed even if I'm being applauded. It's like whenever I feel proud of myself, I end up feeling guilty soon after because I feel like I'm showing narcissism. Yes, I have a lot of problems, especially personal ones. But am I the problem like everyone says? Are they right about me? Am I truly the problem?"
I hate how I've been treated by the people in my life closest to me and I cannot forgive it,38,m8ecyb,3,"TW: self-harm, suicidal thoughts, substance abuse, emotional abuse, and trauma

I've dealt with mental illness (including C-PTSD), drug addiction, and emotional abuse. I feel worn down and tired. The past year with chronic pain has pushed me to a breaking point. This is something I really want to scream about as an aspect of my life that causes me a lot of pain I can't cope with. The only way to describe it is misery. I think I've cried too many times, I just want to be heard in any capacity.

I started using drugs after having my anxiety professionally treated by being diagnosed as-needed Ativan, which was for panic attacks when I was around 10-11? So from then on, consistently through my early teens (later made daily, changed to Xanax). Taking a pill makes me feel better, clearly, so what if I did more. Having relief of any kind was prioritized, potential harm didn’t matter because I had no reason to care about myself. If a chronically anxious and depressed teenager is already suicidal and harming themselves then overdosing doesn’t matter. When my mom found out I started smoking and abusing substances around 15 is the point she began yelling at me directly in my face. I was more miserable and considered abusing drugs worth the yelling, I started shutting myself down mentally to deal with it when it happened.

About 16 my dad physically walked out, my parents never loved each other, I was used to them verbally arguing loudly since I was really young. My mom berated my dad and criticized him constantly. She will claim she never yelled, which is a bald-faced lie to make to a child who could hear their parents arguing in their closed room from the kitchen downstairs. He gradually started shutting down and then left. After that, her anger was transferred to me because I was the oldest child in the house. I don’t forgive my dad for leaving, never will, because the verbal abuse wouldn’t have escalated towards me specifically if he wasn’t a coward who knowingly abandoned his kids with a wife that he — as a grown man that served in the military for around 30 years — took drastic measures to get away from.

The drug addiction ramped up from there and became my primary focus in life. My grades never slipped but I put forth zero effort, I was high at school and blacked out a lot from that time period, wish I had treatment as an option. My mom turned it into something that felt like a game that functioned to make the abuse more extreme. To have it acknowledged that I had in my possession weed, a pipe, and 30-40 hydrocodone pills directly by my mother at 16 but receive no help besides a lecture about felonies (my dad knew, shrugged about it to my face)... and then for my older brother I idolize to question my integrity as a person when I escalated to heroin in 2020 was demoralizing. Stigma from drug use has severely damaged my relationship with him, that’s when he started dismissing any time I contacted him out of desperation that my mom was abusing me. Everyone wants to be pissed off at you but not acknowledge that you were suffering pretty fuckin openly for years and getting worse.

\[My mother knew that I was on drugs the entire time I was using heroin, from the literal first time I picked it up, but for some reason waited a few months to randomly drug test me to prove how she was right. I guess so I would become physically addicted and consumed by it, so she could then force me to cold-turkey withdrawal for a week under the threat of cutting me off completely.\]

This is a vent about things I’ve been pissed off about before, many times, but god damn it sucks. Had input from my current therapist that she didn’t think I had a chance once I was put on benzodiazepines and I probably would have never become a drug addict otherwise. But addicts are terrible people, so clearly any treatment towards me has been deserved. Just ask the person who responded to me once by saying “but you did do heroin”, my brother."
NDE and it keeps replaying in my mind (NSFW),10,m8kxdv,4,"This is a big trigger warning. I’m sorry if this hurts anyone who reads it.

Someone tried to murder me with a large knife. I was stabbed in the lung and was bleeding to death, I accepted I was going to die while I laid on the concrete. The ambulance came, took me to the hospital...I had a bit of hope.

In trauma I started to pass out and I heard the loud voices and racing around for a blood transfusion for me. I lost two liters of blood and I couldn’t breathe. But I accepted once again that I wasn’t going to make it and was sad that this is how I was going to die but so it goes. It was calm, somber, but okay.


I survived and made a 100% recovery physically. But that NDE absolutely shattered me mentally. It bothers me every day (it’s been about a year since the incident) to think that I accepted death and was willing to go. Nothing has been the same since. I have a therapist and I’m trying to cope but the little things all seem meaningless now. I know it sounds so emo and dramatic, but it’s how I feel most days. I somehow always wind up back on the table in the trauma center, looking at the ceiling and feeling like I’m gonna die again. It’s not a flashback per se, but more of a washing over of sadness again. 

I don’t know what the point of this post was. It just feels good to say it to people who understand."

How to form meaningful healthy relationships,5,m8qq71,5,"In any interpersonal relationship; friends, romantic relationships, acquaintances, classmates, I have it always goes 1 of 2 ways.

The 15% extreme happened again recently with an older student who is my supervisor. I shared more than most people do about my life and struggles and have a closer relationship with him than other supervisor/supervisee relationships. It's nothing romantic, maybe I just wanted support and he was willing to listen to me...maybe because I think he's really great at what he does so it meant more to hear his opinion of me...idfk...but I cried and got so angry with myself because I messed up again and now I feel weird about it...Why does it have to be either extreme? Why can't I be in the middle with relationships, why can't I be normal? I'm 27 and I still struggle with this. I told my therapist this incident and she said it is common for people who experience severe trauma to feel these extremes and struggle to have relationships that are in the middle. My internet kept cutting out during therapy so I couldn't work through this and I still feel really sad about it. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to connect with people while staying in the middle of both extremes? Or have any skills or used any resources that helped you? I'm willing to give almost anything a fair shot as long as it is safe and reasonable for me to do so.. Thank you

Does anyone else experience noise sensitivity related (or not) to their trauma?,27,m8drnu,8,"tw sexual assault  


I started struggling with noise sensitivity when the pandemic started because everyone was always at home and because the memories of sexual assault emerged. At first I thought it was just extreme anxiety (I remember I was sensitive when my brother played the guitar years ago). I lived with very loud people so noise during the day led to panic attacks, I couldn't escape it. Then I moved to a nicer place with quiet flatmates and I gradually got used to the noise. If anything, I just get annoyed at loud sounds when I have a bad day but it never gets really bad. Apart from the night time... Unfortunately, I had another incident happen recently and someone accused me of lying which destroyed my sleeping pattern. Since then, I've been having sleep anxiety, I had to start taking anxiety medication that helps a bit. A new flatmate also moved in recently and he likes cooking at night (my room is right next to the kitchen). I told him to be quieter which he is now but not completely so I still have panic attacks sometimes. I'm also quite anxious when he's around simply because we never talk (he doesn't seem to be home most of the time). My therapist says it's because I don't feel safe at night and possibly fear being attacked. And I try affirmation to fight it, I wear earplugs, play white noise and sometimes wear ear defenders but I can still hear him moving the plates. I guess it's possible his presence itself makes me anxious. Is anyone dealing with anything similar? I wonder if you found a way to cope? I don't know anyone with a similar problem so would be nice to connect with someone."

Others have been through worse.” The reason why we do this is because it’s our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that’s exactly what it’s doing, causing more damage. Think of it like a fever. A fever can help you recover. When the fever gets dangerously hot, your body is still using this as a way to protect itself but in reality, it’s just making the illness worse. 

I also use apps to help with my trauma but none of them have anything to help out with this symptom when they really should as it is a very common and miserable symptom. That’s all I have to say. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
Hot flashes and involuntary movements / mumbling when I get flashbacks..what is this??,2,m8lqez,0,"I have no idea if this is a PTSD related thing, but I was in a weird relationship that super messed me up like two or three years ago. I get flashbacks to things at least 3 or 4 times a day, and when the flashbacks hit I immediately just blurt out ""no"" or ""f*ck"" or whatever. This is really annoying because its a reaction to the memory, and I've honestly had it come up in meetings before and I've had to play it off like I didn't just blurt out a string profanities under my breath. 

Ontop of the verbal stuff I get really jumpy and have to move or run my hands through my hair or just anything. I often get really over heated too when it hits and it typically lasts for like 5 or 10 seconds. 

Anyone know what I'm about talking about or can relate in some way? If so, any tips?"
How do you deal with brain fog and bad memory?,17,m8ceak,2,"These symptoms are what personally frustrate me the most. I want to get my life together and learn new skills to get a job, but that seems like such a lofty goal when I forget what I'm trying to say mid-sentence or I forget what I'm trying to do barely two seconds later. I feel like I can't function and it's discouraged me so much that I've stopped looking for jobs with the skills I do have because I'd be seen as slow and incompetent in a work environment since there's a lag."
It's hard to talk about my trauma,4,m8jk71,4,"I have have ptsd stemming from years of childhood trauma and i have a really hard time actually talking about it. I am in therapy and I know I need to process the trauma, but I am having a hard time even starting my trauma narrative. I was wondering if there was anything any of you guys have done to prepare for something like that?"
Intrusive thoughts and delusions,3,m8l9sx,0,"
Any advice would be appreciated. So I’m feeling pretty down and kind of embarrassed, there’s a few things I want to talk about. It really terrifies me and embarrasses me how much my anxiety from PTSD can warp my brain. 

I saw this picture on Pinterest which was posted under a nice drawing post, it said “turn your phone to read” and when I did it said “if you dont repost this this will be the worst week of your life” I was panicked, and surprised I was panicked, this was clearly made by a kid and I’m supposed to be an adult why am I freaking out? My brain is pulling together and identifying the effects of the “curse”.

Ive become extremely paranoid and refused to read my emails incase ive manifested a rejection letter from University from this...its so humiliating that this has bothered me so much I feel like I’m crazy. I’ve been already anxious about my university application, I’m applying to a lower level prep course so that I can progress but work on my inner child.

Ive spent all my energy and time even though I’m struggling badly to make large portfolios and organise it, everyone has been telling me my work is impressive and that there’s nothing to worry about and I’ve already been accepted to the higher level course at another University but my brain is making me feel sick with intrusive thoughts, I guess its insecurity, I guess I feel I don’t deserve it deep down. The intrusive thoughts spiral as I feel I’m almost tempting the fate of failure by thinking about it happening due to these thoughts which generate more. 

this is my first time applying on my own and I feel if I fail I can only blame myself I know a lot of this is to do with childhood insecurity but when the thoughts are there I feel like my future is crumbling and Its my fault identifying intrusive thoughts has helped but admittedly they break my confidence. I feel like I should be confident against the odds and a fighter but I feel shaky and like I’m merely surviving."
Intensified nightmares with weighted blanket :(,1,m8o4fn,2,"Every time I use a weighted blanket to sleep, I sleep better and longer, but have the most vivid nightmares, or at least I can remember them better. My only possible explanation for this is that I am getting more REM sleep. I’ve already tried Prazosin and don’t know what else to do. I’ve pretty used to them and can start my day okay, but will still be thinking about these images all day."
Can you fully recover from PTSD?,14,m88b6b,4,"TW: Sexual assault 

I was taken and pretty violently sexually assaulted when I was a freshman in college 3 years ago. However, at the end of last year, I finally got justice! After a long two and a half year investigation and a week long trial- my rapist was sentenced to 14 years in prison. 

I’ve struggled with PTSD due to the assault for years now. However, I thought after court and after my rapist was sent to prison- I would feel better. I thought I would feel safe again. Like I could relax. However this isn’t the case. If anything the court case made my PTSD worse. My therapist thinks the trial completely retraumized me, even though the outcome was what we wanted.

Is it possible to fully recover from PTSD? Is this going to truly affect me the rest of my life? I go to therapy. I take some medicines to help with the PTSD symptoms (sleep issues, anxiety, lack of focus, etc) but I feel like this is never going to go away. It’s been 3 years. My rapist is in prison now. I feel like I should recover at this point."

"I anonymously reported my rapist after 3.5 years (Success, and venting, advice appreciated!!)",13,m83uxf,5,"CW for sexual assault 

Background: I was raped and manipulated by a boy I liked and who was in my friend group  in my dorm my freshman year of college. For a lot of reasons, namely manipulation, fear, gaslighting, and complete denial about what happened, I didn't report him immediately after the assault. A few months later I had come to terms a bit with what happened and was ready to report him at least to my University... And then he got in trouble for attacking a member of staff in my dorm while high on cocaine. He should have been immediately expelled. Instead he had a hearing where he pleaded and said some ridiculous sob story and the disciplinary staff at my University bought it and he got off Scott free with only a minor warning and he had to switch dorms. He bragged to friends that he could get away with anything because the university was invested in his big sob story and felt so bad for him. That scared me once again into not reporting him. 

&#x200B;

It's been 3.5 years. I am about to graduate from University. I have PTSD now and have suffered hugely because of the assault. He ruined my life. he still goes to my college and I see him walking around. In September My University got into the news for their treatment and handling of sexual assaults, it's a prestigious university and they care a lot more about reputation. An anonymous social media account was made which revealed a massive problem at the university (our only fraternity was revealed to have a MAJOR problem and they have since done nothing about it other than ""give consent trainings"". This inspired me to start to open up more about my experiences. I told friends. But at the same time, I felt horrible because I never reported him. He could and likely will hurt more people and its my fault that I was too ashamed to speak out. 

Because of the bad press, my University started something where students can anonymously report people online. Two days ago I did it. I wrote down all the details, when, where, his first name, and specific details about who he was. But I didn't share my name. I thought at least they'd look at his file, see he had a history and talk to him. But apparently they do NOTHING with anonymous reports because they don't believe them, it's just a way to placate the press. I want to feel empowered that I spoke out about him, but I also feel like it's useless because nothing will happen. 

Here's my dilemma. Should I come forwards with my name so that an actual report can be filed? If I reveal who I am in my report, will he find out that it was me that reported him? I am so scared of what happens when you report, but I feel like a failure of a survivor if I don't. I feel like survivors are only viewed as strong if they report. I know this is a word dump. I just needed to write it down. I needed to celebrate that I reported because I didn't tell anyone! Should I feel guilty about not reporting sooner or with my name attached?"
"TW: Cancer, abuse, death",2,m8d1p2,0,"How do I cope? I’m a 23 year old who was abused up until age 20. I don’t remember the childhood abuse from my mom much, mainly my dad. But as I turned 13 or so, it got bad with my mom. Eventually years later we found out she had cancer and only had so much time left to live. I was basically her spouse at this time. I was 17-19 and just. Raising my siblings, working, cleaning the house, taking care of her (dressing her, cleaning surgery wounds, giving her shots). Eventually I realized I needed to get out (she pulled me out of school at 12 so I had no connections and if I had left, I was homeless and would be on the street and had no clue what to do) so I talked to an online friend and planned to move in with him. Two weeks after I told her she told me she thought she was dying and that it was my fault because I broke her heart by wanting to move out. A week later, she went into the hospital for labored breathing and later died that week, on my birthday haha. It’s been three years and I still don’t know how to fucking cope. When the anniversary of everything comes around, my nightmares get so severe I get non verbal for twenty minutes after. What do I do??? Help"
How mdma therapy works?,1,m8fw7p,4,What the drug kicks in? Just remember the trauma and you accept it sufdenly with open heart?
I’m triggered.,23,m7vn6e,13,"My father was an abusive alcoholic druggy who sexually abused me throughout my childhood, most of which I don’t remember. I was brainwashed into thinking it was okay, normal even. For 11 years of my life, he abused me and manipulated me. As a forgiving person, I reconnected with him a year ago, giving him the benefit of the doubt (nonexistent btw) he continued to manipulate and gaslight me, which was easy because hardly anybody in my life believed me because my abuser claimed I was always a liar. It’s all stupidly ironic in retrospect.

Most of the ptsd I suffer from his actions (and all the ptsd I received in foster care) are tolerable, manageable at most, with the coping strategies I have established myself.  

I see him in my face,which fucked me up for a while because he told me I wasn’t his child and I believed him. Wrong, I’m a spitting image of both my parents. Most days I cannot stand to look at myself. Some days, I look in the mirror, I don’t recognize myself and have a panic attack, so I avoid mirrors as often as possible. Coping mechanisms aren’t as effective for my visual triggers because they’re only suppressed for a short period of time while the trigger is a constant. 

The thing I just cannot escape, is my hands. My hands and quite literally a fucking replica of his. I see my hands as my abusers hands.  He took a part of me, my identity, and reclaiming it is so hard when i have a constant trigger literally in my hands. Sometimes I get my nails done but it doesn’t always work. And that’s not an option at this time because of lockdown. Other than that, I have no ‘healthy’ coping strategies so I think I may resort to wearing gloves 24/7. I’m a student and can’t even get my schoolwork done without being triggered.
I literally cannot win. I am continuously shown that my life is full of unending suffering."
Angry song suggestions?,4,m86de9,11,I was looking for song suggestions to add to a playlist about my abuser. I'm looking for songs that are angry in tone or are vaguely threatening. I really want to take back my anger against my abuser using music as that seems to help me a lot lately. Thanks!!
I need some support,3,m83x85,2,"Tomorrow is my moms birthday. 3 years ago on her birthday I forgot to give her a birthday present and she grounded me. Later that day she had pushed me to the ground and told me how I wasn't worth her giving up medical school for and how she wished she never had me. That night I had suicidal thoughts for the first time.

Being that said, my depression gets really bad around her birthday but usually I can handle it. On Monday tho, she kicked me out of the house of 3 hours. This whole weeks she has been upset with me about me losing all the silver ware and now I'm getting flashbacks to the day 3 years ago and feel absolutely awful."

TW: he's doing better now and i am still so stuck,1,m8b774,3,"Boyfriend is currently playing video games with friends haha, so I guess I'm yelling about this here.

I know I shouldn't have. I kick myself every time I do, but god it's like I can't stay away. I have secret accounts, 0 followers and 0 following, that I used to use to just vent to the void. Occasionally I'll use them to check up on an old bully or someone I hate so their recommended doesn't show up on my personals, but I can still see if they still seem like a p.o.s. I've had these accounts for years, even before we ever met. When we were dating, he had no idea. I barely ever spoke. Barely got the chance to speak, really. I never talked about myself unless it was about my parents, my sexual assault, or my various mental illnesses, but he didn't really know me.

We fell in love in the spring, made it official in the fall, and he finally showed me his true self throughout the entire winter. Winter is now the most triggering part of the year. But the worst of it is during the seasonal changes. Fall going into winter, he slowly became worse, we slowly became worse. He was a master manipulator, and I watched myself become so much more timid, apologetic, and small. All I did was for him. I just wanted to make him happy. If he was happy, then we would be okay. I wanted to be beautiful for him. I wanted to be perfect for him. I would starve myself to stay pretty and petite for him. I shoved away all my friends so I could give him all of my time. If we fought, it was always me that fucked up, I didn't fight for him enough. I didn't show him enough love. I wasn't being authentic enough for him. I'd try to explain why this was happening, that I didn't mean to hurt him, I didn't mean to make him cry, that I was so sorry and I'll do better next time. But he would keep me there, locked in his car, screaming and crying because he just wants someone who loves him as much as he loved them, and I wanted so very badly to show him that I did. He'd ignore me for days after a fight, tell me he never wants to speak to me again, and then after he missed me, he'd beg for me back, say he doesn't care if I'm not perfect, that he loves me and he wants to work with me to be better, and I was so grateful that he gave me a second chance. And then a third. And a fourth. And a fifth. And a sixth. And every time I thought I really did lose him this time, how could I? How could I be such a monster to hurt him like that? How could I be so stupid? He'd tell me, ""god I love you, but I really don't like you."" And I'd say with a half smile, ""yeah, I understand.""

I knew when he was angry immediately. I learned how to sense it, even before knowing for sure. One time, we were in the car with friends, singing badly to some sad song we all loved, thinking everything is fine, but I suddenly felt incredibly uneasy, so I look over, and he wasn't singing. He was staring straight ahead. His face was blank, and he wouldn't meet my eyes at all. I felt my heart drop to my stomach, and nudged him a little, but he ignored me. We were on the way to a local play a friend was in, one that I didn't really know that well, we never really spoke. There was this big cast dinner right before it, and he dropped us off and went to go park the car. I went to the bathroom, and came out hoping to sit next to him. I didn't know anybody there really except my group, but they were all  talking to other people about inside jokes I didn't know and I just wanted to hold his hand while we ate. I wanted to know what was up, because he seemed so happy before we left. I was planning on asking him. And I get a text. He's not coming anymore. ""Go have a good time,"" he says, ""I'm turning my phone off. I won't answer if you call. Don't worry about me. I'm going for a walk. I'll see you in 3 hours."" I knew I was being tested. I didn't see it that way at the moment, but in the back of my mind, I knew that if I did not go look for him, he would leave again. I wouldn't have shown him that I loved him. And I didn't give a fuck about this dumb play with these people I've never spoken to. I didn't want him to be alone out there, walking in freezing October rain. If he was going to suffer, I was too. I spent the next 3 hours walking around with a flashlight, trying to conserve my phone's 15% battery, searching the entire woods around us, the entire shopping center, the entire community play area, some neighborhood nearby, a baseball field, anywhere he could possibly be. All I had on was some skinny jeans, a t shirt, and a jean jacket with a hood, but I ignored the biting cold and my soaked jacket because my discomfort didn't matter, what mattered was finding him and making sure he was okay. My phone eventually died, and I became more distraught. It was getting darker, and I couldn't see where I was stepping anymore, so I finally resigned and hoped to wait for him by the car. I sat there for another 30 minutes, the play had finished, and everyone came back asking where the hell was he, since he was our only ride. They all went inside again to wait, but I stayed right there on the hood of the car. He finally came back, looking down, hands in his jeans, and opened the door without saying a word. I sat inside and asked him ""what the fuck?"" He was pissed. I should have left him be. He didn't owe me anything for looking for him. What did I expect when I practically abandoned him to lie just to fit in with our friends? That he expected it from Girl1, or Girl2 but me??? That I knew how uncomfortable the song I was singing out loud made him, but I just pretended like nothing happened, like everyone else has. Nobody actually gives a shit when it's hard to, and I was no exception. I almost didn't take him seriously. All this, over a song?? And I was hurt, and angry, and I just wanted him to fucking apologize for leaving like that and worrying the shit out of us just because he was mad at me. But he was getting more and more angry, more defensive, and I was getting overwhelmed. He sounded on the verge of tears, and I was already starting to tear up myself. I couldn't speak. He begged me to just say something. I didn't know why I couldn't. I wanted to. And he finally breaks, and begs, ""god, why? why doesn't anyone ever fight for me?"" I managed to choke out, ""I'm sorry."" He just sighed. And then I break. ""I'm sorry. I should've just let you go. I know you were overwhelmed. I'm sorry for not putting you first when I knew you were uncomfortable. I love you, please. Just. I really missed you."" ""I missed you too."" I reached for his hand, and he rubs the back of mine with his thumb. Our friends start coming back when they see me crying, but he goes ""it's okay, seriously, we were just talking."" We drop them all off back home, then ride back to my place in complete silence. He pulled into my drivethrough. ""Goodnight."" ""goodnight, hun."" I walked into my room, and cried for the rest of the night. And it wouldn't at all be the last time anything like this happened. And it would only get worse almost every other day, or at least every week, for the next two months.

We would eventually break up that December. I was devastated, and so unbelievably worn down emotionally. I had two real friends at the time, and they were truly the only two keeping me sane. But the toxicity didn't end there at all. he'd write songs about me, that shittier friends would send me. he would stalk me over the next three months. he screamed one of these songs during a cabaret we were both performing at, a cover that he changed the lyrics to as a direct attack at me specifically. I had stormed out sobbing violently and yelled at him what the fuck. It was then when he told me I didn't deserve to even look at him. I still had 2 other classes with him, but I couldn't even look at him. He told me I was a monster. He told me he wish he knew how much of a coward I was when we met, so he could've avoided all of it. i almost attempted suicide that night. if someone i would have given my life for could say such things to me, if i hurt him enough for him to tell me that, then i didnt deserve to live. 

When we first broke up, I would spend hours looking through his account, seeing the pictures he kept up indirecting me while we were together, or commenting on his own lovey posts about me saying ""go fuck yourself,"" or changing former captions about love songs to things like ""haha nvm."" It was like a form of punishment. I would torture myself, because I deserved to be tortured, and I didn't ever want to let myself forget what I did to him. Sometimes, before things were as hostile, if he made an indirect post that seemed like he was sad, I would message him saying ""hey. Just wanted to check up on you."" I couldn't let him go for months. And then, one night in March, something in my mind flipped, and I suddenly realized how angry I was. How unbelievably unfair it was for him to treat me like he did. And I spent the rest of the spring uncovering the depth of my trauma almost every day. And stalking him through social media didn't feel like as much of a punishment, but more like I had a right to. He told me I couldn't look at him, well fuck that. I was going to look at every single fucking thing he did. And I was going to let myself become infuriated, every new indirect post, I would make my own vent one about how bullshit it was. How bullshit he was. And yet, even if I thought I didn't love him anymore, and I supposedly hated him, and I'm doing this out of pure spite, I still just couldn't let him go. 

It's been 2 years now. 
And eventually, I grew more, and I found someone so much better, and I became responsible, and I tried so hard to heal despite that when winter rolls around I become increasingly suicidal and irrationally terrified, and despite the nightmares that would come almost every single night of me trapped inside his car, despite the fact that the feeling of cold air on any bare skin makes me want to cry, scream, sob, and throw up immediately, despite being unable to see white priuses without falling into panic attacks thinking it's him, and despite the flashbacks with a million stupid fucking triggers like someone grabbing my wrists, or certain ariana grande songs, or the taste of my favorite trident watermelon twist bubble gum.

but God, fucking damn it.
god damn it.
I still haven't been able to let him go.
i still find myself searching his account when im feeling really low, wondering how he is, whether he's doing well. 
and he barely posts, but i usually assume that he's just as damaged and shitty as he used to be.
Until he posted another new song.
And it's a part 2 of an instrumental song that he had made for us when we were together.
The original was complex and soft and bittersweet, representing a romanticized version of our fights, where we(he) blew up, but then come down as we realize how hurt we were and how much we wanted to forgive each other. It was representative of all the goodbyes we made, believing this was the last time, wanting to share one last kiss, one last hug, sharing one last joke, and one last glance. 
This newer one was captioned something like ""been doing pretty damn fucking good lately. Things are looking up.""
I couldn't listen to more than a minute of it because of how completely different it felt. It's this metal guitar instrumental, and it's passionate and fast paced and angry. It's almost like a complete fuck you compared to the old song.

And so I looked more at his account, and a friend of his commented on the post promoting his song. Apparently they're in a band together now. Apparently they have an ep out. And they even have a tiktok. And in all the videos, he looks so goofy, and happy, and like he finally found people who he can really relate to.

And again, god, I know I shouldn't have looked, because you will always find. But it's like I'm addicted and I don't know how to stop. I've tried blocking him, I've tried deleting my accounts, but when I'm severely depressed and I have much less impulse control, I just find new ways, make new accounts. 

I feel like I'm so fucking stupid
I'm still so fucking stuck in the past
It's been 2 years and I just can't move on, even if I do move forward. I mean I have a great job now, I'm saving up for a van to move into with the love of my life, I have so many plans once I don't need to save as much (basically my entire paycheck after necessities) to look into ketamine therapy or maybe emdr, I just got my own nice laptop for the first time in my life and I'm really happy about it, and a lot of things are looking up for me too. 
But if I have all these good things happening, why am I still so fucking low? Why do I still feel like it all happened last year, why am I still so unbelievably depressed, why do I still get immensely triggered, why am I so fucking stuck here?? And how long will it be until something changes?? How long will I feel this way?? It's been almost two years and he seems actually happy now, but why do I have to be the one that's still miserable?
God I just wish that I could fully move past everything that happened to me and just live my life. 
Why did I have to fucking look godddd
I don't really know how to end this, but fuck I'm just tired. I just want to be happy, fully, and without anything holding me back."
Method i discover to heal ptsd,4,m856q8,1,"Every time you have flashback of some people tell you something bad releared to the cptsd imagine yourself with an arrogant smile like sasuke uchia

Therapist always trying to find a trigger?,11,m7u09w,7,"When I tell my therapist about my intrusive memories/episodes, she always asks me to identify what triggered it. Sometimes I just don’t know and I think too hard about it. I can see why she’s asks for sure, but is it possible to just not have an external trigger sometimes?"
Recieving trauma related medical assistance,1,m88pl4,4,"For reference I have a diagnosed trauma disorder. Recently (as in the last 18 days) I have discovered through crisis therapy at my clinic my ""trigger.""

I have purposely not mentioned my specific trauma as to not trigger others. But it does have to do specifically March and not because of the pandemic.

TLDR: Is it too much to expect medical (ie medicine) intervention short term beyond my current plan for trauma disorder when it is too overwhelming to use coping skills previously used in therapy.

I feel like I cannot adequately process this trauma right now. Doing so unmediated creates waves of panic, dissociation, and at this point, sheer physical pain.

I have been continuously told to do my ""exercises"" related to anxiety and ""self care"" to stop the panic attacks but I've reached a state where that is impossible in the moment.

I spoke with my primary care physician, 3 different therapists, 2 psychiatrist nurses, and an emergency room. The er is where things went haywire because they prescribed me a short term controlled while I'm already on one and my psychiatrist doesn't even believe in my current one so he abruptly ended our conversation when I disclosed my er visit. He put in the notes I requested the er medication when I didn't. I will find out in 4 weeks if he plans to drop me as a client.

I have explained in detail my night terrors, panic, agitation, panic attacks, body aches, lingering chest pain, inability to do anything meaningful after 3pm, and irritable feelings. I'm unable to cook or clean or do much of anything after 3. 

Am I expecting too much from my medical team? Am I supposed to suffer through the pain of panic waves? I talked to the inpatient at the local hospital and they said I'm an unlikely candidate and wouldn't be admitted (which I'm okay with because I don't want that either). I could be evaluated by a psychiatrist nurse but they wouldn't be able to help me medication wise, that can only be done by the psychiatrist inpatient. And if that decision was made, there would likely be a wait since I am not dangerous."
How can I learn to thrive and no longer survive? How can I stop feeling sucicidal? Looking for advice,23,m7moll,2,"My whole school experience has been abusive for me, I am now in university but many people made me feel flawed beyond repair and screamed or insulted me to go away and then laughed when I went away, there was lots of psychological abuse which is more traumatizing than words, if someone insults me I can answer back, if someone kicks me I can try to protect my self by stepping away, but like what was I supposed to when someone throws objects me, ruins my personal property or stalked me and provoked me because I have overwhelming emotions and it is easy to make me react. I am now out of school but I grew up too quickly and never felt like a child, and now I feel like a 8 year old stuck in a 20 year old's body due to never being childish and normal and being more mature than my peers. How can I learn to deal with my vulnerability, vulnerability is one of the core reasons I was bullied and since I was too open and friendly, I feel more comfortable self isolating and being cynic since 9/10 times people betray my trust but that is not healthy, I can't spend the next 50 years living with my parents and avoiding people. However people are the core reason I had anxiety, depression and tried to kill my self many times. Now I just cry when I process emotions but I just want to know how to thrive"
What I’ve been pushing down has exploded,3,m7xdb1,0,"A little over a week ago, I physically assaulted my boyfriend during a dissociative episode/flashback. I only remember a portion of it, but even those memories are flawed. I feel incredibly guilty, horrified, and disgusted with myself.  

I have been sexually assaulted four times since the age of 15, by three different men, all of whom I considered friends at the time. I have few memories of most of the incidents, and the first two times (ages 15 and 16) I wasn’t believed by the people closest to me because they “seemed like nice guys”. This led to me not trusting myself or my own memories, and when I woke up to a friend raping me after I had passed out drunk at age 22, I convinced myself I was dreaming. The last time I was attacked, by the same man, I fought back, but he overpowered me. My friend and his roommate woke up and heard me screaming from the other room, and had to pull him off of me. Though my memories of all of these incidents are vague at best, I know they live somewhere in my brain, because they’ve affected me ever since.  

My boyfriend and I had been having a petty little argument, nothing major, and I went to bed while he went out to the living room. I woke up to him looking for his vape in the bed and I panicked. I thought he was trying to lunge at me, and I started kicking him to try to get him away from me. I thought he was laughing at me and continuing to lunge at me, so I kept kicking and pushing him as hard as I could. When he left the room, I tried to lock the door and put things in front of it, but the lock is broken. He was trying to get out of the situation, so he came back into the room to get his stuff and leave, but I thought he had broken the lock to get to me. This is when I completely blacked out. From what he’s told me, I started pushing him and hitting him in the chest while screaming at him to get the fuck away from me. He left and I ended up calling my parents in the middle of the night to come pick me up an hour away. He tried to come back in to check on me and I threatened to call the police. I was absolutely terrified and broken down, and my parents were horrified and concerned that he’d actually done what I thought he was trying to do.  

I’ve had dissociative episodes sporadically in the past, but I’ve never gotten to that point before. My ptsd mostly manifests in insomnia, repressed memories, and extreme paranoia. My boyfriend is trying to support me, but he’s also rightfully hurt, scared, and upset. He’s had his own trauma associated with his ex-girlfriends being physically violent with him, and I feel so guilty that I re-traumatized him by letting my own issues get so out of hand.  

This incident not only brought up trauma associated with being sexually assaulted, but also other intrusive thoughts. Memories of my past abusive relationship and repeatedly watching my brother overdose and go into diabetic keto acidosis are constantly playing through in my head. My brother died the same year I was last assaulted, and I left my abusive ex that year as well. At the time my grief took precedence over dealing with my other trauma, and although that was five years ago, I know it’s affecting me now.  

I’ve previously dealt with these feelings by using alcohol or disordered eating to cope, but I’m trying not to do that anymore. I’ve been in therapy for the past five years, but I know I need to try more or something different. I’ve worked so hard to put my life back together and now it’s falling apart. My relationship is strained from this already, and I can’t hurt anyone, let alone the person I love most, ever again. I’m not sure if I’m just venting or asking for advice, but if anyone has actually read this far and has any advice it would be greatly appreciated.

TLDR: My PTSD is ruining my life and relationship, and I need to take the right steps to treat it."
Dissociating over the weather,1,m84m7e,0,"TW: guns, crime spree

I feel I've officially lost it. I don't feel like I can share this with anyone in my life, because it's so so trivial.

I live in a rough area. Crime has been up, and lately there have been shootings and assaults in plain view right outside my door. I've had to intervene in things I never thought I would. But my trauma has nothing to do with gun violence, and these events didn't shake me up all that much. As fucked up as it is, the ""excitement"" just felt like a refreshing break from the safety and monotony of everyday life. 

I sort of live under a rock when it comes to domestic and world events. Yesterday I checked back into the news as I occasionally do. I read about brutal crimes that recently happened in my city and across the US. I kept up in real time with an ongoing police pursuit of an armed suspect all over my neighborhood.

It got to me.

Before I knew it, I was *sure* I heard shots ring out outside my window. I was *sure* I'd heard a woman shriek. I hit the floor. I felt myself start to dissociate hard- the world got quiet and blurry and I floated farther and farther away. It was so pronounced that I could actually tell it was happening and somehow managed to snap myself out of it. *This is life or death, you have to stay in the present.* 

Even though my body was so sure of what I'd heard, the little remaining sense I had left in my mind told me what is now obvious: *those were not shots. You know what gunfire sounds like and that was not it.*

And yet, as the sounds rang out over and over again, my body was convinced there was a full-blown firefight happening outside. *Should I call the police? What if I'm wrong about this? I need to get dressed and get armed.* 

The sounds kept coming. *Is this a law enforcement shootout? Is this a mass shooting? How is it still going after dozens of rounds?! In the middle of a rainstorm? ... rainstorm...* 

The sounds were from the storm. I listened intently, crouched down on the floor with a pipe in hand for what felt like an hour, trying to gather enough evidence to prove to my shaking body that the sounds I was hearing were just the wind beating against something outside. Eventually I was convinced enough to stand up and compose myself.

I feel really stupid. On the one hand I am sad for myself that such an innocuous turn of events could have me genuinely fearing for my life. On the other hand, it feels really tasteless to confide in anybody about the gunshots I imagined when the country is reeling from actual gun violence. I grew up firing guns, and I'm ashamed that I somehow mistook the wind for a full-blown shootout. I'm baffled at how my mind could make such a leap."
Considering a daily vlog/stream of my recovery to help myself and others become more comfortable with vulnerability,3,m7ufm6,9,"Hello fellow humans, and thank you in advance for offering your time and space! I'd really appreciate your honest feedback about a potential resource I'd love to start offering. 

Some background info: I am non-binary but embrace a very mother-hen+bear type of energy. I am a system (have multiple alters) and manage DPRD, dissociative and psychotic episodes, autism, delusions, ADHD, and C-PTSD. I have experienced childhood abuse, sexual assault, grooming, ostracization, and religious and disability persecution, pretty consistently through my life. I am recovering from codependency and substance misuse. I've been considering lately how grounding it could be for me to lean into how unique and unstable I am, so as to help other people realize it's okay, and that you can love yourself even if everyone and everything around you is insisting you're unlovable. My biggest source of stress right now is having perspectives that can help people but feeling like I can't share them because I'm not healed yet. 

What I'd like to do: I've come to realize recently that this (^^ re: holding back) is exactly the kind of behavior my oppressors and oppressive systems want from me, and that I'm better served finding a way to make my current position work for myself and others. I've landed on making a daily vlog (whether it's rain or shine, manic or depressed, ecstatic or suicidal) that consists of my musings and processes about my trauma and recovery (some including triggering content with ample warnings but some not), my perspectives on how we can all heal ourselves and this system that keeps farming us for trauma and profit, and other things that could be helpful (sharing music, doing art together, playing games, Q&A, etc). 

What you can help with: Is this something you feel you or others could benefit from witnessing? All of my life, I have been either admired, preyed upon, or insulted for my compulsive dedication to absolute authenticity. Though to me, it's one of the most beautiful things in the world: I truly believe that my ability to be pure and vulnerable without fear of judgement, despite it having lead others to wreak havoc on my life, can change this world for the best. Especially given that my intent is to help others with it. I want to normalize being emotional and vulnerable, sharing things online other than toxic perfection, and witnessing ourselves and each other for where we're truly at rather than judging for not being somewhere ""better."" We are always exactly where we're meant to be!

How you can help me: If you do think this would be helpful, do you have any interests, recommendations, or suggestions, on how you would like to see it managed, or what you would or would not like to see? This would eventually expand into my accessible healing businesses that will include animal therapy, disaster relief, crisis intervention, conflict resolution, community advancement, etc. 

Thank you so much to anyone able to read this, and to those willing to offer feedback."
Triggering yourself,1,m82s39,8,"So I have trauma due to police violence, and sometimes I purposefully trigger myself by watching the videos of those nights (it was at a protest).  Is it normal to do that?  Purposefully triggering yourself?  I don't know why I do it, and obviously it doesn't feel great.  It's weird and i don't really like it.  But i was wondering if anyone else does this...and yea"
is this normal?,3,m7ub1f,2,"tw: S/A 

why do i keep daydreaming about when i was being groomed and was in an awful and abusive “relationship” with this person? it’s almost like subconsciously i still enjoyed being played with mentally and almost miss it? i assume it’s bc even if it was just grooming i still felt loved and i’m trying to chase that feeling again at whatever cost? can someone give a logical explanation bc i feel crazy :,)"
Today marks a year since those shots were fired.,40,m7fm8s,8,"I was shot 5 times at basic point blank range my army friend said I should have ear damage from those rounds being so close. The story is on my account somewhere I think. The doctors said it was miracle after miracle that I survived and most people don’t get 1 miracle let alone all the ones I got in a short period of time. 

I’m recovering slowly but I have to admit this first year has been rough. I still can’t go to the area without being filled with anger and I wanting to do something I can’t say on Reddit. The event caused me to get heavily into opiates and anything I could get my hands on in a matter of weeks not even two months I was doing 2 fentanyl pressed M 30 a day without missing a day. 

Heck it got to the point I was taking 6 2mg Xanax and snorting the whole pill once I let 30 minutes of taking the Xanax so I would know I got them both together which with a drug as strong as fentanyl it was very dangerous and reckless.

I was in a dark place I was barely in the stage where you feel invincible I quite literary had just become an adult my birthday had passed just around 3 months ago. I decided I needed to do better so I quit the fentanyl cold turkey. Let the withdrawals happen and then waited 3 weeks. 

Now I still occasionally take pain pills for nerve damage and to stop thinking suicidal and am now legally prescribed Xanax to use incase a panic attack hits hard. I haven’t touched fentanyl in a while. It’s been rough but finally after so long I get a couple days every now and then when I can smile and truly believe I will get past this.

It’s hard and I know it’s going to take time but I know it’s worth it and I’m proud of myself for coming so far and that’s what matters and I truly believe I can go further and heal even more. So to anyone dealing with this awful thing, always remember that things can get better and you don’t have to be stuck in that dark hole, if you need help my messages are open to anyone who needs it even if you just need to vent or need someone to talk to feel free to message me nothing will annoy me or bother me I promise."
I think I am ready to share my story.,23,m7het4,4,"Hello everyone. I (36M) am new to this sub. I am not sure I have PTSD, but I did have a traumatic experience in my teen years I think I need to share. This would be the first time outside of my marriage that I told the full story.

Vocational Rehab help,2,m7tkzv,1,"I was recently diagnosed with military service related PTSD and I qualify for voc rehab, but they want me to tell them how my PTSD is affecting my ability to get/maintain a job.

I found my friends body!,44,m7c5j0,20,"It's been a couple weeks.  I had a very traumatic event happen, I'm in therapy but find even my councillor disturbed by what I explain.  I'm very touchy and have difficulty sleeping.  I break down a few times a day right now.  Crying, hyperventilating, obsessing over details of my friends death.  It's hard to know if his death was a suicide or accident.  Alcohol was involved and he was not in good physical or mental health.  I sometimes wonder if I'll ever feel normal again, if these feelings of emptyness and images of his body when he died will leave my head.  I don't know if this is normal grieving or something permanent.  I have so much to do but no energy to do it.  I'm constantly tired, and never feel rested."
Should I quit my job?,1,m7x2y5,1,"I need to rant this out. I feel like an ass currently. I landed a good paying entry level call center job. I just poofed out of training last night, and called out today. This is my third entry level call center possition so I can't say I didn't know what I was getting into. I feel trapped in customer service. It's not that I don't like helping people. The problem is that dealing with the public takes an emotional toll on me. Unfortunately, it is the only industry I've ever worked in. I already tried to resign from this company and they talked me into giving another project a chance. But, they don't have any possitions that aren't on phones. So its not as if they can acccomodate me with a possition I'm better suited for. I don't know why I keep trying customer service when I know I am not emotionally capable of doing it at this point in time. I just really don't know what to do. Any advice will likely be appreciated."
Shame after episode?,74,m73v5b,9,"Does anyone else ever feel tremendous shame after a dissociation episode? I rarely have the perfect storm of being triggered, going fight instead of flight, and dissociating in the same event and so I’m a little shook. 

Last night I had a rat in my shitty studio apartment, which isn’t the end of the world or directly triggering in of itself, but I dealt with them for two years and that was very stressful and this was the first one since... anyway, I didn’t sleep well because of that, then this morning the construction site outside started with this concrete saw at 7:00am that shook my windows it was so loud, then they added a jackhammer. 

My service dog was upset my the noise and started barking and then she starting alerting me I was having a panic attack and all the noises just snapped me. I just disappeared. 

Turns out I called and screamed at the wrong construction site, armed myself with a self defense tool and went out and screamed at the construction workers until one told me he understood 100% where I was coming from but that he couldn’t do anything about it he was just trying to earn money for his family and I snapped back to conscious of my actions. 

Of course I apologized but I feel terrible every single time this happens, which thankfully isn’t very often anymore, but I just feel so ashamed at not being in control of my self. 

I guess I just wanted to rant and figured you guys would understand. Thanks."
Hyper vigilance,10,m7i1zc,6,"I've recently identified why I act the way I do, its due to being in a constant state of hyper vigilance. Its hard to turn off the feeling because I sometimes don't even realize my behavior, until someone asks me why I'm always in a rush or why I notice everything going on in my surroundings at all times. Hoping someone with experience may have some advice to help me with this. Its made me form many bad habits and even an addiction trying to calm myself."
PTSD is about to cost my job and I’m losing my mind.,16,m7dib3,8,"I got my dream job and I’m going to lose it due to PTSD. I literally can’t handle the pressure and it’s shutting me down. I started this job a few months ago and it was going well until my “training” ended. I had a performance review meeting last week that confirmed what I already knew. I’m slipping behind. I’m missing things that can’t be missed. The role is too important to the company and I’m failing. They put me on a month long “improvement program” that ends with successful completion or termination. 

I’m finally in a place where I’m stable and should be able to function, but I’m literally falling apart. I’ve been in therapy and on meds for a year, I started this new job, moved into a nicer and quieter apartment. I’m working from home. There’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to function and focus and get it right. I feel like I’m in school again. I can understand everything, but I just can’t do the work. I don’t need someone to explain it to me, I just freeze up and can’t finish it. I’m having all these flashbacks to my mom screaming at me and shaming me for not finishing my homework. 

I’m sitting in my desk chair, in my home, shaking and crying uncontrollably because I made a small mistake and had to resend an email. It’s unbearable. I can’t eat, I wake up sweaty well before my alarm goes off. I spend a good hour each day in the bathroom because the anxiety tears up my stomach. I’ve probably lost a couple pounds too because I can see my ribs more now than ever before. 

And I blame myself. I 100% blame myself. Because everyone else can suck it up and get the job done. But I can’t. I was the first of my friends to graduate. I was the first to get a real job. I was the first to move away. And now I’m gonna be the first of my friends to be fired from a job for being too fucking stupid. And I have to sit there every day until they let me go facing my mistakes and stupidity."

Surviving in Academia with PTSD: Anyone else out there at the graduate or post-graduate level with PTSD?,17,m7c9e6,5,"Hi everyone! I have complex PTSD, and I recently joined a group for women who have experienced trauma because my symptoms exploded in January due to dramatic and unexpected life changes. The group meets 3 hrs/day, 3times/week, which is really a lot and kind of overwhelming to manage with my new job. The women in the group are nice, but I feel like a lot of what I'm struggling with right now is trying to understand whether or how I can continue my career trying to manage my mental health issues, because I am currently an academic--which requires heavy cognitive effort, focus, and skill. It's so damn hard to have a job that relies on my mind being at its sharpest and finest all the time

I just completed my PhD in December 2020, and then started a postdoc immediately in January. So, I've survived in academia for a long time, and it has taken a terrible toll on me, and increased the amount of trauma that I have experienced. I've had to take two separate leaves of absence due to PTSD explosions, and I'm currently nearing the end of the second one.  I am wondering if there are other academics out there (including grad students, postdocs, faculty/professors, or people in industry positions that require a PhD) who would be willing to talk about their situations in private DMs? I really want to be able to share my experiences of disclosing/navigating PTSD with people who are more jr. to me in academia (i.e. grad students/postdocs who may be struggling the way I had to), and to learn from people who are more senior to me (i.e. faculty, industry researchers) about how they have navigated.  I know this is a little specific, so maybe nobody is on her who meets that criteria... but the special pressures of academia require special treatment, and I figured it couldn't hurt to at least put it out there and see what happens.

If you already know of a safe space for academics with PTSD, I'd also love to hear about that or get recommendations for that!

Thank you for reading. I really hope to connect with people to share knowledge and help figure out a way through. You can send me a DM, or comment and I'll reach out to you over DM if you indicate in your post that it's ok for me to do that."
Being constantly triggered ( I think I should include trigger warning),1,m7p20o,1,"One of my triggers is people coming into my room, be it strangers or friends, I can’t handle either. Living in a student accommodation, one of the worst things is that the staffs keep coming into my room to inspect this or that at least once a week, they say it’s part of the agreement that I signed up for and it’s for my own safety so I can’t refuse these inspections. What’s even worse is that I have no idea what time would they come, they may say they will conduct the inspections on Thursday and Friday, so I would have to suffer for absolutely two days, unable to do anything, unable to sleep at nights, nothing could possibly interests me, I feel so sick that I can’t eat anything, I would just anxiously await, as if awaiting my own death, until they finally come and be done with this whole inspection. I’m sorry if this doesn’t make any sense, my mind is not functioning very well."
TW: CSA--- Can this still be traumatizing?,6,m7gd3k,8,"can childhood sexual abuse still be traumatizing if it only happened once almost a decade ago, I didn't realize it was abuse until years later, it wasn't violent or life threatening, it wasn't r@pe, and the perpetrator was a woman? This was my situation, and the past couple of days, especially today, I've really been invalidating myself because it could have been so much worse. I have so many symptoms of being traumatized (flashbacks, upsetting dreams/nightmares, frequent dissociation, extreme touch aversion, and depression just to name a few), but I feel like it can't be that bad or trauma because so many people have had it worse or even feared for their lives and realized it was abuse right off the bat.

I had before that, trouble from trauma, depression period and ADHD ( hypersensitivity/empathy/ etc....) and suicide attempt. With all this shit in mind I got in a place for my studies in woodworking were for a long time I tried to bury everything in work/ begin a new life . Also I'm a big sleeper ( and depressed ) so all of this was never a good idea and almost everyone being rude was the icing on the cake.

I kept this rhythm for one year before everything begins to shreds apart again the first week of my second year I almost lost a thumb because I was a complete mess all the time (I am not bad in my job but people sometimes get mad because I'm me ... you know...and it creates arguments and I don't now how to handlw them and I have panic attacks etc... ) trying to hide everything despite I promised to myself to never do that.

I tried a lot of things nothing never work out and then covid came. It pull me out of a lot of stressfull things and help me heal, rethink my life. 

When it restart again I was in a more confortable and  had lot more autonomy.

But, I get beat up (again).... on my bike during comuting... I stop cycling despite I was in a very good progressions, gain 4 kg (a lot for me ) and it reveald everything It broke all of my mental barriers all the different personalities i tried to create of  myself.
Everything came bake twice as fast and the littlest thing became huge.(like being able to sleep in a quiet environment).

And also new I can't be touch on the back without completely freaking out.

Right now I only stay up because I'm used to being completely fucked. I know how to deal and prevent panic attack, stress period, stupid euphoria etc
...

But it still happen and I'm completely aware of it.

I'm just feeling like despite everything I try I'm just a bunch of trauma that can do anything with confrontation (i was in rebellion before now I just lost hope on that point ).

"I need a break from my mother who traumatized me, but I don't know how to make it happen",3,m7g9p2,2,"I grew up in an unstable home, dad took his life when I was 8, mom began drinking and leaving me and my brother home alone, my brother took it out on me and would ""bully me"" for hours, mom would get angry when I texted her to save me. I would get punished because my brother would upset me etc. This is just the short version though, haha.

So, I am an adult now, living in another city. I've realised that I need a break from her. I only feel anxiety whenever I am contacted. But whenever I talk to my mother about boundaries, she gets defensive or interpret me as a villain, then she'll gossip with her friends about me. It scares me a bit that she'll talk behind my back to my father in law who lives in the same city as her. I feel like I am in a prison where I have to abide by her. She's also guilt tripping me on not spending time with her and my brother. Because my brother is so depressed and I should feel sorry for him. Just like when we grew up and he ""bullied me"", I was the inconsiderate one.

I don't know what to do, she doesn't even know about my PTSD. I have no security network other than my partner. 

For clarity she wasn't always bad. We had some normal times too, even as adults. She's periodically nice and periodically like a child."
CBD cannabis oil,11,m78cgo,0,"Lexapro has been giving me side effects so I have been weaning down with cannabis oil, one with high cbd content (about 2:1 cbd:thc). And it’s amazing, I feel like myself again. I was worried that I would get anxiety or paranoia from the cannabis because that has happened before. But none of that happened, I do feel a bit less sharp but it’s helped with all the lexapro withdrawal pains like headache and I feel better in terms of mood. It’s been helping me do introspective work without being judgmental like I am usually and it’s helped a lot. Im taking more since I’m dealing with the lexapro weaning off but once it’s better I will lower it. Just thought it might help someone. Maybe higher cbd lower thc for you to start, like 5:1 or more. I like having a clear head so I’m looking for a higher cbd ratio. But I think a little thc helps than pure cbd, but majority should be cbd for anxiety. Take care everyone."
I think I was molested by my cousin,0,m7l992,4,"A memory from 10 years ago resurfaced, of I think my cousin molesting me we are both female and she was a year younger than me, I remember being close with her but after a while I didn't want to hang out with her anymore I thought it was because she was into girly things and I wasn't a girly girl but I think I finally know. I'm still trying to process everything because it's still new to me we were around 6or 7 years old she didn't touch me (I don't think) but she made me do sexual things like making me hump a pillow and pretend we were making out I honestly don't know if anything else happened but this has been bothering me I feel like I was molested but I don't know if it counts I was so uncomfortable but for some reason I thought it was fun and I just feel so guilty and disgusting, I need someone to lmk if what I'm feeling is valid because I feel like I might be overreacting. 
I also have 2 other experiences that are a little more serious
1. When I was around 6 years old my dad said my nipples were ""weird"" so he sucked them to ""fix"" them this was another memory I forgot but I don't know if he truly was trying to help me or not. I don't think my dad is a creep.

2. I think it was around the same age my older sister pressured me to make out with another kid that I didn't want to do I'm not sure who the kid was but I repeatedly told her no but she told me she wouldn't tell and I listened to her because she was older (around 10ish?) And after she pressured me I tried making out with this boy and she told on me, this really messed me up because I got made fun of by other family members even though I was forced to do it I remember crying about it later. 

I'm just so confused about everything but please I want to know if this was molestation. I feel so gross"
Recovering Trauma Memory?,3,m7fgm2,1,"Hello,

I have a friend who is experiencing some repressed memory resurfacing. What are some resources he can use to recover memories? Or is recovering memories the solution? He currently hears a song from Church music, and is devoted to Jesus and all. But he has no male friends and is around females. He is often perceived as gay, but often makes relationships with girls. He tells me he's not gay. But that's besides the question. He manifested homosexual acts. Apparently, either his family member or pastor forced him for a blowjob while the Church music was going on. 

What are some ways to recover the memory of who did it? And how does one deal with this traumatic event? Should he avoid christian church altogether? What is the hope for him?"
I just need to get this out somewhere,4,m7abo4,0,"First of all, trigger warning for combat.


This is my best March since 2003 yet so far. I haven't been drinking heavily, I haven't retreated completely in on myself, and I've only cried every other day. But today and the last couple days have just been so heavy. I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time and it's been a constant barrage of bad dreams and bad memories. I'm also constantly angry. This morning I was walking my dog and I caught myself checking all the angles for enemies. When I caught myself my brain immediately switched into a memory where we ended up in a minefield and an overpowering urge to run and get away from it. While my VA therapy did fall through over the holidays (I may have forgotten to call to schedule the next appointment about a 100 times) I did learn it's useful to get the memory out. Recite it. Over and over again. This is in furtherance of that. If you don't want to read it, fine, whatever, I just need it out there.

A few days after the first wave of soldiers invaded Iraq they were deeply in trouble. The Iraqis were threatening to cut off their supply lines. It was decided the 101st would go in next and secure those while trying to engage the Medina division. This was, for us, just a few days after we had a member of our division attack our brigade command, witnessed a friendly fighter get shot down, and numerous scud alerts, (none landed near us at this stage). So we were very much already on alert, already walking around armed and ready to fight.

When we left the camp they were playing heavy metal music over the psyops loudspeakers. We were all high on adrenaline. I was gunning a pickup truck style humvee. That adrenaline quickly wore off in the face of boredom as we drove to the Iraqi border. As mortars we had to not only be ready to fight off any direct attacks, but also be ready to put our guns into action and fire rounds to support our leading elements if they got into fighting and needed the help. So we were intently listening to the radio as they got into various situations, none of which I remember.

As we approached the border ourselves a sand storm blew up. We would later joke that we brought our unit's rain with us. Visibility dropped to mere meters and we had to slow to a crawl not to hit other humvees. This seems like a good time to mention that the Iraqi/Kuwait border is one of the most heavily mined areas in the world. The engineers had marked the safe route with red stakes. So when the visibility opened up again for a second and we found ourselves on the wrong side of the red stakes there was no small amount of panic. We all noticed at the same time and we all shouted for the driver to get back over on the right side right the fuck now. Our platoon sergeant also politely requested our presence on the safe route over the radio. This was my first real experience with fight or flight where I thought death was a real possibility. My ass puckered, my muscles tightened up, I started grinding my teeth. About 30 seconds later we were back with everyone else and our introduction to war was over. I relaxed a little and felt like I had run a marathon.

There were many other things to come that year. (Not least the fact that it would be a year and not a couple months) But that was today's fun memory. If you were in a certain place at a certain time there's probably enough here to identify my unit within the 101st. I have ceased to care about that getting out there, NFS."
I had an episode yesterday.,2,m7h56f,0,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here despite lurking for a few months. I served almost five years with an extension, on active duty and deployed twice to combat zones. Despite all of this, it's been an uphill battle to get back to a somewhat normal way of living. I've been unemployed for about seven months and have been using this time to bond with my girlfriend's dogs. She has two female dogs, and they've been living with me almost as long as my girlfriend. Well, one of them has had liver issues and also has anxiety related issues with a fear of men. Despite all of that we have been getting along very well and they both really just want to be by me and get attention from me. Which I find comforting. Yesterday I had taken them both for a walk while my girlfriend was at work, which is fairly normal. Nothing weird was going on aside from light snow as it seemed like the snow was gone for the season. When we were coming back in, I usually harness one first and remove her harness first, as she can be a little weird if she isn't first. When I leaned down to unbuckle the harness she bit me in the face, and missed my right eye by mere centimeters. I think I blacked out because I can't remember anything after being bit, at least until I felt the blood rush down my cheek and I went to clean it. The dog that bit me is leary of me now, and she has some cuts and bruises, but is otherwise alright. I explained it to my girlfriend, and she seemed understanding but upset, and the dog still wants my attention and love, but can be a little timid and scared of me now. I feel so bad, and don't really know how to cope with this. I was diagnosed with combat related PTSD almost four years ago now, and have seen a psychiatrist and therapist since the diagnosis. I just feel like I had a major setback and it is really bothering me. Fight or flight or not, doesn't matter, I don't want to hurt the ones I love whether they've wronged or harmed me. I'm at a loss here."
"The Shawshank Redemption, my favorite movie of all time, yet I can't watch it anymore (TW: Prison, jail, etc)",5,m7bcuw,0,"I can't watch the Shawshank Redemption anymore, even though it's definitely my favorite movie of all time, because it triggers my PTSD. I decided today, I'm gonna face it head on, and watch it again, this time with some weed, because lowkey the cannabis does help me stop getting triggered.



I've been arrested 4 times myself, for petty misdemeanors, and the last time I saw the movie I had horrible nightmares and felt suicidal. I get nightmares like every other night regardless due to other, more serious traumas I've been through.



This time, we're watching it in my virtual law class, and I'm gonna use some medical cannabis. I'll report back on how it goes


EDIT 1: Ok, I've been using some weed, and it's definitely helping. I have REALLY bad PTSD, like I can't watch after the first 8 minutes anymore, now I'm just muting it once in a while, but I'm still able to go by, it feels less serious, but still there, but it also reduces how intense it is"
Bestfriend cant grasp my illness.,20,m70oet,5,"she believes i am being purposefully difficult towards her. Long story but we've been friends since 9th grade we are both in our 40's no children.
i grew up without a mother and she grew up in the foster system..both horrible families with zero support.

my PTSD comes from sexual trauma as a child and gin violence as an adult. I cant force myself to go back to that city, although all my family resides there. My brother died in 2015 and I had to bury him as my family is chocked full of heavy dope addicts and I couldn't see him buried in a wrong way. 

this was the first time I'd been back home in 12 years...

before I left for good I lived with her and her fiance...she treated me very poorly, setting me up for conflict between friends, i didnt cut off the relationship but I vowed to focus on myself moving foward. 

Her Fiance passes away and I didn't not go to the funeral nor the wedding. he was her Husband when he died accidentally. both occurred in the city I am.afriad of. 

she was awarded a large sum of money,never once did i ask for anything.  And never once did she offer to lift me up...She knows I suffer from PTSD 

she is a partier and I am introverted...she loves bags, jewelry, shopping, 

i enjoy books, reading, and researching. 

now her Mother is sick and I need help with addressing what I should do to be there for her but keep my sanity.  I cannot go back to that city. 

please help with ideas"
TW: CSA Being told it isn't a problem (advice wanted),4,m793gt,2,"Hi reddit. Nothing triggers my PTSD more than being told that what happened ""wasn't that bad"", but lately what my parents have been on about is saying, ""Oh it happened but it wasn't bad and it actually secretly triggered suppressed memories of previous incidents that none of us know about, and you need to go to hypnotherapy to unlock them."" I'm terrified of this. I know what my problem is, I remember my assault clearly and have never once changed my story because I knew that if any detail was out of line nobody would ever believe me again, and my biggest fear and biggest trigger is being told I'm lying or trying to ruin someone's good reputation. It did happen, I didn't make it up and I'm not crazy. I also know that it's the problem that causes me the most distress. I'm so afraid that if I go to hypnotherapy I'll just end up making something up to make it stop and they'll use that to sweep everything else under the rug. I don't know what to do."
Had a nightmare after a week of losing my consistent ptsd nightmares,2,m784b1,0,"Names have been altered and stuff but I basically got a nightmare triggered by someone saying the word ""vacation"" around me. Someone i have ptsd of.

So I was dreaming about Lake. Which started out really pleasant. We had finally met irl and were living together. For some reason I was also still living with Thebi?? Weird. I figured i had to hide who Lake was to me from Thebi so I decided to be stealth around her. 

(One sec to interrupt the nightmare. It was irregular after not having had my usual Trauma Nightmares for about a week. Irl Thebi mentioned the word vacation, talking to herself.)

Anyways, it started out great, Lake and I were romantic, sensual, sexual. Just as over voice call but much better in life, Lake's voice made me feel at peace and loved at the same time as excited and supercharged. We read books together and slept in the same bed and hugged and kissed and all the good things. I felt so so so loved. But then Thebi said we had to go on a vacation[this word has always been a negative in my mind]. So we went to the airport and Lake was being distant so I went up real close to him and asked him what's wrong and he snapped at me and physically pushed me aside. I kinda felt tears just automatically press behind my eyes and I wiped them angrily. I felt stupid. But I HAD to try again. I tried to put my hand in his own and he slapped it away and I felt myself at the beginnings of a meltdown. Right there in the airport. Tears of frustration, shaking from anger, I stood there just kinda humiliated and unsure of what to do with myself. MY lover, MY life partner, MY Lake. How dare he leave me feeling so low just like that. We were told to start boarding the plane and as we walked through the terminal, I only saw him getting more unstable. And I was too. It was so wrong and horrible and oh, ""vacation"" only ever brings horrible things. I told him, ""we don't have to go anywhere if you don't want to, love."" But he pushed me away again. He said to me that I was annoying and clingy and a crybaby. That he would be surprised if I ever found an actual lover. He told me I was stupid and emotional and childish. I wanted to hit him right then and there, really badly. I told him I wanted to break up with him and for him to get out of my sight. He said ""fine with me"" very coldly and simply walked off on the place of the terminal right before the point of no return, the plane. And I was then pushed into that plane by Thebi. As I stumbled inside I felt dreadful, nauseous and claustrophobic and terrified like a free animal trapped in a cage. I wanted to run back to my lover. To chase him. To do anything and everything i could to get him back to me. I didn't want some stupid fucking ""vacation."" Vacations always hurt me immensely. I just wanted to be close with my lover. But he had gone from me willingly, coldly. He had insulted me and thrown me away just like everyone else in this cruel life. I had nothing. And then I woke up."
Jumpy at the slightest things: abusive brother often violent,10,m70p8u,4,"I can't believe it's taken me all these years to understand the reason why I am the way I am. This is a true case of domestic violence at the hands of my older brother - the man who I once admired and thought of as my protector. 

Being told by my parents to barricade my door with my bed in case my brother decides to be abusive is not normal. Nothing about this is normal.

I'm so angry and upset."
Does anyone else have experience with their parents trying to sweep their sexual abuse under the rug?,75,m6qyqk,33,"If you feel comfortable, please share how you knew they were. also, what made you realize they weren’t on your side?"
Does anyone else dream about past traumas?,9,m72qy9,6,"Every single dream I can remember is traumatic. All my dreams incorporate past traumas into the present time. They highlight the worst aspects of my traumas and anxiety around them. I wake up feeling like I’ve just experienced trauma again and it’s absolutely awful. 

I go to bed trying to listen to good-dream meditations, but that does no good. It’s come to a point where I’m scared to fall asleep every night. 

Anyone else?"
Venting/Long Rant (warning: SA talk),2,m7c04c,0,"I (26F) have been through a slew of traumas growing up.  None of them gave me PTSD.  Developmental issues for some of them, but never PTSD for most of them.  A car accident did a bit.  So did a two year hellspan as a child of multiple things (gang violence/threats, cop harassment, sexual/psychological abuse, isolation, puberty/discovering my sexuality).  I ignored it all mostly.  I grew up not realizing how fucked up I was despite looking back now and seeing lots of warning signs.  After a lifetime of multiple traumas I didn't get therapy til I was raped almost two years ago.  Suddenly my whole world has crashed down.

I already have a tough schedule.  I have an internship, three polyamorous relationships (only seeing one person rn due to covid), a fulltime overnight job, trying to learn to drive, caring for two incredibly needy cats, taking care of my SEVERELY depressed partner that I live with, and fulltime online classes.  I graduate this year in May.  Now I also have to deal with therapy and really looking at how deeply fucked up my life has been and I just have no motivation most days.  Even with depression I used to just chug caffeine and power thru things.  My future goals (to be a homelessness focused social worker and leftist activist) motivated me.

I know ptsd is technically a form of brain damage.  I should be easier on myself.  But I've gained 50 pounds, have gotten physically weaker (I used to work out), I am using weed way more than I used to, my memory and focus are gone,  I feel numb and tired and like there is no point anymore.  I'm always trying to be strong for some reason so feeling less strong the past year is killing me.  I am not suicidal at all most days, but I do have a slight resentment for my mom most days (even though I adore her and we even relate on both having ptsd) that she didn't abort.  

I can't bring myself to job hunt for a state I'm excited to move to (other places lessen my ptsd generally).  I can't bring myself to care about talking to people.  I can't bring myself to do basic shit like brushing my teeth.  I wish I could just lie around daydreaming, sleeping, showering, listening to asmr or bodyscans, or cuddling with my partner.  Even things like video games, listening to music, watching tv,  and creating art that I deeply love feel like work now.  Every little thing feels hard.  I am giving literally nothing my all anymore.  I don't hate work or school or my internship, but I just don't care.  I'm wishing I could just drop everything some days and start over.  My body is numb.  Memory and focus are gone and sometimes looking at my homework just becomes a blob or another language and no thoughts can form.  I'm tired.  I've been thru so much.  Everytime things feel a little better another traumatic thing happens.  I just hate that life is like this and it makes it hard to care about any obligations.

I've been sexually assaulted so many times.  Even my healthy sex in life had unhealthy thought processes behind it and I did a lot of stupid shit to myself internally.  There is literally no guarantee that working to improve myself will matter when yet another person decides to abuse me in some way.  I'm angry that the world is like this.  I'm angry that I'm not fixing my life the way I want to yet.  I had finally reached my peak self before the rape and now all my work is gone."
I thought I was getting better.,5,m73tnb,2,"I don't know if this is the right sub.. I ended up having a dream recently. I know it shouldn't bother me but I can't get it out of my head. I stopped dreaming about getting assaulted years ago and it came back out of nowhere. I'm having a hard time falling asleep because of it.  Even awake I feel hands around my throat, being pushed up against a wall. The only person I feel safe with isn't really available and I don't want to bother them with this since they're going through their own issues. Does anyone have any advice on what to do to help you fall asleep? Trying not to remember the dream while I am awake and be so jumpy or paranoid? Advice on waking up from those nightmares? My dbt skills are shot and nothing is working for me anymore."
If anyone is feeling down hit me up! Keep our minds busy,13,m6vh79,3,"I’m having a pretty rough attack right now and if anybody feels like venting, maybe we can help each other out and calming each other down!"
Should I even bother with therapy? Online therapy?,28,m6pdad,24,"So, I might as well be talking about being abducted by aliens when I talk about my trauma/ptsd with others. It's too absurd, chaotic, unrelatable, and complicated to talk about. Not to mention, I hate talking or even thinking about it. I have tried to rebuild and make a new life for myself, but the terrible events from my past refused to stay dead. Instead, they managed to take over my life again and have made my present an unimaginable nightmare. Sadly, I have no decent people around to help me. So I'm forced to live with these terrible events entirely by myself.

Now, I think that talking about all this with someone (like a therapist) and them giving regular feedback would be a great help. But I fear that if I met a therapist in person, it would take them just a year to grasp what I'm talking about. All I can see is time and money being wasted with little to show for. But maybe online therapy is an option more suited for me? I'm just looking for someone other than me to even consider and talk about my scenario. 

Should I consider online therapy? Or is my scenario entirely hopeless and should I just give up on trying to have others relate with me? If it wasn't for the terrible thing that happened these last two years, I think I would have been fine with telling no one about my past."
Officially diagnosed with PTSD after surviving COVID,144,m69j99,86,"I thought I was doing better and. It just spiraled so fast. I’m having severe anxiety on the daily. Feels like there’s glass in my skin. Sweating. Heart racing (I need to take meds to keep it lower cuz it’s like 130+ even when I’m sitting). Feels like I’m stuck in this weird fog. Or black tar pit. Feels like I’m suffocating. Reminds me of when I was sick and I could barely breathe. Remembering those weeks in quarantine in that empty house all alone on Christmas and it’s just a blur of fear and sobbing. Hearing my grandma yell for help as they took her to the hospital. Hearing her beg me to take her home. Crying as I tried to explain that I couldn’t. 

I have slept an average of 2 hours a night since I got “better”. When I do sleep, I am apparently screaming and crying in my sleep. I hardly sleep enough to have dreams anymore but when I do they are nightmares. Hardly eating. Can’t focus. Can’t focus at all. Not even on fun stuff. Keep buying more stuff thinking one of these purchases will be good enough that I can actually have fun again but it’s useless. It’s just all gathering dust in my room. 

I need to learn how to be human again and it’s hard. Especially with a family pressuring me to hurry up and be normal and be okay because they don’t like seeing me struggle. I keep trying to force normalcy for their sake but I feel like I’m dying all the time."
How long did it take for you to start having regular therapy sessions?,3,m6w3o5,1,"I started therapy but I’m not sure if this is what I should expect, and I would like something to maybe help base my understanding on. 

TL;DR: Did it also take you at least two months before being able to actually talk to a trauma therapist about what you’re going through?

About a month ago I called a local mental health clinic to set up an appointment because I felt it was time that I found a therapist who could really help me. Ive had counseling before, but it was only for depression and they never even asked about my past and it felt like they just cared about learning to hide my symptoms so it never went further than a couple of appointments. 

At my intake I got diagnosed with PTSD, and I’ve only had two appointments (my intake, and another that was like a continuation of that) where we go over a brief history, symptoms, and my current life. I also have appointments for peer support, skill support (for coping methods), a psychiatrist (for medication) taking place in April. I think I will be seeing my trauma therapist biweekly or maybe weekly, i can’t remember which option I agreed to.  My issue at the moment is that i still don’t have an appointment with the actual trauma therapist, I just know that one will be set eventually. 

The event happened 10 years ago but I still have nightmares often, and have really intense periods of disassociation very frequently. I recently lost an acquaintance to suicide and it hit me very hard because some of this person’s trauma was very similar to mine. I also suspect I have a disassociation disorder along with the PTSD but of course i need a proper diagnosis before being able to say that. Because of this, I really think it would help to see a therapist sooner rather than later. 

I know starting therapy for PTSD is difficult and there is probably a long waiting list and not many people willing to take new patients so I don’t want to complain too much about the process taking too long to start. I also know that recovery is a lot of work and it’s going to take me years to make significant progress, so I don’t want to rush the process. But I have to ask, did your experiences with therapy start out similar? I’m not sure if it normally takes this long, since I have nothing to reference."
How do you fight the tiredness of life?,11,m6oo41,5,"The heavy tired you can’t sleep off. The depression, the memories, the loss, the grief....I am TIRED. MY SOUL ACHES. I am hurting."
I had a someone disturbing & triggering childhood revelation tonight (long read),5,m6tl7p,2,"Hello everyone, I hope your nights are going well. I have had a revelation tonight that is pretty upsetting to me and it is a pretty long read.
A bit of insight first; a good portion of my childhood was spent living around a woman with a severe personality disorder, most likely borderline personality disorder. This was my step mother. 

Years ago, when my dad and old step mom were together, (I must have been no older than 8-10 and I'm 23 now) I really hurt my right shoulder sledding. I was going down a hill too fast and tried to stop by spreading my arms out but my right arm was flung out behind me. I laid there crying and alone in the snow for quite some time, but eventually managed to get up and walk home in the dark.

At the same time, my step brother Dexter had broken a bone (skiing?) A couple days before.
I expressed to my Dad and step mom that my shoulder hurt very badly but my step mom said I was just trying to get attention because of Dexter's injury. I could hardly use my arm but they refused to take me to the doctor. I was playing it up according to her. I always needed attention.

 ""That's enough. Go to your room.""

Weeks (months? My timelines are all messed up from suppressed memories) later, my dad finally takes me in after relentless complaints about my shoulder. Since so long had passed, the doctor saw nothing wrong and sent us on our way.
I always thought I just dislocated my rib or something because of a large, boney lump on my chest.
Sitting on the couch right now feeling my collarbone, it feels very ""odd"" compared to the other side. I ask my boyfriend if it seems/feels weird and after comparing both sides for a while, he's like, ""yup, that was definitely broken at one point."" 

I broke my f**king collar bone as a young child and the two adults that were responsible for taking care of me did nothing. 


Even though the bones healed years ago, I feel like a part of me just broke in half again."
Memory loss?,11,m6nbe3,5,"Can ptsd cause memory loss? I was abused all my life and some part of the family still in this abusive relationship. I struggle with intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, triggering words, memory loss  
 I’m so forgetful and I understand this is normal but i feel like it’s worse that the normal
I don’t remember anything from the age about 16 under (only bad memories) - i’m 22 and still to this day don’t remember a lot of things. It was that bad I didn’t know that 3 of my siblings i lived with for years was my siblings until a few years ago."
"I’m currently in therapy with an child and adolescent psychotherapist. I’m 17, 18 at the end of the year. Should I start thinking of switching to a different therapist?",6,m6pyc9,1,"I like my therapist, but sometimes I feel like I can’t talk to her about heavier stuff. We talk about my boundaries, my trauma responses as a result of my childhood, and my depression and anxiety. But we haven’t spoken about my abuse, my PTSD (in specific detail and calling it what it is), panic attacks or bipolar disorder (I can’t really be diagnosed because I don’t want to come off my antipsychotics)"
Disappointed with my first therapy session,13,m6kjv6,12,"To be fair it's only the first session and we both felt like we didn't talk about as much as we wanted, but it felt like they wanted to focus more on my anxiety and depression and not my PTSD. They're giving me worksheets and forms to fill out to better assess me and find the best approach to my situation (they mentioned brainspotting and cbt), but I'm already leaning towards finding someone else."
Does PTSD cause ocd symptoms?,17,m6jv2w,3,"Its been a long and I stat to develop intrustive thoughts. Even for some thing that don't related for the trauma.

For example out of the blue I have intrustive thoughts ''You are a doormat''

and this thought repeat again and again and cause me distress.

and ofc it changes the way i behave and appear and people judge me because thougth that ive no control over.

Hey I need some advice.,4,m6rzii,8,"I’ve been talking with this girl I really like and I’ve discovered she has ptsd from sexual trauma in her past, I’m pretty clueless when it comes to ptsd because of how vast of a mental disorder is, so if anyone could help explain I’m how I can support her that would be amazing."
It’s that time of year again,6,m6nd6s,1,Totally forgot that March into the end of April when the ‘incident’ happened is when the night terrors come back no matter what kind of medication I am on. A friend reminded me of this tonight. This year will be 5 years. If I could occupy my mind and body with something during that time when it did occur I would but it happened at like 1-2am and everyone I know is sleeping. Guess I will be in for a roller coaster of dreams til it’s over. Wish me luck I come out on the other side again!!
PTSD OPTIONS AND HELP,2,m6m4c7,2,"If you think you have or recently been diagnosed with PTSD.... please realize you’re not alone. For starters, you found this group. Secondly, while everyone’s life experiences are different, our emotional/physical/psychological reactions will be different, but can be the same. So don’t think you are alone in this fight for your well being.

I was diagnosed with PTSD and secondary PTSD about 2 years ago. My PTSD event occurred in 2016 while my secondary PTSD SYMTPOMS have been occurring over the last 10 years or so(job related). 
You have to understand everyone handles things differently, but that does not mean you have to handle it alone. After my 2016 incident, I thought I was ok after a month or two. It wasn’t until nearly a full year did I truly see what was happening to me. My wife saw the signs much sooner. 

Many people, for a variety of reasons, are uncomfortable with talking to a mental health professional. I was too at first. If you want to truly get the help you need, you have to outside of your comfort zone and ask for help. When you finally do, the first couple of sessions will be fairly short and not to invasive. The therapist wants to get to know you, your medical history and what brought your there. Depending on your type of treatment, it could be 4-5 sessions before you get to the heart of the matter. I was recommended EMDR therapy(please look this up so this post isn’t too long). It wasn’t until my 10th or 11th regular session did we do the EMDR. I have found it very helpful. However, it can be very emotionally and physically draining at times... depending on your incident. But you must be honest with everything, what happened, how you feel it has affected you, and most importantly how you’re feeling during the treatments. Please, don’t try to go it alone like I did. It only makes it worse. 

God bless and good luck to you all"
Don’t give me your pity,12,m6auqe,7,"I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and bipolar 1 for 2 years now and I just don’t like being pitied, I know I’m a bit different, but trying to teach my friends/family how I process my emotions differently, is so tiresome/frustrating. It makes me feel like I wished that no one knew anything about me and never told anyone about my family and sexual trauma my whole life. I just feel like no one really cares about me and just wants to control my life without even letting me put input in and making it harder for me to make my own decisions Bc of the fear they struck in me."
lost in it all,1,m6ru8h,1,it’s all so tiring. i’m as resilient as i can be but man it just really gets to ya sometimes yknow... i’m proud of how long i’ve held on for and how much of the mess in my head i’ve been able to take but sometimes i wish i wasn’t such a fighter. i wish i could just breakdown in the arms of a loved one and cry
Sibling with autism and bpd,7,m6cjof,2,"I’m 16, 3rd child of 4, everyone diagnosed with autism except for my little sister. My oldest sister (21) has had aggressive and violent meltdowns for as long as I can remember. I got used to screaming and having the police at our door. I’ve never been in the same room when it happened because it was unsafe, so kind of just sat alone at night waiting for it to end so I can go back to sleep. My parents never talked about it. Every time it happened we just moved on without saying a word, which resulted in me not feeling like I can talk about anything to anyone. 

I knew I had trauma, I never considered I might have ptsd. Probably because all my shit got shoved under the rug when I got my autism diagnosis. 

My sister has been on medication for a few months and it has been better. She rarely has meltdowns anymore and overall we’re much more stable than we used to be. However, I don’t feel like anything changed. I’m still on edge all the time, waiting for shit to happen. I still can’t talk about anything and we don’t talk about anything. I have severe anxiety and can’t talk about any of my problems because my sister always came first. I feel selfish talking about my shit because everyone has worse things going on. 

Things have been calm lately though. I had to drop out of school because of panic attacks but am spending my days at a farm now, where I pretty much do all of my school work instead. But the problem is there are more kids with autism there, kids that also have aggressive outbursts. The reason why I got to ptsd is because a few days ago one of the teachers had to yell at one of the kids that had an outburst. I wasn’t prepared for it to happen and it immediately triggered me with flashbacks and intense fear which eventually turned into mild dissociation. I’ve been doing some research on emotional neglect caused by having a sibling with a mental illness, and parents that don’t notice your struggles. 

Besides that my sister is moving out soon. Which should be a good thing as it would mean the meltdowns wont ever happen here again but it feels awful. I’m still on edge all the time even though nothing in the last few months has even been remotely as bad as it used to be. I can’t talk to my therapist I panic and I dissociate. I’m not quite sure how to get a diagnosis and proper help with my trauma."
"Nightmares about family member's death, how do I tell my parent?",1,m6opqg,0,"Hey everyone, since I can remember I've had these vivid nightmares surrounding memories about the day my close cousin died. He died 9 years ago. Driving there, seeing all the ambulances and people crying, stuff like that. I'm not sure if I want to tell my parent or not. I'm definitely sure that I don't know what to tell them. I told my therapist when I used to do therapy but whenever I think about him I just breakdown and it's really pathetic and embarrassing.

I just really don't know what to say or even if I should say anything at all. Also, is there a way to prevent these kind of nightmares? I'm lucky if I get 4 hours of sleep yet it still happens and I don't know how to make it stop. Thanks in advance."
Anybody taking Zoloft for Ptsd?,9,m690ze,8,I’m on 50mg and often I have dreams about my traumas. Anybody experienced this?
I don't know what to think about this,1,m6lyj6,1,"Couple years ago, when I was about 11 I was on vacation with my parents in Bulgaria. One time I went swimming alone and it was a bad idea. Some older dude touched my butt, I got scared so I started to swim away from him but he grabbed my leg. I started screaming and he left me. I quickly ran out of the water but I've never told my parents about it.

Some time ago I told my two friends about it, and they just laughed it off. 

I hate when people touch me and I often feel sick or uncomfortable because of it. I have no idea if this is somehow related to that event. I really don't know what to think about this and if I should tell this to my parents. I tried telling this to my therapist but Im too embarrassed. I have so many problems right now and I don't like to think about this, but what if this has something to do with my confidence, self-hatred or whatever. I don't know. Its so embarrassing to write about this and Im kinda scared but fuck it help."
Big first step! going to therapy,100,m5ujax,16,"My first session is tomorrow. I've messaged my therapist to give her some more info about me and she told me I have more than one trauma, which is interesting to me because I just lumped them all together. Other than depression and anxiety, I depersonalize and also have issues with brain fog and impaired memory. I look forward to learning more and finally getting better so I can function better and be happier. I've been trying to heal on my own but I feel so stuck and unsupported and I need professional help"
How to heal,2,m6eyo3,2,"I was recently diagnosed with a few things, PTSD being one of them. What are way you heal? I can be quite outgoing but once my true feelings are brought up or asked about, I shut down. I am starting to stand up for myself though and all of a sudden I just feel like writing letters or texts to people telling them how I feel. Is that weird? I’m scared to see how some may react, and some relationships could end if they don’t like my boundaries, but I just feel like I want to do this but I am also doubting myself."
My boyfriend’s nickname is the name of the man who groomed me,1,m6h3b2,6,"I’m dating a guy named “Jimmy”. I love Jimmy and I am comfortable with him, but I’ve recently started hanging out with some of his friends and one of them often calls him “Jim” which is also the name of the old man who groomed me when I was a young teen. I’m trying not to be bothered by it but I think about it a lot. I’m worried the friend will say something about my boyfriend while referring to him as Jim that will cause me to panic. 

Any advice for dealing with this trigger? I’m sure his friend would be understanding if I asked him not to say Jim, but it would be easier to avoid that conversation."
Growing up with Narcs is probably the reason why I might have ptsd,2,m69y4t,1,"They were overprotective yet mean and discouraging, and fear mongering was their parenting style to put you into submission. 

I was raised in a religious household and at the age of 7 I was told about the devil. 

About demonic possessions and I’ve seen footage of demonic possessions and children who don’t obey God will be claimed by the devil. 

It’s also one of the reason why I still sleep with a night light and afraid of the dark. 

At times I still get nightmares about demons and evil spirits because those are the stories I grew up with. 

It’s so bad that I can’t sleep alone in the dark without feeling unsafe. I can’t live in a large house because that sparks my anxiety when it’s night time. 

I find it hard to find professional help for that because I might be seen as a test object. 

Thankfully I have a kitty and I feel at when she’s around. 

I also hear about going to hell for stepping out of religion, I have mixed feelings, at times I want to stay to avoid going to hell and burn forever but on the other hand I feel like religion is man made and just a control tool."
PTSD of a friend,3,m66e13,3,"(23m), She (22f) is diagnosing with PTSD, we have been friends after whatever has caused the situation and I'm too scared to ask what exactly happened to her and as a really good friend wanna help her go back to normal, she's taking therapy but since pandemic face to face meetings with her crappy therapist (as she described) doesn't happen often.
I just need help with, 1)if I should ask what has caused her PTSD? So I can be cautious not to trigger her and sake of curiosity .

Not sure how to handle the waves of “this isn’t fucking fair”,91,m5mp5h,17,"In the beginning of this year I discovered my partner was lying about their sobriety (3 months clean from heroin is what I was told). I watched them slowly spiral out until I threw their shit out in the hall and that was the last of it.
The situation sucked but really is nothing compared to my initial trauma. But I still feel so angry and unsafe that it feels identical to the domestic violence situation I was in years ago. 
I find myself randomly angry crying and screaming. I want too move on so bad. This shouldn’t fucking matter so much. I’ve been through so much worse, why can’t I handle this?"
Intrusive memories that.. aren't about the trauma??,30,m5txds,17,"Confusing title maybe, sorry. I've been wondering if anyone else experiences this or knows what it is, but I often get just random intrusive memories about my childhood that make me feel really awful, maybe triggered but it's not as intense? Even though they might not have anything to do with my trauma. Like I'll look at the way the light is coming through the window, and it'll bring me back to a specific memory of when I was in third grade, looking out my kitchen's window and smelling my mom making eggs, and it instantly makes me feel sick to my stomach, and my heart races, and I feel very uncomfortable and instinctively shake my head as if to shake away the memory, even though I know it's not a bad memory. This only really happens with childhood memories, and I did experience a lot of childhood trauma, but it just doesn't make sense to me why the memories aren't of any sort of trauma yet they still feel like this. If I need to give more information pls let me know

Need Advice Dealing with Heart Rate Spikes,3,m624so,9,"Hey there!
It's my first time posting here so bear with me.

I keep experiencing spikes in my heart rate. I'll be standing still talking and my heart rate is at 110bpm. I'll be walking around my house, doing the dishes, or washing my face and bam, my heart rate has spiked to 106bpm. (This is consistent across a number of devices I've used to check my heart rate throughout the day)

At the moment I'm dealing with this by stopping what I'm doing to sit down, take big belly breaths and sometimes even the Peter Levine voo breathing. But this is much harder when I'm in the middle of talking to someone, or standing at work (I work in customer service). 

Does anyone have any advice in how to deal with/minimise heart rate spikes?"
Do these sound like ptsd symptoms?,1,m6a4gj,0,"(Apologies if I have picked the wrong flair)
Hi, I was diagnosed with ptsd 18months ago, but also some other things, and started on new and much better medication. I’ve kind of been ignoring the ptsd part of it since then, put it in the too hard basket, but recently I’m trying to accept it and face it. I’ve been wondering if actually some of my problems could be symptoms or related to ptsd. My ptsd is related to sexual assaults in childhood and adulthood. My new medication has helped with nightmares and sleep, but I think these other things are more difficult to fix.

Symptoms:
- I used to be happily sexually active and confident, but for the past 3 years I’ve been completely turned off. I now am jumpy even if people try to hug me, unless I have prior warning and am not surprised, even people I love and trust. This really is weird for me and I am angry at myself about it. 
- crying often, for no reason or for very small reasons, like watching a video where someone talks about having an illness.
- full body fatigue and aches, I feel like I’ve run a marathon but I’ve done no exercise. 
- explosive anger and very sensitive to any kind of criticism.

If anyone has any thoughts, even if it’s just a yes or a no, I would appreciate it. I’m waiting to see my new psychologist and will be telling her about all these things too. Thank you."
Delete and Ban if not allow but I am sick and Tired,0,m6ey40,7,"Look, I do not know what your people's circumstances are, but if you think you have PTSD then please seek treatment from a professional. **DO NOT SELF DIAGNOSE OR MEDICATE**. You and all your google skills cannot replace the knowledge and experience of a trained medical professional. You may be uncomfortable seeking professional help, I was. PTSD is not cut and paste, you could have severe depression, anxiety,  ect. that are symptoms of PTSD but the underlying cause of the issue is not PTSD. 

I have lost to many friends to suicide, and I do not want to see any of you glamorus people harmed. REDDIT is a great place for talking to others about what is going on with you, but it is not a replacement for a doctor. Go get help."
Is anyone else losing their hair?,4,m61vy0,7," I'm losing hair to balding/thinning, and it could be because of the ptsd.

Self triggering- anyone else?,5,m5wwdp,2,"For context I was in a terrorist attack when I was seventeen. It’s now almost four years later and after being diagnosed in 2018 with PTSD it’s gotten better but sometimes I have flare ups during times of stress/when terrorist attacks happen. 

Recently I’ve found myself researching more about the attack, purposefully looking for tweets about it from the day and initial breaking news reports. I’m finding that it’s like I’m almost wanting to trigger an emotional reaction even though I know I don’t ((actually)) want to experience that pain. I’ve googled it but can’t seem to find much in a way of explanation.

Starting trauma work,2,m61nf4,1,"4 years ago I got out a horrible abusive relationship that left me with trauma so bad I flunked out of my freshman year of college, before i was that stereotypical ap student.

I know i need to work through this and deserve to finally feel more free but I’m terrified and half wanting to say no save it for some other time.

I need relationship advice,3,m5wgau,4,"I need some advice

I’m a sexual assault survivor, when I was younger and once by an ex girlfriend. Recently with a new girl who also happens to be a survivor who recently went through it about 3 years ago. I cared about her and always wanted to keep her happy. As a young couple we were intimate. Had sex maybe 3 times a week. I thought she was into it because she would send me freaky text messages and pictures throughout the day. About a month ago she had a ptsd nightmare and put my face to the guys face. It started off hey saying her therapist said I had a sex problem and I respected her words. I signed up for therapy a day later to be told differently. She told me and my homie that she realized she just got triggered, told me she still loved me but was scared of me, I gave her the space she asked for and she came back into my life saying I assaulted her so I told her I apologize I made her feel that way. But to me it feels like she’s trying to change what happened in the past or how it happened like she’s trying to remember what didn’t happen. She stalks my account on Instagram. I don’t text too many people on insta so I see when she blocks me and unblocks me every other day and once she accidentally liked a picture. She had multiple accounts too so I don’t know if she’s watching me on the other ones. She called me out for posting me missing her videos on tiktok but she doesn’t follow me or I follow her. Ig I’m here asking for advice, it’s been a month, has anyone gone through something similar? I’m trying to be as nice as possible to her because I understand she had trauma before I hoped in this relationship but it’s kind of scary. I love the girl still but i don’t know what to do. I tried apologizing and she wanted to see me in person and hang out and she would have a panic attack and flake. Now it seems she’s done with me but she’s also stalking me so I’m super confused"
"I want to ruin his life (TW: grooming, r*pe, partner emotional abuse, nsfw for a few parts, suicide)",3,m5vq38,3,"I keep tabs on his facebook once a year or so. Watch his relationships change like the weather. Laugh a little internally at the quotes about leaving the past behind and being a good person.

We were best friends, like siblings. We called eachother that aswell, I called him big bro. I was 14 and he was 18 (soon 19 a little after we met online)

We talked daily, almost allll the time. He was complaining once about being horny in college and me, being a dumb horny teen, kinda jokingly suggested I could help. While I shouldnt have done this, I was 14 years old, already traumatized by other things, and heavily dependent on one person at a time like my life revolved around them completely. He continued and we sexted for a bit, he felt guilty but I promised him it was legal in my country because I was genuinely in love with him and got scared because I thought I wanted this for real at the time and was responsible enough (which it wasnt legal, and even then he shouldve told me I was overstepping and that he was an adult, he shouldve stopped me)

Me being the initiator still makes me feel super guilty. Was it even grooming? what do I call it? His BPD made him extremely dependent on me and emotionally manipulate me into essentially making his mental health my total responsibility. We continued this relationship for about 2 years, s\*xting still. He was my first experience as a sub in B\*SM and it affects me to this day that he's how I discovered that side of myself. I'm still 17 so I won't go into details about the specific things we did for that, but 70% of me says it was his fault that he didnt stop it and manipulated me into being his only support beam for his bpd and s\*icidal tendencies. There were many days and nights where I was talking him out of hanging himself, and he would do it so much anyway. I was s\*icidal myself and still struggle with depression despite being on meds now, and he kept pushing it all on me, a child. When he was r\*ped I was the only one to support him.

I once sent him a nice care package across the ocean where he lives. He wanted some of my a-few-days-worn underwear so I included that. He told me he m\*sturbated while wearing my hoodie and underwear.

All that doubt of how valid it was aside, I know where he works. I have the really bad urge to show the tattoo studio he works at what he did. But he has pets that depend on him. A boyfriend who'se probably a decent person. I couldn't wish joblessness onto his pets and maybe even his boyfriend if theyre financially working together. But something in me also doesnt want him jobless. The manipulation is still deeply rooted in me, and I hate that I care."

Philosophical problems with PTSD treatment,31,m56j4n,31,"I'm starting to think that too much of mental health treatment, especially with trauma, is simplify and standardized to the point of meaninglessness for me. When people speak of ""acceptance, healing, and moving on"", I don't disagree, when you get into what that REALLY means, there’s no substance.  

It seems to me like a lot of trauma work is about separating trauma from a person’s idea of the self; “accepting you are not your trauma”. Okay, well, what is the self? And who is to say what a healthy vs unhealthy arrangement of the self is?  

Neuroscience seems to suggest that the self is not a unitary or consistent feature of a person; that complicates any meaningful discussion of this. To my reading of the evidence, it is seems like the self is really like a bunch of interwoven narratives, aspects, and systems of emotion and thought, which by their very essence cannot be partitioned into discrete things. Further, the arrangement of the self, or the mind, doesn’t conform to a single healthy range, or baseline, like say the functioning of a kidney or a heart might. But then this stands in stark contrast to the treatment philosophies and modalities used by a great deal of American mental health providers.  

The mind, as an emergent property of the brain, is not well understood, and I don’t believe you can just say “I am not my trauma” over and over again, and “find acceptance”. I find that the more I push for meaning in treatment, the more I find conversations devolve into either spiritualism (i.e. mindfulness as a sort of religion) or into discussion which are predicated on finding ways to get me conform to hyper-standardized diagnostic label/criteria, predicated upon the world view that my identity is medically “wrong” and bust conform to what is “medically right”.  

I think it is very debatable to dismiss the thoughts and feelings of a person impacted by trauma as simply the product of sickness, a disease of the brain; it much more complicated than that I believe.  

I think what it means to separate the ""self"" from trauma is not clear cut the way it is made out to be, and by it's very nature runs into the thorny issues of what people understand to be normal, and what metric or cultural worldview is being used to judge what a healthy baseline of emotional health actually is.  

In my experience, it seems that a lot of psychological professionals struggle to incorporate an evidenced, consistent, and multidimensional theory of the mind into their work, and are extremely resistant to accepting that people can fall outside of the check boxes or DSM.

Ultimately I feel like getting help, real help, is so hard because so many of the people who as mental health professionals are too mired in their narrow worldviews on what the self, the mind, and well being means for individual people."
blame it on me i guess,67,m511nr,19,"everyone keeps trying to blame me for my own child abuse like because the longer it went on the worse my emotional reactions to events were and because of that i brought it upon myself.

Well this is new...,1,m5plgt,2,"2 years ago I was in a single car accident. We had some snow/ice and when I was driving, my tire got stuck in some slush, I fishtailed on the highway and hit a cement barricade going 40 mph. My Jeep was totalled and I spent 10 hours in the emergency room while they tried to figure out if I had any internal bleeding. I was the only one in the car, thank goodness, but everyone was shocked that I didn't have more Injuries/concussion/etc. I didnt think I had any PTSD from it, so never sought help. 

This morning I hit black ice on my drive to work. I fishtailed 6 times, did a full spin in my suv before I was finally able to grab onto some road that wasn't covered in black ice. 

I realized when I got into the office that I'm probably struggling with some form of PTSD from my car accident 2 years ago, and this mornings incident showed me that I need to start seeing someone to process it. 

I'm not sure what I'm asking for - maybe some sort of validation that PTSD can be caused by a car accident? I don't really know...but I know the thought of driving home this evening is scaring me and already causing a lot of anxiety."

Looking for advice. Tw for csa and sexual assault.,4,m5d5zb,1,"So, I've posted about this once before... But the thing is I didn't receive really any helpful advice ( definitely not trying to sound rude, sorry if it seems that way. Likely on me for not giving enough detail. ) last time and I'm desperate for some help, because apparently getting in to see a therapist won't happen for a few more months, at least, bc... America's mental healthcare system. 

Long story short, I was molested by my older brother as a child, I was assaulted and coerced into sexual activity by my first bf as a teen, and I was assaulted again as an adult. Needless to say, I have some issues regarding sex. And one of those is that once I get worked up, I need to get some release for it, otherwise it starts screwing with my brain. It starts feeling like people are touching me, I can't handle anyone actually touching me, depression hits hard, I start disassociating, ect. It's not pretty. And there's a very specific list of actions my fiance does that get me into the mood, and all of them are explicitly sexual in nature.  I've listed them off to him. He knows what they are, he knows how they affect me, and he knows how it hurts my brain if he does them and doesn't follow through. Even months ago we literally had a talk with my therapist at the time and she said that there should be an understanding between us that if he does those specific things, there should be a follow through. And if he's not in the mood and doesn't feel up to doing anything, then he shouldn't do the things that get me worked up in the first place. Sounds fair, right??   The issue is, he still does those things. Then proceeds to leave me hanging for days following it. And before you ask, no, trying to take care of it, myself, only makes it worse if anything. And if I bring it up to him that he worked me up, he frequently brushes it off or sometimes gets defensive about it. And it hurts.  It sends me into a spiral that gets so bad I can't sleep, even having the cats' fur brushing my skin feels like too much touch, I can't eat, lose my voice, start tuning out everything around me for minutes at a time, feel like my whole bodys just not real or not there or not mine.    And the thing is, I don't know why there's this disconnect?? In everything else, he's the sweetest guy. I have chronic pain and he's constantly freaking out over me if I look like I'm in even a little bit of pain. Hes thoughtful, brings me gifts, listens to me.  So I don't get why this specifically is just?? So difficult??? And it's not like he doesn't understand how bad it gets. I mean, we're both extremely physically affectionate people and I know it bothers him when it gets bad and we can't cuddle or even hug because the mere thought of being touched when I'm in that state makes me feel pukey and shaky, but he still has the nerve to get offended when I turn down snuggles??? I don't get it. And I'm at my wits end. I just need to know what to do, how to get through to him.    Cause the other issue is, I never want him to feel like he has to have sex with me, I would never want to take away someone's consent like that at all. But then am I the bad guy for getting upset with him and kind of expecting sex if he purposely does the things that work me up but leaves me hanging?? Like, is it wrong that he'll do those things and I'll think, ""I guess he's in the mood""?  Like I said, all the things that work me up are explicitly sexual in nature. It's not like just a hug or handholding or something is enough to do it. So, am I the asshole here for getting worked up and expecting sex after he does those things?? Please, advice is welcome. Cause this has been going on for months and I've run out of ideas. I just need to know how to get it through to him fully and completely that he needs to stop doing it to me. It's seriously affecting my health, mental and physical. Losing sleep, losing weight, moods tanking, and I'd like it to stop."
People don’t talk about triggers enough.,13,m53ouz,0,"[Let’s Talk: Episode 1- Triggers](https://youtu.be/N-hjvfrojCI)

I made this video trying to simply talk about triggers in a simple way directed more towards people who don’t understand but I tried to also lay it out for people who do understand. I feel like I should have elaborated more on it and I might make a part 2 on this video to talk about it more in-depth with more understanding."
We stuck in the middle ages,5,m56aop,15,"The methdos to solve ptsd are poor. what do we got EMDR? Is the only treatment recongised along with medication.

All other treatment are not sufficiently good enough to be recongised as ptsd treatment.

I feel like the govemrents put us behind. They can invest trillions of dollars for covid treatments but who made the treatments for ptsd? random people like Peter levine and Francine Shapiro make it.

They don't put trillions of dollars to figure out how to fix ptsd. I don't see teams working on it around the clock.

TW//: Shooting

I was a witness in a shooting in October and I live in a very gang active area. There was another shooting near my house the other night and it threw me into an absolute panic. I haven’t been sleeping with out melatonin, I am consistently replaying every single thing that has happened those two nights and the shooting from when I was in high school. It never ends and I feel so trapped in my own head. I just needed a place to put this because I am going crazy and can’t stop it.

"I'm just tired of people who are triggering me constantly (TW: sexual abuse, harassment, stalking)",5,m5656k,3,"Well, guys, I suffer from sexual PTSD for three years now. It started the day I was threatened with rape by a guy who was stalking my social media after I ghosted him since he was VERY direct about how he wants to hook up and everything, not to mention he was too obtrusive, even though we were strangers when he messaged me trying to flirt with me. Later I discovered that he had known my family, but I never knew or met him, so we were complete strangers anyway.

And you know what? I'm tired because something similar is happening again.

So I'm a freshman in uni now and one of the guys who is studying with me is trying to flirt with me. To give you some context, we have never met in person and never talked about anything but our studies, but a few weeks ago he started getting, um, kinda too much when I was just helping him with our homework.

To give you some more context, I help everyone, literally everyone and it's obvious from our collective chat where guys and girls are asking for help so I wasn't giving him any reason to act like this. But anyway, it's probably ok to him to ask a girl about when she is going to visit the uni or where is she from (I live in another city), considering that he only knows how this girl looks like and nothing more. I guess he even got angry when I said that I don't know about the time I'll be visiting the uni, even though he switched the subject.

I'm SO UNBEARABLY tired of guys who view me like this. Why on Earth do they act like this towards me? Why I'm viewed as a piece of meat that is suitable only for sex? I'm an alive person and I never asked anyone to treat me like this. I know a lot of ladies who like to be sexual and it's their business, but I'm just sick of it all considering being a Christian woman who was abused sexually. I'm tired of people who just interested in my face/body and think that I need to know about their interest or that they have any right to express that to me directly. I bet they won't even talk to me if they know who I really am and not my face.

Maybe I'm overreacting here, but I am just tired of the fact that the only men that respect my boundaries are my male friends (they are the best cinnamon buns in the world, no doubt, I love them), but when it comes to relationships then I'm just viewed as a proud holder of the vagina but not as a person.

And I'm very uncomfortable with the thought that I need to keep up the conversation with a person who is unpleasant for me so I won't be threatened with rape again. You know, I'm texting with him RIGHT NOW and I wish I was rather dead than talking to him. I know there are lots of good guys out there and thank you guys for your existence, but sometimes living in this society is just too much.

Anyway, I feel like I was raped mentally today for some reason which was is a perfect colorful extra-sprinkle for my major depressive episode so I don't even know why I'm writing this, but thanks if you read the post."
The Storm,3,m57vs3,1,"The Storm

As I leave the gym today in the middle of a blizzard like every other day since my breakup, my past is right there to join me on my walk to the car. It buckles up next to me and holds it's icy grip on my hand. Reminds me of all my insecurities and failures. From destroying the person I loved the most to ruining every relationship with family or friendships I've ever had. It loves to play back why I'll never be good enough for anyone. Why somehow I'll sabotage anyone's life who gets close enough to me. All I do at this point is either attempt to fill the void that my mother left in me as a child or I'm fighting everyday to be different. To just have that breakthrough in change. Therapy, self help books, daily affirmations, exercise for hours on end, meditation, all of it feels like temporary fixes. Like a band aid on a cracked foundation. I don't wanna be like this anymore. My last relationship although I'm so thankful for it ending because it showed how much I needed to change it's also showed how broken I am. It's revealed the monster behind the mask I've always hidden behind. I've been raped, shot at, blown up, beaten into submission, told I'd never be smart enough or handsome enough for anyone to ever love me since I was four. I just wish things were easier. I wish I could catch a break from Life. But I think there are so many people that have had it so much worse than me and my problems are insignificant. I can see on the other side of the mirror someone who is beautiful and can be confident and just at peace. But like a mirror it's impossible to get to the reflection. I just wish I could feel something different. I want to be a better person so bad. I don't want to carry on this toxic cycle."
Does anyone overcome trauma by trying to forget about it?,1,m5doim,1,"My experiences aren't as severe as some others, but two times I have been separated from my pets when they died. First, my horse. He was out in Colorado and he had an equine disease called EPM. I   
 was in Massachusettes. One day he couldn't get up and he was put down and my mom told me months later of his passing. Recently, December 2020, we had to put my dog down because she had a stomach cancer or something related to cancer where her bowels were obstructed. She was in Massachusettes and I was in Colorado with my mom. Funny how that worked, huh?

 With these deaths, I manage to push them aside rather quickly. It took a bit longer with my horse because he was my best friend while my dog was more of my mom's from time to time. And she kind of disconnected from the family as she got older. With my dog, on the day of her passing, I just felt numb and guilty, but over the next few days I forced myself to stop being sad and just move on.

However, my trauma of experience death still shakes me up. I've never seen anyone die in front of me and I kind of hope that I never do. Now, I currently own another horse who I got after my last horse was unrideable due to his EPM. But even I get scared to think about him dying on me one day even though it is going to happen eventually."
Recent PTSD diagnosis,4,m53bpg,2,"I’m not sure how I feel about all of this. 

I was in the military but never thought of my time in as being something that had a negative effect on me. 

But after reaching out to a number of outlets for help, I was diagnosed with PTSD from the VA a few weeks ago. It’s service connected. They have me on a couple of different meds to treat the symptoms and I’m seeing a therapist 2 times a month. 

Idk. I always thought I was “strong” or whatever. But over the last few years I’ve started checks by all the boxes. Hyper vigilance, extreme anxiety and depression, persistent and recurring memories, shrinking away from family/friends etc.  

I feel like I’m finally getting past one identity crisis (leaving the military 5 years ago) and replacing it with another. It’s hard because I can’t really talk to anyone about it either. My s/o is made to feel uncomfortable when I bring it up (can’t blame her), I’m quarantining/isolating so I don’t hang out with people, and the friends I game with share the same trauma so I don’t want to ruin the vibe by making them all relive it. 

Shit sucks. It’s not even knowing I’ll struggle with this (PTSD) for some time, it’s knowing that I now have to jive my own self definition with everything else. I know PTSD doesn’t make you weak or anything, I just thought I’d figured out who I was. Now that’s all turned around."
i'm looking for help coping with still living with the cause of your ptsd,2,m56fiw,0,"hey all ! this is my first post, i've decided maybe the support here can help :)

TW: family abuse caused by mental illness, suicide threats, (mentions aspergers, bipolar disorder, OCD)

i have ptsd as a result of continuous childhood trauma. a lot of people i meet with ptsd from childhood have it because of a parent, but i have it because of my sister. we're a family of 5, which is me (youngest), older sister i'll call julie (middle child), oldest sister who i'll call eliza, and my two parents. eliza has is on the aspergers spectrum and has bipolar disorder and it was something that got worse and worse as she grew up. issues started at around the time she turned 5, when i was born. when she was 10 ish my parents took her to therapy, she was diagnosed and from then on she would refuse to talk to the therapist. like straight refused to speak, she would just sit there. so they stopped taking her, things were in a constant fragile state the entire time i was growing up. she'd have what we call 'episodes' about 5 times a week. anything could start them (ex. telling her to do a chore, her getting jealous of something, basically anytime something didn't go her way). due to this i just developed this thing where my chest hurts when i'm around her, i'm constantly on edge. 

those years were the worst, things went from verbally to physically violent. nobody ever got seriously, seriously hurt, it was a lot of threats with weapons, pushing and pinning to walls, charging at us, that kind of a thing. one of the worst reoccurring incidents in her episodes was her getting a weapon or something possibly deadly and threatening to/saying she was going to kill herself. there were two causes; either she hated herself for what she was doing to us or she would use it as a way to get things. friends were scarce for me, too, because she would have episodes while they were over and it would scare them. one time she pulled out a knife in front of one of my best friends and later that week while we were on a walk eliza told me that she thought my life would be better off with her dead, i didn't know what to say because at the time it was true. it didn't help that both of my parents get easily angered, my dad gets especially angry over finances because he was poor growing up, but my mom is more manipulative and tends to get angry over emotional situations. when julie was in middle school my mom basically lived through her and left me behind with eliza and my dad, which was a horrible combination. i have julie to relate to as someone who went through the same thing in a way, but she was able to do tons of extracurriculars and be away from home most of the time and experienced like 1/4 of what i did. i love her dearly but it's hard not to feel a little resentment.

anyway, eliza finally got some actual help at around 16 and went to therapy until she went to college. she's a senior in college now, but living at home with us because of COVID-19. julie still went to school, i don't blame her, but her and i are best friends and i've never had to be around eliza without julie. julie doesn't have PTSD, she was affected in a different way (she has OCD). i can talk to her about that a bit (my therapist says i'm on the OCD spectrum), but there's no one i can talk about about this. i'm a junior in high school, but i've pushed myself academically a lot and am technically a freshman in college. i'm online in college and will have my associate's degree the same year i graduate high school (weird, i know haha), but the point is eliza and i are both home for school. i'm able to be around her more than i used to because her episodes are more spread out and are only verbal now for the most part, but she still always triggers me and some of the things she says to me i worry will stick with me forever. we got a bit closer this past year, but about a month ago she had a really bad episode and i knew i had to go away and be alone for a bit to use my kit (my method of coping is by pulling myself out of a flashback through the senses, like i'll spray something with a strong scent, feel something odd, and i have a kit full of these things). anyway, i was getting my things and leaving and she said to me ""whatever, go cry about it"" and it just has really stuck with me. i know it sounds lame but it just felt like she was mocking the symtoms of the disorder that *she* gave me. it just felt awful. things haven't been the same, my mom and i got into an argument that triggered me today and she said something similar. i haven't been able to get over it and it makes me feel immature. she has some issues too, she's just sort of textbook manipulative and i can't tell her if she hurts my feelings because she turns it around and tries to make me feel awful about it (ex. well i guess i'm just a terrible person, sorry i'm an awful mother, etc.)

i know i have to live with both of them for the next year. does anyone know some good coping mechanisms for this ? 

thank you <3"
What are the risks of doing a research study on PTSD?,2,m55xkk,2,"[Autocruitment](https://www.autocruitment.com/) is able to connect me to studies about PTSD, and they made a post about how those who may have PTSD are eligible for a compensated evaluation in exchange for participation in some medical trial(s). I don't know all the information is, but I am worried about potentially re-traumatizing myself\* or the side effects of medications interacting with the numerous medications that I'm already on. What are the risks here? Is it possible that they'll compensate me for any harm done? Any advice?

\*I talk a lot about my trauma, so I think that would be difficult but not impossible.

Edit: It just connects you to studies. It's more of an email subscription than anything else. I don't think that it's a scam, it just leaves the information up to the individual studies (which could be scams, I admit). This is more of a general question. I understand that each specific study has its own risks and I need to look at those, but just in general, what should I look out for?"
I was involved in a car accident yesterday and I can’t get over the guilt. TW: car accident details.,52,m4o9dg,5,"I don’t know who to talk about this. I feel so stupid. I was just going to work by using my electric bike and I didn’t look right in time. The car was just inches away from me before it hit me from the side, I flew off my bike and broke the windshield. I just remember falling down and feeling grateful that my head ended up falling on top of my backpack instead of the pavement. The fear that cornered me was just way too much. 

The lady that was driving called 911 stating that she didn’t see me and I calmed her down from the floor telling her that it’s okay. I knew it was me.

"My abuser got married and looks ""happy""",19,m4pbe6,15,"My abuser (m27) got married to the girl (f27) he was ex's with and was highschool sweethearts with wh I was also once friends with when me and my abuser were together. 

He looked happy ngl I know its wrong to check on their social media but I can't help but want to find out if their lives are getting any worse than mine.

Summary: abuser is my ex of 2 year and a half, ended it last 2017 cuz of an ugly physical fight. He cheated on me, gaslighted me, hit me on the face, guts, head many times with his hands or an umbrella.  Anyway, I'm not perfect. Never said I was, I was destructive and would always do something stupid when he does something wrong i.e. found out he cheated on me and threw money at my face and said he didn't love me anymore (we broke up for a week) so I went and slept with my college crush for kicks. 

Anyway, I've also been dealing with childhood trauma besides this from my parents and I can't solely blame everything to him, I know that. But my abuser and his now wife has kept on bugging me since 2019. First, he created a twitter account to hate on me and in his words he has ""no regrets"" for it. Second, the girl created a fb page with me and his other exs calling us ""bitches"" when all I did was text him ""Just wanted to say hi"" one time (i was in a dark place ngl went thru something physically tormenting and thought he owed me comfort from all the shit he put me through). Then the girl or him idk kept on messaging me with multiple fake accounts calling me a bitch or a whore and texting me stuff like ""I'm glad ""current boyfriend then's name"" broke up with you good for him"" on my fb account. Also why I deleted that fb account. Third, recently they called me and texted me this January 1 to call me a bitch and a whore again. This time I replied cuz I was at the toilet pooping and I just got pissed off. 

Additional info, i know the girls twitter account and she also tweets about being in a toxic relationship and not being able to leave just this January. Thinking about that, wondering how weird it is to marry someone you're toxic with. It baffles me. I know it's hard to get out of a toxic relationship, I was in one too but how idiotic of you to marry them even? 

I forgot to mention when the girl and I were ""close"" I and my ex then told her about abusing me and she even told him ""how low can you go as a human being?"" So she knew about him abusing me. It's just shitty and I'm currently going thru therapy to help me from the flashbacks and depression. Idk maybe I just want attention or maybe I want to clear my heart from the stories he's telling people that I blackmailed him and stuff. I still don't understand why he hates me so much. I wish I could ask him, I really wish I could."
Hypervigilance is making me relapse,1,m55cw3,1,"tw suicide

&#x200B;

PTSD related from friend attempting suicide when I was a kid. And then I almost attempted suicide because I was emotionally abused online for talking about it.

I can't get it out of my head that I Need To Prevent A Suicide. Because You Gotta. You Can't Just Sit There And Watch It Happen All Over Again. So you get in arguments, and you get angry, and you overstep, and you push boundaries, and stick your nose into other people's business, and people get mad at you, but its ok because you can deal with people getting angry at you if it means someone lives.

All week I've just had images and thoughts of this person killing themselves. And like, how would their family feel? Their friends? What would happen to them? So you've GOT TO DO SOMETHING.

And then people get really mad at you. And accuse you of suicide baiting. And go around acting like you were manipulating and guilttripping them.

But when I'm in the moment, I am *absolutely convinced* I can prevent a suicide if I just find the right things to say. And everyone just kind of...treats me like I'm crazy for it. I feel crazy. I think I probably am.

&#x200B;

My friend telling me about her suicide attempt came out of the blue. I was 14. We'd spent the day on [joinme](https://joinme.com) where we could chat and see each others screens. She had her friend round and we teased eachother. He asked me for my pic I think in a joking way and I said 'sure' and then sent him a photo of a horse's butt. And then it was evening and my friend told me she'd attempted suicide 2 weeks prior. A boy she liked said something rude to her a party and she toppled over the edge from that one comment, and went home and tried to kill herself and went to sleep and woke up the next day.

So it was a happy day for me with my friend. I was happy. And then the suicide trauma came along in literally a second.

I still don't trust that anybody's truly happy. Even if they act it. I still have the suspicion they're going to try and leave. 

So how can I just sit back. Even if I *know* it's more than likely things will be okay. How do I sit back in the knowledge that there's even the tiniest possiblility it won't be okay.

&#x200B;

Seeing somebody being cyberbullied online made me trauma-relapse. Spent the week *absolutely convinced* I can make this stop. That it's my *responsibility* and my *duty* to make it stop. That I need to prevent a suicide.

A lot of people are mad at me now for sticking my nose in.

&#x200B;

I wish I wasn't this way. I wish I wasn't traumatized. I wish I didn't feel this way. When I get into the middle of a PTSD episode I can't think straight. The episodes can last anywhere from a couple of hours to a couple of weeks, or more. I get angry. I say and do things I wouldn't normally do. I cry all the time. I think about self-harm and suicide. I see danger everywhere. I see suicide in everybody I talk to and everybody I meet. I do knee-jerk things without thinking them through. I overreact to every criticism and assume they're going to emotionally abuse me again. I start crying over the tiniest things. I start drowning in guilt for everything I do. I obsess over what I've done wrong and whether people hate me for it. 

&#x200B;

I haven't relapsed in a year. I thought I was over it. And then this week just triggered me completely out of the blue and it's been a complete and utter spiral from there.

Bipolar 1 and PTSD?,5,m4qml2,6,"I was diagnosed with both at the same time. My therapist recently told me that my psychotic symptoms could be mostly stemming from my PTSD and that the Bipolar could be a misdiagnosis. My dad has very severe forms of the same things. I know that PTSD is often overlooked for other mental illnesses like Bipolar disorder. I have hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions more frequently than I thought would be normal for PTSD (at least once a week with hallucinations appearing almost everyday in some way). I have had a couple of what I thought were bad manic episodes that meet a lot of the criteria. I don't know a lot about PTSD, I guess.

After the laughter I slowly go into depression not just from the PTSD moment but like depressing thoughts of whatever.

Rage attacks,19,m4ge33,6,"Does anybody gets attacks where you get aggressive, shout, harm yourself, destroy stuff, etc... 

I get this when I’m triggered or my mom keeps making comments invalidating what happened to me."
Childhood PTSD (Developmental Trauma Disorder),3,m4ko4m,0,"I’ve noticed a persistent pattern of abusive and unstable relationships in my life. It started by being friends with mostly other traumatized youths in teenage-hood, where there seemed to be a sense of mutual understanding, and compassion - but (of course) accompanied by our collective maladaptive tendencies. Romantic relationships too, the most long term and involved were emotionally abusive. I found myself with 2 frightening and dis-compassionate  partners, and remained in those relationships for years, confused, scared and heartbroken. Real intimacy felt alien. The last emotionally abusive relationship continued for a little over 2 years and ended ~6m before lockdown started. It was at the end of that relationship that I began living in my own apartment for the first time in my life, was completely independent from my family (as I’d completed grad school, started my career and obtained economic independence) and not living with either my family or an abusive partner. 

For the first time in my life, i have a safe space to stop being on autopilot. I didn’t realize this until recently. But 2020 came with its punches and during quarantine someone I had been seeing casually but consistently for months prior, not the abusive partner - but a rebound that I knew from childhood (we went to same school for 10 years), who had also been traumatized as a child, and who I’d casually dated previously in my life, died from an overdose. He had  been best friends with my best friend who had died also from an overdose a few years earlier, when I was in the abusive relationship. Note I’ve never done the drugs these people died abusing, but my childhood friends all did suffer from trauma too, and many have since died or fallen victim to terrible addiction.  This death set me into a deep spiral, I shut down, felt disconnected, experienced physical pain, slight sounds startled me, I couldn’t sleep and I felt completely overwhelmed - crying and sobbing, not always knowing why.  eventually trying to sooth myself in this state caused me to start meditating everyday.

SO, this is the part I’m hoping will be helpful to those with similar experiences, and childhood trauma - which mind you I’m only really starting to come to terms with. As I began meditating every day, consistently (usually after I have my coffee or tea in the morning, but never was hard on myself about it while building the habit), I had an epiphany ~10 days in. I realized that trying to subdue and control the overwhelming emotions just exacerbated them. It was only by sitting with them and letting them have their space within me that I could begin to heal and understand them.

 I read this, which maybe some of you can relate to: 

“traumatized people live with seemingly unbearable sensations: they feel heartbroken and suffer from intolerable sensations in the pit of their stomach or tightness in their chest. Yet avoiding these sensations in our bodies increases our vulnerability to being overwhelmed by them.” - The Body Keeps the Score 

(if you’re ready for some eye opening reading about trauma, pick this book up. But I suggest being in therapy and meditating regularly, and having your safety and independence from abusers secured before doing so.)

Self awareness is the path to beginning to heal. Self awareness begins by activating the medial prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that noticed what’s going on inside of us and allows us to feel what we’re feeling. Begin by learning how to breathe calmly and remain in a state or relative physical relaxation even while accessing painful and horrifying memories. When you deliberately take a few slow, deep breathes, you will notice the effects of the parasympathetic brake in your arousal. The more you stay focused on your breathing, the more you will benefit, particularly if you pay attention to the very end of the out-breath and then wait a moment before you inhale again. As you continue to breathe and notice air moving in and out of your lungs you may think about the role that oxygen plays in nourishing your body and bathing your tissues with the energy you need to feel alive and engaged. 

Now I see my traumatic responses have followed me throughout life, because of deeply buried childhood trauma. I am successful, smart, passionate, but have trouble in romance and also with self care. Doctors appointments, dentist appointments, showering or cleaning my house (for myself, I will do it to be presentable for others and outwardly am attractive and social) are difficult for me often. It’s hard to make close friends. But I am resilient and I try to help myself. I realized the extent of my avoidance, whilst being unable to avoid with the business of every day life being stripped away during Covid. I realized all the healing I still need to do, and all that I can’t access and don’t consciously remember. Just fragments. 

Pushing on my bedroom door while crying and screaming, trying to prevent my parents from coming in. Being called names like “pimple face” or “little snot faced brat” by my mother. Being pinched by her while she would clench her teeth in anger at me, and being called a bitch when I was only a little girl. I remember being bit and slapped. I remember compulsively masturbating at a very young age and not really knowing what I was doing. I remember as a teenager being bulimic, cutting myself, being diagnosed as borderline by a doctor who saw me only once after a very frightening incident when my mother chased me around the house screaming and accusing me of being a drug addict and drug dealer bc I had taken ambien from her medicine cabinet to help me sleep one night (and had taken 5 or 10 to keep stored away for a rainy day, but when she caught me, I took them all at once out of sheer terror hoping that would prevent me from being caught). I came to hours later, sobbing, with her still raging at me, and having torn up my bedroom from the inside out looking for evidence against me. Mind you I was an honor student on my way to the Ivy League when this happened. But the worst of the memories I know I can’t fully access. Even this all only came back to me recently. They’re mostly things that happened when I was already a teen, but that’s not when the abuse started. That’s just when I started to act out more. 

The thing about childhood trauma, and trauma in general, is that it creates a divided self. The memories of it are disconnected in our minds, but live on every day in our bodies, in our emotional reactions. I am not the bulimic teen who cut herself, those were my coping mechanisms when I was in immediate danger. I feel so disconnected from that self now. 

But “who can find a proper grave for such damaged mosaics of the mind, where they may rest in pieces? Life goes on, but in two temporal directions at once, the future unable to escape the grip of a memory laden with grief.” 

For those with childhood trauma, who have been consistently misdiagnosed and abused again, who have struggled asking themselves if they’re inherently bad, if they’re mentally ill, if they’ll ever feel worthy of love, all while not fully knowing what’s wrong with them - I am sending you a big hug. It’s not your fault. Child abuse is wrong. It is an epidemic in America, and goes unspoken of and untreated. You can heal, consciously, and you can stop spreading the trauma and recreating it. There is science developing to validate your feelings, your faulty, blurry my memories, your extreme visceral responses, and there are people who understand and relate. People who have felt like outcasts their whole lives too, inadequate, and searching for why and how to prove themselves lovable. You can heal."
PTSD from stalking and trauma,7,m4g80i,0,"I really hope you guys in this community can help me as recently I have grown to discover I have PTSD due to being stalked and childhood trauma.

I always though PTSD belonged to Military personnel or victims of Rape/ Abuse.

I had cancer at 11 and was diagnosed 2 days before I would have been suffocated by it. I had Non-hodgkin's Lymphoblastic lymphoma,   which is rare and even more so in females. It grew quick and was in the hospital by April 1st and in ICU the next day.. Haha April Fools day! Obviously I beat cancer and have a family 29 years later but the trauma is still there but barely thanks to counseling. But every year around this time it comes flooding back like it was yesterday. 

On top of that I was stalked for 3 years by my ex and have reoccurring nightmares about him showing up at my house provinces away. I changed my life because of him, if I see  a man who resembles him I melt down and literally either freeze or run the other way.

I wonder I would do if he should show up at my house 19 years later and I think I would fight him, because all of the fear he caused to myself and family.
Now I realize that I am in denial of how much trauma he caused me but feel I don't deserve the term PTSD even though I have nightmares about him, have panic attacks seeing anyone who looks like him and react when I hear anyone who has his similar name. 

Please help! I feel tortured by him and tired if him controlling me.

FYI yes I have posted on Stalkers forum but PTSD isn't really addressed on there.

Thank you all for reading my story."
I realized how disconnected I am.,98,m3ycxh,18,"Someone came over today that I used to be close with... But having them over made me realize how disconnected I am from people. How poorly I tried to keep communicating with them... I realized how disconnected I am from people like my partner and even my own child... That I feel nothing at all for them.
 I realized that when you spend every day trying to go day by day... That when you spend so long just trying to survive that you lose touch of things that are key parts of normal society. Things like just talking with friends become so distant in your mind when you have to focus all of your energy on trying to seem normal to everyone else when in reality you are far from."
Responses to triggers,3,m4gv7d,3,"Hi, I'm currently researching aspects of PTSD and was hoping anyone can shed some light on a question. So if you were put in a similar position as a previous traumatic incident, are you able to react and think clearly enough to get yourself out or do you need to rely on someone else to help you?"
The Sequel,3,m4e9v9,2,"I self published a comicbook on Amazon. I am a retired Veteran of 20 years. I was diagnosed qith PTSD 4 years ago. I barely finished my 20 years. I lost my best friend to PTSD soon after.  This book ia the culmination of his lost and my art therapy. This post is more about showing how I deal with my PTSD than self promotion, but I will post a link in the comments if any wants it."
"PTSD, Expansion of Consciousness & Other People",5,m48wwr,6,"I'm a bit skeptical to write this as there's a small part of me that wants to be cautious of narcissism and ego defence. Having said that, I think I've thought this over enough and believe the conclusion does hold weight.

When I developed PTSD, I was trying everything possible to figure out what happened to me, why am I suddenly in this vortex of fear and hypervigilence etc etc. This led to me doing extensive research in psychology, therapies, religions, spirituality, ego etc. I've had mystical experiences with psychedelics where I have experienced what I can only describe as ""Cosmic Love"".

These are things that I would estimate 90%+ of people have not done based on my interaction with people. They have not taken the time to figure out their own biases, beliefs, ideology etc. Why they do what they do, like what they like etc. Why? Because it's painful to go in there and start trying to rewire shit. There's almost no point. Whereas when you have PTSD, there's every point. It's life and death. You want so desperately to get out of it that you'll do anything. For example: start shadow work. (Jungian Philosophy)

Anyway... I also remember seeing a TedTalk on YouTube, titled: ""Psychosis or Spiritual Awakening?"". That always stuck with me. I think because, like I said, after developing PTSD, maybe 6 months later, I started doing anything I could to ""fix"" myself. Started meditating, listening to Eckhart Tolle, taking psychedelic trips, studying psychology and spirituality blah blah blah.

So basically what I'm saying is this:

I am of the opinion that trauma CAN, not neccesarily WILL, open one up to extreme growth as a person and identity, due to the desire to resolve the trauma and have a healthy, fulfilled life. This opens one up to new possibilities, new models of reality, and new beliefs to replace the previous regressive ones that may have even helped contribute to the trauma. Hence, growth and evolution occurs in the psyche.
Also, i feel the intense suffering that comes from PTSD opens one up to being more compassionate and loving to others, at least in my own experience. 

Now, I have also noticed on this journey that the majority of people just piss me off. Lol. Like I've said, most haven't done any inner work and I feel most haven't got past the mental age of 16-18. A lot of adult life that I have encountered seems to be like a school playground. This comes in the form of gossip, hierarchical social games, drama, etc.

I'm not sure if I'm communicating this correctly but I guess what I'm almost trying to say is: it's a bit like stepping out of The Matrix. Everyone else is running around creating enemies, and warring with each other. The trauma sufferer sees this as futile and wants peace and love and goes on a journey of resolution and healing becoming a better and more complete person in the process.

There's something that opens up in the midst of intense suffering (like PTSD) which I have termed here: Expansion of Consciousness.

Now, interacting with most other people just feels like a chore. It feels a lot of them do things like gaslighting, hierarchical social games, gossip etc etc. It's just exhausting.


Tried to explain as best I can. I'd love to hear what you think on this. 🙂"
One more thing you’ve taken away...,5,m4cdqe,1,"I’ve spent one year in counseling coming to terms with being diagnosed with PTSD. My husband has been talking with another woman. It’s been a rough year for us both. He is bipolar. I have MDD, anxiety, and PTSD from CSA and growing up with domestic violence at home. We’re working through it and one of our conversations he said he selfishly wants to be with someone who doesn’t have that trauma. My heart broke instantly. I just want to be happy for the rest of my life. I’ve been miserable enough."
Does anyone else see their abuser in select people around them?,19,m42hj2,5,"There's a new guy at work and every single time we make eye contact the flashbacks come rolling in. He has a similar eye color, but outside that I KNOW they're different people. I feel bad for avoiding him and maybe not being as friendly as I usually am, but his apparence is triggering by no fault of his own. Does anybody else do this? Will I be choosing select people to represent him for the rest of my life?"
Detaching from bf due to trauma. Pls help me.,10,m44lhh,1,"TW for SA/r’pe mention, s’x mention, SA trigger detail


Something my wonderful bf did triggered me so hard and now I don’t feel anything towards him the past couple weeks and I’m currently mid anxiety attack sobbing at 3am over how distraught I am. I can’t see my therapist for another 2 weeks (it’s already been 2 or 3) and I don’t know what to do, I’m desperate.




Backstory: I’ve been in weekly therapy for going on 5 years now after the lowest point in my life after I was SA’d by my old bestfriend of 10 years repeatedly. Diagnosed MDD + PTSD, layers of complex childhood and adulthood trauma. Sadly got into a relationship with an abuser June 2019 after he had groomed me for months and developed “essentially Stockholm’s” - repeated assaults and r’pes (mostly intimidation and nothing actually physically harmful I would say) had nothing on the level of daily psychological abuse he put me through. Abuser moved in Nov 2019 after convincing me to not press charges, cheated constantly while I was punished daily, treated like a slave and atm with intermittent positive reinforcement. I ended it July 2020, kicked him out in September 2020 because I was so scared of him and how he would react when I was no longer of use to him. I never wanted to be in the relationship to begin with, convinced myself it was okay and he was working on being a better man and could only survive a day at a time, and was relieved to finally end it.

I started talking to current bf in August 2020 casually, we had mutual friends. We took things slow. He’s been a great friend and never once did I feel I was using him to distract myself, I was doing my healing in therapy and we just got closer and closer over time. He’s younger with less relationship experience, and so there’s been minor insensitive things he’s done, but we work through them amazingly. Hes the only person who I have felt genuinely..tries. We communicate great, every hiccup there’s been we have one calm conversation about it and then he puts all his effort into changing something, even if it’s little and I don’t make a big deal about it, to fix the issue and it doesn’t come up again. I do what I can to accommodate him, meet him half way, compromise, support him in his life journey, and all in all be a partner, and he does the same in return. Don’t get me wrong he’s not perfect, and neither am I. He has his character flaws and things we don’t see eye to eye on, but he’s a good person, and I’ve got a lot of baggage and issues. I’ve never been so attracted to someone in my life, I was starting to see what real safety and security and happiness is supposed to feel like for the first time in my life and I can’t thank him enough for that. I was starting to feel those “in love” feelings about 5/6 months in, (I say this as someone who’s very conservative with love, who quadrupple checks that I really mean it for months before I say it because people often mistake infatuation or passion for love or being in love) thinking yeah, this is something I want for a long time. We’re with eachother all the time now and just genuinely adore doing everything together.

The Triggering Event: We went on a little getaway for Valentine’s Day. I shit you not this man makes me cry with how good he is to me, we had some amazingly passionate intimate obviously-we’re-falling-for-eachother sex the night before vday. Vday comes, he tells me he’s in love with me, and I let him know I’m getting to the point of loving him just not ready to say it yet, and we decide to make it official between us. Problem is...that night I was tired, my lingerie was being annoying and by the time it was working for me I was no longer feeling sexy yknow? But I was like hey give me some warm up time, and I’ll come back around. He proceeds to do something he knows I don’t really like, but he does..and it went on for just a minute, two tops. I slowly just stopped being into what we were doing and was silent, looking back I know this is what triggered me: (((I was reminded of previous times with people where they did stuff to me while I laid there silent in defeated “freeze” mode and didn’t want it. They didn’t care, didnt listen to my no or my disinterest, and did so until completion.))) he enjoyed this act enough to where he had to stop himself from finishing during the foreplay. After the 1-2 mins, where maybe 30 seconds I was completely silent, my bf goes “you don’t seem into this/you’re not enjoying this, let’s do something else.” The correct thing to do, obviously!! We pretty much just jumped right into sex since I’m sure he was sufficiently worked up, and looking back I realize I probably should have stopped altogether because I was turned off almost completely. I pretty much just wanted him to finish and for it to be done and over with, so I feel like I did this to myself for wanting to people please instead of being true to my feelings.

Ever since then I have been so detached from him. I was having these extreme moments of depersonalization, and this feeling of ‘otherness’ from him that I’ve never felt with anyone before. I feel so far away from him. I didn’t realize what was going on until last week when I suddenly remembered this event, I had sort of repressed it. I was feeling empty, numb, depressed with a lack of motivation for self care, having nightmares about my ex abuser. I have secluded myself from my friends because I don’t feel anything - I don’t care to be friends with anyone right now. I don’t f e e l. It also means I don’t feel anything towards my bf right now.. I don’t get giddy, I don’t get butterflies, I’m sex repulsed, I don’t feel happy but I don’t feel sad. I’m just empty. I KNOW it’s because I’m in “flight” and “freeze” mode - I KNOW it’s because I was triggered and I now feel unsafe in general and so being vulnerable or close to anyone is automatically being avoided. I cannot stop it. I know these things and usually when I’m aware of them I can process and move through it. But I can’t. And my therapist (who I haven’t seen since before vday because her sudden busy schedule) just canceled next weeks appointment. I’ve been holding out a couple weeks for our next app and now it’s even farther out. I feel like I’m going to lose it.

The emptiness I feel towards this amazing, adorable man is hurting me so bad. Tonight I got insecure he was lying to me about something my ex abuser would lie about, which I know means my Trauma Brain is feeling like it’s happening All Over Again even though logically I know it’s not and that this is not my ex and he simply made a mistake. I feel like my ex abuser is ruining my current relationship without even being here, and it makes me feel ruined and tainted by the abuse all over again and it makes the su!cidal ideation increase.

Literally a day before I realized what was going on with me, we had discussed him moving some of his stuff in since he’s here so often (he’s house hunting but the market sucks), then circumstances made it so he would have to basically move in completely until he finds a house, and he wants to do it ASAP now. I want to but I cant, I cannot do this. Not right now. I feel like I’m back in survival mode and I can’t see into tomorrow let alone the next few months or god forbid a year from now. My shitty Trauma Brain will convince me I do not want friends or relationships and it’s so hard to fight it. It’s trying to convince me I feel nothing for him (I still have moments where I’m like aww I have a crush on him) and that he’s not what I want. He is though. And it feels like this Trauma reaction is something that’s not me at all, not my real thoughts or feelings, and it’s consuming me and making me think that somehow it’s right.

I don’t want to end things with him. I want to feel that spark again. I want to stop feeling so triggered and go back to feeling happy and safe. I don’t feel like I can talk to my friends right now because I’m so emotionally detached from everything.

I don’t know what to do and I’m falling apart."

Today I had mediaton with one of my abusers.,124,m3p6nx,22,"We never had a relationship just FWB who ended up with a child,I did not see the red flags before I got pregnant. 

For 2 years he has been verbally abusing me, gaslighting me and treathening me.
We have had meetings on meetings than never helped.
And today was the day I feared the most,mediation. 

And I went through with it, I owned it.
I was scared shitless,I could not eat,my anxiety was at an all time high but I did it.
And im proud of myself, because for once I did not just sit there nodding my head saying yes to things I disagreed on.
No, I went in there full force looked him deep into his eyes and I said 

""I dont trust you,I dont respect you and I dislike you, but still im sitting here today trying to come to an agreement for our son.
It.felt.so.good.
It felt so damn good to finally being brave enough to tell him that. And when he gave me a letter from his lawyer where he treathened me that if I dont share custody he will take me to court.

I was even braver, again I looked him into his eyes and said no, he replied ""well ill take you to court"" and what I said its insane for me to even write ""Well then bring it on"". 

I am so proud of myself, I dont care that I have not been able to eat all day or that I feel like a truck has run over me. Im so damn tired I cant think straight, but none of that matters because I
I faced my abuser,I raised my voice,I stood my ground.

EDIT:

Thank you all for your lovely comments and thank you for the rewards♡ its the next day and im still dead tired but I feel good, in the middle of all of this I forgot the person who supervise the visitations had to work a late shift and it was visitation day, so guess who had to open the door and si hi to him. And I did that too with flying colors!"

Can a great amount of physical pain give you ptsd?,3,m45ool,7,Like if you wake up after an invasive surgery and the analgesic is not working.
Trying to understand what happened to me,4,m43uh7,0,"So this might be confusing so I apologize in advance I’ve just never told anybody about this as it’s quite personal. I have a lot of trauma surrounding how person and whereas this wasn’t the worst that occurred it’s the only part of it I can’t talk about fully, I never bring up. I try to avoid.

Before this specific thing started I had gone through something very traumatic so my partner suggested ‘age regression’ to me and to try it, I wasn’t too fond of it but he kept assuring me that it would work. He’d make me do this almost daily but it got worse and worse as the days went on. 

He stopped treating me like I was one person and started acting like I was two, giving negative connotations to the version of me which wasn’t regressed. He’d call the non regressed version “Mean (my name)” and then the regressed version “Baby (my name)” and over time he’d buy items that toddlers would use and force me to use them. I expressed my discomfort but he assured me I was just embarrassed and that this was helping me.

Overtime he started forcing me to talk about the regressed version of me as if it was a completely different person, separating the two. He’d also sexualize that version and any time we participated in anything of those sorts he’d say he preferred the regressed version and force me to do that. 

One night I broke down and cried to him that I hated it, I couldn’t do it anymore, it wasn’t helping and it was only making things worse and in response he got pissed off and ignored me. Then I said I didn’t want to participate in anything sexual with him because of how much it was interfering with our relationship, my mental health and my final year of high school. The next day he came to me saying he was very insecure, especially with the timing because he had opened up a lot more sexually to me and that he loved spending time with me and how sex was a necessity and we needed it to bond. That same day I did my finals and ended up throwing up multiple times because of the amount of anxiety I had from him blatantly ignoring me for trying to get out of this. 

After that I continued on, but the things he’d do or made me do got worse. Make me use ‘pull ups’ or suck on dummies, wouldn’t let me have actual glasses but sippy cups. I expressed my discomfort multiple times but it would always lead to him getting upset and me feeling awful again so I carried on. He set rules for me, had me have a ‘bed time’ and would even ask the non regressed me if I he could go on play dates with the regressed version. Completely treating it like I was two different people. 

Late in December of that year I had an infertility scare and I was terrified because I always wanted t have children, luckily it wasn’t infertility at the time but now compared to them the thought of having or being around babies horrifies me. I freak out anytime I see anything like that or if people try to baby me or talk about age regression. Being around anything in relation makes me nauseous. 

I don’t know if it was the being forced into being two people, the discomfort of the sexualization or what but when I talk about this trauma any other part with it I’m fine with talking about to a degree, it doesn’t bother me when it comes up. Sure context matters and how it’s brought up can impact me heavily but even mere mentions of this or even anything to do with toddlers sends me into full panic. It was quite hard writing all of this out. I just want to understand what happened to me, and why this affects me so much more than other things like sexual/physical violence."

On the 10th of March 2018, my ex raped me for the first time. There were times before that, when I didnt actually want to, but was too afraid to deny sex. There were times after that when he raped me again, but by then I was able to dissociate. But that day, I was screaming, crying and kicking him. I was begging him to stop, and he didn't care. I thought he was going to kill me because he was hurting me so much.
Before the incident, I was an open book. I had no trouble sharing my troubles with my friends and my parents. But this was something I couldn't tell anyone, it ate me up inside. I knew what he did was wrong, but I was too afraid to leave him. He always told me nobody would ever love me as much as he loved me, and I believed him. I blamed myself, I told him that I wanted sex that night. But he did something I didnt like, I told him and he just kept going. 

I've come a long way in those 3 years. I've had a lot of EMDR, I've been through so much trauma therapy. I have gotten addicted to marijuana, but am also in recovery for that now and am almost 6 months sober. I've been through hell but I'm in an okay place mentally. I'm still mentally hurting, I still need a lot of therapy, but I'm no longer suicidal. I am no longer surviving, I am living. 

But 10th of March is always an awful day. Even though most days I barely think about him, 10th of March just hurts me. I can feel the scarf he was choking me with around my throat, I start remembering things I had forgotten about, I'm scared he somehow knows where I am and is going to do it again. It reminds me of other people who have traumatised me later in life, even though those people had nothing to do with that incident. 10th of March makes me feel like the girl who I was the first few years after it happened. An addicted girl, who had lost all sense of self, was cutting herself to punish herself for just existing, the girl who would stand near the train tracks every night and hoping one day she would have the guts to jump. 

Now its the 13th of March, I survived yet another 10th of March. But I'm still hurting from Wednesday. It might take a few weeks to go back to 'normal', but I will get there. And next year, I will survive another 10th of March"
DAE have flashbacks that accumulate from being triggered over the course of several days?,4,m433uz,2,"Woke up today having a flashback. I couldn’t figure out why the hell my brain decided to open the floodgates while I was asleep but then I remembered I actually have done a couple triggering things over the past 3 days. I stopped in my hometown for food the other day and was anxious and uncomfortable but I got the food and left and was okay. Then I visited my aunt and she started venting about our family and stuff she went through as a kid and I vented to her about things me and my brother went through, she said a word that triggered me and I told her that it did but she said it a few more times (don’t think she was being malicious, just doesn’t understand ptsd) 

Then last night I turned on a TV show I used to watch as a kid and only watched one episode. Again, felt anxious but relatively alright. 

During all of those I just felt really uncomfortable and like I wanted to get out of the situation, but didn’t have full blown flashbacks and felt relatively alright. Then today I wake up in one. 

Anyone else have this happen?"
Am I blowing this out of proportion?,1,m4a2er,1,"I try my best to apply stoicism with insomnia as I know I can be quite emotional when I'm tired and feeling vulnerable to flash backs. This is a rant to try and apply some of the emotions but advice would be welcome here too. 

The onset of high emotion was so rapid that I would hurt myself to cope whenever this happened years ago. Not so often anymore and I don't self harm either but it makes the process a lot fucking harder without that go-to. Just feeling like a loose fucking cannon.

I went out for a run today and my phone died. Running without music is like meditation and I hate it. All the thoughts suppressed have a chance to dominate when not drowned out by loud music. I broke down mid way through for a minute because I was just so fucking tired and couldn't think about anything else. Told my mum this when I got home. An hour or so later she says 'I hate to tell you this, but I had a wonderful sleep. It just makes you feel so much better!'
I asked why she was telling me then, and if she understood how it was coming across. She went off in a huff. 
I'm struggling to apply stoicism in this situation. In fact, as an extra vent, without fail, every morning I will be asked 'Well? Did you sleep this time?'. I've had that ice breaker everyday for 3 months. Despite repeatedly requesting not to fucking ask.

I love my mum, our relationship is fine, she is not the  most maternal but she shows love in other ways. It's just on some occasions, like this, that I just don't know how to respond or manage the aftermath within myself. 
If I was to express this to her, I would be said to be being oversensative and then dismissed. I can't really cope with that either so I don't know where to put all this. I'm not sensitive, I have PTSD and insomnia, I don't believe it's the same thing and find myself quite insulted each time my mental health is deemed just me being sensitive."
Nightmares,2,m45n34,2,"Hello I would just like a bit of advice as I’m very new to these symptoms. What I’m about to type may be triggering.



I’m not going into much detail but I was sexually assaulted when I was around 4 and basically only found out 2 years ago. Recently I’ve felt very out of it and started waking up screaming thinking something is trying to get me. This time I was at my boyfriend’s house and it was very embarrassing. I actually hurt him during this episode, not too bad thankfully, it was just some kicks. However, I’m frightened it may get worse and I may actually hurt someone. I was looking up night terrors and they involve you forgetting but I am so petrified I can’t sleep. I believed the thing is still coming for me and in my dream it looked so real, I was having panic attack afterwards for about 15 minutes so that makes me believe it wasn’t a night terror. 

I’m not sure where these dreams have come from I have had 2 in the past 2 months (these two weren’t as bad. I was running away in my house and my mum came to help me and that was very effective, I wasn’t scared afterwards ) and I’m not sure if it’s the incident that is causing them as it’s been bothering me more. Things such as being scared to have sex or seeing myself naked when in a bad mental state. I’ve been very dissociated too. I’m really confused about the way I feel and I really want it all to stop because I can’t deal with how frightening the dreams are. Has anyone here experienced anything similar?"

Does anyone have any experience with getting on disability? I saw some people saying that getting a disability lawyer makes the process easier?

Is doubting own trauma common? TW: Abuse,104,m3ejl4,26,"I need advice from objective people (tldr at bottom). 

Years ago I (M) said no to someone (F) who wanted to have sex with me. She asked and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She asked again and I said I didn't want to. We were sitting down at the time. She got on top of me and I froze as she had sex with me. I didn't push her off. She tried to kiss me and I tried to turn away but was unable to. The whole thing was very brief. I didnt think too much about it for years after (i had the mindset of 'I am male so it isn't the same' ) and I have been on good terms with her since. 

I went for therapy a couple years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist at the time focused a lot on why she acted she did at the time and in the years I've known this person I've learned she was sexually assaulted by guys before I knew her. Likewise I was sexually assaulted by an older boy when i was very young. I gradually began to understand why she acted the way she did and also why I froze (i was beaten up a lot as a kid too and i would always freeze then as well). To that end I hold no anger towards her, as she was a product of her suffering. It helped me move on for a time. She's changed. I've changed. We've grown and now we are supportive of each other. I have forgiven my other attackers as well as part of my own journey. 

The problem I have is that sometimes I doubt the whole thing and now I blame myself. Its like 'i hold no anger, i understand why she was like that' but now I question whether I was raped at all. 

**Tl:DR: **  I guess I'm just looking for a more objective outsider opinion: Given that I said I didnt want sex twice and then didnt fight back, I was still raped, right? Being on good terms now and understanding why that happened doesnt invalidate my experience does it? Is my self doubt just a part of the PTSD?

Advice appreciated."
"Dealing with anger? How do you forgive, or at least stop caring about what they did?",9,m3n21w,5,"So, I had pretty successful treatment for PTSD some time ago (EMDR plus some talk therapy) and a lot of my symptoms are under control.

Unfortunately for me I am still full of rage. 

My trauma was such that I didn't find out who was responsible for it for years. By the time I knew, they were out of my life. I'm angry that I never got to confront them, that I was nice to them when I didn't know how they'd hurt me and others, and that they haven't faced any consequences, and that they've probably gone on to hurt other people in similar ways.

I think about them often and I hope horrible things happen to them. And I guess this is understandable, but I know it isn't good for my health, and it's a pall on my otherwise-improved mental well-being. God knows what it's doing to me physically.

I want to move towards a place of forgiveness, or at least to a place of indifference to them as people, to truly gain some peace after all this. Before PTSD I never really used to hold grudges, but a lot of the attitudes I had before that helped me not be angry at people just don't seem to work if I apply them here. A lot of the advice about anger online seems to be about not lashing out at people (which I never have) and a lot of the forgiveness content is non-instructional or religious, which doesn't help me much.

If anyone's got strategies that help with this, I'd be really grateful."
Does anyone else keep a mostly clean house but have a messy nightmare of a bedroom?,8,m3mpow,3,
Am I traumatized?,2,m3tmll,2,"I don’t really like to be the person who diagnoses them self. But I am planning to seek professional help.

So last night I took an edible and when I do I usually watch funny shows, play games, or listen to music. But last night once the thc hit me I had a flashback when looking at myself in the mirror. I think it lasted like 20 minutes of me looking in the mirror and thinking about the time my parents use to fight a lot. 

My parents use to fight all the time and it would be a regular thing like I would be so excited to go to school because I knew i wouldn’t hear them fight, I would be so happy to sleep over at my cousins because I wouldn’t hear them fight. 

But my flashback was back to a time when the fight was more intense than usual: me and my little brother were playing in my parents room and then we heard my parents shouting and then my mom came into the room and told us to pack clothes. I remember trying to get my shoes on but my dad didn’t want us to leave and kept saying he was sorry but my mom wanted to leave. As we were pulling out of the driveway my dad ran out and kept calling us a “bullshit family” I think the whole time my siblings were scared of my dad but the whole time I just wanted to run out and hug him. 

Then I started remembering multiple times when they fought and since that flashback I couldn’t stop thinking about it and I can’t stop crying. I’ve been told that the family should talk to each other about this. But my parents are old and I’m afraid if I bring anything up it’ll spark arguments again and maybe give one of them a heart attack or stroke. As my dad had a minor stroke a few years ago. 

I’ve never really talked about this because when I was in kindergarten I talked about how my parents fought with my teacher and she called my mom then my mom didn’t want anyone to know what was going on so she got mad at me. Since then I’ve been scared to talk about the times they fought and looking back I am seeing the impact it left on the family. 

Lately I’ve just thought about trying to heal myself and somewhat try to bring the family close again. Because I remember the time when my parents never fought and it was before the time my dads mom died. I remember we were once a happy family"
Devastated.,3,m3ox6k,3,"I've posted here once before as I was struggling with the anniversary of my partner before last who died next to me. 

Today I was on tik-tok and stumbled across a man who looked so much like him, his eyes, his mannerisms, I was so unprepared and am so devastated, and I felt like I was having a heart attack?? From shock??
It's been almost 5 years since he died and I do okay mostly but today I do not feel okay. I feel as if I am experiencing day 1, and seeing this man so freakishly similar to my person has left me breathless. I went home and cried on my husband during my lunch break and I'm just trying to make it through the day. 
I hope I never ever see this person with my own 2 eyes, I don't think I could recover. It was both the worst and best thing I have ever experienced."
My hatred and psychopathy toward dogs all started because of a traumatic experience,0,m3vjwi,3,"Before I get started, I'd like to warn everybody that this post may contain anti-dog actions. If you like dogs, that's fine. But please no derailing or victim blaming. Thank you.

A while ago, I posted a rant on why I hate dogs, and it didn't turn out very well. A couple of guys were saying horrible shit about me. But you know what? Fuck those ignorant bitches! They honestly don't give a shit about what I go through, so they can suck my dick!

Anyways, for those of you who didn't know already, I fucking HATE dogs! Now you may be asking ""why the fuck do you hate dogs for?"". Here's how it all began. I was three or four when I first discovered my hatred for dogs. My car door was open and I was just about to get out, when all of a sudden, a big-ass mutt came storming into my side and bit my hand really hard with its mouth! I screamed and cried while my parents took me home. For years, I've been terrified by these fucking things! I begged my parents to carry me to keep me safe whenever I went to my grandmother's house. I would have nightmares of them chasing after me with their hungry eyes. I would tell anyone about how horrified I am of dogs, but no one gave a shit about it! They just brush it off like I'm crazy. And yet they fucking push me to get near them! Would I ever pressure anyone to go on a ferris wheel ride with me even if they're afraid of heights? Fuck no! It's bad enough that I have allergies at home without any pets around, but for fuck's sake I will scream my lungs out if I see any mudprints, hair, or even droppings on my property, furniture, floor, whatever!

If I'm crazy enough to shoot every fucking mongrel I lay my eyes on, then I guess I am! If I'm a psychopath to actually wish every single one of these fucking mutts to die of cancer, then hell yes I am! What I'm trying to say is those of you who want to tell me how fucked up I am denies not only my past traumatic experience, but also everyone else's. The main reason for my fucked up thinking process is how I became fucked up in the first place. My past trauma (including being physically, verbally, and emotionally abused by my parents) is the main reason for my psychopathic behavior. And I will be honest, I can be persuaded all I like to start getting involved with these mutts, but I'm an all-or-nothing type of person. I could internally shut down as they start sinking their teeth into my flesh."
I don’t remember my childhood :(,77,m338hu,19,"trigger warning: violence
hello! recently I’ve been very sad on how I don’t remember my childhood. so, I’m kinda still in my childhood, I’m only 15! but, I’ve dealt with generalized anxiety disorder and ocd since I was 7, and trauma since I was 11. my dad is sometimes very violent, and he  does bad things (especially towards my mom). I don’t want to go into details but just know, it isn’t good. throughout my early years (8-12) it was only violence and arguing. I have nightmares and anger/emotional outbursts throughout the day that are hard to deal with (all related to my parents). my therapist says I have “complex trauma” and I cannot remember ages 8-11 at all. its very sad. i feel like I didn’t even have a childhood! I only remember the fights and stuff, but everything else is a blur. is this related to trauma or is it something else? I have struggles with dissociating in grade 5 and 6 so I don’t know if that’s related. how can I get my good memories back? what has worked for any of you guys? please help! I am very sad and I feel like my childhood was wasted :("
Has anyone here read A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara?,4,m3khrj,1,"I’m torn on how i feel about this book in relation to my own trauma. It is at times an excruciating read, I’ve never read a book that literally punched me in the face with emotion every 15 pages, and like a masochist I’d sit there and read it alternating between crying because something was so small and so touching or so tragic and heartbreaking. It’s been 5 years and I still think about this book at least a few times every week.

It’s, at its core, a story about trauma and friendship but centers around one character who has had one of the most difficult lives imaginable, like even to just touch on the basics would require every trigger warning there is. At some points it almost feels like tragedy porn, but it balances that with these extremely tender and heartfelt moments and reflections on friendship. 

In a way I felt like the book traumatized me, but on the other it feels so important that I read it. I’m just wondering if any other trauma survivors who’ve read it have had a similar reaction, or just what your thoughts were in general."
ADHD and PTSD,7,m3ey1n,6," I've struggled with anxiety my whole life and was also recently diagnosed with ADHD and my psychiatric nurse also mentioned I have symptoms of PTSD. I'm trying to figure out if some of the mood related issues I'm dealing with are related to my ADHD OR are things that can happen with PTSD, and appreciate any insight. 

So basically I have moments or days when something triggers an intense mood reaction in me, and I feel these intense negative feelings ( hard to describe but sometimes they are like dread or just an intense negative feeling) accompanied by physical sensations in my chest or throat, or sometimes in the back of my neck. The issue that caused my PTSD was that my child was abducted by her Dad when he began cheating on me, and for a YEAR, I basically had no certainty that my daughter was OK ( her Dad wouldn't let me talk to her and wouldn't tell me where they were and I had no money to go travel internationally to find them) and so was emotionally tortured and lived in fear everyday. On top of that, I had immense, immense Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria from my husband cheating and essentially throwing me away like I was trash. I now have sole custody and my daughter is doing well, but I'm still an emotional wreck and I'm trying to figure out what to do about it, and if the mood stuff I'm dealing with is related to the PTSD or ADHD/Rejection Sensitivity Dysphoria. 

My psychiatric nurse is out of my network so I haven't been able to go back to her, and I had a very bad reaction to the initial round of medication we tried for my ADHD ( low dose Adderal) and I'm hoping when I go back to her, I can better articulate what I'm feeling so she can help me find what will work. 

Anyhow, I appreciate any insight!"
I’m not sure if it actually happened or if it was a dream,2,m3jfd3,4,"Tw: rape..?, online predators

I have a ‘memory’ of when I was around 5 years old and had a sexual intercourse with someone. I used to think it was a dream but it keeps coming back to me and making me feel so uneasy. It being a dream makes no sense. I was 5, why would I dream of that?

All I really remember is this old looking wooden outdoor wc or a small cabin or something similar (I’m not sure) and the grass surrounding it. I don’t remember seeing much from when it actually happened, I think my eyes were covered.
It’s so frustrating that I cannot remember what exactly happened and figure it out. I just want to know what happened 

The reason why I think it’s real is because sometimes I get really touch repulsive and self destructive out of nowhere and I never knew the reason. Sometimes talking or mentioning anything sexual will give me a full blown mental breakdown.

The worst thing is that it’s not the only thing that’s happened. I met a pedophile online around the same age, maybe a year later, and have had a bunch of other disturbing occurrences on the internet since my parents didn’t really monitor anything.

Idk, I wish this was easier to deal with"
I don’t know why I feel like this,5,m3dk3t,0,"Hi everyone (or anyone) that’s reading. I have only started looking into these strange feelings and behaviours in myself recently, and just really want to reach out to share my problems (and maybe find people in a similar situation).

So, I’ve got two weird behavioural things that I have experienced since childhood (I have no memory of any abuse as a child). I’m currently in a great place in my life but still experience these regularly.

Firstly, I get this terrible, whole body disgust. It lasts for only about a minute and occurs every couple of months. The best way I can describe it is a completely unprovoked wave of deep shame and disgust about myself. I feel embarrassed and dirty, and just want to cover myself up. It’s an overwhelming feeling in my chest, arms and stomach. I feel so disgusting and dirty that I just want to hide away from everyone and even myself. This does eventually pass, and then I’m back to feeling completely normal.

Secondly, I have this unavoidable need and requirement to cover myself in super unflattering clothes around my family, more specifically, male members of my family like my dad. The thought of showing certain areas of skin (which I am completely comfortable to display around my partner and friends) makes me incredibly uncomfortable when around these male figures. On top of this, any positive remarks about my looks from these family members, makes me feel icky and gross. I actively try to look as ugly as possible when around such people.

So, as I said, I have no recollection of abuse in my childhood. But these feelings are so intense and relentless that it completely baffles me. I would really appreciate anyone’s thoughts, and would love to hear anyone else’s experiences.

Thank you for reading."
Severe anger when people try to control/influence my decisions and what is good for me?,132,m2ojod,36,"Idk if this is related to PTSD, but i noticed i get extremely angry to the point of rage when people try to control me or try to make me do things i don’t want to do or try to control my decisions.

mother with ptsd. need some sort of advice or support,4,m3c714,2,"hi there,

i didn't know if i should mark this as vent or advice because it is a combination of both.

my mom keeps having ptsd episodes in the evening which usually gets both my parents arguing until she is exhausted and falls asleep. the reason i consider them episodes is she tends to talk about her insecurities and parents (which they have passed away and she does say her dad gave her ptsd), but also talks (ends up shouting) in circles about subjects that have upset her and sometimes she is antagonistic (will touch you if you don't want her to, too.) her shouting is really agitating so its REALLY hard for me to just be like ""hey everything is going to be alright."" it seems like she doesn't really remember what happens the next day but she also does... but this has been going on for at least two years and when i confront my parents about it, they keep making excuses for having arguments so loud in the house that everyone can hear instead of just talking things out. my mom has told me her therapist said she can express her feelings however she wants...

i understand that PTSD is complicated but there needs to be help because it is wearing down everyone. in addition to the PTSD there is addiction with alcohol and my mom has taken xanax for anxiety so i know that doesn't help her memory. recently my dad told me that if i keep mentioning all the bad things they do during arguments, then they have no reason to change or to try to get better. so that helps sort of but my emotional needs are being put second because of the past.

i need some sort of advice. this post is only a slice of the pie of what happens. i know that it is on my parents ultimately to get help because they want it but it is so hard watching this keep happening. i know my parents have had painful pasts, but they giving me and my siblings a very difficult present and they act like our home life isn't stressful or frustrating to us."

I need help supporting a friend…,6,m35a9u,1,"TW: RAPE

Recently I’ve had a friend who has wanted to have sex. We have traded numerous times but feels extreme guilt when he finishes. We were also supposed to hook up numerous times, but he would always back out at the last minute. So I could tell something wasn’t right. 

So I started to ask him some questions, I prefaced the question by saying that I won’t judge you and just be honest ok? I then went on to ask him if he was sexually assaulted. He told me he was, when he was younger by an older male friend. When I asked him if he wanted to talk to me about it he said no. I immediately changed the subject. 

I briefly touched on the topic of internalized homophobia and I can completely help him with that as I was once struggled with it. I told him that when he’s ready to talk about it I’m here for him. I also told him I wanted to give him some space and time to process some of these thoughts.

I fear as if he may have PTSD, while I’m familiar with the syndrome. I’m not familiar with it being caused by an assault. I’m asking for help because I know he has a shitty family life, and doesn’t really have anyone there for him. I’m asking for advice on this so when he’s ready to talk. I know what to say.

Need some help: how to tell someone to stop triggering my ed.,2,m39v48,2,"So, long story short, I have an eating disorder tied to my ptsd thanks to my mom and her repeated and frequent comments on my weight. I used to starve myself for days on end, feel like I was going to throw up midmeal, not be able to eat in public bc it felt like people were judging me, ect.   Recently, and with thanks to my fiance, I've been managing to eat better and more than I have in years prior. The issue though is, we are currently staying with his mom due to life reasons and she, while she has good intentions, does tend to trigger my ed. She'll get on us for what we eat if she doesn't consider it healthy enough, told me a couple times that I won't stay skinny ( I'm also currently still recovering from being dangerously underweight ) if I keep eating the food I am, ect. And that tends to send me into a downward spiral of wanting to starve myself again, of only seeing my fat every time I see myself in the mirror... That kind of thing. And I'm just wondering how to POLITELY let her know that she's tripping me up. I know what I eat isn't always the healthiest ( though I do try ), but at least I'm eating something, which is better than before, right?     Thanks for any advice in advance."
I trust way too easily considering past trauma,14,m2wpya,3,"Hey! I first want to leave a content warning just in case!

I was wondering if anyone else has had this experience or if it’s common at all. But essentially I have quite a bit of trauma from my childhood as well as past abusive relationships that very much do effect me to this day. 
One thing I’ve always been painfully aware of is despite this trauma I’ve always been way too willing to completely open up to someone and trust them within the first few times I’ve met them. Because of this I have been used a lot and hurt a lot so at this point I should be able to be more wary of those I meet. However I still continue this cycle of trust and hurt.

Does anyone ever really get over sexual assault?,2,m36598,3,"Trigger warning SA. 

I (20F) broke up with my LDR boyfriend of 3 years maybe 6-7 months ago because it just won't work out with our families. We are on really good terms and are still the closest and best of friends. I was also sexually assaulted when I was 15, only something I recognized and came into terms with around 4 months ago. During the relationship, my ex boyfriend had told me that I was sexually assaulted, but I never believed him because I felt like I was exaggerating the whole thing or that maybe he said it because he was protective. 

We used to have sex during the relationship and it was great, but ever since I realized I was sexually assaulted, I no longer have any desire to have sex (with anyone) one bit. It's almost as though, all of my desire has totally vanished. Even the slightest thought of any physical touch makes me feel anxious and worried. 

I must admit that I still love with my ex, but I know in my heart it won't work out, although I still love him very much (and he loves me too). There's this guy I recently became friends with and I felt like he may have feelings for me and he does have a background that would work out with my family. Although I don't even know if he likes me, I just still feel anxious or scared about even speaking to men again. I don't even know if I have feelings for him. Obviously not everyone out there is a pedophile or rapist, but I feel this sense of anxiety speaking to men (who I'm not good friends with) in general, especially in situations where there may be the chance of being more than friends. 

I genuinely have no idea how I'm going to get into a relationship again because the entire thing just makes me anxious - and whenever I feel this way, I like to disappear. I'm probably not going to text the guy for a few days bc I feel my anxiety shooting up again. 

My question is: those of you who were sexually assaulted, how did you ever get into relationships again and feel comfortable with physical intimacy?"

Ptsd from tripping on edibles I guess,1,m3a1vh,2,"

I tripped 3 months ago and had constant dissociation for 2 months which was just internal chaos and panic for the duration, my triggers seem to be dissociation, infinity, tripping and the matrix and other strange thoughts can cause it but they seem to be indescribable and tbf anything can really cause what I think is a flashback because things seem to just cause it randomly. Now I dont know if I really truly have ptsd but whenever I see these things I get sent into immediate panic and like im gonna or am falling down the rabbit hole again and that makes me freak out or well i guess im freaking out because the dissociating makes that invisible really i never really get passed the point of rolling about my bed and groaning because of how uncomfortable I am but inside I feel as if im getting sucked out the arse of reality. I don't seem to have 1 singular intrusive thought but a large collection ever expanding weird thoughts ethier like the weirdness of existence and consciousness, it causes me to dissociate hard and feel like im tripping again I don't know what this is but from what ive heard it sounds like ptsd I talk to my therapist about it but I won't be able to see a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis for a few months my question is what do you think? Is this ptsd or im I experiencing something else? I have asd and I had a panic disorder before all this mess so maybe I just exacerbated it? who the fuck knows at this point"

Just diagnosed with PTSD,4,m2ud1i,1,"TW: sexual assault, suicidal ideation



I was diagnosed with severe depressive disorder 25 years ago.  I have been in therapy and on medication ever since, and have struggled a lot with keeping jobs, having enough money for my bills, keeping insurance and medications, etc.  Every couple of years I would have a major breakdown, lose whatever job I had at the time, and spiral downwards.

Well, we had a breakthrough in therapy the other day and I got a new, additional diagnosis - PTSD.  I had never told anyone before about being raped when I was 19.  I finally opened up to my therapist and told her about it and together we traced the onset of my depression to that exact incident.  Literally everything that has gone wrong in my life is because of what that monster did to me.

I am so angry I can’t deal with it.  I literally seethe when I think about how this one thing and this one man completely ruined my life.  I can’t stop thinking about where I might be and how my life might be if it had never happened and I am overwhelmed by these thoughts.  I can’t move on and I almost wish we’d never figured this out, because I feel like I’ve regressed and ruined 25 years of therapy.  

This is why I’ve never been able to trust men enough to make a relationship work, so I’m 44 and single.  This is why men with mustaches give me panic attacks.  This is why I was promiscuous for ten years, because I didn’t think I was worth anyone forging a real relationship with me and that sex was the only thing I had to offer.  This is why I think about ending it all every time I get into a major depressive episode.  This is the answer to ‘why me’ whenever I think about how no one else in my family has depression.  This is why I can’t keep a job and why I live in poverty and why my therapist says that I am the poster child for disabling depression.  

I hate him and I want him to die. I have no idea where he is now, I can’t find any trace of him on the internet, and there is a very real part of me that wants to get a private investigator and track him down so I can ... I don’t even know.  He needs to be punished.  He needs to know what he’s done to me but he probably won’t even care, or worse, he might be happy about it.  He might have done this to other women.  

So basically he’s ruined my life up to now and now, he’s ruining it even more because I’m so hyper focused on him and what he did.  How do I get over this?  How can I stop thinking about him and being so angry?  Angry doesn’t even seem like a strong enough word ... I’m incensed, I’m enraged, I’m furious.  I don’t like feeling like this; it colors everything and I can’t even do the things that brought me happiness before.  

I do have another appointment with my therapist and we’re going to be dealing with this but we just made the discovery at our last session and I have to wait a few more days before I can see her again.  

I guess I’m just looking for advice from anyone who might have an idea how I can stop letting this monster live rent free in my head."

ptsd makes yet another appearance,1,m31yhm,7,ptsd is wild tonight with all the conversation around sexual assault in the uk. its so scary that although everyone is talking - no change is being made. will life ever get better ? just constant fear of worrying when the next attack will happen. where is the justice for victims.
Misdiagnosed as OCD when it was really PTSD,1,m301rj,1,"So I had a traumatic event happen to me almost 2 years ago. Someone broke into my apartment.  It really shook me, and it caused me to have all of these side-effects happen. I couldn't sleep because I was terrified something would happen again, and also because I would have nightmares about what happened. I continually would check all of my locks, windows, leave lights on to look like I was awake, etc. I couldn't even do normal things like shower or cook without having to be on full alert about everything going on in my apartment.

It really disturbed my life, and I was in school at the time, so I was falling behind so much as I wasn't sleeping/couldn't concentrate. I decided I really needed to go to a therapist because I was ashamed and embarrassed to talk to anyone I knew about this. The therapist was great. We did CBT, and she diagnosed me as having OCD because I would ""check"" my locks and windows a lot. The CBT really did help, and I had to stop seeing her because my insurance changed and unfortunately I could no longer afford out of pocket prices. But I felt so much better after months of working through what happened.

A few months later, I went to another therapist. She was AWFUL. I told her how I was diagnosed with OCD, and she said there was no way I had OCD. She kept on asking me about what happened with the event, and she almost mocked me for being so scared. She told me people with OCD counted their steps etc while I was just scared of something. This really hurt me. Knowing I had support from the other therapist and doing CBT helped me to kind of realize what happened and to work through it, and stop having these awful thoughts. Going to her kind of put me into this hole again in a way.

Yesterday I went to a new psychiatrist to get medicine for anxiety and ADHD. I hesitantly told her about what happened, and we discussed it a lot. She said she thinks I was misdiagnosed with OCD as this is not something I have done/still do unless something triggers me into thinking about the event (re: the checking locks, etc). She said it was PTSD that I actually had. I never even knew much about PTSD, but after reading about it online, it makes so much sense to me. And in some way, I feel better knowing that it wasn't just me being silly for being so upset over something that happened a while ago, and not feel embarrassed for being so traumatized.

Anyway, I wonder if other people on here have also been misdiagnosed with OCD or something else instead of PTSD."
My future PTSD support flower garden (Want a flower?),204,m1zl8e,383,"For every person who comments their favorite flower out of the ones listed, I will plant one in my garden. This way I think it will be nice for them to know they’re cared for!

Flower choices: Zinnia, Merrygold, Poppy, Sunflower

I make a butterfly garden every year and thought this time around I’d support others with PTSD."
I feel more calm under pressure?,6,m2mcvg,8,"Back story, I was diagnosed with PTSD at 15 from living in a somewhat abusive household and from getting hospitalized after being attacked in my teens. Got diagnosed again after my partner shot himself while we were on duty together. Moving on... I see the symptoms pretty much day to day. It has been hell and back trying to be normal or not tell everyone to fuck themselves, it’s been hell trying not to break shit every time I hear a door slam or I hear a loud knock.

But what’s weird is... I’m finding that I find comfort in situations of high stress. Whether it’s at work, and I’m trying to track someone down, or it’s at home and I’ve got my headphones on playing the campaign for Call of Duty MW. It’s like, I don’t like loud noises or stress when it’s out of my control, but when it comes down to it.. the only time I do feel comfortable is when I’m playing videogames, in the middle of a gunfight.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is it healthy? What makes you guys “comfortable”?"
Emergency workers diagnosed with PTSD,4,m2n68w,7,"I’m a firefighter that has been doing this career for 18 years. I was diagnosed with PTSD after finally admitted something was wrong and things were going down-hill.  
It’s a bit embarrassing and there is a lot of feelings of  guilt. The thought that others have seen or done more then you is always on my mind. 
Now that I’ve opened up about it, it’s like the flood gates have opened up and things seem worse. But I’ve been told that things will get worse before they ever get better."
Need to vent,5,m2lm9q,4,"Tomorrow marks the 5th year anniversary of my best bud dying next to me. We were deployed together and shared some tough times.

Please check on your vets. We’re pretty good at hiding things. 
Miss you Bucky."
Trigger warning. I'm ok and not in danger. Wrote this working through some emotions and was curious what you all think.,1,m2u2xv,5,"*possible trigger warning* Hey everyone.

Friendly rope in his hand.  

Going to make it all go away.  

Yesterday will be the last day.  

Pint of whiskey with the willow tree.  

The only two friends he has that make him feel warm. 

He is screaming inside, but his eyes stare ahead blue and cold  

Wind whipped and sun burned face cradled with calloused scarred hands

A hard man inside and out

But this world is no longer a place for hard men

Expected to be gentle and soft

It tears at his heart because he wants to be this way for them

They think he does not want to learn 

They know nothing of the daily struggle within

A warrior and animal can not be domesticated 

Only sedated

But the sedation is hated, and so is the sober

So what choice does the man have 

It seems better to be grieved and remembered 

Rather than hated and forgotten 

The friendly rope holds him tight 

He whispers goodbye and his words are devoured by the empty night 

The willow tree rocks the warrior to sleep

He is at peace and in the hearts of those he loves."
I am a pathetic child.,9,m2dxrb,15,"I had another night terror last night. I was lying in my bed and I couldn't move and a demon started attacking me. I thrashed and screamed and cried and called for my ""Mommy"" to help me, but she never did. My wife ran into the room and woke me up thankfully. She doesn't sleep in the bed with me anymore because I kick and punch in my sleep.

I am a 35 year old man and I am crying for my ""mommy"" to protect me from the demon on my ceiling. So pathetic."
I hate being a woman / Rant,14,m27uxb,5,"I don't mean like I hate existing in woman form,. I'm fine with that, but I hate the world does almost nothing to change already. Every fucking day not only do I need to deal with men being insane and staring at me as if I am created just for them and causing flashbacks in public, but because our culture making me exposed to all kinds of bad stuff I wouldn't have to endure if I was a man.


This is just today's example. I accepted one male linkedin connection, and today he sent me simple message hi :). I was little on the edge because usually messages on linkedin go straight to the point but I thought, well, maybe he wants to be extra polite before talking business. I sent him hello :) and the next message I received from him was - do you have an instagram :). I swear this feels like office sexual harassment, or triggers sexism flashbacks I already endured many times. I went into helpless mode right away, and I always have trouble getting out of there. So fucking ridiculous! I can't imagine men receiving something like that. It's repulsive.


Also, today I discovered a new trigger - it's being asked how old I am. It is a trigger purely because it sends me into flashback when I was a girl and sexually abused and felt powerless because I thought men are authority and I thought that I have no right to speak for myself as a little girl. 🤮😭 To this day I have trouble thinking that's NOT how the world is supposed to function.


I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! Ffs, my life is literally shortened because of trauma and all these situations ate making it even shorter with new stress. I want to escape, I am overwhelmed dealing with this non stop. It's insane."
Night sweats?,2,m2jx5e,1,"I’ve been upped to 40mg and have since started having awful night sweats. I’ve also been prescribed trazodone for sleep, I’m not sure which it’s caused by. 

Anybody have any experience with this?"
Just got diagnosed!,10,m26hv5,3,"It’s kind of a relief because I’ve been wanting to know what’s been happening to me for a long time. I don’t feel like I’m faking it or exaggerating anymore. I’m glad I finally got help.

Hello Reddit family!"
I wish I could.,8,m2c2z5,0,"I wish I could be like a normal person. Not curl into a ball and powerlessly watch as my brain freezes in panic whenever I encounter my triggers, which are so ridiculously common in everyday life.

My therapist tries her very best to help, trying to get me to process my trauma properly this time. But I was hurt almost continuously for ten years of my life, a decade that I'll never get back, and threatens to steal even more decades of my life by shrouding them in sadness, a life spent continuously triggered over and over again to the point where functioning is so hard. I wish I was freed from the abuse early enough to heal my wounds properly, but unfortunately they've just scarred over now, and I don't know if it's even possible for me to reprocess what happened to me the ""right"" way anymore.

Sometimes I wonder if being able to function and socialize like a normal person without struggling to do so is just too much to ask for in my life."
My therapist told me my ex online friend gave me PTSD.,5,m2e5xa,1,"This is my first post here so I hope I am doing this okay. 

Note: I have been diagnosed with C-PTSD & BPD due to traumatic childhood which I will not get into.

TL;DR: had a best online friend from Sweden who led me on and was emotionally abusive and toxic. There are certain things I can't do or look at because it reminds me of her.

I'll try not to make this long at all, but basically I met a online friend from Sweden on Twitter/Instagram back in 2018. It was part of a fandom and we got really close by talking and just getting to know each other. I already have a lot of trust issues and just went through a really bad friendship break up a year before that was very traumatic.

I explained to her my situation meaning my mental health, that I have a hard time with confrontation or being honest because of abandonment. So basically we got really close and video chatted, swapped emails, and swapped each other's addresses.

Around 2020 is when our friendship started falling apart. At the time I was getting a lot of help and wasn't very honest with her, because she was the type of person that believed in toxic positivity. She told me that I was her soulmate, her happy place, and her world. That she wanted to meet me one day and a couple years and hang out. She was basically a second mom to me since I don't have a good relationship with my mom. 

One of her friends from the Philippines who she was friends with online as well, would always make fun of my ranting online. I like to vent a lot because I don't have real life friends because I just don't trust people. I opened up to this swedish friend of mine who I got close with about my traumatic childhood. 

She started distancing herself for me after I told her everything, we were friends for almost 2 years. She would constantly lead me on and start taking things back by saying ""oh I was drunk and I didn't mean to say you were my soulmate, it slipped out.""

I was very close to this woman, and I just loved her so much. I told her I had attachment issues and she kept telling me in the beginning ""I don't want you being afraid of me, cling on to me if you need to. This is what I'm here for."" She ends up taking everything back and slowly stop talking to me. 

May of 2020 I ended the friendship because it was a dead end and one sided. She told me if I felt better or was ready to talk again that she would be here for me. Silly me thinking that few months later I wanted to check on her because of the covid-19. Never answered me back, and I was in a severe depressive state and still dealing but for 7 months.

I talked to my therapist about everything and she told me that my former friend from Sweden gave me PTSD along with the psychiatrist saying that as well.   

I can't listen to the music from my favorite artist that we were in a fandom with because it reminds me of her. 
I get really uncomfortable with people from different countries (Not in a racist way) because it reminds me of her accent.
She would send me tea and sweets in the mail, sometimes I would see them at my local whole foods or world market.
People's faces sometime look like her and I get nightmares of her.

I deal with racing and intrusive thoughts. I've been diagnosed with BPD due to childhood trauma along with C-PTSD. I've been on a long road to recovery and my therapist told me that I've been doing so well. I had to step back and decided to write her about 4 days ago, after 7 months. Guess what? She never wrote back. I cried for 2 days straight and wanted to just die. Here I am 4 days after writing her the fifth time & feel a little bit of relief. I was afraid of her being blunt towards me because she used to be mean to me. I accepted it because I thought that was normal, my whole life I was treated like dirt so I thought it was normal. 

sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'm still having a hard time and there are triggers seeing certain things, hearing certain things, and even tasting certain things that remind me of her. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice how to handle flashbacks, triggers, and nightmares?
Thank you."
"Does anyone else feel like they've manifested their PTSD? (TW; SA, emotional manipulation)",8,m26jx3,4,"My relationship with my ex has a lot of moments that I think are traumatic, but I feel like I'm affected by them only because I want to feel like the victim or cope with being the ""bad one"" in our relationship. I say that in quotations because I'm not sure if I really was a bad partner or he was just gaslighting me. He was sexually abusive towards me and would humiliate me by touching me in public, but I didn't realize it was abuse until after our relationship ended. It only started affecting me when I came came to that realization, which leads me to believe that it's my fault I have these symptoms."
My best friend refuses to acknowledge one of my biggest triggers,1,m2ixj6,1," Hiya, first post so I hope i’m not doing something wrong,

A bit of backstory: I was officially diagnosed with c-ptsd as well as several other mental illnesses in June 2020 because of some things that I really do not want to go into. This came as a shock to me to be honest as for about 5 years I had drilled it into my head that I could not have ptsd, which was ridiculous. The main reasoning behind this stupid idea was because of the number one trigger for me. Something so small and minute that most people wouldn’t bat an eye at it. Notification noises. Upon talking to my therapist in one of my first sessions I learned that most people don’t throw their phone and curl up into a ball every time their phone beeps. I’ve been working on it for a while now and making very slow progress on it but progress nonetheless. (I also do not have notifications on. Ever. on anything. The amount of times i’ve almost missed an assignment deadline change is horrifying) 

Onto my actual reason for this post: not to sugar coat it, my friend is being an ass about it. I love her to bits, we’ve been friends for 7ish years now and I call her my best friend when asked about that sort of thing. But for some reason she refuses to acknowledge that this is an actual problem for me. She thinks I’m kidding for some reason. She has literally seen me go into panic attacks on really bad days because of skype notifications. I’ve asked time and time again and as kindly as I can if she could please just turn down the volume when we hang out. And every time she laughs and turns it all the way up (sidenote: she's not hard of hearing, or anything of the sort. She does this because she thinks it's funny). Our mutual friends are not like this, they take my trigger very seriously. It's only the one. It's gotten to the point where I dread her coming over, or just talking to her in general. Did you know that on instagram video messages if you get a notification your phone picks it up and it's in the message? Guess how I found that out. (Jesus that sounds so bitter I’m so sorry). She messages me more or less everyday because I’m out of our hometown for college. 

I know that I can’t expect the world to bend to my will just because I go into a panic over phone beeps. That it’s a dickish move for me to try and force my friend to do things a certain way. But I just wish she could treat this with the slightest amount of decency. How do I go about this? I don’t want to cut her off or anything, she's still one of my best friends and I don’t want to tear our group apart because of this. But I just don’t know what to do anymore. Thank you so much in advance for any advice you may have, and sorry if this is kind of rambly or if it has the wrong flair or if it doesn't belong here."
Which way of therapy/psychotherapy you practice and recommend,2,m2dhro,2,"Hey everyone,

So far I haven't had much success with psychotherapies(I guess majority was gestalt and any sort of ""talk"" therapy. I have had appointments with psychiatrist too

Most of the time diagnosed with depression, anxiety, latest psychiatrist even prescribed me concerta with possible attention issues that I guess stems from early age trauma and some bullying that induced tremendous amount of shame, guilt, anger for not intervening when anyone tried to hurt me

I will have my first (successful) somatic experience soon, had one that was complete failure and got some contact for a body psychotherapist and she also had a degree for EMDR

My issues as mentioned are possible early age trauma(a few years ago I have been told that my mother left our family couple of times) that induced big amount of trust issues, insecurities(in relationships), attachment issues, abandonment issues

What do you think of my plan for helping myself out? Any other psychology path?

Thanks!"
I found my trigger (sexual assault/violence),3,m275n5,1,"It's white cars, ones that look closest to his. When I see one in the parking lot I look around frantically and I used to now know why. When I see one on the street my throat and lungs freeze but my blood is on fire. When I'm driving I try to hide my head. When one passes by my house I spend the rest of the day ""in grey"". When I saw a fucking commercial I became angry and had no idea why. The images were so sharp and jarring that I pretended they weren't real and dissociated. 

My trigger is white cars. Because he used to find me in a white car. He found me, took me, and left me in pieces in a white car.

(That's it I just wanted to write it down and know it's real. It doesn't make sense to me still but I'm working on it)"
Anyone else have nightmares unrelated to their PTSD?,106,m1msyh,66,"For many years I had regular nightmares of being chased and just generally fighting for survival. Nowadays, I've made a ton of progress on my PTSD but I have the most random and fucked up nightmares sometimes. I have nightmares way less frequently but instead of being chased it's usually something really fucked up. Last night I had a nightmare where I watched someone get shredded alive slowly in some time of meat grinder type thing, intentionally from a bad guy. Flesh bits were flying everywhere and the screaming was horrific. That dream was followed by me being tortured and I only woke up because I was in so much pain. None of those are related to any of my actual trauma but it messes me up. I had to take the day off work and get my mind right. Does this happen to anyone else?"
Had to put our family dog down today:( It has sucked me back into one of the most traumatic times in my life...feeling physically ill,2,m2amy4,2,"Our sweet mini labradoodle was 14 yrs old. She was blind in one eye and losing her sight in her other eye. She had cancer all over her body. We had to do the humane thing and let her rest:( This made me feel like I was being sucked back in time. Shortly after my mom died by suicide, she had left behind her toy poodle of 14 yrs. She was blind, couldn’t walk and cried constantly. I had to make the decision to do what my mom couldn’t... I had to have her put down. She was the only living thing I had left of my mom.

"I feel like certain music made me romanticize mental illness in my youth, and I always wanted to be ""damaged,"" but now that I actually am... it sucks.",21,m1ta4f,2,"When you're a kid listening to this music they don't tell you that if you're mentally ill and/or an addict, you'll never be able to hold a job, so you will make next to zero money, and if you don't have a family member supporting you, you'll either be homeless, prostituting, or in assisted living.

Is it normal for smells to show up when triggered?,4,m22ne8,2,"I have a Serious trigger of Alc*hol. Even just mentioning the word on a bad day can set me off. I was looking up a video on youtube, and the ad preceding it was an ad for Captain Morgan, and as soon as that hit, I started smelling beer.

"""You can only control your response to the situation.""",47,m1oxvz,18,"This is something my boss told me today. After I came to her nearly in tears with another story of how my co-worker is verbally abusing me. Now, this might be decent advice for a person who has never experienced any trauma, but it got me thinking.
I can't control my response. I have a disability that stops me from controlling my response. Sudden noises make me jump. Objects coming at my face make me flinch. When my coworker starts lecturing me about something, I have a PTSD flashback, a panic attack, or I start dissociating. There is literally nothing I can do to prevent this.
I really don't want to drag my PTSD into this situation because I don't want to be treated like I'm delicate or crazy. I'm just tired of my coworker lecturing me like I'm one of the toddlers in our class. And I'm tired of my boss making excuses for said coworker and writing off her bullying as ""pandemic stress."" Yeah, we're all stressed out because of the pandemic, but that doesn't give anyone the right to treat other people like crap."
Embarrassed to admit I'm bothered by things that COULD HAVE happened but didn't when I was in Afghanistan.,15,m1t58h,10,"I was in the military deployed to Afghanistan almost six years ago now. Say what you will about how the US military is being used there, but I thought I was doing the right thing being there until I left. I figure there's a pretty good reason we're not wanted there. Either way, I was fortunate enough to make it home safely, but I had several situations that, at the time, made me wonder if something really awful was about to happen.

I just woke up to go to the bathroom around 2 am, and when I got back to bed I started thinking about what might have happened if I'd been attacked and my weapon didn't function properly. Or whether a rescue team would have been able to find me if my vehicle was disabled. There were several times I felt I was in imminent danger because I'd been spotted and the person would ID our vehicle and get on their radio or phone. Every time something like that would happen, my first thought was that someone somewhere down this road is waiting to kill me. That feeling of not knowing which turn to take or not take would be enough to make you crazy. 

At the time, you compartmentalize to get you through, but for some reason tonight, over six years later, for the first time I nearly had a panic attack thinking about what could have happened to me. I started typing this post and I got sweaty and anxious, and my wife woke up and helped calm me down a bit. But I wanted to share this because I have always been ashamed of how I felt scared when I was there, or how I got stressed out by my experience when there are people out there who have very real, tangible traumatic experiences. I feel like a phony for thinking about the possibility of having PTSD, but I just wanted to vent."
Can abusive relationship and fast antidepressant switching cause CPTSD?,2,m26vng,0," 

Hello everybody, I would like to apologize for my English coz I am not a native speaker.

I have always had some problems in my intimate relationships. My ex-girlfriend was a narcissistic abuser and a premiant student at my university. Like everybody, I have been through some childhood trauma, but a minor one, I think. However, it led to a bad attachment style in my relationships. Mainly I cannot keep my personal boundaries and have problems with assertiveness. I am also a ""pleaser"" type of person because my parents were arguing a lot during my childhood. We also have some history of psychological problems running in the family (neurosis). After my last ex-girlfriend, I have been attending a psychologist. Recently I found a new girlfriend who is sadly my colleague from work.

Everything went pretty fine at the start, but after few months, I woke up with a panic attack that she broke up with me. Since then, my problems started. I was extremely anxious in her presence and didn't know why. I confronted her honestly, but she was raised in a family where psychological problems do not exist, and they are trying to avoid people with problems. Long story short. My anxiety becomes panics, and she was blackmailing me about breaking up with me if I don't solve this. I started to have nightmares and weird unconscious feelings forcing me to run. After discussion with my psychologist, he assumed it is good I do not run away and try to confront my fears. Well, I tried it, and after few days, I was hospitalized after terrible neverending panic attacks. We broke up. I found a professor psychiatrist from the medical faculty and started taking Mirtazapine. I have had such ambivalent feelings for my girlfriend. I know deep down I love her (maybe attachment issue?) and cannot be with her in one room without having panic attacks. She became more understanding, and AD started to work. Unfortunately, I have had terrible side effects and dissociation on Mirt. After consulting with my new EMDR/trauma-focused psychologist, I tried to switch to a different AD to target my anxiety/panic (PTSD symptoms?). I wanted to solve it and stay with my ex-girlfriend, so I was attending him twice a week + plus prescribed different AD. Well repeatedly, in this case, new AD almost killed me a let me in long-term dissociation (dp/dr), and I had 24/7 panic attacks during 14 days. Terrible depression started, anxiety attacks, and everybody persuaded me to listen to the psychiatrist about taking them. I could not cope anymore and stop taking them. My girlfriend broke up with me again during that time, saying I would like to help you, but I don't know how the problem is in your head only, you need time for yourself to solve it. I could not go to work or study. I started SSRI, which caused the same reaction as the previous AD. Now I am again on Mirtazapine because it is only which works somehow for me.

Now I am almost not communicating with my ""newer"" ex. However, we are just friends; I still like her somehow after all of it (she has many good attributes). I keep attending EMDR twice a week + have EFT every 3 weeks. I am completely braindead after all that happened. I am dissociated 24/7. If I feel something, I have panic attacks or anxiety. I've been told I have an extremely hypersensitive amygdala (well, thanks :/). Cannot focus, work or study. I wanted everything and ended with nothing, sadly. My whole life is in ruins now.

If my ex would understand more and not try to convince me, it's just a feeling or thought which causes my anxiety. Maybe It would not end like that. I don't know, really. I am a super kind person, well was, because now I am full of anger or emptiness.

I have questions for you. Was my unconsciousness right about my current ex? I have always had ambivalent feelings for her. Nobody understands it, even two of my psychologists. Maybe I did not see something my unconscious mind tried to tell me. She is not perfect, and anything is either ""black"" or ""white ."" Maybe she is also some type of abuser or shares some similarities with my previous ex (triggers from the previous relationship) - my psychologist suggests this. I am interested in a specific type of girls. I am also a perfectionist myself, so it is a very complicated topic overall.

The second question is about the type of diagnosis. I went through an almost constant life-threatening situation during the past few months. Well, at least my brain thinks that. The worst stress was caused by medication. BTW, the psychiatrist told me it is not possible to have these terrible side effects, etc. I am treated for mild PTSD, Panic disorder, and dissociation disorder. However, after reading some comments and topics, I think it could be complex PTSD.

I would be so grateful for information about my feelings towards my ex (ambivalent) and her non-emphatic behavior maybe. Can I be a victim again? What should I do when she is my colleague? I was stupid to let it go so far. I was so attached to her.

I am highly depressed, changes in behavior, aggression, not communicating with anybody almost. Have nightmares, flashbacks, constant panic attacks. Avoiding certain situations, people, not feeling anything deep down when I am in dissociation which is like 20/7. Should I keep my treatment plan? I took a semester free and trying to have a daily plan. Is there any medication that could help me and not kill me. The worst is the dp/dr for me. I want to live my life and study but my brain is dead, I cannot think and focus and also cannot remember certain parts of the day or even past months. Could it be CPTSD? I will be so grateful for every suggestion and idea from you guys. Well, I keep fighting but I am incredibly scared about my future and brain functions.

Thanks a lot, guys."
"Finding Support for my wife (trigger warning:parental abuse, no graphic details)",2,m252ki,0,"Hi! My (30m) wife (29f) has PTSD (diagnosed) and possibly some other mental health/neurological disorders, possibly ADHD, which I have as well. She was physically/emotionally abused by her father, who was himself undiagnosed with multiple issues, and who's parents grew up during the great depression. They had a long and difficult relationship, and her father passed away recently in his sleep and was in his 60s, which has destroyed my wife, her sister, and mother, as they were all still close with him, and accepted he was mentally ill, even though they didn't put up with his temper anymore. He had gotten better (was no longer physically abusive), but still had a tendency to fly off the handle/berate people.  My wife was not on speaking terms with him when he died, and I don't think she will ever forgive herself. Her dad was her best friend, regardless of the trauma. 

  My wife has seen general therapists, but is still pretty new to her ptsd diagnosis as a whole, though she's had it a long time. We live near Columbia, MO, and I was wondering if any of you know if there are any resources in that area for us to look into. My wife has trouble with employment, she doesn't do well with stress/jobs she hates, as they drastically affect her mental health, which affects our relationship, as my ADHD makes it difficult for me to be aware of her mental state at all times and I have a hard time anticipating her needs.  This of course makes treatment difficult, since in the US, Healthcare/insurance is tied to employment, and I don't make enough to pay our bills and her health insurance. 

   I genuinely believe she needs a specialist. She has a lot to work through, and doesn't have a normal size support system, as she has trouble developing lasting friendships. The 2 people she really talks to besides myself have their own lives, and being a one man support system is far more difficult than I could have possibly imagined. I love her so much, and I just want her to be happy and healthy, even if it means she can't work sometimes. Any help finding resources would be greatly appreciated."
Tired of being invalidated and told how “young” I am,16,m1sl8u,4,"TW: physical abuse mentioned

When I was a young kid people called me an old soul or “very mature for my age.” I spent ages 8-14 reading books all day almost every day (a lot of adult fiction) and found it extremely hard to connect with my peers. I wish I spent more of my childhood actually living than just thinking. 

I’m 21 and just feel so done with life. Mentally I feel 60. Mainly because of physical abuse that lasted my teen years, that caused me to have severe chronic pain for 4 years that is still far from healed. 

I sustained concussions that literally gave me amnesia for a year, where I constantly complained about feeling “like an old person with dementia”.

It’s just weird having such a huge disconnect between where I am in my mind, and how people see me. In everyone else’s eyes I’m some young dumb practically teenager still, and should be out partying. I’m so jealous how everyone around me is carefree. I can’t live to my parents or anyone’s expectations, of being like that and I hate it. 

I’ve just suffered so fucking much. I literally think my brain is eroded from the combination of concussions, depression and ptsd, and drinking. 

Idk why but I’m so frustrated that people keep saying shit like “omg you’re so young” or treating me like I don’t have any life experiences. I’ve suffered a lot more than some of the middle aged people saying that, who never experienced abuse. It didn’t help that throughout the abuse people constantly told me “you’re too young to have neck pain”... 

Idk if anyone else can relate, it just makes me feel so invalidated when people assume I’m just some young dumb kid who’s never suffered in their life."
Cptsd?,6,m1w76y,2,"When I read about cptsd the symptoms match me very well. It is confusing because I remember my early childhood as very nice. But I dissociated a lot even back then as I remember (my teacher even wrote it to my mom because I constantly spaced out dringend class and just react when she calls me several times). My childhood went down when I was 10 and we moved to my stepdad. Then the Mobbing and emotional abuse began, at 11 I was sexually assaulted and dissociated the event since I was 16. My depression started and I got an eating dissorder too. But everyone accused me to make things up and my pain isn't valid. It was very painful, until I moved out. Then it got better, but I was raped 3 times and didn't even feel anything until the last time, like, I dissociated hard and felt like shattered completely. Then, the regular ptsd symptoms began. The dissociation is like a Red line through my life. I dissociated every past event that got me pain so is it possible I dissociate some Events of my early childhood too? It seems to me like I didn't went through enough to have cptsd even when I have the symptoms. I'm confused."
"Gonna do EMDR therapy, starting next Monday, any success stories? Is it triggering/upsetting?",2,m21jb3,3,"Basically title.

"I need help, any help, also happy to answer any questions tw mentions of domestic abuse+ family abuse, rape, intrusive thoughts, self harm, suicide, eating disorders",1,m25x8l,1,"Im nervous and stressed posting this but, I need help, I need advice. So long story short, I've been in and out of varying levels of abusive relationships, along that, I have been raped repeatedly and grew up with a drug addict older sister, a distant father and a narcissist/verbally & emotionally abusive mother along with other problems along the way. 

Anyway the reason I'm writing thing is because I can feel myself slipping and I have been for a while, I have constant intrusive thoughts to rip my skin off, I have been punching myself in the head and thighs to the point of bruises, I scratch at my hands if I don't actively stop myself and on top of all that, I keep hurting the one person I love, the first boyfriend I have ever had that made me feel safe and loved and worth something. I keep fighting over nothing and getting more and more heated, its like a cloud during and after and I have trouble figuring out what was actually said and what I actually did, I know my family has a past of borderline and bipolar but I don't know if I have either of those, I just don't know what to do, im sorry this is unorganised and chaotic to read it's basically how my brain is running, I can't find any peace or organisation 


I've tried to kill myself 3 times now, all overdoses, I've self harmed and suffered from eating disorders for as long as I can remember. I don't want to die but its getting so fucking hard"
The difference between borderline and PTSD,6,m1umri,1,"I had a very abusive childhood.  I then had various life altering traumas like my husband and love of my life dying suddenly at 26.  I was also attacked a few times (I live in a country with a very high crime rate).  I also have trichotillomania and various other self esteem psychological issues. 

Long story short, I tried getting help over the years but nobody has been able to help to the point where I can actually function in normal society.  I've had about 40 jobs and moved about 50 times in 15 years.  I can't seem to stay in any place.  The moment there is any kind of stress I move or run away. 

&#x200B;

My problem is this... My doctor has now diagnosed me with bipolar disorder.  I don't have mood swings.  I don't have manic highs. I keep telling her this and she insists (and got quite rude about it).  I don't know what's wrong with me but i just can't seem to accept the bipolar diagnosis. She is now refusing to treat me further because I disagree with the diagnosis.

What do I do?"
Quitting drinking...is hard.,23,m1mrcl,3,"The incidents leading up to the most traumatic moments of my life, leading to my journey with PTSD, all involved me drinking to the point of blacking out. Last week I got so drunk with a few new friends that I completely blacked out. I lost my phone and I threw up semi-conscious. Went to work the next day and had to take a nap under my desk...when I woke up, I threw up in my garbage can.

Both times I was sexually assaulted, I was drunk. Last week I made it home safe by some miracle but god, I'm so angry with myself for the mistakes I've made. But I've decided to quit drinking. I'm proud to have come to this decision but I have no idea what I'm doing.

I'm a performer and all my friends are party animals. I have no idea how I'm going to resist the urge to drink. Without liquor I'm terrified to be intimate with anyone and terrified to sing, which I'm extremely passionate about. Alcohol turns me into an extrovert but it also makes me so vulnerable. I can't do it anymore.

I'm just trying to build up inner strength at this point. It's so strange...my rape was years ago but it feels as fresh as the night it happened, despite time passing and therapy. Trauma works in mysterious ways.

I don't know what the point of all this was...but I'm struggling. It was easy to decide I'm not drinking anymore. But building up the permanent strength to replace the temporary bravery alcohol gives me is going to be difficult. Can anyone relate?"

I was raped at 14 - Can I please get support or help,62,m1e8cs,15,"Hi everybody, this has been weighing on me heavily since it all started, and I would really appreciate some support or your attention I just need to get this off my chest

&#x200B;

I was sexually assaulted by my abusive boyfriend of two years in October, he did it to me while I was 14. I was barely old enough to comprehend what he was doing yet all I felt was the excruciating pain in which he was penetrating me. It was the worst experience of my life, he was a big guy and he was leaning his entire bodyweight on me, crushing me so hard it felt like 1000 pianos were being laid on me and it was crushing my chest so I couldn't breathe, I was suffocating in pillow my face was pressed into. He was pulling my hair and groping me at the same time he was penetrating me and the pain was unimaginable, I could feel every sensation in my body, and it was all pain it was all torture. I remember he was yanking my hair and it pulled my head up off the pillow for a split second, and I remember seeing the side table and the chimney to another house outside the window. It was in the middle of the night when he did it to me, about 3AM. The whole experience lasted for 10 seconds, before a 10 year old girl walked in on us and stopped it. It was the most traumatic experience I ever had and I still have PTSD on it. 

&#x200B;

A little backstory on what happened leading up to this. I was abused by my boyfriend physically and mentally for 2 years, with it starting as hitting and punching and then escalating to choking, slapping, giving me black eyes, and he once choked me unconscious. He told me he was the only one who loved me and that nobody wanted me that I wasn't good enough and he constantly body shamed me and gave me an eating disorder. Note this was all happening when I was 12-14. I believed all his mental manipulation and it made me always go back to him. He would threaten to hit me and was always so intimate, groping me painfully during our relationship. In September, a month before I was raped, his friend sexually assaulted me at the local community center. I remember being so petrified and he forced me to eat a pill that turned out to be a sedative so I couldn't fight back. I wasn't raped, but I was groped, fingered, violently assaulted to where I had to be contained in a wheelchair because I couldn't walk because of what he did to my genitalia that day.

&#x200B;

When I was raped, I was still in a wheelchair because of what his friend did to my vagina, making it physical torture too to be penetrated that way. When my parents found out I was raped, they weren't supportive at all, they called me names like ""stupid"" and ""slut"" and drove me to my first suicidal thoughts. It forced me to run away to a shelter at 2AM, but I had to run through the woods in order to get there. In the woods there happened to be a group of men who tripped me when they saw me coming, groped me again, and mugged me of any belongings I had. This wasn't even the end of my trauma.

&#x200B;

During my stay at the shelter, I lost my voice. I was unable to talk to any of the attendings there or other girls at the shelter. I had a court trial with my boyfriend to where he was sentenced to 13 years in prison, then 10 years when it was reduced. It was so scary being in front of all the people, feeling his cold eyes boring into mine when I stood up there and testified and I still have nightmares about that day to this day right now. 

&#x200B;

On Halloween, I was assaulted and groped again by the abusive ex of one of the girls at the shelter. This was just the cherry on top to all the trauma I had experienced so far. It further intensified my phobia of people and the outdoors and even going into my own backyard can set a panic attack on me.

&#x200B;

Fast forwarding to now, 6 months later, I'm back at my parent's home when they forced me to come back from the shelter. I feel alone all the time, have vivid hallucinations where my boyfriend is raping me again almost every day, have panic attacks, and have nightmares of being raped again. My parents refuse to support me so I have no access to a therapist. I always feel sad, hopeless, angry, trapped in a box of negative emotions. I can't tell any of my friends for support and they don't know anything is wrong I'm not ready to reach out. My only help is from confiding in 1 friend I did tell, but they cannot be with me physically. 

&#x200B;

My arms and legs are full of cuts, maybe \~30 total. At first, cutting was a suicide attempt, but now cutting is more of a way to temporarily get relief from all the intense depression and anger and sadness I get from the memory. I cannot stop remembering those 10 seconds and it's ingrained into me and I feel so unimaginably angry all the time since it's not fair how I got all this trauma and nobody else did. It feels so hopeless and everyday I want to give up and kill myself.

&#x200B;

All I want is a therapist, some help. I don't want to go to the hospital because it reminds me of the first time I got assaulted, I have a phobia of hospitals and I believe everyone wants to rape me too and hurt me. I'm petrified of stepping foot outdoors and I can barely tell my story to anyone because it seems so far fetched and crazy and made up. Everyday is so painful, I wake up with a nightmare and have a panic attack, I have suicidal thoughts, I become depressed and then become so angry I want to punch a hole in my walls. I can't distract myself, the memory is always on the front of my mind or back at all times. 

&#x200B;

I just want the pain to stop, I want a break from all the pain my only wish is that there is a therapist online somewhere willing to converse with me over a live chat since calling would be extremely difficult since my parents can hear. They believe everything that you think of when you think rape culture and refuse to help me. They constantly yell at me and hurt me and make me want to kill myself more. I'm too scared of going to the police.

&#x200B;

I always think I'm not good enough, I still remember what he said and part of me still loves him I think I'm crazy for that. I think I'm alone and nobody wants to help me that nobody would believe me that I'm all alone with him in my head all the time. I obviously have PTSD or rape trauma syndrome but no therapist to help me. I live in Canada.

&#x200B;

Any help would be graciously appreciated, I would love it if anybody could get me contact with a therapist for free and without parental support because it feels so hopeless to continue going without one. But I just wanted to let this off my chest, any support would be appreciated. Thank you if you read all that."
Are childlike behaviors and interests always a result of trauma?,11,m1q50l,6,"Hi there!
First of all, I wasn't sure where to post this - if it's inappropriate on here, it of course will immediately deleted!!

So my question is;
I really love all things colourful, childlike, cute, etc.
I wear my little pony hoodies, watch Disney movies 24/7, have hundreds of stuffed animals, draw in coloring books, have tea parties with my barbies,...
All that, despite being 20 years of age.

I currently am in therapy because in my childhood I had been heavily neglected to the point it can be called abuse.
I'm getting better every single day and I'm so happy about my progress.
Though, my interests and personality don't seem to change. 

Is it necessary for me to ""let go"" of these interests in order to fully heal?
Or can I keep my childlike interests? I really don't want to give them up.

Thanks for reading! :)"
Complications with Opening Up to Family,1,m22kao,0,"TW: sexual assault

Hello. As the trigger warning above suggests, I'm a survivor of sexual assault, particularly from a close family member: one of my cousins. It happened when I was a teenager and I've barely had contact since (save for a few moments I dreaded but that's not relevant) but at least 2 of his siblings are unaware of this. His sister in particular keeps accidentally triggering me by trying to bring him along to visit or posting on my dad's memorial page by comparing him to my deceased father. Now, I don't blame her in the slightest, we just fell out of touch with that side of the family because of her brother and she doesn't know that, but I think it's time.

However, it's really difficult to write or record that message. It was easier to tell my grandmother and other aunt because they knew some of what happened and already supported me, but honestly I'm kind of scared about this one. As much as I know it's not my responsibility, I don't want to ruin relationships, break her reality, or cause drama. I know that whatever happens next is on her and maybe her mother or brothers, and I rationally shouldn't blame myself, but it's a really hard thing to write out and press send. I know this because I've been trying to inform her for months, but I don't know if I'm strong enough."

My professor is a stalker and I don’t know what to do. (TW),20,m1joxy,8,"My professor is a stalker
He hasn’t stalked me personally, but I have ptsd from a person in my past stalking me (among other things). The class is one I can’t switch out or drop and I’m having difficulty going to class without just sobbing throughout the whole thing since learning about his past behaviors. I believe I may be the only current student who knows about this, but I have talked with other professors about it and they know + reported it when the confirmed incident happened in 2019, but nothing came of it. 

I feel very conflicted. The class covers sensitive issues including violence and stalking against women and because of the vulnerable position students are in (myself included) I worry and I feel like I should tell others to be cautious/be alert. On the other hand I worry about the professor finding out that I know and him retaliating against the victim. I feel it’s not my story to share and that it may not be fair of me to tell it, but I worry that not sharing may lead others to get hurt in the future. I know how badly it can fuck up someone’s life when they’ve been a victim of stalking and I wouldn’t wish that on anyone. Idrk what I’m looking for, advice, nice words.... idk.

Question,4,m1qekv,7,"Are people who suffer from PTSD turned off from gory stuff, like horror movies and things like that? Asking for myself"
cold sweats and nightmares every single night for 20 years,7,m1ldgr,5,"Ive tried big pharma meds, drugs, years of therapy, nothing gives me relief from the nightmares. I catch colds frequently because of the cold sweats. I am genuinely suffering and I just want it to stop. Does anybody else suffer from this? If so, what do you do to cope? Any advice needed. :("
I think I need help.,6,m1k1gs,5,"Over the last several months, my mental health has been declining. I am going through times where I’m extremely up and happy, everything is great and I’m hopeful for the future. This lasts for days, sometimes weeks. Then I get hit with invasive thoughts of how awful I am and how no one has ever loved me and never will, and other things I don’t wish to talk about. The thoughts have proof to back them up, there is endless proof of what an awful person I am and my brain reminds me every morning when I wake until every evening when I sleep. It also reminds me of traumatic events I’ve been through and has been surprising me with a ton of repressed memories. Mostly about my abusive ex. It is endless. It feels like torture, like my brain wants to ruin every part of me and rip me apart until nothing is left. This also lasts but for longer periods of time, weeks to months at a time. 

You can probably guess which of these I’m feeling now. I’m drained, exhausted. I can’t even rest when I sleep, my dreams are so vivid and real. I’m waking up exhausted, remaining exhausted while my brain attacks me, go to bed exhausted, repeat every day. On top of all that, when I get to these dark places I struggle with handling my sobriety. 

I’ve been able to fight the thoughts and I’m sober, but it’s been going on for so long I am so exhausted of fighting. I am miserable and I feel like it won’t ever end, it just keeps getting worse. 

I have a bad feeling about if I don’t get help, but I am scared to get help. Every time I’ve tried to get help, I get judged and told to “get over it” or that I “clearly don’t actually want to get better” and they give up on me. They tell me to find someone else. I’m afraid to get a therapist for this reason. I can’t tell my friends or family it’s too much for them to handle and I’m ashamed of my condition. I feel alone, weak and alone. I’m just hoping the better days come soon so I can get some relief."
I'm so thankful for my therapist,32,m17ga8,6,"I've never felt such compassion and understanding in my life.  I was able to talk about everything, everything, even the things that ashamed me most today, and I managed to put everything in perspective. 
If someone can have such compassion for me, I feel like one day I can too.

I'm so grateful that I'm in tears. I can heal. I can get better and be in peace one day. I don't have to be afraid anymore.
Maybe I'll soon give myself permission to have dreams again, instead of just coping all the time.

Today I managed to breathe a little."
Sexual orientation after rape,6,m1hl01,5,"How do I deal with the constant questioning of my sexual orientation ?

My deposition is on Friday and I just... I dunno, I’ve seemingly lost the ability to function and the will to live.

Having flashbacks of things I don't remember happening,14,m187ms,4,Every so often I have visions/flashbacks of events related to my trauma that I don't remember happening. Is this normal?
I’m not asking for a diagnosis but I don’t know if what happened to me could be bad enough to have “given” me PTSD but I’m so not myself anymore. Any advice would be awesome.,1,m1p48n,4,"In the beginning of January I was in a horrible car accident that I shouldn’t have walked away from. The pictures are traumatizing and it took me a while to look at them. It was entirely my fault, although I can’t remember the accident at all or afterwards really, and in my police report it’s stated that I was unable to recall the event.

I ended up in the hospital, eventually stayed in psych for a few days due to my extreme reaction and saying I wish I did die with my car etc. 

Since then I haven’t been myself. For one I HATE driving now, I got a brand new car and I don’t even like it. However, given the severity of my accident I don’t think wanting to avoid driving is outlandish. 

But, personality wise idk what’s wrong with me. I’m jumpy, I’m detached from my surroundings and people. Half of the time I feel like things are a dream and not happening, this was something I kept repeating in the hospital, I refused to believe anything was real. I have next to no concentration, I’m extremely overwhelmed- that being said I’m taking on a lot with college courses, 2 part time jobs, and an internship so maybe overwhelmed is normal. I have reoccurring dreams that I’m in my new car and I flip it like I did in real life. My anxiety is out of control, I can’t relax, seeing car accidents in movies makes me horribly distressed and loud noises make me jump. I’ve isolated myself almost completely and have no desire to get back to the way things were. 

I’ve always had mental health issues, but this is a bit more extreme. I’m pretty good at “wearing a mask” and keeping it on and acting normal but lately the thought of having to do that is exhausting and I avoid situations where I’ll need to “wear my mask.” 

I guess my question is, can something like a car accident possibly result in PTSD? Or is this just something else? I just wish I could feel normal again but unfortunately it doesn’t seem like that’s going to happen any time soon even with all the time that’s going by."

How do I tell my parents I need therapy,4,m13zco,3,"TW

I’m 16 and when I was 14 I met this guy online who was 17 and we started dating when he was 18 (yes I know I was stupid) I won’t go into much detail but what matters was he was emotionally abusive and manipulative and that lasted until the beginning of quarantine when I was finally able to completely cut him out of my life with the help of my new boyfriend.

He said if he ever saw me he would “publicly r*pe and humiliate me”(he knows where I go to school and hang out) He would always be yelling at me for the smallest things and call me a pathetic little shit and ever since then I’ve been extremely paranoid by the smallest movements, whenever someone slightly raises their voices or makes a loud noise I start crying. I’ve had trouble sleeping and have had constant nightmares, and talking to adults has been completely terrifying and I break down crying. There was also a time while we were dating where I just had an anxiety attack after a girl who he cheated on me with showed up randomly and I started shaking uncontrollably. I’ve just been really sensitive and constantly overthink.

My current boyfriend says I need therapy and I know I do and I want help but asking my parents for anything is terrifying and whenever I do or I try to I end up crying uncontrollably and it’s just scary I don’t now how to talk to them or bring it up I don’t want to tell them about what happened to me yet since they would probably be really disappointed and upset but I just need the help and don’t know how to ask them or how else I can get help.

I did tell my parents I wanted a therapist before but they ended up forgetting and that never happened."
How to reduce night terrors?,9,m0y7ex,2,"Sometimes they're quite graphic, other times I wake up with an emotion I'd only visit around the time of my trauma. But night terrors always leave me tense and scared in the morning, and I never really fully move on to the day because of how purely painful and terrifying they are. Have been meditating+ therapy. But other than that, any tips to reduce them?"
Just started reading the book Upside: The New Science of Post Traumatic Growth,9,m0x9e2,1,"It seems to have good reviews, will report back after... take care everyone"
Family triggering me,5,m0ztny,0,"I’m struggling. I moved home in September, because I was burning myself out trying to train my dog in an apartment/roommate setting while working thru school. I reached out to my parents because I wanted to get my rescue dog into an advanced training curriculum asap. They offered (basically what they had wanted from the beginning) for me to move home and take classes online. Six months, and two massive familial meltdowns, two threats of eviction, multiple threats/offers to put down my dog, and several panic attacks down the road I’ve decided that I won’t be staying through the summer.

 I think moving home has caused irreparable damage. I was diagnosed with ptsd when I was 12, when it was brought to my parents’ attention that a practically catatonic state shouldn’t be the norm for a child my age. They brought me to psychiatry offices where id sit in dark rooms, ignoring the questions the strangers prodded at me until it was time to go home and sit in an equally dark room. 

Almost ten years later, I found myself slipping back into that same silent pattern which was why I reached out in the first place. My dog has been the only thing holding me together for the past year. My ‘suicidal ideations’ have pretty much dropped – can’t drop dead when I’m responsible for the life of someone else. 

Even though I’ve had to cut back on my credits in order to save up money, I know id rather take longer to graduate then live without my dog. I don’t see them the way I used to. I thought I could come back, and they’d help me pull myself back together. Instead, I’ve come to the realization that I’m alone. The little trust I have left keeps getting pulled away. I trust more in the security that my animal can give me than that of my own family. The clashes over the dogs training and their contempt of me have only widened the gulf I live with.  

I want to blame my abusers for this gulf. I blame them for leaving me an empty husk. I used to be so angry. I don’t have the energy to feel angry anymore. I look at my dog and I know that if it came down to it, he’d put his life on the line to protect me from further damage. I’m fairly certain my quality of life won’t be much improved by leaving – once the burnout kicks back in, but his could. I’ve resigned myself to living according to the constraints my brain affords me. It just turns out it won’t be with my family."
Coming home is hard,3,m11rz1,1,"I was/am a person who had to travel around alot for the work i did that messed me up so bad. I won't get into details because it may upset some and it is vaguely political in nature (hence the throwaway as well). Suffice to say though i was a medic and a good one at that who lead a small team of medics to help people in danger.

I saw some things and lost some people during my time. Some nights it really does all come back and i just lock up and relieve every sight,sound, smell and noise in vivid detail in a way i was not ready for. That isnt what this post is about though.

Instead i just need to vent about coming home. I had a schedule almost where i would go out for up to 2 weeks at times (usually though it was 3 to 5 days)  each month. It may not sound like much but during that time my existence was just getting my people home and helping those who needed it. Nothing else mattered to me and nothing else existed. It had to be that way because if it wasnt i could make a bad call and get people hurt or killed very easily (we werent targeted for arrest because we were peaceful, didnt stop others from attempting to kill us several times). Then i'd come home and just pretend nothing happened. If anyone asked where i went i said vacation or a friends house. Still it was weird being home even when i was still regularly going out. I'd find myself just finding everything so odd and funny almost. 

I never really noticed it until one day i was in aldis shopping and it was the day after i came back from a really rough outing. The day before i had to talk down an armed gunman who had been agitated  after firecrackers and flashbangs went off. He had gone down into a high ready and was repeatedly sweeping the crowd with his muzzle. No one wanted to go near him but i did and i convinced him to come back with me and disarm then escorted him out of the area. I genuinely believe i probably saved a few lives there. I remember i was sitting there in aldis and I couldn't explain it but somehow just this idea that i could go from that extreme situation to my biggest worry being picking out ceral messed with me to the point where i couldnt stop laughing and crying at the same time. I went to the store bathroom and just stayed in one of the stalls bitting my arm to try and stay quiet.

That was 2 years ago now and its only gotten worse. I find myself frequently feeling alienated from normal people around me and feel like a freak, like i dont belong. It has gotten so bad i have developed paranoid ideas that people recognize it and thats why they glance at me on the street or say hello. I know i'm wrong but it still pops into my head occasionally.

My last outing was in december, since then I've told my people i'm retired. It means nothing but that i'm trying to live a normal life. 

It's only gotten harder being home. I find myself feeling alone more now as part of the process of my retirement was seperating myself from my old friends and trying to reconnect with the old ones. I find my temper short and its gotten to the point where im so afraid of snapping that when i talk to normal people i shut myself off emotionally, i learned recently this is called stone walling. The hardest thing is the lack of a mission or purpose. Weirdly i find myself more afraid of dying now then when i was in despite being in no danger. 

Frankly it is so hard coming home it is driving me away from home. Lately i started reconnecting with certain members of my team i was particularly close too and purposing the idea of taking our work farther by starting a ngo as cover to go into active warzones. It terrifies me that this is a real part of me and i want it to stop but i can't. I tried talking to shrinks about it but was told twice this was a normal part of processing and was even encouraged. Honestly i'm scared, i'm scared that it will never go away and that i will always find home foreign to me. I want one day to be able to settle down. To share my life with someone and to grow old and raise a family in a community that i feel is a part of me. Sadly i dont think it will ever really happen.

Please if you have experience with this advice is greatly appreciated."
I just got the official diagnosis today...,12,m0ut1d,7,"My therapist went through every criteria in the DSM-5 with me, and I met almost all of them. It’s not too surprising, but also makes me feel a bit sad to have realized just how much trauma has and continues to effect my life. Anyways, I’m glad there’s a group on here to find support from others with PTSD. I’d love to find some friends to relate to. And if anyone is in need of a friend, I’m here. 💞"
my ptsd,3,m11m10,10,"the thing with my ptsd is i don’t sympathy cause i did it to myself, i gave myself the lsd tab and i sat there and did it, but i went through what a rape victim went through ( i assume ), but theres no rape group for me, there’s no community of girls that can go i’ve been through the same thing, idk anyone who has been through this, i saw things no 18 year old should have to see, i watched myself be raped from 1st person and 3rd person, i felt every arm and every bone, i saw every eye, and every face, i remember it so vividly i could draw the eyes ( if i was talented enough to draw ), i saw my mother’s eyes turn into something evil, the arms i felt at home in and safe in, were my enemy, the father who is meant to walk me up the aisle, i can’t even speak about what i saw, it was disgusting and disturbing, but i cant look at my own dad the same anymore, but i don’t get a community, i don’t get the sympathy from girls, i get looked at like a crackhead, i deserved it, i did it to myself, i get flashbacks, but they’re not validated because it was all a flashback, but nothing felt more real, i still think i’m dead and this is just the after life, i cant understand it, how it didn’t happen, maybe it did happen but my family said it was a lsd trip so i wouldn’t be too fucked and feel too dirty, but i feel dirty, i scrubbed at my skin, trying to change it, my neck, i scrubbed at my neck, my neck that my aunt use to say was so pretty and long, i wanted to tear it to pieces, sometimes i just touch it and it feels like it’s happening all again, but my ptsd will never be validated because it was my fault"
"Chronic Stress, Insomnia, and Hair Loss",2,m1160q,1,"29 year old male. I had a PTSD trigger in October at a meditation retreat of all places. The trigger was just a song. That same night I started experiencing insomnia. The next day, I could feel a sensation on my scalp. I have been walking around with chronic stress since the song played. These symptoms have gotten progressively worse. 

I am currently at a 30 day inpatient program. Working on stressors and triggers and how to get this back to normal. 

The stress: I feel like a dense ball of stress. My anxiety and depression has gotten significantly worse. There is a direct correlation to my stress and how much sleep I get. The stress also gives me shallow breathing. I feel like the stress/anxiety is the root issue that needs addressed. 

Insomnia: since October, I have been sleeping under 5 hours a night. This is sooooo abnormal. I normally sleep 8-10 hours a night. I wake up like clockwork at 1:20, 3, and 4:30 am. If I’m lucky, I fall back asleep. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, these hours are related to unprocessed grief, anger, and being in control- very accurate for my situation. 

Hair loss: I assume it is Telogen Effluvium. I am stressed and anxious and my hair loss only started with the trigger in October. The hair loss was unnoticeable for 3 months, but then the shedding got really bad. I have been taking Nutrafol hair supplements and using PuraDor shampoo and conditioner, but I know these are not stopping the underlying cause of my hair loss- stress. 

Any thoughts/ questions/ concerns???"
How do you cope with panic attacks?,2,m10jpf,11,"I found a grounding technique called the 5 senses that worked. But I want to know how you guys cope with it, maybe I’ll find a better way to deal :)"
Coping with shame?,38,m0fql9,13,"Hi all, I recently started EMDR processing which has been intense but I feel like it will eventually be really helpful for me. One of the side effect though has been me realizing how hyper vigilant I have been constantly and how much the trauma (and person who caused it) have been affecting my life for the past two years. And I’m so embarrassed and ashamed by that, it’s frustrating. My therapist told me ‘don’t be embarrassed’ but I feel like that’s easier said than done. I just keep feeling like I must be a weak person to have allowed another person to have this much of an effect on me, without even causing me actual physical harm. Does anyone else feel this way, or have you? How do you deal with it? Some days it makes me want to quit EMDR, but I don’t think that would be good for me long term.

Thanks in advance!!! Love to you all."
Hyper-Vigilance,16,m0kj7k,12,Does anyone have any tips on how to relieve their hyper-vigilance? I’m scared people are gonna eventually think I’m just faking it or I’m just being overly dramatic.

Finally faced my demons,10,m0lfrk,4,"Hi all!, this is an obvious throwaway account just to protect identity.  

doing a semi short version

Was working at a police department in a city I moved to with my wife, got a call about an unresponsive four year old.. showed up child wrapped in towel unconscious. Tried everything in my being to save this baby ..but unfortunately he succumbed to his abuse. Mothers boyfriend was physically abusing the child and come to find out the boy had a split spleen  and after a few days succumbed to the damage. he had extreme brain swelling. while E.M.T grabbed the boy I was talking with his two younger brothers in another room who were watching all dogs go to heaven...and playing with them. They were unaware their brother had died in the other room...

fast forward both mother and boyfriend sentenced to almost 40 years in jail. 

Immediately after I had left the scene i sat in my car with another officer and we did our best to rationalize everything. We told ourselves we did everything we could and we gave him at least a fighting chance. I couldn't sleep for the next two days. Every time i took a shower i took the opportunity to cry and I did this for about a week. After that I seemed to have pushed it to the corners of my mind. 

From that point on I began to get nervous every shift that I would have to respond to a similar call..i became increasingly more hot tempered towards any case that involved a child and found that I began to fight urges of physically assaulting these people who were involved with crimes against children... I soon told my wife that I needed to move back to our home state and I ended up leaving police work..... I work in law enforcement now but in a different capacity. Let me be clear I've never acted on those violent urges..

I didn't realize I had ptsd until while working my new job I had to deal with someone convicted of murdering a child. once i read the case something triggered...I started sweating...i became angry and sad at the same time ..in my head I ended up back in that living room with the dying child.. the rest of that work day I was in a total disconnect I felt very heavy and sat in my office and cried....since that day as an officer I've never had a full night of sleep..id have nightmares ..so vivid I felt like I could smell the scene I've never forgot that boys face...

fast forward again

I have a one year old son now...and i felt like it was time to start facing my demons so that I dont short change my son from having a full intact father. 

i sat down with my wife after 4 years and told her the story in full detail...why i don't sleep......why some days i seem to be aggravated or just irritated ..why I don't trust people ..nor care to be around them. the days i seemed to have sat in my own thoughts and just lay in bed...once she heard everything she cried.... She cried for me...for what I had to go through and what ive bottled up for years ..

it sounds cliché to say but if you have never worked law enforcement. .you may not truly know what we deal with and how we have to go from a traffic accident with serious injury or death ...to pulling someone over for speeding and wonder why seem a little annoyed or ""mean""

and talking to the doctors that departments refer you too is kind of a sign of weakness. That mentality does still exist.. 

I have friends who are police officers and I keep intouch with them and find it easier to talk to them about it when i do need to talk about it..I've seemed to be more open to it now after I opened up to my wife.. I feel different.. i still have days where something will trigger it and Ill either start to become sad or angry...but I found that when I do I reach out to my wife and tell her ..and she has always been good at keeping me in check...

for once in my life I feel like I have a somewhat good grip on things ..  I feel like Ive started to become normal again...

I still get the feeling that I'm crazy for feeling this way and that I should be better by now and it shouldn't effect me any more.. and sometimes when I talk about it to my wife...i feel embarrassed .. IDK just an additional thought"
"Feeling of being put in a BOX, which mentally disables me and then my body, it plays on my fear. It feels like I’m being killed.",1,m0vomh,0,"Has anyone ever felt this? Is this another sign that I have PTSD? To me it feels and seems so.It feels like another version, story, or pay of saying I have PTSD and I need help ASAP. One of the many ways to get a diagnosis, but the thing is, is I was raped and my rape is real and was traumatic the rest of body. 

I feel I’m screaming in my head for it to get out. I also became very suicidal, and wanted to kill myself."
PTSD and weed?,6,m0i7rh,10,"Ok. So my husband smokes alot. 3 times he has pressured me into trying something whether its smoking or an edible. The thing is each time it has been an AWFUL experience. I get bad flashbacks that happen so frequently I feel like I'm lost in time I don't know when or where I'm at, I dont know who I'm with, and I don't know what's real. Which leads to me freaking out. Has this happened to anyone else who wanted to try weed or an edible because they heard it helped with ptsd? Or am I just weird. I know ptsd changes the human brain, and weed affects the parts of the brain that is changed/traumatized by ptsd. Idk. what gives? Why does it have such an awful effect on me while others get all happy and calm?"

My abuser considers herself the victim.,8,m0fzws,10,"TW: grooming, spirituality 

My abuser, who went on to groom an entire community online, somehow considers herself the victim of narcissistic abuse. It’s maddening, considering how much time she spent gaslighting and harming the community that we were both in. She claimed to be dating a ghost and would use that to spread false information about him on the web - information that presumably came from spiritual visions. 

I’m not here to bash on others’ beliefs, but this person was harmful. Made herself seem like the only pure person and would talk badly about literally everyone else. We did call her out publicly, but it took a lot to do so when all we wanted was peace. 

It’s maddening and literally spits in the faces of all of our experiences with her. She even accused me of things that I have evidence of her being guilty of. Of course, she never responded to the allegations - but she believes that she’s the victim in this scenario some how, when she’s stalked and harmed multiple people here. 

I’m very vocal about what I’ve gone through, for sure. But her silence speaks volumes. 

Have others experienced this?"
I fucking hate my job,57,m05cgn,8,"Got physically abused by my husband and left him. Two months later got a job at a school only for them to put me in a Special Ed classroom with physically abusive kids. They are aggressive towards me and the other teachers every day.

I'm worried about covid testing....,2,m0ozx3,4,"Tomorrow in my college I'm getting a covid test, don't worry I'm not here to be an anit vaxer or anything, but I'm worried that that invasion of space might be too much for me and I'll be in college surrounded by students, then I have a lessons for the rest of the day,how can I prepare myself a bit better?

(I know I will take the test bc I want others to be safe and its not an option to be alone as its mass testing thats done systematically)

Identifying triggers,1,m0rci1,0,"Hey all, I've been in therapy for coming up on a year now and for the most part I've been doing better. However, I still have times where I completely back slide and am having a lot of trouble identifying why. I wanted to ask if anyone has any good apps or just ideas to help keep track of triggers? I know it's not a linear process but sometimes I end up just completely exhausted for days, after having so much good progress it's disheartening to not know what happened.

If it helps, for me these back slides are like... A complete reversal for me. I dissociate badly and without noticing, I start questioning everything about myself, and I'm so exhausted I can barely keep my eyes open for more than a few hours at a time or focus on anything. My medications do help in the sense that I don't feel utterly hopeless like before but the physical sensations are still there."
"to articulately title the scrambled soup my ADHD brain typed out is too hard so i just wont, and the post flair doesnt fit so well either.",3,m0isc8,0,"well we're off to a good start here. i made the title and these two sentences *after* i typed out the rest of this. something ive noticed is that when ive laughingly remarked ""i hav absolutely no idea how i exist"" others do not find this funny or really understand what i mean lmao. like, the best way i can i explain it is ""I, person that i am, composed of the experiences I've experienced, have been put in charge of myself, and somehow, *somehow* i am here, scratching my head going what?"" its funny to me. im not gonna say that it was altogether *necessary* or in someway righteously destined that i experienced this absolute clusterfuck of mental health becoming absolute shite, but at the end of the day im jus glad to still be puttin one foot in front of the other and makin progress everyday. i think its an attitude that naturally developes over time, even if you dont conciously seek out positive thinkkng or mantras, i think eventually after breaking down enough you are just so easily truthfully grateful for the little crumbs of stability+goodness that you gradually begin to amass. didnt intend to ramble about all this but whatever. love to all, hope anyone whos strugglin today remembers that theyve prolly been through worse and if not- then theyve previously been through things that took the cake for worst shit ever and still got through that so idk keep on keepin on. peace n love"
UK based organisations who support ex military people with PTSD (with varying degrees of success),2,m0jn9g,0,"
I was telling my friend recently about my 2 year (2016 - 2018) struggle to get support, for Post Traumatic Stress, after being deployed with the military, a few years working in various Conflict Affected areas, and a pretty robust involuntary coffee meeting, with some dudes from Russian Federation Military Intelligence.
Its mainly UK focused, as that is where my experience lies, but the guy I was sharing on behalf of is in the United States. So, its pitched in that direction.
I will copy the text below, hoping that it might be useful for someone. It is only based on my experience, so I cant speak for others who might have had more positive or negative experiences with the same or other organisations.

Please feel free to forward and share, as you wish. Some information about Combat Stress, the UK’s leading charity for veterans’ mental health. For over a century, they have helped former servicemen and women with mental health problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression. Today they provide specialist treatment and support for veterans from every service and conflict, focusing on those with complex mental health issues.
The work they do is life-changing and often life-saving. No one else does what they do.
Their unique services
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for their specialist services remains critical.
Although their clinical staff are unable to meet veterans in person, they have adapted and enhanced their phone and digital services to provide 1-1 therapy sessions, introduced a range of online resources on their website and offered access to their online peer support community.
They are taking new referrals in Scotland and Northern Ireland, after a temporary pause while they reconfigured, they are beginning to take on small numbers of new referrals in England and Wales until they are able to take more.
Their 24-hour Helpline 0800 138 1619 remains available to all veterans and their families for confidential mental health advice and support.
Demand remains constant
Since 1919 they have provided support to veterans from every Service and every conflict. Their support is vital to those who turn to them at their darkest hour. For many, this is years after leaving the Armed Forces – on average, it takes a veteran 13 years to ask for their help after leaving Service.
Their website is https://combatstress.org.uk
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

Organisations that I have found are also useful in the UK are Horseback UK which take wounded servicemen and women and introduce them to horses. Through working with the horses amongst a like-minded group, service personnel who have been mentally and physically scarred regain their confidence, dignity and especially in the case of amputees, mobility.
The relationship with the horses and the environment in which this was established is where magic happens.
Those who have completed the program return to assist in the delivery of other courses offering their support and experiences. Horseback UK are amazing at what they do, and the staff empathise, and care about their work and their horses. It is a life saving, and incredibly powerful program.
https://horseback.org.uk/about/introduction-to-horseback-uk/
Royal British Legion and SSAFA, the Armed Forces charity (Soldiers Sailors and Airmen's Institute) which provided me with quite a bit of funding for art, paints and canvases and eventually for a laptop computer. Although, they are very bureaucratic and slow, and not particularly compassionate or understanding. They are huge corporate bureaucracies now, and I feel I have lost sight of what they were established to do in the first place. But with some quite comprehensive assistance from other organisations, it is possible to get something useful rom then eventually.
https://www.ssafa.org.uk/

Phoenix House Recovery Centre in Catterick Garrison, in the North of England is a beautiful recovery centre, where staff spend lots of time fundraising, engaging with donors and the media. They do however have a lovely centre, which when ex military people finally get in there, they do offer sports programs, yoga, reiki, resettlement courses, wood work and lots of other things which are really helpful.

If you are lucky, as I was. It might be possible to find one person who will connect with you and will actually be able to work with you to take things forward in a positive direction. PTSD Resolution is a charity that helps Veterans, Reservists and Families who are struggling to reintegrate into a normal work & family life because of trauma suffered during service in the armed forces. The programme is community-based, with treatment and support provided locally through a nationwide network of 200 therapists, accredited by the Professional Standards Authority. PTSD Resolution helps Veterans and Reservists to resolve the mental health problems associated with military trauma that obstruct a normal range of family and work relationships. They have provided me with some great, Rewind Therapy, which is a kind of non-intrusive, safe and highly effective psychological method for detraumatising people, which can also be used for removing phobias. It is carried out by an experienced practitioner and is only performed once a person is in a state of deep relaxation.

Veterans for Peace are a peace activist organisation, although not an organisation that provides direct or charitable support to ex military people. What they do is offer a structure and organisation that is very familiar, and provide a supportive framework of people who are dedicated to sharing information about the futility of conflict and war, and working to oppose and hopefully stop it in the future. They were established in the USA and have many chapters there. I have met some amazing men and women there, and they are all very personable, intelligent and like minded. Veterans for Peace in the UK https://vfpuk.org/
Veterans For Peace is a global organization of Military Veterans and allies whose collective efforts are to build a culture of peace by using our experiences and lifting our voices. We inform the public of the true causes of war and the enormous costs of wars, with an obligation to heal the wounds of wars. Our network is comprised of over 140 chapters worldwide whose work includes: educating the public, advocating for a dismantling of the war economy, providing services that assist veterans and victims of war, and most significantly, working to end all wars. Veterans for Peace in the USA

Other organisations in the UK are Veterans UK which are almost (in my opinion) a complete waste of time and money, https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterans-uk
They do nothing much other than take their time to ""assist"" people to get pitiful government unemployment benefit, which is fundamentally useless for getting anywhere useful.

Forward Assist https://www.forward-assist.com/ No idea what they do in reality, beyond fund raise for themselves.
The Beacon, in Catterick Garrison, which offers supported housing to single veterans who are homeless or at risk of homelessness and who have support needs. This is probably one of the most hostile, and dangerous environments I have ever been in, in my life. I include, Baghdad, Kabul, Mogadishu, Donetsk, Benghazi, Malakal, Sofia, Ulan Bator and Blackpool in that list.
People are lucky if they emerge from this place alive and in one piece and have to work quite hard themselves to do so, as the staff, beyond chatting, don't do very much to assist, as their hands are tied, and they are run down and burnt out by being surrounded by miserable people all the time. There are some amazing staff there, who do care, and try their hardest to help people out, however they can. Although its easy for people to slip through the gaps, and end up dead, in prison or just completely lost in drugs, alcohol or the toxic relationships which abound in the place. https://www.riverside.org.uk/in-your-neighbourhood/north-yorkshire/care-and-support/the_beacon/
ABF The Soldiers’ Charity say they are the national charity of the British Army, providing a lifetime of support to soldiers, veterans and their families when they are in need.In my experience, I have no idea what they do besides pass people on to the next charity in the chain who passes people on in turn. https://soldierscharity.org/
There we go. Not sure how useful that is, particularly for someone in the United States, but I am happy to provide more information, or answer any questions as they come up.
I will just add, that Veterans with Dogs say that they train and provide assistance dogs exclusively for current and former members of the British Armed Forces with service-related mental health conditions. They also claim that they specialise in providing trained assistance dogs for Veterans with mental health difficulties. With their goal is to improve quality of life and help lead independent lives by training assistance dogs in task-specific skills. All of my experience with them has been fundamentally miserable. They seem to not really have a clue of how to communicate or deal with people at all. Let alone people with mental health challenges.
No idea how or even if it possible to get a dog from them. I was Infantry, deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, and I don't seem to fit their criteria. I suppose if you are very much a whore for the media, or raise them thousands perhaps then they will pay attention. No idea really. https://veteranswithdogs.uk/


Also, not a military charity per se, but Hostage UK now Hostage International
Who say that since Hostage UK’s inception in 2004, the charity has always supported families regardless of their nationality or location. Families across the world have lent on them for direct support and that they have worked with organisations in many countries to help them improve the support they give to families during a kidnap crisis.
My experience with these clowns, is that they are an absolute scam.
I contacted them in frustration and desperation, and they listened intently and made sure to take note of all off the gory, and most noteworthy details. Then their ""support"" was to try to help to get me on government benefits and write a letter to my doctor saying, they should help out. (Two completely pointless things in my experience).
I saw them at a conference a few years later, gushing about all the amazing things that they do. I challenged them privately, on how fundamentally useless and misrepresentative they are. They claimed I was an anomaly, and had somehow slipped through the gaps. I gave them my card and said they could contact me if they could offer any tangible support. But never heard back.

Hope this might be useful to someone.

Are there any free online therapy resources for PTSD? (Canada),1,m0nk7n,0,"I'm in a sticky situation Reddit I desperately need your help

&#x200B;

5 months ago my friend (14F) was raped and sexually assaulted by her abusive boyfriend of 2 years. Her parents are unsupportive of her situation and she suffers from severe PTSD, with hallucinations, nightmares, flashbacks, panic attacks, etc. 

&#x200B;

She desperately needs a therapist or professional or any outside help of any kind, but without the support of her parents, finding any resource that allows her to get professional help without a cost or parental consent is extremely slim to none. Is there any therapy resource I can forward to her that will help a minor without parental consent for free? I know that's a lot but this is my last hope considering I'm asking this on reddit. The option of asking her parents are out of the question and recovering without any treatment is also impossible. 

&#x200B;

A resource that can operate over live chat and in Canada is the most preferred option. She cannot see anyone in person because of her parents. 

&#x200B;

DM me or reply in the comments if you need any more details. I'm not looking for a hotline or crisis phone number, I am looking for counseling/therapy, a long term solution please."

EMDR Therapy,7,m03e8r,14,"Has anybody on here tried EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) therapy who would be okay sharing about their experience?

I'm so close to practicing ineffective coping skills...,2,m0a5jf,0,"My ex (not the one that gave me PTSD) is constantly texting me and accusing me of cheating. Long story short and with details changed, I had to move back in with my parents and he told my mother about my therapy sessions and the trauma she caused. So, I guess you guys can kinda guess how it turned out... Emotional abuse, gaslighting, and bullying by mother for $500 Alex?

Because of him, she's constantly being mean to me and calling me names. She makes fun of me for getting into the abusive relationship that I was in and says that I don't really have PTSD, that I'm just ""lazy"", and ""manipulative"". She constantly screams at me about getting a job and it's annoying because I really am trying to overcome this and feel comfortable going outside, not to mention that I've been filling out applications and I'm constantly not hearing back from where I've applied. I've started tutoring again and she constantly messes with my appointments because it's ""not a real job"" or she's ""tired of me being in the house"". I hate her and I hate ex even more because she's even worse now knowing all of my therapy details. She throws my trauma in my face and blames me for it. All ex will ever say when I tell him (on the rare occasion I talk to him) that it's his fault her abuse got worse he says, ""I was trying to help"", ""I didn't think she was that bad"", ""she's your mom she loves you"", ""she wanted you back home, she loves you so much that she fought to have you back there."" It makes me so fucking angry!!

Fortunately, I'm currently dating a wonderful man who wants to move out west with me and is just all around awesome. He's the one great thing I look forward to every single day and he motivates me to get better, not only for him, but for myself. Unfortunately, it's going to probably be the end of the year when we can finally move out west and be together. We both want to save up for a nice home and also have an emergency fund. And that almost makes this situation worse because I want to be with him and finally in a caring, nurturing, stable environment with someone who actively listens to me and shows me that they care about my feelings. And it frustrates me that I have to grin and bear it for now!!

The silver lining to this situation is that I have him in my life to look forward to, he's supportive, emotionally present and he actually believes me when I tell him my mother is abusive. From what I've told him, he seems to know and accept the fact that she is as bad as I say she is. It's so validating to know that someone, *someone* finally sees past that whole ""she's your mother"" bullshit and sees her for who she is!!"

Looking for advice (UK),1,m06j1d,0,"Hi, just looking for some insight from others. 

The GP referred me to a charity as well as psychotherapist through NHS when I first reached out in August. 

The charity had a shorter waiting list than the second referral so I’ve been doing CBT therapy for about 6 weeks. My therapist the past couple of weeks has been advising me that although she can’t give me a diagnosis a lot of the issues we have been working through are PTSD. She is going to write a letter to me to give to my GP. 

I was just wondering is there any benefit to having an official diagnosis? (Medication or even just it being on file incase of future struggles)

I was struggling a lot again in December before the charity waiting list was over and contacted my GP who really weren’t helpful- told me to buy a colouring book etc. (I think maybe I didn’t explained myself really well). So I am just weary of dealing with them again as I left feeling really guilty and like a nuisance. 

Someone mentioned to me that it could affect my life insurance costs- does anyone have any experience with this?

Not sure if anyone has been through something similar. Any advice appreciated xx"

CBT therapy techniques,36,lzl0q0,6,"Saw another post sharing tips for those who can't afford therapy. Here are some tips from my cognitive behavioral sessions. 
1) If you're having intrusive thoughts, write every detail about the thought in a notebook. Write about the event over and over again daily in said notebook. Even if you can't remember much at first, write down what you can remember. The key is that you must be consistent and write daily. This is exposure therapy. My psychologist explained it like this ""you keep playing a scary movie in your head over and over, but you look away from the scary parts. If you watch the scary parts, you wont be scared anymore because you know what's going to happen""

2) if you keep having nightmares and wake up from them, don't fall back to sleep trying to think of something else. Go back to sleep, but change the ending of the dream so that you're more in control. For example, I would have nightmares about my ex breaking into my house again to harm me. I fell back to sleep and changed the ending to my dream. Instead of my dream finishing with my ex harming me, I finished with me successfully overpowering him and throwing him out. 

3) if you constantly have negative thoughts, write down the negative thought, then write down solutions/explanations to the negative thought. 
-""I heard a noise, someone must be breaking in again--the noise is most likely someone using the bathroom, the noise could've been my pet walking around""
-""the restraining order is almost up, hes going to harm me again---its been 2 years and I'm still safe, I can ask for another order,""

These are some techniques they would possibly use in cbt therapy, I hope this helps!"
Cold Sweats and night terrors,2,m00iv6,3,"So I’ve taken to Reddit to share this and seek out some useful information.

 I don’t know if it’s ptsd but I can only assume it is. 

Back when I was young and dumb teen I tried my hand at selling weed. Nothing big, bought and sold about a OZ a day. Well the few times I did big sales I got robbed both times. With out going into the details, one time I was shot at (thankfully they missed) second time was just bum rushed with guns all in my face. 

At the time, I was pretty numb to the whole experience. I kinda expected it, given how I was trying to make my money. 
But now it’s been about 2-4 years since the events and for the past 6 months I’ve had weekly nightmares of me being robbed at work, being shot, being robbed in general, being out in positions of kill or be killed you name it and waking up drenched in sweat head to toe but freezing my ass off.. 

I suppose I’m more or less just curious if PTSD is the right rabbit hole to go down here in terms of seeking a resolution or if there’s something else I should be looking at.  TIYA to all of you here in the community."
"i don’t know if this is the right sub, cw for alcohol mention",3,lzwc4p,0,"i experience the same memory, the same experience over and over again. i relive it constantly. i analyse everything to the point where it stops making sense. i am in a permanent sense of self-doubt and sadness. sometimes i will find occasional joy in mundane things - booze, food, music, television - but they are short-lived. 

the worst thing is, is that the event feels so hard to describe to people and feels shameful because it was executed in such an overblown way, i am ashamed of my responses and the fact that it could be perceived as something to laugh at. when in reality the event was so much more complex than one or two components. it was so convoluted and restless that it’s easy to get lost in it, entwined, enraptured in this solid state of numbness and internal agonising.

i feel like i am at fault. i feel like i am to blame, that i have dug my own hole and misread everything, that i deserved the eventual outcome and that i handled it badly. my partner reassures me that i didn’t. it is stressful to him, and in turn stressful to me. it is triggering to us both.

so many people have either brushed it off as a misunderstanding. they see it as an online fight. they see it as four days of “drama”. it wasn’t. it ruined my life. and my heart is pounding with fear as i write this, fearful of the masses of invalidation i anticipate from the possibility of confiding to someone about it.

it wasn’t just four days. it went well beyond four days.

fuck. i’m so sorry. i don’t know what to do. what else is there to say."
Does disassociation ever stop?,11,lzlv04,5,"My ex girlfriend went through having an abortion 7 months ago.

Since then I have tried asking her to go to therapy together to unpack it and talk about it. Her reasonings were due to covid and our lack of jobs, and her fear of her disapproving parents.

She shuts down the conversation pretty quickly and then moves on. She normally would never do this.

Further she hates talking about it altogether and thus I had stopped asking.

She had been binge watching tv shows and movies and focusing on her health which is great yes, but its as if she was not at all thinking about it and that is understandable but I just feel like sweeping things under a rug and disassociating are more damaging.

Out of nowhere 7 months post abortion, she told me she associates me to the abortion and thus she couldn't be with me any longer. Again disassociating from her trauma.

Finally its been 6 months post breakup and I ran into her sister at a grocery store. After catching up, I asked her about her sister. And she said ""Funny you ask, we talked the other day about you. I asked her what's he been up to. And unfortunately she said that she hasn't thought about you, searched you, or any of that.""

This killed to hear because we had a long relationship and I thought I was special to her in some way despite breaking up.

I felt like she was trying to disassociate me from her mind and life, sweeping me under that big rug of hers and not thinking about me.

Does disassociation ever catch up to someone and then they need to handle all those things they have pushed down?

Would she ever stop disassociating me do you think? 

Can disassociation last a lifetime?

I would love to be friends just like we were before dating... but yah she doesnt want me around due to the connection, and seemingly she doesnt want me in her head either."
The Beirut Port Explosion,15,lzkh2h,4,"This has been bugging me ever since it happened, and Im only now ever really talking about it.

On August 4th , 2020, the port in my city blew up with 2750 tons of ammonium nitrate in the warehouse, most of the city was badly damaged. I live about 3km ( 2 miles) away from the blast.
Nothing happened to me or my family, since they were all out of town,and it was just me in the city that day.
Initially the warehouse was on fire prior to the blast and I didnt think anything of it really, thought it was just like any other fire, about tobe put out.
So I just went about my day , but around 6:08 pm I felt the ground below me shake violently, so I looked out the window and I saw the clouds moving irregularly, I had experienced a blast/ explosion before so I knew the tell tale signs of it,so I immediately yanked my window open and ducked for cover, then the shockwave hit,  mind you this all happened in mere seconds if not split seconds, then stuff from my room was flung around, glass windows around my house shattered. First thing I did was put my shoes on to walk around ,since there was glass all over the floor, and I rushed to fill a backpack with essentials to leave the city.  first thing that came to mind was that this was an Israeli airstrike and we should be expecting another very shortly. Then my family called and I told them I was fine. Next thing I did was walk down to the streets, everything is destroyed , glass everywhere,a large smoke cloud in the sky,people running around with blood all over their face, I can hear people crying from their apartment buildings. And I still have no idea what happened,in my head Im still waiting for the second strike to happen.then military planes and helicopters were out to take recon pics to assess the situation, but everytime I heard them Id get that fight or flight response and then it would take me a while to settle down again. I later learned that I had lost two of my friends in the blast since they live in an area exposed to the port directly .Its been 7 months and I occasionally get nightmares where  Im in different places living out the same scenario, Im always jittery and uneasy towards any sound I hear which is remotely similar to a jet or  an explosion. And Ive been having a feeling of ( this might sound silly to most of you) an impending nuclear attack thats about to take place. 
I havent spoken to anyone about this, not even my closest friends and family.  

Im sorry for any spelling errors, or grammatical mistakes and formatting."
PTSD getting in the way of being able to hold a job,13,lzknc0,10,"I because of PTSD I don't know that I can hold a job at this point in my life. In 2016-19 had a series of violent, very serious workplace related situations that ultimately exacerbated my PTSD issues. 

Now I struggle to feel safe on the job, deal with pressures in the office, I struggle to maintain good sleep and not be dangerously sleep deprived when on a rigid work schedule, and I struggle to hide my struggles from bosses and coworkers. It's all  too much to handle day in and day out, indefinitely. 

I keep burning out of jobs and getting bullied by coworkers and eventually forced to find new work. ADA is a joke and just makes the situation worse. I've tried to get professional help but so far all I've gotten is invalidated, labeled, and told to take some deep breathes. 

With the pandemic I've been unemployed for about a year now, and I struggle to see myself ever being able to hold a regular job and not end up worn down and burned out after a month or two. 

After many months of waiting I was connected with a case manager, but they quit their job before my first session, and I ended up disconnected services. 

I am 100% reliant on government help and struggle to pay my bills. I feel very hopeless about it, and don't see myself as having much of a future if I can't support myself. I'm really frightened and lost about this and not a single person in my life understands or has any sympathy for me. It's all ""pull yourself up by your boot straps...""

I have been white-knuckling it through work situations for years and I just don't think I can put myself through a life where every single day I have to but all my energy into pretending to be okay and ""normal"" for people while also coping with a lack of sleep and constant work-related stress. 

Has anyone else faced this kind of situation? I'm totally at a loss. My life is completely stagnated and I'm not sure what kind of future a person struggling as hard as I am can even have."

i havent told anyone i was abused. it was a really long time ago. i dont want to tell anyone now.


except my therapist. i want help. i want these thoughts to stop. but im scared. im scared shes going to tell my family or theyll find out or this will be taken to court and ill have to tell everyone. i dont want to do that. its too much.

I was never an angry person and I'm dealing with the fact my head compartmentalized things in such a way that when I observe myself now as a whole, I feel like I should recognize better when I feel angry and I'm doing things defensively. I tend to be oblivious of my faults at those times.
But on the other hand, if I focus on my faults I have a hard time speaking for myself because my head is 100% focused on ""I fucked up"", I can't place what the other person's done in perspective. I give up too much on myself. 

How do you guys reconcile this? I'm aware it's because I'm very co-dependent. 
In my head I believe that in a bad interaction in a relationship one bad thing does not justify another, within reasonableness. We all have to see our part and pull our own weight, but I feel so two-sided when it comes to this.

How long can someone suppress trauma and just hide it away?,2,lzmt8v,5,"For example: 

Lets say someone has a trauma incident like losing a parent, they never want to talk about it but also bury it away and any fragment or memory of it they try to remove.

My girlfriend lost her father, she desperately and almost immediately tried to remove every remnant of him from her life. Not because of negativity but because she just didn't want to be sad with reminders of her father dying.

I just think its severely unhealthy and wish I could share that with her.

But based on my question, how long can someone hide their trauma? Can they live their life and never face it? 

She doesn't even want to talk to her brother because he looks like her father and reminds her of her father. Its like she wants to disconnect from reality and live in this world as though her father is out of sight out of mind and not face the trauma.

Will this or any other related trauma last forever?

Is there anything I can do?

It scares me also that she did this, because now I feel like if anything happens with us in anyway, she will remove me and it will be out of sight out of mind with me. 

Whats your take?"
I don’t think I want to get better.,3,lzkjuf,1,"I know how bad it sounds, but hear me out. I went through some major trauma when I was 13 years old. I didn’t have ANY support system to help me after the fact, not even my own family, who would belittle me and betray my trust. I was a child who was suffering immensely behind closed doors. For years after, I experienced intense PTSD symptoms that I had to cope with entirely on my own. I had to learn the hard way that nobody was gonna come and save me. There was never anyone there to calm me down after a nightmare. Never anyone to bring me back to reality. Never anyone to validate my trauma and tell me it was gonna be alright. Absolutely no one. I honestly don’t know how I survived without ending it. Because I was alone through all of this, I’ve developed intense hyper-independence and insist on coping with everything myself. It’s just how I’ve had to live.

I got a therapist for the first time this year and was officially diagnosed with PTSD. This week will be my first session of EMDR. Even though healing seems like such an amazing thing, and I would give anything for a bit of relief in difficult moments, a big part of me doesn’t want to get better until someone finally sees me. Deep down, I want someone to recognize how hurt I am. I want someone to help me through a flashback or a panic attack. I want someone to care for me on bad days. I want someone to vent about my trauma to. I want someone to hug me and tell me it will be okay. Though I push it away, I want it more than anything. And I don’t want to get better until I know what it’s like to be supported and loved, something I haven’t experienced since I was 13 years old. Maybe this all sounds stupid. I shouldn’t expect to be saved, I know. But I’m conflicted about healing because if I’m not broken, there’s nothing to be fixed. There’s no reason for someone to comfort and care for me. There’s no need for someone to help me when I’m hurting. I don’t want to get better because it defeats any chance of finally feeling supported. Am I entitled for thinking this? Maybe. Honestly, the child in me just wants to be loved. All she wants is a chance to be vulnerable and let her guard down. And even though she‘s terrified to open up, she’s tired of doing this on her own. That’s why I don’t want to get better. I’d rather suffer for a million years if it means I might finally be seen."
Something weird happened. It saved my life.,212,lys8ua,56,"I was suicidal yesterday and actually planning on using my .357 to end it. My work environment is so negative and everyone hates me so much and they make it a point to let me know so often that I had literally lost the will to live. I’ve had no one in my life for 13 years, no friends, no one. I have nothing. It was my time. 

But I went to a facility at work where I deliver to. Two nurses came up from the bottom floor and immediately asked me about my adoption tattoo. Then they immediately gave me a group hug. It was amazing. I haven’t felt physical affection in 13 years. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t even know them at all. I’ve never believed in god, but sometimes I wonder if we do have people looking out for us. It’s just such strange timing. Plus the topic was brought up in aa meeting tonight. So another coincidence. 

Just thought it was strange, but it saved my life. Maybe I can improve myself enough where people will give me a chance again."
Does anyone else feel guilty for speaking about the abuse they've experienced?,33,lyzfbm,12,I can't help but feel very guilty for talking the abuse I experienced growing up. I recently talked a little bit about my childhood with my therapist. I feel incredibly stupid for saying anything like I shouldn't speak about it. Even though it hurts. I hate feeling like this. It's like I feel guilty for even trying to heal. I feel like I deserve to live in pain and I hate that. It's like why do I even try to get better? No one understands what this is like.
Night Terrors Wake Up Panic Attacks and Sleep Paralysis,2,lzgeb0,1,"I recently experienced a sleep paralysis episode. It was a short moment but I could not open my eyes.  I have a history now with night terrors since childhood. I have extremely vivid dreams that are often sexually based, pedophilic, violent, kidnap themed, and infidelity. Starting around 6-7 years ago I began waking up with panic attacks.  My heart rate is incredibly fast I get vertigo short breath terror and often vomiting follows. It has become daily at times throughout the years even in peaceful periods of my life.  My night terrors have the ability to cause me to violently fight in my sleep and often I wake up from sleep crying loud enough to wake my husband.  I am not sure if this is a familiar experience with PTSD. I have seem many therapists but have never told them all these episodes. My concern is they are increasing in severity and I have little compassion getting my peer circle to understand it's crippling affect it's begun to have on me. I start every morning like this,  it's never a good day.  I notice however with more sleep I don't suffer the attacks as often,  and wonder if all.these other physical affects can realky be due to lack of sleep? Please share if you've had similar night symptoms."
Feeling more and more alone,1,lzj7qk,0,"I suffer from PTSD and lately my symptoms have worsened, forgetting to eat/no appetite , short term memory issue, sleep disruption you get it. 
I had an argument with the only person who remotely cares about what’s happening to me and now I’ve been told that I missed a package and why didn’t I inform them right away. Frankly I forgot, that what happens when you spend most days completely solitary. 

And now (even in anger), I was told ‘ why didn’t you say anything within 24 hours instead of talking about meaningless shit’.  Apparently asking someone how they are, how their day went and anything else I can remember that needs taking care of is ‘meaningless’. I already struggle with imposter syndrome, I last east have trust issues to at run so deep I expect people to hurt me and abuse my trust the moment I meet them. And anytime their kind I only see it as a facade and not genuine. 

It’s was stupid and trivial, more and more I feel like I have less and less of a support structure and feel more like people hate me and what I have to say really doesn’t matter to those around me. And it was uncalled for to be spoken to that way. And it only makes me feel worse about myself and it just makes me want to withdraw more and more to complete isolation. I’m so fucking tired of the very few around me marking me feel less than. I really am and there’s no way to change it. I’m stuck here right now with all this anger and nowhere to put it.
Therapy, medicine (not suicidal, never have been)✅"
I guess I’m the worst daughter (Family Trauma/ Sexual Assault Trauma),6,lz821i,0,"I grew up with so much family trauma, parents divorcing at the age of 5, witnessing so many family deaths, and my mother not talking about any of it or helping me understand. 

My older sister ruined my life because of her actions, she took my childhood, and teenage years in high school from me. My sister got involved with abusive men with records, each one more worse than the last, and had children by them, but kept getting her kids taken away, and put in my mothers custody, due to the men she would bring around. One man laid hands on my nephew, had my other nephew pass from SIDS, had another kid with my sister/ named him the (IV) after the son that passed, and another man killed my niece by punching her resulting in brain dead. 

I didn’t know how to process all of this trauma from the age of 7 to 23. I had to watch my nephews all the time, didn’t really have friends until high school, and was taught to suppress and not talk about my problems/ put everyone else first. I’m 23 now, but honestly my mother hasn’t felt like my mother since I was 7. My mother was always at work, real father all the way in Another state, siblings weren’t close to me at all, I was alone all the time in my room depressed/ very suicidal, stressed out at a young age always having to take care of my nephews feeling like a “Second Mom” , and not knowing how to process my emotions at appropriate times. No one came to my lacrosse games, always got picked up hella late like 3 hours passed the time I was supposed to be picked up or longer, she took my sisters or brothers out all the time, and even bought them groceries and was still there for them. 

I turned 18 and tried to admit myself to cry for help, my mother took me to her friend instead, and still felt suicidal afterwards. I got held down in the back of the bus Bc my friends cousin who I knew since 1st grade, wanted to grab my boobs under my bra randomly, and no one heard me screaming, this was my junior year of high school. 

I have been off my meds since December Bc after 2 years just felt numb, and my mother instead of putting me in the bigger room in the new house with a bathroom for privacy, put me upstairs with everyone else in my old bed set from 4th grade.... while everyone else got new furniture and new TVs. I just feel like my mother doesn’t care about me and I’ve tried to talk to her multiple times, even cried to her face that I would go to therapy and go on meds so that I could go to the bigger room and she didn’t listen. Honestly living in this room is my own hell, Bc I can’t suppress anymore memories, they’re all coming out, and at night it’s the worst. I know everyone’s suggestions is to just move out, but I’m honest to God trying, I was in my own sexually abusive relationships that even gave me financial trauma, and I’m trying to suck it up and pay everything off, so that I can honestly just leave this place and start a new life, Bc I’m trying so hard to not burn bridges, but everything is so hard, and I feel like I’m losing my damn mind."
I need to get this out.,3,lza8dy,2,"I keep on having night terrors about what caused my ptsd. The more stressed out I am, the more frequent they are. 

When I was 6 years old my uncle was shitfaced drunk and came over to our house with his son. He was a severe alcoholic so this was normal. But I did something that I can’t remember that triggered him. He grabbed me by the throat, dragged me across the room to the front door and choke slammed me against the front door and was strangling me to death when what seemed like forever my dad came up and obviously flipped the fuck out and got into a fight with him. My dad kicked him out. He then decided to go to his house and broke in and really fucking went after him. 

I always played by myself no was never social as a kid, it was even worse after this, it magnified my issues. Then comes the bullying for me not talking to people and my life went downhill from there. 

Well even as an adult I still have this night terror/dream/sleep paralysis that happens all of the time. I wake up screaming to the point where my neighbors have noticed. I wake up only halfway, to the point where I can hear my tv and people walking down the hallway but I can’t open my eyes or move. I then feel a body either jump on me or spoon up against my back, and the hands go around my throat and I’m being strangled all over again. I can feel everything physically as if someone broke into my apartment and is actually doing it. It’s fucking terrifying. I never see the person though, it’s just physical feelings. I hate it. 

Anyways, just had to get that out. I’m addressing it with my therapist next week."

I finally feel safe to share my story,85,lyjlep,12,"Warning: Some miscarriage stuff is graphic so please don't read if it is fresh with you.

This is somewhat long, so if no one reads it that's fine. I just want to say that I have reached a point in my life where PTSD no longer owns my life anymore. I think part of my PTSD wasn't just the actual incidents, but how people around me handled it. I couldn't discuss bits and pieces for a long time, and now I can. 

Step back a few years ago. It seems like yesterday, my timeline is blurry because unbeknownst to me, I smudged everything together. If you lose track of events because you're in a fog you'll understand the constant messing up dates and years. I used to ride motorcycles. A man made an illegal left turn into my bike. I broke 7 bones, including my pelvis (which will matter later). The first hospital not on my insurance but the closest was going to do surgery on my shattered left arm and pelvis as it was an open book fracture. When I was transferred to my HMO hospital they decided I didn't need it. As a result my left arm fused together incorrectly and I lost partial feeling in it. I was depressed in a wheelchair. They gave me two PT sessions. One was just sitting up in bed, one was transferring from my bed to the wheelchair. After that my insurance provider decided I was good. I had to figure out how to do everything else on my own. I was dating someone during this accident. During my depression I latched on to him. I was forming a horrible codependent relationship and didn't realize it. Because I couldn't have sex at first I told him we could open the relationship up. I would have done anything to keep him in it. My self esteem was blown. He started seeing someone else. Our rules were he had to use protection and remain emotionally monogamous with me. He agreed. 

Every week I couldn't work my boss would call me up and ask me if I was available to walk. They weren't wheelchair accessible. At this point I wasn't even wiping my own feces. Thank god for my sister. She lived in the apartment with me. She had never seen me naked and now she would have to wipe my butt. It was degrading. I couldn't work, but my boss's urgency that I come back to work made me worried she was going to fire me. I was determined to get an early release. I called an Uber. I waited 10 minutes for the Uber driver to come just to have her tell me she that my collapsible wheelchair didn't fit in her car. Next Uber driver with the same model car fit my wheelchair in without trouble. Again, feeling like I was a worthless burden on society. I went to the hospital to get my doctor to let me work early. He refused initially as it was clear I couldn't walk well if at any. In the following month I eventually managed to get a note sooner once I was able to walk in tiny bits with my cane. I was in bed for so long that I ran out of breath easily, and the pain walking was like a knife in my pelvis. But, I needed to pay rent so I went back to work. 

A few months out, my pelvis was still fractured, but healing, I stupidly started having sex again. I felt like I was losing him to the other woman. I hadn't got my period and my boyfriend suggested I couldn't get pregnant. He didn't want to use protection. Keep in mind we both were graduate students in biology-related fields but also we were both idiots. I have never had unprotected sex thus never having a serious pregnancy scare. I guess my mind set was I wanted to keep him and I could support a baby as I made decent money. Tbh I was so depressed I had no idea what I was doing.  He said he didn't want children unless it was with the right person. I didn't even love him. I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. Of course, as one might have guessed, I got pregnant almost right away. I bled heavily after testing positive. The initial doctor told me I miscarried but to come back in a few days to make sure my HCG levels went down. I went through that emotion. I was crying, and my boyfriend at the time was out in another country. I chose not to tell him until he came back because I stupidly didn't want to ruin his trip. I had to cry in silence. I went back to get my HCG tested and it doubled in two days. I was still pregnant. As it turns out, I had a condition with subchoronic bleeding. Having a still fractured pelvis and being pregnant led to a high risk pregnancy. I had to see a perinatologist. I couldn't have sex until the bleeding stops which was very seldom. Boyfriend had sex more and more at other woman's house. It did slow down when I hit my second trimester and that was the best I got. 

Cue back to boyfriend. I told him about the pregnancy and he wanted to know if I was getting an abortion. Children weren't in his future. Instead of asking me how I was etc, he kept talking about how stupid it was of him to have unprotected sex. He didn't care about the baby. I instantly fell in love with this baby. He grew, was healthy, and the NIPT test and 4D ultrasound showed him to be in good shape. Right after my 2nd trimester I felt pain in my vagina. I went to get tested but they didn't call me with any results so I assumed I was good. Later on I would find my white blood count was out of spec high, and no one contacted me. The doctor who was supposed to read that test and notify me stopped contact and put me in touch with his partner after what happened next. One morning I woke up and my water broke. I just knew what it was. I panicked and went to the ER. The baby was fine but the amniotic fluid was gone. They told me I had an infection that caused the sac to pop. I had to abort the baby or it could be deadly. I couldn't do it. I read about some mothers successfully delivering with low amniotic fluids and I was determined to keep him. My baby was the only thing keeping me going. 

I stayed in bed drinking lots of fluids and on antibiotics. I was still with my boyfriend but he was more often at the other woman's house at this point. He assured me she meant nothing more than sex to him. One night I was laying in bed and I just felt something shift. I could feel pressure on my vaginal canal. I actually didn't have contractions which would be ignored by the doctor and almost lead to a deadly outcome. I called my boyfriend to take me to the hospital. My sister does not have her driver's license because she's almost blind. He said he was getting high with said woman and asked if I could take an Uber. I was bleeding heavily at this time. I insisted and he finally came over. He brought me to the hospital. I wasn't far along enough for them to bring me to L&D. I had to at least be 22 weeks, so they made me push him out in the ER. He came out sleeping of course. I took pictures with my phone because he was perfect. I'm still working up to looking at these pictures, I put them on my google drive so I wouldn't see them. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to see him, and my boyfriend said those kind of things grossed him out. The nurse took my son and put him in a hazardous waste bag. That was the last time I ever saw him. Unfortunately, the placenta retained in my uterus. 

They did an emergency D&C to get the placenta out while I was under. During that time I bled out because I did not contract. They had to do two blood transfusions to keep me alive. The doctor would later tell me that I should have came in sooner to do the D&C (abortion) and this wouldn't have happened. He said he was close to performing a hysterectomy. I have no children, nor had no children other than the son I had just lost. That would have been devastating. While I was recovering in the hospital bed, boyfriend came and visited me. He said he was sorry to see me suffering too much and decided the relationship was much more intense than he wanted. He didn't want children, and when I got pregnant that ruined the great relationship we used to have. 

I was desperate. I asked him what I could do to make him stay. He said he wanted to try swinging with people. He had already contacted a couple and they wanted to meet the following week. I wasn't supposed to have sex until after my doctor approved. I wanted so badly to keep my boyfriend that I did it. The 2nd day upon returning to work, my co-workers knowing what happened, greeted me by asking me what I would get for my baby shower since her friend is having one. I just broke down crying right there at work. Milk was coming in my breasts and they hurt. I remember my co-worker telling me not to cry because I could have another one. The other co-worker who was a mom said 'at least you didn't have to give birth to a full sized baby. Mine was painful.'

So what happened. I went a couple weeks like this and started drinking heavily, using pot. One day I woke up on a weekday when I should have been working and I just couldn't do it. I couldn't move out of bed. I called in sick that day. The next day and the next was the same. I called in sick over and over again. I couldn't get out of bed other than to get something to drink. A close friend of mine in the same state but another city contacted me. Thank god for her. She truly has saved me. She urged me to come stay with her. I stayed with her because I didn't see my life improving. She did meditations with me, and did some therapeutic  work that she was taught. We really spoke a lot about what I wanted to do. We did a proper ceremony for my son so I could get closure. I've been wanting to move out of CA, out of my crappy toxic job, and the boyfriend was a narcissist. I made a plan to pack up everything I could, my sister who lived with me would get the apartment (she could afford it by herself), and I would pursue a new life because I just wasn't happy anymore. 

The problem was I hadn't dealt with a lot of the trauma of what happened. I went to stay at my parents in the middle of the country while I looked for jobs in my dream state. The first of what would be many panic attacks would occur. Triggers of baby commercials coming on, and remembering everything everybody did to me to make things worse. I refused to sleep because I felt like if I went to sleep I would die. My body would constantly feel like it was going to die and give up on me. I contemplated every second all the things that could kill me at any second. Driving became a nightmare. I had cut off contact with boyfriend, but the woman he was sleeping with and wouldn't ever date, he started to date. This psycho started contacting me with no provocation asking me if I was still around. It started off with did I call her. I had her number from before I left the state because she wanted to hang out with me as we were ""sharing"" my boyfriend. The whole thing was weird but I went with it. She starting sending me fake call logs saying I called her and to contact her. When I didn't respond she became more aggressive. She told me I had tried to trap boyfriend with a baby, and he wouldn't have been with me otherwise. I blocked her but I'm pretty sure she used phishing numbers as I received random text messages pertaining to stuff she would say. Of course this triggered me every single time. (I've changed numbers since). After the last bad trigger, I started seeking therapy 3x a week. 

At first I didn't notice a change. One by one I was able to talk and peel apart more about what happened that last year. There were things about my accident I ignored because I was focused on my pregnancy. I never mourned the loss of a lot of things. I never got angry with how my boyfriend treated me. I let my self-esteem plummet. For months I couldn't drive without having to pull over the side of the road. One day I went 30 minutes without panicking while I drove. I actually relaxed and listened to the music without feeling my body go numb. That's easy for most people, but for people with flight or fright responses it can be scary. After so much intensive therapy I that was the first thing I noticed as an improvement. 

I met my future husband while staying with my parents. It took me awhile to find a job again out of state. Fast forward, I'm married to someone who loves me and treats me well. I have my dream job with colleagues that treat me human. I still get panic attacks, and I'm still in therapy. But this is one of the first times I can tell my full story without crying. I'm not 100% completely healed but I'm getting there.  I feel like I was fortunate enough to have things turned around in a matter of a few years. I know some are still struggling on here, but I hope that everyone finds a point in which they realize that something as small as a car drive for a few minutes is improvement."
Thank you mom and dad (tw: abuse/rape/suicide/self injury),18,lyr2e9,5,"Thank you mom and dad:

For never teaching me to stand on my own

For always telling me I'm going to fail instead of guiding me

For telling me i need to get over my friend's suicide already before the funeral was even held

For telling me it's my fault i was bullied because i ""let it happen""

For sending my brother to live with family and sending me to live with strangers in a cult boarding school when you had to go out of the country for work

Thank you mom:

For sitting by and watching as dad beat the sh*t out of me for going to the bathroom before doing the dishes and telling me i had it coming as i wiped the blood from my nose

For telling me it was my fault i was raped for acting like a whore when all i did was sit in the lap of my first boyfriend whom i had been dating for five months

For standing by while my brother gaslighted me, thus destroying any chance i had to learn to trust

For mispronouncing my name constantly and laughing about it, making me feel compelled to change my name when given the option after dad adopted me after your marriage to him (not my biological father) thus setting me up for a life of fighting for my identity

For telling me i was a bad mother for wanting to cuddle with my son as a baby and sleep in the bed with him while he was a damn infant

Thank you dad:

For punishing me when my brother was beating me up

For punishing me when you caught me trying to kill myself, thus making me want to kill myself more

For catering to my brother who stole cars for fun while treating every mistake i made as a federal offense

For waiting a month to tell me my mom died, the day before my sons birthday, thus othering me from my own family, robbing me if the chance to say goodbye, and making my child's birthday as painful as possible

My dad and i have mended fences, but the damage cannot be undone. I will never have a chance to make things right with my mother.

So thanks for making me the absolute trainwreck i am today because y'all saw fit to judge me instead of trying to understand me."
I feel like just giving up and let my PTSD consume me.,12,lyshbs,9,"(Throwaway account I dont want my family to find this)

Ive been working hard and long on my PTSD and ive gotten a long way from where I was, but right im so close to just throw in the towel. I was re triggered a few months ago and ever since life has been a living hell again, but im always at good spirits working on myself and my triggers, but im tired now.

I work on myself every day, I have dealt with daily panic attacks, horrible sleep, not eating and just feeling numb for the last few months. And I did get to a comfy spot where I started getting in control again I was actually able to think ""well this aint that bad"". But then, my son was involved in an accident that resulted in 2 degree burns, having to hold down my screaming son while they treated him over and over again for 3 days has been absolutly horrible. While I was at the hospital I did not even want to be with him, it was like my mind shut off, I could not look at him because ""that is not my son"" but im a mother and that is my son, so I gave him all the love he needed even though I felt more like his aunt than his mother. 

I would have guessed that now thats hes healed I would be back at my good old ""thats my son I love him more than life"" but no, still I have distanced myself, ive had this problem before that when things get bad I dissociate myself,and I feel like a shit mother because I carried this tiny human for 9 months and have spent every hour with him since but still its him I dissociate from.
And to make things worse, his father who triggers my PTSD severly called me in for mediation, so I have to sit in a chair for 2 hours listening to him. And there is something in his voice that makes me want to crawl up into a hole and die, his body language and voice it seriously triggers me.

And that man has made life a living hell since I was pregnant, he promised me that he would be there but instead he left me and came back to make things hell.
I became a high risk pregnancy due to all the stress he put on me, at 20 weeks pregnant I almost lost my son because of him. And ive tried my very best to meet his demands but he is NEVER satisfied, all I do is wrong,all I say is wrong. I cant even express myself because I never know what he will use against me, the only reason he is going to mediation is to get a piece of paper so he can take me to court and im so afraid that court will give him custody and then my son will have to move away from me and if that happens ill take a cab to the nearest psych ward and admit myself.

Im seriously on my knees kissing this mans shoes trying to satisfy him, im giving him 110 % of me trying to make it all smooth and peaceful, and all im getting in return is anxiety because im seriously hating myself for letting this man stomp on me. I should have known that my PTSD would get to this point but I could not stop it.

Its currently 4 in the morning and this is the first time in 4 years I wake up in panic, I ended taking one of my ""in case of absolutely emergency take this"" pill, I never use medication but today I did.

Yaknow, im just in such a dark place now, I cant find the door that leads me out and I dont know what to do anymore. I just want to be happycakes again, I want to be able to eat and sleep, but right now that seems so far away.

If you read this rant, thank you sorry its messy."
I can’t seem to hold accountability without dissociating,10,lys3md,0,"I guess its generally just being called out I can’t handle. It’s not the fact that I don’t think I can be wrong or any real self-centeredness to it, but more of being blackmailed and threatened over the littles things in my past. If I didn’t do everything absolutly right I would be yelled at, spread misinformation about, and even beat. Being told nicely “oh can you please not do this?” is all I really can handle which is so scummy, people don’t owe me their politness for my wrong doings, and I wanna unlearn such defensive behavior but its so hard. I feel I just can’t see what I’m doing wrong most of the time because I’m always on autopilot mode and once something stops me and tells me that autopilot mode is wrong its... very hard to accept. I zone out and distance myself from others, I have anger issues and extreme anxiety, just loud noises can trigger me. I feel so out of body and in pain, I try so hard to teach myself, to listen to others... but I feel I’m getting no where right now, I do have the drive to be better, its just the acting to change is something I have a hard time doing. I never feel like its enough and I have 2 options to either submit, or completely bite back when neither is a good option."
Feeling weirdly at home after being triggered,10,lyruev,4,"It's similar to how being catastrophically depressed is ""comfortable"". Not in the sense that it's enjoyable or easy to bear, but... familiar. 

I know what to do in that space, how to take care of myself, and the like. And so I settle in and play Sims and avoid triggering material the best I can and just generally be kind to myself. And it's... odd.

I go to sleep and have unpleasant dreams, walk around with unbearable anxiety, both physical and mental, and just generally feel shitty, exhausted, and irritable. But it's familiar. Very familiar. And in that sense, it's almost predictable. Much more than when I haven't been triggered and am resting easy for the time being -- because at any moment, that could change. 

Does anyone else relate to this?"
Question,0,lz24tc,2,"Idk if this is PTSD, upto 12 years old I didn't have any fear of  that's because I was playing out in the street we have a lot of stray dogs in our country so when I saw one I just looked at it and it just randomly growled at me and started chasing me I just ran as fast as I could ,I tripped and fell over on the ground the dog ran away it didn't bite me after that incident I am still scared of stray dogs to this day I am 17 now I used to fear all dogs but with help from my friends I am not afraid of house dogs but strays still scare me.
Can anyone tell me how to solve this."
To respond to Facebook triggers? (Rape & stalking trigger warning),2,lyy0u2,1,"Long-story-short, I was stalked by a guy I dated after I broke up with him because I walked in on him raping one of my best friends while she was unconscious (which brings the number of women who told me the same story about him to 5). He stalked me for 4 years until I finally went to our local police because he posted photos of his assault rifle collection with my name carved into one of them. Our local police had an amazing detective and I haven't heard from him since (even though they could do nothing with my second-hand account of the rapes)  :::knocking on wood anyways because being stalked is TERRIBLE:::

I'm rarely on Facebook these days (that's where he posted the photos and Facebook said that due to ""free speech"" they weren't a violation of their policies) and I've worked really hard to come so far with my treatment, but I just saw a Facebook ""friend's"" post about how ""no one should take anyone's guns away"" and I was going to reply to him, but then figured my response would be better here. Here's what I was going to say...

""It's so interesting to see these posts from someone who hasn't been stalked by a man who has raped 2 of her friends and has half a dozen assault rifles (and her name carved into one of them). 🤔
I guess I should feel comforted that I'm a better shot than him? 😉
Although, (our local law enforcement) obviously disagrees. 😉"" 

...I'm glad I didn't reply on Facebook and engage this obviously-irrational person with my PTSD and I know these flash-back-feelings and their tears will subside, but I needed to put it somewhere. 

I also got a ""friend request"" from one of the mutual friends between me and my stalker and I so badly wanted to say, ""When your request comes withoout an apology while you stay 'friends' with TWO people my ex raped I have NO interest in having contact with you,"" but, obviously, again, this wouldn't do any good against someone who told me I was ""over-reacting"" to the stalking, my stalker was ""harmless,"" and is STILL friends with the guy even though I think our mutual friends have told him the same thing they told me. 

If I didn't need to use Facebook for work I would be off it completely. Maybe I should keep my use only to work?

Can anyone relate? 😭"
EMDR struggles and Self Doubt,3,lyvn3d,0,"I just need to get all of this off my chest somewhere.

I'm having such a hard time in EMDR. I've done three sessions so far and still don't have a safe space in my head. I look back, and there has never been a place I feel safe and it's killing me. I struggle with PTSD related to a suicide of my closest friend a few years back and growing up with autism misdiagnosed as OCD. This is also bundled with severe anxiety and depression/suicidal thoughts daily, even with meds, since I was 5 or 6. All of my happy memories are stained with memories of yelling, fear, and screaming. Even my emotional support animal can trigger horrible fears of her dying and me feeling lost. I constantly feel like everyone I know will abandon or hurt me. I feel so trapped. My EMDR therapist told me I deserve to feel happy and I should love myself and I broke down right then and there. Everyone has said I love you to me, but who really means it? If people knew me, would they really love me? I mean, I'm 18 and already have gone through so much horrible stuff. I just feel so suffocated by my past that I barely can breathe, yet I can't see myself leaving. It's like my brain wants to stay hurting and suffering. Like it doesn't know anything else, and it rather stay with what it knows? I don't know. Does this stuff get better?"
Disconnecting,6,lyt1gx,3,"I’m having trouble staying connected and remembering things. I guess the way I deal with trauma is trying to forgot it immediately. 

The issue right now is that my dog died on the 3rd. As we walked out of the vet’s office, I started to forget. I barely cried. I comforted my partner more in the office. She was crying more than me, and she’s only known the dog a year. I’ve had my dog since she was 8 weeks old, she was nearly 6 when she died. 

I’m finding it hard to cry, and hard to connect to what happened. I really can’t connect to it as “real”. My brain is telling me it didn’t happen, or that it wasn’t real. Or that it didn’t happen to me. 

I’m not really sure how to process this in a healthy way."
Someone had the audacity to just flat out dm me and asked how I was abused without them noticing,24,lygwsh,2,"Hello,

So I was in foster care as a teenager and some terrible things happened to me. For one, I was struggling with anorexia at the time and was sent to a residential treatment facility. At the time, my case worker was completely neglectful and rarely checked on me, and left me totally in the hands of this facility. Long story short, throughout my time at this facility I was drugged, abused, left with vaginal infections, rotting teeth, etc. After awhile I ran away and was brought to a psych hospital, where I told the psychiatrist there everything that happened to me. He deemed me NOT a danger to myself, weaned me off of drugs (I told him I felt high and was being forced to take things), I told him about my vaginal pain, etc. Within 2 weeks I was off of most medications, and eventually reunified home and out of the DCFS system by age 17. 

I am in a facebook group about eating disorder recovery and somebody asked for a review of this particular facility. I told her i had an abusive experience as an adolescent and let her know she could message me if she had any other questions since she is looking at a few facilities for her recovery. 

There is a woman who was in the same treatment center as me at the time (and who was an adult at her time of treatment, therefore separate interaction and only saw each other during mealtimes) and at around midnight sends me a private message saying, ""How were you abused in there as a child? I've been there and wasn't abused."" I let her know that her experience does not invalidate mine, and that just because she didn't witness what happened in private rooms with me being abused, doesn't mean it didn't happen. 

I gave a very brief description and told her I wish to go no further, as it felt like she was implying that since she didn't witness or experience any abuse, that they did not abuse a child. She apologized for coming across as invalidating and aggressive but it was just a really messed up confrontation- as if I owed her my story. I have a diagnosis of PTSD. I have weekly night terrors, I can't open my door/am alarmed by my doorbell. It was just like since they didn't abuse her, how could it have happened to me. It kinda hurt especially considering I've barely ever spoken to the woman."
Saw my abuser at Trader Joe’s,21,lygwwk,6,"I saw him twice actually. I live in a relatively small town so I’m surprised it’s taken me this long to run into him. But I haven’t seen him since elementary school so like 12 years ago. End of December I saw him at the grocery store and it sent me into a spiral. I haven’t been the same since and I’m honestly terrified of leaving my house. I have constant panic attacks and can barely sleep anymore. I left the house for the first time in a long time yesterday and he was sitting at a fucking outdoor restaurant a block from my place. Like what’s my luck honestly. Every part of me says run away from this town but that’s irrational and requires a plan and time. The worst part is I don’t even think he recognizes me. Or remembers me. Like all the years he spent hurting me don’t even exist and he can just live a normal life. 
Should I leave? My brain is telling me to pack up my car and just run."
"First Post,. go easy on me",8,lylko1,5,"I just found this subreddit but I just have to share this with somebody. I just have to let somebody know. I have to.

Disclaimer, I do not plan on hurting myself or committing suicide. I just need to say this stuff.

The worst thing about the whole thing and the worst thing I swear wasn't getting hit or the physical violence. I never even got left a mark on myself. What bothered me the most is that my mother was the kindest nicest person. She was the kindest nicest person. She had been hit as a kid too. She knew how scary it was. And yet she hit me. She hit me and when I asked my siblings they said it never happened to them. It was just me. It was just me. I was such an unbearable kid that I drove my kind and caring mother to violence. That is how I thought of it. It was only me and it was my fault. And it wasn't even that bad, she never broke the skin or left marks and in many people's books that kind of thing is just normal discipline. I even grew up in a suburban household with food on the table and opportunities and education. But it stays with me. It stays with me all these years later. I was a terrible, violent, and awful kid. If it weren't for me, the family would have been so much better off. I don't know if that's true but it's what my brain keeps telling me. I just had to tell this to someone. I don't know if I'm screaming into the void or doing something inappropriate but for now I just gotta tell someone. I have to.

&#x200B;

Edit: I think it's important to mention that I have no PTSD diagnosis. I just need a place to say this. This is the place I found and this event is trauma. idk if that's okay or not. If there's some other place this should go I am sorry. "
Has anyone else experienced a change over time in their triggers/attacks?,3,lyru1b,2,"I'm going to try to keeps things general to avoid anything triggering, but I'm open to explaining more in DMs or comments if need be. Right now I'm in a good place so it's easy for me to be candid about my experiences. I was diagnosed with ptsd several years ago due to a violent physical assault. One of the side-effects of this was that coping mechanisms I had built up over my life to deal with extensive childhood abuse began to crumble. 

When I first started therapy, my strongest triggers were mental. Most often I'd catch myself feeling happy about something simple, like how nice the weekend had been going, and my brain would flip into panic mode. I'd be convinced something terrible was about to happen to me or my family. Part of that stemmed from my recent trauma, but part of it also stemmed from my childhood trauma (feeling like I didn't deserve anything good). 

Over the past year or so, as I've started working more on my childhood trauma, my mind has become more detached from my attacks, and the attacks themselves have become more physical. Things that set me off tend to be more physical as well. Those physical triggers are still a mix of recent and childhood trauma, just like my earlier mental ones were. 

On top of that there are constants like bouts of depression, long-lasting low-level anxiety, and intense nightmares. Not to mention that my brain will occasionally switch things up and toss me a panic attack like I described initially. It's like my brain constantly finds new ways to refuse to heal. So my question is: Has anyone else here gone through something like this? Where your triggers and attacks almost evolve as you go through treatment? Or am I just super lucky?"
I want plastic surgery,9,lyklq6,0,"I won’t turn away advice but the jist of it is this. I absolutely despise my mom and one sister whom I kind of attribute a lot of the past issues to. 

I got crazy the other night and thought it’d be fun to animate old pictures of family with the MyHeritage website and ended up causing a neat catastrophic break down. 

I realized suddenly why I don’t like looking in the mirror. I look just like my mom and sisters. We all look like someone took a cheat sheet to a test and each person just changed one answer each and boom - 4 women that look like we all popped out the same mold. 

So, even though I’m no contact with my sisters and my mom is dead, I see them all the time in reflections. 

This morning, it occurred to me that I could get plastic surgery. Reshape my nose, cheeks, chin and forehead. Now I understand why I’m drawn to tattoos and body modification. I really am surprised I don’t have tattoos on my face to be honest. 

I don’t know if I’ll do this but I just wanted to vent, I guess."
Why do I tend to over share?,98,ly4yjq,52,"Why do I tend to over share very specific details about my trauma and childhood adversities? 

I don’t actually understand why I do this and wonder if others do it too(?), it drives me insane when I realize what I have just said to this person that I either know very well or not at all.

Overwhelmed/Panicked at Work,3,lypl7h,4,"Hi all, basically I need advice on what to do about being overwhelmed at work. 

I previously applied for disability when I was diagnosed about 10 years ago. It was denied because I didn’t have enough work credits (I was in my early 20s). 

Since then, I finished college, and I’ve had two jobs. The first was a very low paying, low effort position that I could do from home, but it wasn’t enough money. It also was considered independent contractor work, so I don’t think that counted for work credits. 

I’ve been at my current job for almost two years - kinda. Due to the pandemic, I’ve been off work for nearly a year. I’ve still had to do some work from home because no one else at my job can do certain things but me (small company). 

During this year, I’ve realized how bad I was doing while I was going to work full time. During the time I worked there, my panic attacks came back with a vegetable and were worse than before. I had several at work. With that being said, I find that I am constantly in a state of stress and anxiety at work. I feel overwhelmed constantly. 

My boss called me today and said we should schedule a time to talk about me returning, and I am absolutely dreading it. I already feel like I’m drowning by the upcoming tasks he’s sent my way. Combine this with some other health concerns I have going on, and I don’t know how much more I can take.

I guess I’m looking for advice on what to do with all of this. I could go back to part time, but I can’t really afford to do that. Money would be tight at best. 

Sorry for the wall of text. Tl;dr I have to work but it’s becoming overwhelming and detrimental to my mental health."
Can ptsd cause anxiety/panic attacks in unrelated situations?,6,lym4kx,3,I don’t have nightmares about my traumatic incident or anything like that but everything that used to make me uncomfortable makes me 10x more uncomfortable after the incident. For example I hated awkward social situations but it was just uncomfortable and now they give me actual panic attacks. Just anything that made me feel uncomfortable is like amplified. And they are totally unrelated to my traumatic incident. Could this be caused by ptsd/traumatic incident or is it unrelated?
DAE write things they know will trigger them,7,lyikr2,3,"Does anyone else write something that they know will trigger them? I love to write but I don't know how to write anything that doesn't come from the perspective of a villain, normally a murderer or abuser. I.E. today I wrote about a man who attacked his girlfriend, who then left him (and has PTSD) and he now is trying to  hurt her for saying no to him. And now I'm like having a huge anxiety attack and I don't know what to do about it. I just can't write anything that's not triggering, and it's really bad for me.

TLDR: cant write anything not triggering and its not good

Repressed memories surfacing - can anybody tell me more?,4,lylsnj,3,"I would like to know more about the nature of repressed memories and how they surface when it comes to trauma.

I endured trauma as a child that I only knew about because my father told me when I was 12, out of spite for my mother. I knew that the trauma he described was significant, but for the life of me I couldn't remember anything about it. 

Now, the trauma he described is starting to come up in my mind more and more. I don't remember the event specifically, but I'm remembering feelings and events around it: for example, last night I remembered my dad and officers taking me on a tour of a police station, and the officers giving me a teddy bear. It clicked then that he was probably doing that to make me feel safe with police again. It feels like my mind is connecting all the dots, suddenly.

This is all very new and upsetting to me and I'm wondering if what I've described is normal for people starting to recall their trauma. The event in question happened when I was four so I don't know if I'll ever fully remember, but I'm hoping for some direction when it comes to what to do when things surface. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and therapist who are helping a lot, but I also just want to find a safe, supportive place to talk about this."
"Today, I realized something very important...",94,ly1s4m,10,"I realized that I can't make everyone love me, no matter how hard I try. No matter how much effort I put in not everyone will care for me. I realized that after standing there, staring at my boyfriend who was too busy playing video games to give me a proper hello after just returned from being hospitalized due to be suicidal. Then, watching him barely talk to me the rest of the day and mumble a ""I love you"" just to appease me. Part of my PTSD comes from being abandoned after being severely abused by a parental figure. So, I always have strived to try and make sure people love and care about me... Yet, today made me realize that I can't."
i love my therapist,38,ly6c13,5,she actually cares about me and is taking extra classes to learn more about things more specific to my situation and it makes me feel happy. i’m so lucky that i ended up in a situation where with such limited options for treatment i ended up with a really good one
Not able to do things I used to have no issue with,2,lynh6g,0,"Has anyone else had this happen? I had to take a hearing test today for work. I've done dozens of these, and never had an issue. But this was the first one since I started having symptoms of PTSD and as soon as the door closed I immediately felt that tightness in my chest and I'm barely holding on here. I've never had an issue with confined spaces before, but this time I just felt trapped even though there was a window right there. I think I'm just as surprised that I had a reaction as I am having a tough time."
Making myself look good,10,lyd9qx,1,"Hello, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I wonder if anyone else does this. 

I make myself look good when I've done something bad. Whenever I'm accused of doing something bad, like being rude or hurtful. I immediately minimize the other person's feelings and try to make myself look better. This is reflexive, almost like I can't stop it. I immediately jump to, ""Oh well it's not that bad, I have (insert excuse)""

This happens with my spouse a lot and he's growing increasingly frustrated and is threatening to kick me out - this isn't the only reason that's a very long story. This seems to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

He's told me I have to process the trauma surrounding this defect I have, or I'm leaving.

Anybody else experience this? I was raised by a narcissistic mother (diagnosed narcissist) and a pretty absent father, so my PTSD stems from childhood trauma. Any advice appreciated."
Do you feel like your brain goes backwards?,2,lyle33,0,"I don't really know how to explain this, but when I'm going through something very stressful, my brain just completely goes back to who I was a few years ago. Like I'll wake up and expect to be met by the same friends I had 5 years ago, with the same interests and the same room and the same classmates. So when I realize things have changed, I'm confused. It feels like I'm stuck in someone else's life, because my brain thinks I'm still me from 5 years ago. When I'm reminded of what my life looks like now, I remember. But otherwise it's like I've completely gone back. Maybe it's a weird way of dissociating, I don't know. Do you relate?"

For the last 6 months that she died my life has honestly been a living hell and up until recently I thought it was just normal grief but I guess not. Anyways I’m still having horrible nightmares about what my mom looked like in the hospital or about her being gone in general and I keep waking up crying as hard as I can and punching my pillow.

Sertraline/Zoloft experiences?,1,lyocl9,5,"Hi, my doctor has prescribed me Sertraline aka Zoloft starting at 50mg moving up to 100. 

I've read the side effects and some studies discreditting ssri's and it's really making me apprehensive about taking it. 

Has anyone been prescribed this and willing to share their experience? Thanks"
How to seek help?,1,lynpyh,3," I suspect that I'm currently dealing with PTSD from a past relationship with my alcoholic ex girlfriend. It has been a year since I've spoken with her and two years since I've seen her, but a day doesn't go by without thinking about our two years together. I have intrusive thoughts, constant anger, and I always feel like something bad is going to happen. I feel as if I'm always waiting for when it's gunna hit the fan, if that makes sense. 

I was suggested by a nurse practitioner during an anxiety fueled doctor visit that I was exhibiting symptoms of PTSD, but was dismissed when I brought it up to another doctor and was told that he is ""not a counselor"". I'll be honest, I was greatly discouraged by this and think it was wrong of him to dismiss my concerns without letting me explain myself. But now I dont even know what to do. 

I'm getting really sick of this and every day is awful to some degree. I can't bring it up to any of my friends because it's become clear to me that they cannot understand what it was like to be in my situation, and also I do not wish to burden them anymore. I feel as if I've embarrassed myself enough. 

I know subs like this do not advocate for giving advice, so I'm not asking for any advice, but it would be helpful to hear some personal stories about how you chose to seek help, or how you found the courage to do so. 

To be clear. I do not claim to have PTSD. I do not want to self diagnose myself, but nothing else seems to make sense and I'm beginning to lose it over here."
My family is emotionally suppressed and I’m entering the part of recovery where I attach emotions to what happened,14,ly5g3e,4,"I just got off the phone with my mom and I cannot stop laughing about the ridiculousness of the conversation. I told her my psych “graduated” me to the next level of working thru my ptsd which meant that I’d have to start feeling whatever emotions are attached to the events that I’ve detached from for years now. Right off the bat, my mom, in all her ignorance, asked me if it was a wise choice to become emotionally regulated when I’m in a family that has multi-generational emotional suppression. I laughed and said yes it is, to which she asked why. I told her by suppressing my emotions, it’s literally killing me. By having that learned behavior throughout my life, it will end up killing me.

I’ve struggled with suicidal attempts in the distant past (pre 2003), and ideation off & on since, as recent as 2016 when she left work to come sit with me in my apartment one night. I also have a severe history of schizo-affective disorder (schizophrenia & bi-polar for me). My family hasn’t really been there for me through much of that short of my mom sitting with me. My brother & his wife are largely hands off with me in the mental health department.

I’m not allowed emotions in my family. I can’t get frustrated or mad, I can’t cry, I can’t be too happy, I can’t be moody, I have to be the equivalent of a robot, emotionally speaking. So with all this ptsd sht going on, it’s been hell going it alone. I’ve called them out for not supporting me once & my SIL ghosted me for 7 months. 

BUT! What I am glad about is that my weird sense of humor is coming back after it being one of many things robbed from me, and as it’s come back, it’s picked up inspiration from this hell and oh boy does my family not find me funny anymore. So I just gotta laugh at my mom clutching her pearls and being personally offended that I would try to break one of the few family traditions we have."
"Diagnosed with ptsd, anxiety, depression recently. Tw (child abuse, verbal, physical.)",2,lyeajo,3,"Hello, I’ve never posted here and just found the reddit for this tbh. I am turning 25 on the 18th this month and it’s pretty hard to fathom. Up until I was 22 I prayed everyday for something or someone to come take me or to not wake up. I had an extremely abusive childhood growing up and extremely high standards. 

Background I am half white/Korean, white dad and Korean mom. Both came from poor backgrounds and one came from a family of alcoholics and smokers and one was third world with outhouses. I was told I was the golden child my entire life cause I just did what they told me to do and I was a robot. I listened because the yelling, the beating, the anxiety and feelings that I’d get would be worse than just obeying. My older sister was the trouble maker who stole from stores and family, chase me with knives, put me in boxes and shove me down stairs, pushed my parents buttons, etc and it would all come back to me for no reason cause my parents couldn’t separate their anger and find something to come after me for. I was always a picky eater I don’t like certain textures they gross me out and I was forced to sit at the table till my plate was cleared. I was left at the table by myself for 3-4 hours until my parents would finally release me as I could not eat it, it isn’t possible to this day with certain things I just cannot do it. Which then just results in being screamed at even more. We would get beat and screamed and the only way it would stop is once we were hyper ventilating, crying and gagging to catch your breathe it would get to that point everytime for things to finally stop.

During an extremely stressful time with their work, my sister had nudes leaked in middle school which resulted in attempted suicide and her chest pumped. Parents are manic and always on edge waiting to snap the house was always like being on egg shells waiting for someone to snap.

I lived on the internet, I had my real friends there, gf’s, and my personality was there and I had to put a mask on everyday in real life. Regardless I would get yelled at if my sister did anything. Things that would happen is beating switches, belts, kitchen utensils, and my dad would always say things like “say that again and I’ll knock your fucken teeth out”, “you guys are such ungrateful spoiled fucken kids”, everything was a comparison, a threat, a beating if you do this or that. Yelling at kids that they should’ve known better in hindsight after making a childish mistake. 

There was standards for school too that we must have all B’s or better or we lost all the rights we had pretty much. Everything was taken away, screamed at, monitored, etc. At this point my parents were making 6 figure income and I was struggling in math and school. I had never studied in life, but I was always able to just do schoolwork until 10th grade. My memory disappeared and I couldn’t remember or focus anymore on anything. I asked for a tutor for help and they told me no. I got a 2.3 and 2.5 gpa sophomore and junior year. Freshman was a 3.9 and senior was a 3.7(cheated and teachers let me and got my gpa up final year. 

I am on my 3rd therapist which is a psychologist with a PhD specializing in EMDR therapy and has been helping a lot to process. I am on my second psychiatrist to help. I suffer now with poor self esteem, suicidal ideation daily, ruminating thoughts for 4+ hours a day, severe GAD, major depressive disorder chronic, and it’s hard to avoid triggers for ptsd. Everyday feels like I’m playing a game of dodging land minds. I feel like I’m sitting on a bench everyday watching or waiting for things to crumble apart. Hope has been something that flickers back and forth sometimes it’s just so hard to imagine there is another side to life feeling one way for.

I just wanted to voice my story I have been struggling to stay “afloat” these days and when I fail or I let myself be consumed I just feel like such a failure. I just want to help others in this world and be a nice person treating others with respect. Yet part of me will snap and just end up breaking, throwing and screaming when I can’t hold it together. My body tenses up so often with muscles feeling locked and to the point of pain. I would wake up the next day sore from the tension. On the road to recovery, but I have such a high level of respect of the people who have made it to the light at the end of the tunnel."
PTSD makes me feel bad for my partner...,77,lxr1ds,8,"Last night I had a trigger after watching something and it messed me up more than I thought it would. Normally, I have a decent grip on my moments but later it came back to bite me.

My partner, bless his heart, did everything he could as I had a panic attack, cried, and dissociated and I felt so bad. I hate making him worry, but I am glad he supports me.

But with my episode I just felt guilty and anxious. I felt so broken. I hate my parents for being horrible and breaking me this way. 

Yes, I know that I need to mother myself and treat myself with care in these moments. It just sucks.

im starting to do some reaserch about the relation between FPS games and levels of PTSD, im trying to assert if there is any truth to the claim that people that play FPS have similar levels of PTSD to vets, i highly doubt it but looking at some of the gory sights of some of the games, it seems that there may be some PTSD in people that play games, if you have any studies please share.

Stuck in a period of daydreaming about memories.,16,lxyxo2,4,"I hate these periods. Not only am I remembering ""bad shit"" but I am completely lost in them. I am both ruminating about how life would be if I acted differently, had avoided different situations or had grown up in a stable environment. I'm also ruminating about the future in relation to these memories. What if me and X have kids at the same time and they go to the same school, so we've gotta do parent meetings together(lol).
Or for some reason Y will spread rumours about the abuse, to make me look like I was asking for it... and everyone will believe him and leave me.

Autistic teenager living with parent with PTSD needs advice on how to get along better.,6,ly4wyw,7,"Hello im 17 and my stepfather has ptsd from mutiple different experiences in his life including but not limited to the military. I do things that im not conscious of that sets him off like for example.

1.Moving my hands in jesters which he interprets/ begins to feel nervous because it looks like im going to strike him. I do that because it helps me talk easier and slower.

2.I make quick motions like ""snatching"" somthing out of their hands which I dont consider as snatching but ill accept that I probably am bit I dont consider how much strength I use. 

3.I ask questions to understand things but he interprets that me questioning his authority when I just feel really uncomfortable doing somthing without understanding why im doing it.

Im fine with learning to improve but he cannot correct me when I do things that setshe him off because they immediately get angry and to stop themselves from lashing out in a way they will regret they just ""let it slide"" but keep thinking about it. They may not ever bring it up again and when they do I completely forgotten that  happened or how I did something even if it was less than a minute ago. So I cannot really learn from it, it just keeps happening over and over and over again. What should I do/encourage him to do for us to get along better if we cannot even communicate in a way that will let me improve."
"I finally said it out loud, for the first time.",13,ly07jl,1,"I had my assessment appointment with a therapist for trauma focused cbt this week. She asked what it was that I was struggling with most. She then brought up things I had said in the first appointment to get on to the waiting list. She didn't press the matter, just asked, and for the first time those words left my mouth in 14 years. 
 Part of me doesn't get why this all still affects me the way it does, it shouldn't still hurt like it does. I shouldn't still panic. I shouldn't be ""malfunctioning "" like this. 

I managed to finally say that I had been in an abusive relationship,  and had been raped when I was 17. How so many things at work bring back the memories because so many more people have been aggressive and angry, and when working in customer service its always directed at the wrong person. Its directed at me. 

The medication I'm on must have truly numbed me to most of the feelings because there wasn't any relief uttering it out loud. There was no weight lifted, no easing in the pain. I don't know what I truly expected but I thought I'd feel something. If anything everything feels crushing now (a few days on) because its out there now. There's no going back to pretending.

Hi. I’m trying to help my wife...,6,ly2guz,13,"My wife has some trauma from 5 years ago that has been creeping into her/our everyday life for a while. She finally hit a breaking point and decided to take FMLA from work and do the trauma work. I support her in this decision and o realize she wasn’t ready until now. So, she applied for leave and was approved and started a PHP program locally. It proved to be really, really hard for her to do the work outpatient due to her trauma response/dissociation. So after three weeks, the insurance recommended a higher level of care and we agreed that it was necessary. We didn’t do any research on places because they told us they would do a single case agreement with our insurance for their residential facility and it would make it easy for her to step back to PHP after. She left a few days later and it was an awful, borderline traumatic, experience. She got to the facility and they took away the phone use they promised before she arrived (we know inpatient/residential facilities are strict on phone use, but we pre-arranged phone access because out 1-year old had a 105.8 fever and because of the single case agreement, my wife couldn’t wait until she was better before leaving). On top of that, we found out they didn’t *do* trauma and couldn’t really do med management because the psych was only on site once a week. The facility had just opened and there was really nothing in place, so it was a giant mess. We decided she should come home and we would find another treatment center. 

This is where we are now - there is nothing available. We’ve spent hours calling therapists, PHPs, inpatient and residential facilities, etc. and everything is a dead end. She doesn’t have a therapist and no one in network is taking new patients. All inpatient/residential want a single case agreement done by a PHP or therapist. The prior PHP won’t allow her to assess, help us, or take her back because she didn’t “successfully complete residential,” and we don’t have $30K to pay for anything out of pocket. 

I’m getting nervous because she only has 7 weeks of FMLA left and is in no place to return to work. She needs to be somewhere ASAP and one minute she knows that and the next she can do it on her own. I feel like I’m walking on egg shells a home and I’m using all of my mental energy to make phone calls, ask around, and support her, but we just keep getting nowhere. 

I’m hoping someone has some ideas, resources, places they received treatment, etc. I realize this post leaves out a lot. I’m trying to keep it relatively short but I’m happy to answer any questions you may have. I appreciate any and all feedback."
How to survive,4,ly55vd,4,"I haven't been diagnosed yet, but am pretty sure I have PTSD/C-PTSD. I'm currently thinking about leaving my husband, due to some problems in our marriage. I'm not sure if I'm emotionally ready for this move. A friend was willing to help with counseling, but really I'm concerned about food and housing. 

What is getting on disability like, and is it possible to afford a clean place in a safe area? I have these crying spells and some emotional trauma, so I don't currently think I can work. Eventually, I'd like to train and get back into graphic design, which is what I'm good at.

s/o video game rage is triggering,5,ly4sgg,4,"Just wanted to rant that my boyfriend's video game rage is a major trigger because he tends to yell, throw things, and hit the things around him. He's definitely gotten better after the 3+ times I've broken down after his rages from my PTSD but I was wondering if anyone else has been in a similar situation? It took a lot to get him to understand how deeply his seemingly inconsequential video game rage would affect me but I definitely had to break down multiple times and threaten to leave (I'm temporarily living with him) if he didn't stop. Have any of you ever had something someone else did that was triggering to you and you had to argue with them to stop? He has had general anger issues in the past (not physically towards any of his ex's or me) and for him, video games are where he can let out anger and frustration and it's a really difficult habit to change. It's not completely fair for him that I feel like he will let that anger out on me when he is raging at FIFA but it's also not fair for me to be hyperfocused whenever he plays in order to know when he loses so I can mentally prepare myself or not be able to breathe when he's punching the couch/table/floor/controller."

New traumatic event how to process,1,lya0u1,1,"Trigger for childhood abuse

My PTSD is probably more likely to be complex due to many traumas. I am on the waiting list for therapy and have had CBT twice and I believe the other type with eye movements when I was a lot younger but the word is escaping atm. 

This weekend my mother outed my sibling to me, then instead of saying ‘please don’t go and speak to him yet he’s not ready’ she aggressively grabbed me, and as I tried to get away she tugged more and wouldn’t let go. I had to take on an anger response in order to get her off me by being the superior person, she doesn’t like confrontation unless she’s the one doing it. I shouted and leaned over her and explained violence is never acceptable in a situation like this, that she is to use her words and not her body to express her concerns.

She let go eventually. My husband was there and said it seemed quite short in terms of time. But he was in front of us as we walked at a distance (the fact she broke distance laws to attack me I’m furious), and he didn’t see the beginning of the struggle. All I did was start to turn around and walk towards the house. I had wanted to say to him hey don’t worry I’m bisexual, I totally support you (because many attacks from my mother were after I came out and I never spoke of it again after childhood until a few years ago. I’m learning to be out of the closet and sharing with some friends and husband and have told my sister but because mum is always there I didn’t know if my brother knew), but if my mother had said that he wasn’t ready then I would have turned back. I can totally see why she would have been defensive, but I also know it was an inappropriate reaction. Like she’s been saying she has anxiety for years but I actually think it’s an anger problem.

As a child she would shove and push and do this pulling and shaking and screaming, and launch attacks for similar non reasons but in her mind they were good reasons. Like having a shower before work when I was a teenager being a severe problem, or eating food when I was hungry, or picking up scraps when she hadn’t cooked me a portion of dinner, trying to stab me when she didn’t like that I was putting leaflets in newspapers after she insisted I do it for a job because I was ‘in her way...’ the worst one is that she attacked me for being in the bathroom when she was pregnant. She smashed my head into the mirror above the toilet and it cracked, hitting me and pushing me around, similar not letting go while screaming hit me. Eventually I had to push her off, carefully to only push her not near the bump in defence so I could lock myself in the bathroom. She did a dramatic ‘I’ve been pushed!!!’ And did an act of moving very far back step by step until she was at the top of the stairs. At first it did seem like I had caused her to lose her balance. But She paused got her balance...then grabbed the stair bannister and called out for my stepdad and said I had attacked her, stood there for a moment, swinging herself back and forth to get the guts to throw herself down and smirking at me. Then she pushed the bannister and smirked at me as she fell down into a pregnant, splayed mess on the floor at the bottom. Crying and saying help me. Stepdad ran up the stairs shouting at me. I said she did it herself but nobody believed me. 

I don’t remember after that. She lost two babies at some point but because I have ptsd I struggle with timing. I don’t know if she lost this baby or it went on to be my sibling. 

This sibling is the one I stay in contact for. She doesn’t allow him to be alone with me. When I arrange to meet him, even though he’s almost 18 she has to be there and he has to ask permission. I would not have contact with her if the situation was different. He has clearly been fed all sorts of information about me but I think after this incident at the weekend he might be realising that I’m not this monster she’s told everyone I am.

After the event this weekend, I closed up. She chased me and after I shut myself in my car and told my husband to drive off, he was just as confused as he hasn’t experienced a parent attacking their child before so he thought he should stay to try and work it out but she tried to  get in the car and I got lost in a flashback. He got in and drove me home. He said she was trying to apologise but it was too late. I cried the entire way home, then all day and evening and had flashbacks in the nights. 

So my question is...I’ve had CBT and all that and recently group therapy to learn how trauma memories happen...and to take care of myself now. But they didn’t teach me how to process new trauma memories. I’m aware there is a 2 week time period before the memory is stored in either the hypothalamus for a normal memory or the amygdala as a trauma memory. 

How can I process this new traumatic event so that it doesn’t become like all the others? I was naive to think that I was past trauma and that it was just work on my past."
Paranoia and guilt,7,ly0qa4,0,"I was verbally, physically, and I believe although my memory is blurred, sexually abused growing up. I bit my tongue and moved out at 18 and since then I have somehow managed to continue to have a relationship with my parents with a lot of distance involved. Every time we come to a point of understanding or they want to do something nice for me, I feel this extreme like, paranoia about what their intentions actually are. I never have trusted their reactions to anything I do but especially since I’ve moved out and they’re no longer a physical threat to me, I feel so anxious and cautious and like I can’t trust them, or even my siblings. This has extended into my friendships and my family friends, like my boyfriends siblings for instance. I love them all very much and I hate that my brain rationalizes everything this way. I feel like everyone has ill motives against me and I feel guilty for thinking that. Has anyone else dealt with this and how do I stop my thoughts from going there?"
Looking for Support and Advice for my Combat Vet husband,2,ly665o,3,"Long story short, my husband is a combat vet (we met in the service so I get some of the issues but not to the same extent by any means). He won’t go to the VA for his PTSD, and I don’t know how to convince him that it would be good for him to. When he first came home, he used to shake me a lot in the night and that was scary, but I know he wasn’t trying to scare me. I have been so patient with all of the issues he has been having because I didn’t make it out of my service period completely unscathed either. He has made a lot of progress, but he still has so much trouble at night. He reaches for my hands while he’s sleeping instead of shaking me so I can say that’s probably the most personally affecting process he has. I just want to be able to support and help him, but I’m not a professional. The little help I can provide isn’t necessarily going to make the changes that help him sleep at night. Any suggestions of places to have him reach out to or reasons that I could get him to talk to the Va would be so helpful. I worry about him a lot."
I have a newfound anxiety after a major PTSD episode [TW below],8,lxxa8c,2,"TW: Drinking / Alcohol






In August of last year I had a MAJOR dissociative episode and subsequent panic attack that landed me in the hospital. I had been drinking that night, though certainly not heavy by any means (just enough for a slight buzz) and a doctor at the hospital thought I might have been drugged (but they lost the sample before testing it so I won’t know). Since then, any time I start to feel even a little bit buzzed from a couple drinks, I start to feel overwhelmed with panic. I feel like “what if I’m about to lose control again?” The episode I had in August caused me to be kicked out of my best friend’s wedding, I lost several friends, and my boyfriend initially wanted to break up with me. I was out of work for a week recovering afterwards. To be completely honest, that experience felt far far worse than what originally caused my PTSD.

This new anxiety makes me feel even worse. I feel like I can’t get drinks with friends or even have a glass of wine with dinner at home with my boyfriend. I feel so scared. Part of me wants to commit to cutting out alcohol but, having never struggled with alcohol, that kind of feels like I’m letting my PTSD “win” over me living my normal life.

I experienced my trauma 5 years ago & I just hate that even now, I’m having to navigate new anxieties, fears, problems, etc because of it.

Losing the battle with constant nightmares,56,lxj6l2,17,"Sorry if this isn't  fully coherent, I was just woken up in the middle of a nightmare, I may be a little out of it. 

I'm 29f, married with a child and have been diagnosed with CPTSD and BPD (borderline), I'm on anti depressant and anti anxiety medications. The only thing they do is limit my anger response , which naturally is a huge issue for me.

The problem is the nightmares. I can't sleep more than 2 hours without having one. Most aren't even about the trauma I went through, just made up situations. I wake up screaming, crying, and drenched in sweat. It used to just be me waking up on my own to go do something around the house to decompress before my family gets up. Recently it's become more common for my internal freakouts to be more vocalized. I now scare my husband most nights by screaming and loudly arguing to the air. 

This one I didn't start to calm down as soon as I woke up as I normally do. He rolled over to comfort me after explaining what I was yelling. I declined because I felt as though someone poured a cup of water on me and I needed to escape. I tell him I'll be ok, go back to sleep, as I walk out holding in my panic attack crying the best I can until I can distance myself from the room.

I'm at a loss on how to handle this. I need sleep, he needs sleep. I can't be waking up everyday in fight or flight. It's  simply getting to be to much and I have no idea what to do :("
Trauma work alternatives to EMDR,3,ly3rf4,2,"Hi everyone, 
Along with my life-long anxiety and after a few bad experiences, some of them with therapists, I'm having a hard time feeling safe around some people. I feel panicked, spiraling, very confused... My issue now is that it's difficult for me to trust therapists, but I really need the help. 
The times I've tried EMDR I benefit from It, but there are not many Emdr therapists in my city rn.

I was wondering if there are techniques for trauma work or nervous system work that I can do to empower myself so I can feel more protected/more clear in triggering spaces, including therapy. I've heard about TRE and somatic experencing. Any other things I can do in group/by myself?

I was not even 7year old. The reason why he beat the shit of me was because I said shut your mouth to one of my neighbor and she went and told my dad. I wanted to kill her after that. I think my father suffer from a mental illness or maybe expert trauma in his childhood himself. Because the things he use to do to me and my siblings were really crazy. He was like this until I was 17 years. Then the beating decrease but the emotional abuse persisted.

I was wondering if anyone had any advice or tips on how to get back to doing the good things for yourself after you've been traumatized. I life with my SO and his family (renting together) until May. If you read my post history, I made a post in the justnomil thread addressing the details of the situation. Anyway, long story short, I witnessed my bf's mom physically beat his younger sibling and it's hard to get that out of my head.... It really scared me and made me uncomfortable and luckily for us, we're moving out soon.

The problem I am having is getting back on top of school after seeing that happen to a child... It was disturbing and it reminded me of my own past abuse I've been through. This is affecting my grades a ton and I don't know how to get back on track.

I'm in my last year / important semester of university and I need to do well. I'm feeling so stuck though, whenever I go to type up an assignment and feel ok again generally, my bf's mom will start more drama/arguments/violent acts.

I'm debating on deferring my term or asking my advisor if I can get extensions for my assignments due to my circumstances.

Any suggestions on how to not let my surroundings impact me this badly so I can get through the term?

Too many preconceived notions about people holding me back,1,ly5seu,0,"So I have a pattern in all my relationships. All my relationships end with someone in the guy's family being to possessive about him and trying to break us up and the guy not standing up for me so I leave or they leave me.

It's usually a possessive sibling and Its become a big red flag for me now. One of my exes sibling called me on the phone and began to yell and ask me to leave the same night.

Another one made his brother take back the ring after he proposed and we were engaged briefly because our customs were different and she wanted a more lavish wedding than our customs usually were..She used to keep texting him when we were dating like calling and checking on him in the middle of dates, during our first few dates. I wish I had taken the exit door then than have to bear seeing my wedding called off because she wasn't happy with our wedding plan. 

Its very disorienting because initially I'd try to be friendly and courteous and they ll be nice since they know I'm dating their brother and when they suddenly change or make demands, I usually say my point of view and also hope the guy will speak up for me. If he stays silent, I begin to reconsider being in that relationship.

Another ex guy s sister would keep trying to tell me she is hanging out with him more now coz later he would be too busy with me.

When ever im talking to someone new and they bring up their sibling, I'm too scared now. Its ridiculous coz almost everyone has a sibling. And I'm stuck in this infinite loop of collecting red flags.

While I'm aware of how my fears are based on a small population,  these were traumatic events in my life because almost every break up I had involved a sibling- their they caused it or my ex made the sister call me and tell me its over..or something of that nature.

I almost begin to cry when i see there is another one in the picture . My therapist is aware of this but I'm not sure if I can overcome this. It's become inbuilt in my head now to avoid the remote possibility of this trauma ever again.

New roommate is triggering me and I don’t know what to do,15,lxc09k,9,"Using a throwaway and hope this is a good sub for this
EDIT: the part specific to PTSD is at the bottom


My girlfriend’s best friend moved in with us 2 and a half months ago, and it’s started to make me uncomfortable. We are both gay, and he’s a straight male. He moved into our finished basement after his girlfriend broke up with him and he had to move out of their apartment. I’ve outlined how he makes me uncomfortable below, but I would also like to add that my girlfriend believes he may be on the spectrum. Apparently he’s talked to her about this and has wanted to get a diagnosis for awhile but is scared. It would definitely turn this from one type of situation to the other, but wouldn’t change the core issues. 

* Sexually inappropriate comments and behaviors: He’s asked how tight I am, and has made a lot of inappropriate references to previous sex work I used to do as well as previous sexual partners. My girlfriend talked to him about the first comment but doesn’t see a problem with the references to sex work and my sex life because her and I are able to joke about it, and because I willingly told him about it. I don’t feel like that’s fair. I told him because I thought I could trust him to handle the information appropriately, while it was relevant to a conversation we were having. It’s different for my partner to reference it vs one of her friends that I’m not in a sexual relationship with. I didn’t tell him to hear jokes about it all the time. I regret being open with him. I have told him that I don't like it when he talks about those things, but I get the classic "" it's just a joke jeez haha"" response and it continues.
* Has tried to initiate a sexual relationship with me: When my girlfriend and I first started dating, I tried to be a friend to him as well. He asked if I wanted to come over and watch Queer Eye with him one day, and I said sure. I mean, it’s Queer Eye and I’m a lesbian that’s dating his best friend. I wasn’t worried. He didn’t make explicit advances on me but kept scooting closer to me on the couch and asked a lot of personal questions during the two or so hours I was there. I did feel uncomfortable. I found out a month later from my girlfriend that (for some reason) he had actually told her that he was hoping something would happen between us during that day. He said he had condoms with him “just in case”. She was so upset with him, but they are somehow still friends. He has actually done this a few times before without me knowing his motive, and has told my girlfriend about his intentions a few weeks after we hang out. I do not feel comfortable being alone with him for this reason, although she assures me that he’s harmless and I just have to say no if he tries something. I was sexually assaulted by a guy I thought was a friend, and the thought of having to possibly be back in that situation makes me feel so sick. It’s a horrible breach of trust. 
* Makes insensitive comments: This could be just because he’s a typical clueless dude, but he can be very insensitive and thoughtless with the things he says. My girlfriend and I both have struggled with addiction and sexual abuse, which she discusses openly with him. This is not something I would forget about a person, especially my best friend and even their partner, but he seems to. He very often comments on world events, local news, memes, or videos to us, and sometimes comments on things that involve drug addiction or sexual abuse and assault. He usually speaks to us like he’s talking to some random friend and not people who have experienced these things. He victim-blames, he’s derogatory, ignorant. It puts me in a very defensive position and upsets my girlfriend. One of us will usually tell him that he needs to either stop talking or change his stance. We remind him of our past experiences every time. It’s so irritating to have conversations like this in my own home.
* Weird behavior: If he comes into a common area room that you’re in, he’ll stand in the archway and wait for you to acknowledge him before coming all the way in. This is only mildly annoying, but it can be startling if I’m wearing headphones, or not paying attention, and suddenly become aware that he’s staring at me. He will stand there for several minutes. It’s just uncomfortable and is making me paranoid all the time that he’s staring at me. I’m sure he’s trying to be polite, but I hate it, and both me and my girlfriend have told him to stop. 

He is not a bad roommate per say. He’s polite to me, outside of these situations, he cleans up after himself relatively well, is respectful of our belongings, he pays rent on time. He stays in the basement or is at work 80% of the time honestly. But having him in the house has started to trigger a lot of anxiety for me. I’m not comfortable with houseguests in the first place-my home is my safe space and my sanctuary- but I have honestly made an effort to put this bias aside and be okay with him being here. But...the things mentioned above are making it harder as time passes.

I don’t know if this is normal, but I feel like he’s triggering flashbacks of the sexual abuse I experienced. He doesn’t resemble anyone, but I think because he makes me feel sexually uncomfortable it’s mimicking the feelings I experienced previously and putting me back into the mindset. I really don’t know what to do. I can’t tell my girlfriend to kick him out. He has nowhere to go. She also probably would not be willing to, as she doesn’t feel affected by his behavior. This is a cycle for them that repeats all the time. He is inappropriate or upsets her, then he either apologizes and she moves on, or she just chooses to forgive him. I think they have a very codependent friendship. He’s also told her he thinks I’m controlling and manipulative, so I don’t think it would go well for me to tell her that I don’t want him to live here, and prove him right. I honestly wonder if I *am* being controlling or manipulative by having this response to him being here. What if I'm exacerbating these personal issues so they seem worse than they are, because I want my girlfriend all to myself without her friend around? Without realizing it?  😬 

If his issue is being on the spectrum and not being able to regulate his thinking the same way as us, it would definitely make me feel guilty for shaming him over the way his brain works, but at the same time, these are things that would be inappropriate regardless of that.

I just need to know what to do to help myself. I spend most of the time in our bedroom when he’s home, or will eventually go in there if I’m somewhere else and he walks in. His physical presence feels overwhelmingly visceral and intrusive to me. It’s hard to make eye contact with him as well. I don’t like going into the kitchen and seeing his food because that also somehow triggers anxiety and bad feelings for me. So I have not been eating as much. 

I know my reactions to him being here isn’t all his fault- I’m responding to trauma triggers- so I really do try not to make him feel unwelcome or uncomfortable. It would also hurt my girlfriend if I started being cold to him when he’s not really doing anything outwardly upsetting. She is very attached to him, and gets defensive about him. He’s staying indefinitely because my girlfriend loves that he’s here, but I can’t continue like this. Please be compassionate in your responses. I have no one else to talk to about this."
They all said it was my fault,11,lxb6f5,4,"TW: Victim blaming, rape, sexual, emotional, and physical abuse, suicide encouragement
I hope this is the right sub for this, sorry if it isn’t 


She convinced them all that I was the abuser, not her. I almost got in trouble a lot. The counselors at the camp weren’t very aware or caring tho, so nothing happened to me. Whenever I tried to tell them they’d get mad at me, tell me to “shut the **** up” “You’re such a liar” “Ugh what a b****” and stuff. They hated me, told me “go ahead and kill yourself” “Everyone would be so much happier if you didn’t exist” they al thought I was trash. They hurt me too, sometimes she got them into triggering me too (from previous trauma/ptsd). They said I was being overdramatized, “stop faking it”, and stuff. When I tried to tell them about how she raped and touched me they wouldn’t believe me, and even if they did they didn’t react well. I remember being told “Are you serious?! First you accuse her of abuse, now this?! You monster.” “She did that?? Good for her, you had it coming, b****” “Stop lying girls can’t rape girls” “Didn’t you mention orgasming in response?? You must’ve wanted it then, you’re being so ridiculous”. I tried to show them the bruises and cuts I got from her hitting me, or giving examples of what she said to me that hit my feelings, and they’d think I was making it up, that the scars were fake, or that I did it to myself for “proof”. My boyfriend’s the first person to react nicely to it, and I’m still kinda waiting for him to suddenly hate me for it. I was able to convince one person. One person. I thought I would finally get away, it’d finally be okay, I would be safe. Then I watched her get convinced I was lying by her again. Every time I tried to tell her she’d do one of her “punishments”. Raping me, beating me up, choking me, making me watch her beat up the othe girl she abused with me until she was unconscious and even past then, triggering me, cutting me.. At some point I realized they’d never believe me and it’d cause me less pain to just shut up. I still kinda feel like they’re right and I did deserve it, and that I am being over dramatic. But maybe deep down I know I’m not, since I put victim blaming in the TW. My boyfriend says that it’s not and she lied to me, but I’m stil so confused. She continuously gaslighted me into thinking that it was my fault and I made her do it, that I wanted it, etc. etc. I don’t really know anymore

Working through my sexual trauma alone,5,lxf2y3,0,"TW: SA
I can’t afford therapy or medication although those are both things I have done in the past and went into debt from. I am reading “the body keeps the score” and while reading am trying to work through some of the shit that’s happened to me. I am taking a year off of college because my ptsd was so bad last year that I failed all my classes I’m supposed to go back in the fall but I don’t know if I’ll be able to handle it. My family doesn’t know what has happened and they have caused some early childhood trauma. I know if I tell them how bad I’m struggling I won’t get support I’ll get judgement. My boyfriend is the only one there for me with everything I’m dealing with but I find it extremely difficult to vocalize what I’m feeling when I’m feeling it and then after I’m feeling it I feel stupid for feeling it. I’ve been having worse panic and out of body feelings lately. Also while reading the book I’m starting to worry that my childhood was worse than I actually recall I feel like I’m remembering more everyday. I feel like my thoughts and memories are collapsing on me. I was assaulted twice in my life however the first time was multiple times just by the same person which I’m realizing now may have done more damage than I thought and then the second one happened and I feel like it invalidated the first one. I’m trying to quit smoking weed because I’m using it to cope with all of this but without it I’m left to face everything head on. I’m feeling very confused about my past very hurt and very scared. I’m finding it difficult to to go to work and see friends and then with going back to school hanging over my head I don’t know how I’ll juggle it all. I know I need professional help but I’m also on my families insurance and not only do they not know about my trauma but they also do not approve of mental help. They don’t believe it is a real problem you can have. I’m lost. I’m trying to put myself back together piece by piece but I feel like I’m breaking the more I try to help myself. I don’t know what to do. I don’t even know why I made this post I guess I just needed to vent last time I posted in here people in the comments told me to get professional help but as I said that’s not an option at this time so please don’t suggest that it just makes me sad:/"
Need advice for my first date in awhile,10,lxbd3h,3,"Currently on an SSRI that’s clicking well with me, working with a psychologist on my PTSD, doing well and being consistent at work, and overall feeling positive!

So, I (female 23) said yes to a date this weekend with a guy (male 24) I’ve known for years and trust. My friends and parents know him well and also trust him.

I’m really nervous because– I won’t go into details– my trauma comes from a r*pe two years ago and an abusive partner that the police had to get involved with.

Does anyone have any advice or their own stories from going on a date after a long time due to trauma? I don’t know if maybe I should cancel if I’m this nervous about it.

Thanks."
Perceptions,9,lxarlg,5,"I once was a bubbly, socially adept person. The morale booster at times. For over a decade now it seems things have flipped entirely and I've had one terrible encounter after another with people. I feel like I'm a bad person and have no self esteem anymore. I don't really speak or bother anyone, yet have been targeted over and over by shady types and looked at as a criminal by normal people.

Has anyone else introverted with PTSD experienced a drastic change in the way others treat you and view you while just trying to exist and cope with reality?"

I might have found the name for what I have.,2,lxgzvv,0,can someone please message me and ask some questions to maybe have a clue if I have it or not. I am 100% comfortable with questions about my trauma and would like to start the conversation with the trauma that started my (potential) PTSD
Sexual assault memory and realizing it might mean something other than what I thought it did (perspectives wanted)(*trigger warning*),12,lx7u4i,6,"I was sexually assaulted many, many years ago. There is this one aspect of this horrible experience that I didn’t understand much until recently (when I had a full-on very upsetting flashback). Now I wonder if it actually means something else. I want to understand it, as in the real life version not my feelings around it. It helps me process it. I’m trying to understand intention,  etc.

If two guys (18 and possibly 18-21) took two girls to an apartment  after a grad party and it was empty (thought they were giving us a ride home, but vaguely recall them saying just have to go inside for a minute). I remember not wanting to go in, and then thinking what is this place. (no furniture) ... would it seem more likely it was the older person’s apartment or that the older kids’ parents managed the apt building and was able to go in? Do young broke folk often have zero furniture (stark empty)  but a mat on the floor no blankets, nothing?  As in empty apt, smelled like cigarette smoke, and one small mat on the ground

-First guy assaulted me when I went to bathroom.  I said full on NO, tried to say everything in between repeated nos. I have boyfriend, have period, no, want to go home, and also repeatedly saying Stop!  Don’t! Stop please.. Was blocked into a bathroom , not sure what was happening to other girl by other guy...it hurt, and it hurt a lot , rough and remember getting on floor and finding my underwear I think, person left and shut door , something about the other person. I think they were trying to trade. Ugh. I was trying to get my underwear on, but I remember being really upset and not being able to think clearly...then I’ve blocked whatever out.

-what would cause someone to want to put someone in a bathtub naked in the dark/(maybe light from open door?) and then rinse them off, their parts, like making sure water is swished on their vulva etc. This was the second, older guy.. I block out what happened prior.  I have no memory of how got in it, just panic feeling of can’t get out, where are my clothes, what is this person doing,  someone near me in dark rinsing my legs, parts etc.  I hate saying this. I thought it was because maybe I was dirty. I always felt dirty after this. Never felt clean again. Disgusted with my body and my self.

There is a lot more detail that I’m leaving out. I’m not at a point to be able to deal with everything as a whole. I’m breaking it up into smaller increments with the connections and questions that are coming up. 

I’m in the process of starting therapy for this as it’s affected my life greatly. Every relationship. Every sexual encounter. My identity. My stress-response. Panic attacks. Depression. Feeling out of control... Feeling to blame. Feeling ashamed. Feeling like I want to be invisible and no one ever to notice anything about me. 

I refused to think of this for years. I blamed myself. I got scared of men,  I don’t  trust people. I still cry a lot. I wake up scared. My life is one big long run-on day.

All these questions I had about why were we taken to an empty apartment in a crappy building? Why did that person put me in the bathtub and wash me all off...I was so embarrassed to ever tell anyone about this part...

I’d like to know if it’s a sexual thing that people do, or like what just popped into my head today (was this person aware of what they were doing, and washing on purpose)? I always assumed it was not a calculated thing, it was a spontaneous “accident” that occurred.  However, I am suddenly thinking it was much more calculated than I realize.

Sorry for any triggers and I appreciate your perspective on it."
The After Shock,3,lxctnk,0,"It happened so many years ago and for some reason my body hasn’t realized it yet. I’m ok I’m in a fine place (not good not bad, just fine). 

Let me set the scene.... 

I’m 20 years old, I’m in school and I no longer have to
deal with what I dealt with as a child. Despite the fact that I am somewhat free of that world, my body protects as if I’m still in that small purple bedroom on the second floor. 

A minor inconvenience and my body will shut down I’ll lose all human feeling and drift into the unknown for an unknown amount of time for an unknown reason.  There is no snapping out of it because there was nothing to snap into. On the flip side, the same could happen but instead of drifting away I will fall into a manic spiral of rage. “Everybody is against you”, my brain will say. The closest to me will feel the wrath of my brain forcing itself to protect me, but I didn’t ask. I am alone now because of my brain, it protected too well, but can it protect me from myself? 

Will it ever stop? 
Will I ever be normal again? 
Will the protective barrier in my brain let it’s guard down? 

I guess only time will tell... but how much time do I have left?"
You're not hopeless,39,lwwanv,4,"I want everyone here to understand that no matter what they are going through, you are okay. You are strong no matter what the physical or mental affects are from. You survived and you keep going. Don't let the past take over your present or future. 

It may be difficult at times but you are resilient. You wake up everyday and you do everything you can to the best of your abilities. You deal with what most people can't even imagine. Take a moment to appreciate how far you've come, it doesn't matter if it's a little progress, you've made progress! You might not even recognize that you've made progress but understand that you have. Remember to love yourself and take care of yourself because you are not the reason for your traumatic experience. I believe in you to recognize your distorted thoughts and see yourself as you truly should. It might take time to do so, it might take some work with a therapist or some inner-self work. No matter how you get there you can do it because you are resilient. You are not hopeless. You are not anything to be ashamed of. You are only human. 

Be kind to yourself as you are to others. You recognize them as people with feelings, do so for yourself as well. You are not different, you don't deserve whatever your distorted thoughts make you believe you deserve. You experience emotions and that's okay. It's okay to feel those emotions and they can feel intense but try to remember that they are temporary. I believe that you can see those emotions bubble up and understand it's only human to feel those emotions. I know you can recognize them as scary, but you can get through it. Because you are strong. 

No matter what you're going through and no matter what others say, I believe in you. You might underestimate yourself at the moment, but if you really decide to try and pick yourself up over and over again until you can overcome anything. It's okay to look back on that traumatic event, it's okay to feel those emotions, but keep your head in the present. Lingering too long in the past gives depressive feelings and too long into the future holds anxiety. Breath and focus on the tasks at hand. And I know you can do it. You've already come so far. You're strong. You're resilient. You're human.

Edit: I'm so glad this helped at least some people, I wasn't looking for awards but thank you anyways. If anyone ever needs to talk my DMs are open ❤️"
My Parent(s) abused me and don’t regret it,10,lx542g,3,"(TRIGGER WARNING) 

My parents abused my as a kid. And well it wasn’t usually physical or directed towards me but still it’s screwed up to have a parent abuse you, then 10 years later still standing by the abuse with confidence saying stuff like: “you needed to learn a lesson”. Really fucked me up. Now I am a grown “adult” about to graduate(try too) only left with a head full of hate to surround myself with during the day and intense vivid nightmares to look forward to at night. 

I want to have parents again. It’s hard growing up without real ones especially now."
I am so confused ... should I ask my doctor if I have ptsd?,4,lx9hai,1,"I might have ptsd. Or at least reisidual symptoms from an unresolved trauma. I don’t know what to do. at 19 I was date raped by a guy I casually knew. I don’t know for sure and I never will, but I suspect there were date Rape drugs involved. I was a virgin at the time, and I had never even had a real boyfriend yet. I was too scared/ ashamed to tell anyone or report it. I naively thought i could treat it as if it was not a big deal. I even still liked this guy for a while and wanted him to like me ... somehow I thought that would make a difference in what happened. I rationalized and used all kinds of cognitive distortions to avoid accepting the truth of it. I even saw him  and slept with him again ( I actually thought oh well I’m not a virgin anymore so at least I can have fun without worrying about how my first time happens). The second time I slept with him, he didn’t stop when my head was bumping on the wall, and he started without any foreplay or without even asking if it was okay... he didn’t use protection or even pull out. I was so naive and stupid to not speak up for myself and I’m ashamed of that. I guess my self esteem was that bad. 

But after that I started to develop pretty bad depression and anxiety. I dropped out of uni, then enrolled in a college program and panicked and quit 2 days in. I went to community college because my parents insisted that I do something and I almost quit that too. I quit taekwondo which I loved before. I thought about the experience a lot and it made me upset and depressed. I became detached from people that were close to me. I felt afraid going out to places with friends. I refused to meet new people. I started to over eat, and I put on 45 lbs in a year and a half, developed PCOS...I got panic and dread and nausea a lot and I threw up stuff that I ate on purpose because it somehow calmed me even though I knew it was disgusting. 

I worked at a job that I hated and where my boss was abusive towards all the staff and made me cry frequently. I stayed there 10 years because I had no drive anymore. I put on more weight. I lost touch with many friends, and had a lot of trouble making any new ones. There were years that I drank way too much. I avoided dating for a really long time and the ones I did go on made me feel worse. I got confused about my sexuality and thought I was asexual. I felt like I wanted to go back to school to finish my degree but it took me 9 years to decide to go back.

I’m doing better, I have a boyfriend, and a better job, and I’m almost done school. But I’m still overweight and it really hurts me... I want to go back to the way I was before any of this happened. I want to feel pretty again. But it’s so hard ... and not only because it’s hard to lose weight, and because of the pcos. But also because every time I try to make an effort and confront the weight issue with exercise and healthy eating - I struggle with a lot of the feelings that come up when I’m doing it and sooner or later I give up. I feel maybe I still get triggered all these years later. It’s so much to face .... 

I never got diagnosed with ptsd. I’ve always had depression and anxiety since I was 15. I thought the trauma just made it worse. My doctor has been treating me for depression so long... I officially have major depressive disorder. I’ve mentioned that I was sexually assaulted in conversation during visits about other things, but I’ve never focused on that topic with my doctor in one visit. I never got diagnosed with any ptsd and I don’t know if I meet the criteria. I’m very scared. 

Should I ask my doctor. Would it even make any difference ?"
Dissociating at dangerous times,8,lx4gxi,2,Idk if this is from ptsd but I don’t know where to look anymore. Something bad happened and I forgot about it after a few years. Recently the person who did it sent me a friend request and after that I started experiencing weird feelings. Like emotional flashbacks and sudden feelings of extreme sadness. Worst of all Yesterday I dissociated while driving. I could feel it happening but I couldn’t pull myself out. It’s never happens to me before and it was very scary. Now I’m scared to drive and I don’t know how to tell my husband without him thinking I’m crazy.
Just need to put this into words.,1,lxfzot,1,"In May of 2020 I was in a car accident, it was bad, very bad. The highway patrol was certain they were going to see a corpse in my vehicle, that level of bad. But I survived with a few broken bones. Including several pelvic fractures, but I was walking within a week.

The first week after the wreck was awful. Nightmares, shaking, random crying spells and even the urge to take my own life. (That urge was beaten back and has never reared itself since, if I start to feel off, I call my therapist. Even if it's 2am on a Sunday.)

I slowly worked my way back mentally, I can even travel through that intersection without my heart rate spiking. Made a lot of progress. But sometimes it rears it's head. Two days ago I was so overwhelmed with flashbacks I had to pull over and was late for work. I've had trouble sleeping, every time I close my eyes I just see the grill of that truck in my drivers window again. I've talked to my therapist, but it isn't helping. Tried talking to my S.O. about it, but she isn't able to help either. It's 3:20am and I'm standing in the bathroom, fighting back tears while I write this.

I just want it to stop, I want my life back. PTSD, you can't have control, I refuse. I'm gonna charlie mike, fuck you PTSD, you won't win.

Recently diagnosed,1,lxdcp0,1,"I just wanted to share a little bit of my story. Not going to go into great detail. But I spent most of 2020 physically ill every single day. Upon waking. I went to so many doctors and ended up in the emergency room two times for digestive issues that were causing all sorts of bathroom problems. A lot of people aren’t really aware the effects it can have on your digestive system, pumping a surplus of chemicals through your stomach that shouldn’t be there cause those feelings of constant sickness. And it’s biology, caused by mentality. I couldn’t believe how simple the answer was in the end. After changing my diet completely and exercising regularly now and seeing so many doctors the problem was caused by PTSD.

If you ever feel like you have this disorder please get help. It’s very easy to with covid. There are all kinds of teledocs all over the country that will help. The woman I spoke with was super gentle.

Badly triggered after long term PTSD from rape,33,lwqoss,4,"I've had PTSD for around 7 years now due to being violently raped at knifepoint by multiple people and tortured. I have managed it well (I think). However I was in work the other week and a male coworker expressed an interest in me. When I rejected him, he came into the room I was taking my break in, locked the door behind him, and continually harassed me for a kiss all day. When I continued to reject him he walked over and kissed me regardless while I shielded my face. This coworker was someone I considered a friend, and someone I trusted.

Words that make you feel things (with story),3,lx4ln8,0,"I some super weird ones, but the weirdest, I think, is the word *Metformin*. I'm in medical school and a healthcare worker, so obviously I hear/see/talk about this word often since it's a very common medication for the treatment of diabetes. 

I just want to preface by saying the gun doesn't go off and I still don't completely know how a gun works. I think I blocked as much of that memory as I could.

When I was 15, my dad had a very bad reaction to it and it caused him to have a complete and very scarring psychotic break. He has some severe mental illness, so I'm sure they really played into it. It all started when I asked him how to use one of his guns. He started by showing me how to load it and unload it. When he got to the part where he was showing how to load it, he was explaining how to use the safety and disengage the gun if prepped to fire. He was pulling back the little hammer thingy at the end and it slipped out of his fingers. When the gun didn't go off he just started freaking out and talking nonsense and calling me my mom's name. (He later told me that all he could think about was what would have happened if he accidentally shot me and he just went off the deep end.) I went and told my sisters what happened and what was going on, and then I called my mom and an ambulance. The story goes on from there for a span of two week, with my mom, sisters and I sleeping on the floor of a church because my dad was too dangerous to be around. He finally got forced to go to a psych hospital and we were able to go home to a very trashed house amd try to get what ""normal"" we could back.

During this time, my mom put a lot of pressure on me to take care of my sisters and help her with some very serious stuff. I'm still working through flashbacks and severe reactions to weird things, like completely normal people not making sense when they're talking, even though I know it's just them trying to describe something or whatever so I can understand.

And that's why the word *Metformin* sometimes makes me want to puke."

My biggest fear is that I'll be misdiagnosed, or worse yet, be told there's nothing wrong with me. I can't count the number of times I've fled situations to the ER just to have them hook up a bunch of wires and afterwards tell me there's nothing wrong. 

It's so hard sometimes to articulate the terrors and what brings them on - as well as the guilt and shame afterwards. It's as if our language has avoided giving certain feelings and experiences any terminology in an attempt to brush it under the rug.

Anyway, thanks for reading - I hope you all stay safe and keep the demons at bay.

"Please someone tell me they have found a romantic partner that is understanding. As I sit here feeling like a crazy person, at the end of another relationship, and feel like I'm a female in her 30s who has no hope. There has to be someone who gets it, I want to believe that at least.",25,lwoaa8,19,"I'm so upset with myself for being triggered tonight and having a panic attack. But I feel infinitely worse that my partner wouldnt call me - when I was worried he was hurt as he didnt do a check-in when coming out of a mountain trip, he read my texts but wouldn't call me back. And he flatly apologized eventually and said it was all good on his end, yet was frustrated with me. He said he didn't want me to put my worries on him - that he can't have that on his mind. That he is always fine and nothing will happen and I need to trust him. Except he won't hear me that it has nothing to do with trust. And he was in the same mountainous area where my other friend died. So I'm extra wary. And he doesnt get it - and makes me feel crazy for worrying. We are falling apart as a couple I know. But will anyone ever get it? I don't know anymore"
I feel guilty for having a childhood trauma that other people where able to get over in 2 weeks as a child.,4,lwzw1k,1,If I where to talk about it here I would get downvoted and would be accused of downplaying more important traumas. I wonder if my Autism makes me more prone to small things making me traumatized.
Just joined,2,lx4f53,0,"Hello, I have had ptsd most of my life. I was molested before the age of 5, come from an abusive home and have been raped 2 times in my teens years. I have no memories of the one time being raped and have mostly gotten over being abused/molested but it still has effects on me. The last time I got raped still really bothers me though because I got my friend raped too. I have flash backs to it as I'm calling asleep all the time and worry about having stds because he gave me one. If someone wakes me up or comes in the room while I'm sleeping I will wake up with my fist raised to them. I even did this to my 5 year old sister, I have never hurt anyone though. I will cry out in my sleep to the point of waking myself up. I am doing councilling for years but cannot get over it"
Should I expect better support from my autistic husband?,4,lww9zc,1,"I don't know what level of support I should expect from my husband. He is Autistic and I know that each person with autism is unique but I seem to have lost perspective on what sort of reasonable support I should expect from him as a reasonable person.

It mostly comes down to the issue I have with having a stress response to his anger. I understand why he struggles with anger, but he seems to think that my reactions to it are my problem.

An example situation:

I was on all fours on the bed to get to the other side since it is against the wall. He had left a pile of washing on the bed and left the game he was playing with friends to move it for me. Unfortunately he was very angry at the game at that moment and when he entered the room it was very abruptly. He threw the clothes onto the floor and the combination left me completely triggered and close to panic. I said stop, yet he threw one more item. I just snapped and screamed ""I SAID STOP"". He just stared at me and slammed the door behind him.

I feel ashamed at my reaction but also proud that I tried to set a boundary. I wish I didn't react that way... It always ruins the day. I have to be up for class in 6 hours and I don't know if I'll be able to sleep after that.

I just don't know whether I should feel like he's not doing enough to support me within our relationship when he just stays angry after that sort of thing and leaves me alone without checking on me... Am I using his autism as an excuse for his behaviour? Should I expect better?

ETA: for any issue I have apart from him, he is a wonderfully caring man. And the weird part to me is that I heard him apologise for yelling at his friend after the incident... And tell him that he's ""sleeping on the couch cos I got angry at video games"". I guess he just doesn't understand or remember that we said that the bedroom was meant to be my safe space."
Does anyone else have trouble communicating?,11,lwpo60,7,"I struggle with c-ptsd and one thing I've noticed about myself that has changed is my ability to speak and explain things as they are in thought. I don't know if that was a direct result from events, or if it came from the anxiety itself that it came from. It's so frustrating my sentences don't come out correctly. Has anyone else experienced an effect like this?"
"Why people blame you, and not your abuser",6,lwss6p,1,"TW: mention of bitch ass people, unfairness and I mention slightly what one of my trauma's are (but I'm not going into any detail)

There is a psychological thing called ""blaming the victim"". Short explanation: people can't handle the fact that other people can do such cruel things. So its easier to blame the victim. And if it's not the victims fault, that means it can happen to anyone, even themselves/the people they care about. So instead of accepting that this is a possible danger for anyone, it's easier to put the blame and responsibility on the victim. 


It's a coping and protection mechanism, which often happens subconsciously. To protect the mind, because some people might not able to handle the truth mentally. 


Not saying its permanent, you can change this. But that is not that easily done.


But that is all I know since I dropped out of my psychological study. So if you want to know more, I'm afraid you have to Google it or something haha.


This knowledge is what keeps me from going insane. I live in a small town and for some reason everyone found out about my r@p€. Me and my family went though a lot of comments about how it's all a lie or how I deserved it. A girl went to my 14 y/o sister to tell her that what happened to me was hilarious. I just need to remind myself that these people don't get it, because they can't. They're fucking shit and I hate them. But it's because they have a problem, and it had nothing to do with me. So I should not punch the 14 year old bitch. Its her problem, not mine.


I hope this knowledge gives you the peace it gives me. 



TLDR: if its not your fault, that means that the world is too scary for them to handle. Also that means that some people are just really THAT bad, which means your abuse/trauma could happen to them or their loved ones too. Blaming you or choosing the side of your abuser is their way of them (subconsciously) protecting themselves."
Sick of people not taking you seriously because you were “lucky”,23,lwk37t,8,Yeah I didn’t die so I was “lucky”. So I should be thankful and not be panicking and it’s not a big deal apparently

"Mindfulness, Meditation & Trauma",4,lwpxbt,2,"Hi everyone, 

Meditation and mindfulness has for me been a huge help for my ptsd/healing from trauma as well as being (in the beginning) a big trigger. Sitting still with your thoughts when you have ptsd can trigger even more and make you uncover pain you didn't know you had. However, it is often also recommended as a coping strategy. I did some research in my journey and I just wanted to share the resources I found that helped me a lot and share other resources and experiences with other ones going through similar processes. I feel still very alone in my experience and I thought this would be nice as well as able to help others.

- This is a mindfulness teacher who focusses on mindfulness and trauma. He has both a book, free webinars and a podcast. He does podcasts often and with other people focussed on this topic: https://davidtreleaven.com/

- Joseph Goldstein on working with fear (less focussed on trauma): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azakYcmJ_5c 

I am really curious if this is something other people have experiences with and if you have resources. 

An important disclaimer: please remember that mindfulness and meditation practices are not a substitute for therapy. Remember you need to try an array of methods that work for you and therapy is very very important. Be careful to not go too far and know your own limits when doing mindfulness-based ""inwards"" exercises if you have ptsd, for me it has led to some gnarly situations."
TW... just a heads up yall. This is my story (short version) and something that happened today that made me freak out.,8,lwlvjz,7,"Almost 6 years ago, right before Easter, 9 guys kicked my door in while I was standing 5 feet away from it, (I had no time to react). My wife, my youngest child, and two friends (a man and pregnant female) were there as well. 
The 9 guys had brass knuckles and immediately jumped on me as soon as they kicked the door in. I was knocked out instantly, don't even remember the event except for starting to turn when I hear the door get kicked. Most of the guys proceeded to pummel  me with the brass knuckles and kick me with steel toed boots. While they are trying to kill me, one of them grabs my wife and throws her out the back door and locks it. Another guy is beating my male friends ass (he was hospitalized with a concussion and minor injuries, they were there for me...). His pregnant wife was shoved into a corner and held there.  My child was in my bedroom with our 3 pitt bulls at the time, & remained in there hiding throughout the event. 
They ran back out of the house before my wife could make it around to the front door. She called the ambulance and started praying. When the ambulance arrived, I was unresponsive to external stimuli, my pupils were fixed and I had zero pain response. I was lying in a 4 foot diameter pool of my own blood. I awoke from a coma (very short term, thank God!) In the hospital, surrounded by cops and drs... both of who started asking me questions. I couldn't move half of my body, or speak to respond. 

Fast forward thru 3 &1/2 years of cognitive, physical rehabilitation & emotional therapy and I can walk, talk & work (go outside) without having crippling anxiety attacks. 

Now I've been back to work for 2 & 1/2 years, haven't had a bad freakout/anxiety attack in like 2 years... im doing good. Yeah me... then I get a FB friend request.  From the ring leader of the 9 guys who tried to kill me.

If you're wondering why he isn't in prison for the rest of his life, there is a twofold answer to your question. 1 we moved right after the incident and the courts didn't get our change of address (we assume because my wife filed one the day we moved) to notify us of the court date. 2 I was hella brain damaged still & utterly afraid to leave the house, so I'm not sure if I would've gone then anyways.


I cant think of but 2 reasons he would reach out to me, he found religion and wants to apologize or he wants to antagonize me... idk what to do"
I feel like my PTSD has made me a shitty and overly needy friend.,7,lwltuo,1,"Background information: I was sexually assaulted in 2018. It’s caused me a pretty significant fear of betrayal and strange men. It’s complicated and it’s made me extremely co-dependent.

A year later in 2019 I met this girl through mutual friends. We hit it off. She’s my best friend in the entire world now. We share everything with each other and hang out every weekend. I haven’t ever had a friend as great as her. She and I have similar interests, values, we love spending time with each other — she’s like a sister to me. Every weekend I spend at her apartment so we can cook, watch movies, etc.

But I think sometimes I’m too needy for her. She’s so independent. I, myself, am not. She basically raised herself because of neglectful and abusive parents. My parents spoiled me. She lives on her own at 22 and I still live at home because I’m scared to move out. She has her own car, I can’t even drive because I have test anxiety and have struggled for years to get my license (embarrassing, I know). And on top of that, I can’t trust myself to do anything. If I’m going pretty much anywhere or doing anything at all, I need her to be there.

She works so much. Every day of the week. And as supportive as she is, I know she’s tired and can’t/shouldn’t always have to be there for me. But I feel very lost without her. I was already pretty spoiled before but my sexual assault has made me...fearful to do anything. It’s just made my inability to be independent so much harder. 

I don’t really know what to do or how to talk to her about this without sounding like a bummer or sounding manipulative. Any advice?"
How do I get to open up to my therapist about my trauma?,9,lwho88,5,"Sorry if this is not allowed, since I'm not professionally diagnosed with PTSD. But that's the reason why I'm asking this.

I started going to therapy at the beginning of this year. I've had only 5 sessions so far, but I still want to wait more time until I get to trust her best. I am asking this for now so I can process it for a longer time until I'm ready. 

And I am also very scared and concerned of me not being able to open up to her, because usually when I talk about my trauma in person I start crying and I start getting too much flashbacks, its overwhelming and kind of embarrassing. Any advice to overcome with this?"
"I am a danger to myself, instead of talking I direct my emotions into physical harm onto me.",28,lw8c2k,7,"I just can't trust anyone around me, I know that I'm supposed to but It is hard. My trauma stems from people who were supposed to love, support, care and protect me. I struggle to form close relationships because I have intrusive thoughts and nightmares related to my past but I'm also having new violent dreams about the people who appear as though they would not do that.

I keep seeing these small signs that lead me to overthink the way people feel about but then the feeling gets stronger and more believable because the logic doesn't point anywhere else, I feel like I am going insane because no one else but me sees it, only I feel this way and I am at a point where these thoughts make me hurt myself.

My mind is branding theses thoughts into my head and I feel so unwell lately. I just need to be around people who understand... I am tired of my trauma consuming my every thought, I just want to be sedated, I just can't take it. I was doing so well fighting these thoughts but now they just make me have aggressive outbursts."
news video triggered PTSD,2,lwnjhp,3,"While I was on my computer today, I overheard on the news about some students falling to their death due to a rail failing at a university in I believe Mexico. 

I saw the video, and it gave me chills, and made me feel sick to my stomach almost immediately. Now i cant stop replaying it in my head. 

I have PTSD due to a similar incident when I was younger, watching too many gore like videos under the age of 10, and also childhood abuse. 

I just want help, I just want it to stop, and I feel like my significant other doesn't understand how painful it can be when these things happen."
How can anyone live like this,2,lwn2uo,7,"I don't care why you're hurt, my pain isn't any more than yours. pain is pain. Others don't see it this way, then they don't bother to listen to your pain. 
 My pain became apparent 10 years ago when I watched a very good friend get murdered. Shot to death. Then I had to look at the pictures from his crime scene. I had to see his body, his fucking face man. I'll never, ever in my life forget it. Even if I want to. That's all I can think about, even though my own life was not good. A few days ago I talked to the person who was raising me at the time of this 'event'. I have not spoken to my family in about 4 years. My ""guardian"" my Aunt. The sister of my mother said to me. Why are you like this? I've been through far worse than you, and I'm okay.
How do you respond to this, she accused me of thinking she had something to do with me being, for lack of a better term (I'm shot, scared, confused.) Ugh. I have zero friends. Literally none. No one to talk to. I've attempted suicide, everyone was annoyed by that. I've tried to get help, nobody listens. Is this hell? I'm over it man. If things can get worse, fuck me man. I couldn't handle it."
First trigger,2,lwlphg,1,"During my 30s I went through multiple miscarriages & failed infertility treatments. After ten years, we ended up adopting our two kids so I thought I was ok. Today (I’m 53)  I had to have an invasive & painful procedure (endometrial biopsy) and in the middle of it I began screaming and sobbing uncontrollably. It wasn’t just the physical pain. It was like I was right there again, losing all the pregnancies at once, like I never left that place of grief. I was so horrified I came home & drank a lot. I went through years of therapy for childhood sexual abuse. I guess I’m supposed to deal with this now. Fuck."
Two car accidents causing me distress (neither one my fault),6,lwdsy8,0,"I'm 22 and I just got in my second car accident two days ago. No one was injured (although I'm very sore and have some nasty bruises) but the accident was bad enough to total both of our cars. A woman ran a blinking red light and hit me on the passenger side of my car, sending me over a curb and kind of far out into a field area. Luckily my car went in between a pole and a tree instead of hitting one of them head on. I had the right of way (yellow on my side) and was not speeding or distracted, but there was nothing I could do to prevent it. The cop at the scene gave her a ticket for failure to yield and she was upset and shocked because I guess she didn't believe it was her fault. She claimed to her insurance company that the intersection was a four way stop, but after my claim my insurance guy told me he Google Mapped the road and saw very clearly it was NOT a four way stop and she will likely be found at fault.

My first accident was very similar. I went through my green light and someone ran through a red light, hitting me on the drivers side door this time. Again, no major injuries and both cars totaled. The other driver was also issued a ticket and multiple witnesses and the police report verified that the other driver was at fault.

I know I'm lucky to be okay after two pretty serious accidents, but I feel so unlucky. I'm having a really hard time coping this time. When it happens once you just brush it off and say it was a crazy happenstance. But happening almost exactly the same way only three years apart is freaking me out. I'm a very safe and cautious driver (which probably sounds hard to believe but it's true). I drove on the same road today to get to work and was nervous but made it fine. I feel anxious behind the wheel and afraid that it will happen again. Even as a passenger Everly movement another car makes has me worrying. It's really scary to know that you can be doing everything right and you can still get injured, or worse. I almost feel doomed, like I should never drive again.

I don't know if I have PTSD but I am definitely feeling different. I feel kind of numb mentally. All I can think about is the accident. I keep running through how it happened and I keep pondering why it has happened to me twice. I've been tired for the past two days and I just feel like shutting myself in my room because I don't want to talk to anyone. I really feel like I don't know if I'll ever be okay with driving again. I know I have to, but I don't know how much driving I can handle anymore.

I don't know what I expect to gain from posting this but if anyone has advice or wisdom or a story to share please drop it in the comments. I would really appreciate hearing from other people about this :)"
I'm feeling a bit strange,2,lwkl0j,2,"I'm not going to assume I have PTSD, but I will say something feels wrong, like my experiences aren't exactly as bad as most here, so I'm really confused, should I really think I might have PTSD or should I just act like it's minor and it'll go?

But to give an idea of what I went through:
In primary school I was weird, rattled and couldn't seem to keep my head straight, school felt like an entrance to prison.

In secondary school, I was bullied, getting kicked, shoved, pressured into fighting and looked down on by others. I've had money stolen at times as well.

In college, things seemed to reach another level, I wasn't just bullied, I was gaslit. I was repeatedly told everything was just jokes, but it wasn't funny, I expressed my annoyance several times. Here's a list of things that was done but don't seem to be done between themselves:

Throwing crisp packets at me

Throwing bottles at me

Peer pressured into horseplay

Repeatedly challenged to fight

Name calling

Holding onto my stuff to annoy me until the end of class

Filming me getting angry

Falsely accused me of being in the wrong

Peer pressured into a fist fight, making me throw the first punch and made fun of me for losing

Tried to scare me with a knife (this was an electrician course so a utility knife was needed for cutting cables and wires or something)

Staring and copying my actions in class

Kicking my chair during an exam

Telling me I'm getting loud after a witty comeback

Constantly reminding me they were joking

Since that time I thought I was unaffected, but was I? The trauma seems to come and go, at times it gets very severe and sticks. It did make my depression much worse and kept me out of college at times too, I remember flinching when one of the bullies walked past me. I still get flashbacks and still avoid new people, avoiding sitting with strangers if possible, I avoid interaction with anyone unless they speak to me first so then I can see what they're like. I simply can't get myself to risk going through what I went through again, so I make myself look like the strong silent type, but really I'm just a pussycat.

I'm not sure what to do, my parents have heard me talking about mental health several times, I'm afraid they'll think I'm mad for suggesting PTSD is a possibility. I wish I had a car and money, I'd just run and get help."
First time posting in a group like this and hope I am doing this right.,6,lwdl01,0,"I think the flare is right for this.
I have lived 4 years with a abusive idiot. My sister lived with him longer than me. He tempted me into moving in with the lure of low rent and plentiful high paying job opportunities. It started slow with him raising my rent from 200 to 400 a month. He made a great excuse by saying that it was because we would be moving into a house and I would have my own room. He failed to tell me that the ‘house’ would be a vermin infested dung heap. It finally got to the point where he would insist on most of my paycheck and when I tried to refuse and just pay him the 400. He would say that if I did not like it that I could get out. He knew full well that I had no where to go. 

He also started off as being nice to me but gradually he would add chores that I would need to do. It was reasonable at first: clean my room every week, do dishes every other day. But soon it would be to mow a huge field with a push mower in the middle of a hot summer day. This was because at the time I worked mornings and would get off around 3. Also every small thing would set him off and he would threaten to kick me out: not be at his beck and call when he asked, being in the bathroom at the wrong time, or having ‘attitude’. 

It was worse for my sister: she had to empty his puss cups as he was to lazy to get up and go to the bathroom himself, make tea for him even if she was struggling to walk as it was a bad day for her back, cook dinner even if she could barely walk and use a deep frier even though he knew full well that she hated doing it. 

It would not have been so bad if it was not for the fact that he 
A. Did not have a job and had no drive to get one
B. Was not getting unemployment and had no drive to do so
C. Spent any extras money outside of  paying for utilities and bare minimum groceries on him self in the form of games and cigarettes. 

We would probably be still trapped there if it was for the fact that his best friend came to live with us and saw the shit he was putting us through and sneaked first my sister and then me out of there. Though he caught me as he was paranoid after my sister suddenly ‘disappearing’. I left after her because I had to confirm a job transfer.

I still have nightmares of me being back there and having to do all the things he made my sister do. And she does too."
All the smoke detectors in my apartment went off at once...,9,lwajl1,2,"And even though I didn’t know it wasn’t a real fire, I was still able to stay cool-headed and grab everything important! No crying, no extreme panicking, no attack. I was focused on one thing and one thing only: “what do I need in case I lose it all?”

And I was quickly able to make the decisions: medical records, purse, laptop, stuffed animals (I only have 4 here). I tried for meds, but i realized I didn’t have my key to the lock (they’re in a locker drawer) readily available, so I was able to let those go in the moment, and whatever else is in the drawer. 


The next thing was to help make sure we got all the cats, but by that time the alarms stopped. 

I genuinely thought it was the entire building, but despite that I was able to think clearly. I have hope for myself in case there is a real fire next time."
Mind is playing too realistic tricks on me - anyone else experiencing the same?,3,lwghf5,0,"Today I prepared a package to be send out for repair. It’s a timer switch. I prepped it this morning. 

Just before hopping into bed I see the timer switch laying on my desk next to my books. So, I grab it just to check if it is really the timer switch or sometimes else (bc  of impaired eyesight). I am stunned that I am holding the time switch in my hands since I am confident that I put it in the parcel earlier. So I check my room for the other functioning switches to see if I maybe took one of them out, put it on my desk and forgot about it. But no, all are still in place. And I am still confused about it all and my memory tell me I did put the switch in the box. I can even see and feel the memory. 

And then it hit me - I almost send out an empty package to the repair shop and my mind played another one of his tricks on me. I open up the package and expect to only see wrapping stuff. But no, I put something in the parcel - a plug distributor. The same one I was searching for today. All is fine now, I repackaged the box and I will ship it tomorrow. 

This isn’t the first time my mind plays tricks on me. I’ll give you another example: 
about four weeks ago I went to the supermarkt to buy pizzadough so I could make pizza’s that weekend. So I went to the store, picked it out, put it in my shopping cart, my bag, checked the receipt, put it in the fridge and didn’t look at it until I needed it again (about 5 or 6 days later). And that was the first time I saw that I hadn’t bought pizzadough, I bought two boxes of puff pastry. The MOST nauseating food to exist on this world, I simply hate it. So how come I brought this home instead of my pizzadough?! 

Does anyone else have these experiences too? Being confident you did the thing you wanted to do and even your memory backs you up but later you found out it was another trick of the mind?"
Emotionally conflicted,3,lwd77y,1,"My ex step mom is at my dad's, after her new boyfriend beat her up. I live with my dad now, after my mom abused me in every way possible for 7 years. My ex stepmom completely invalidated my trauma, and called me a liar and theif back when she lived with us. She cheated on my dad with her new boyfriend because she wasn't getting pregnant, and her alcohol addiction went too far, and now I don't know how to feel, because my dad was in a terrible place after they got divorced and when all that stuff was going on, and it's still difficult for my dad to really understand my trauma, and I'm still trying to deal with all my PTSD and trauma and constant nightmares and now there's the possibility she will come live with us, or be back if the boyfriend beats her up again, since she doesn't want to call the police on him. 

I sympathize with her, obviously, but I am scared for my dad because he was in a terrible spot, even though he's hurt me a little in the past, so everything is confusing."
I don't know what to do?,2,lwgm52,0,"This is difficult to articulate so please be patient.

Part of my trauma is from being sexually abused. I meet someone i chould make myself vulnerable to and see myself getting intimate with but he broke my heart in a very cruel manner.

I met someone the other day, he lives down the hall from me. He invited me over, fed me, we watched a movie. He put his hand under my shirt and rubbed my back. He was a gentleman about it, didn't mess with my bra or anything. And i let it happen.

I don't recall the last time I've had human contact. A couple months ago maybe? And i was so touch starved i told him not to stop when he backed off.

But i don't know if I'm ready to be vulnerable again, if I'm ready to be intimate in any manner. He seems like a nice guy, very respectful and giving. But my head is so muddled i don't know if I'm ready to even try going anywhere. I'm still at the point where it feels like people being nice to me is a trap, but I'm so freaking lonely."
"Body, sexual body parts, and confused feelings",5,lwbftx,4,"So, I have a history of sexual abuse and childhood traumas. I have some really strange feelings that I don’t understand and was hoping someone could give me insight. 

Basically, I feel extremely triggered by seeing other people’s physical body parts/genitals of the same sex. Realistically, I know everyone is different and has different appearances etc.. but for some reason that does not sit well with me. The fact that I am different makes me feel uncomfortable. I don’t want to be “different”. I want to be the best. I want the best looking vagina, boobs, etc. I feel like the fact that there is so much variety among people, makes me feel like there’s a possibility that I am not living up to someone’s standards.. and I can’t handle that. I want to fit EVERYONES standards. Is it a control thing?"
I may have red flags of ptsd,6,lw6ays,2,My dad died when I was 7 or 8 I heard him die in the next room his room was next to the waiting room in the hospital and the same year my grandfather killed himself I was really close to both of them like they were my best friends. Any how my doctor thinks I have ptsd because I wake up in the middle of the night from nightmares all the time and walk around looking for my dad because I thought I see him  I’m anxious depressed one moment I’m fine next thing I’m depressed just staring at the wall. Also I get extreme paranoia. And suicidal dreams after my nightmares. I’m not suicidal just wondering if it’s sighs of ptsd or not my doctor thinks it is.
"If you’ve had a traumatic experience and developed PTSD, are you more prone to being traumatized by a new event?",9,lw1zl3,5,"My mother passed away homeless due a paramedic essentially just not doing his job properly and that gave me PTSD.

Sorry for my weak English. I’m from Iraq and I was in military for while during the civil war and also after that. I witnessed lots of drama in my life. Especially in my military life.  I didn’t now I have PTSD till 2015. We don’t have good doctors in Iraq for PTSD every doctor I go to him he give different story of treatment. And I have friend suggested to go online and find clinics. What I find was a clinic asking for health insurance and social number which are things we don’t use in Iraq. 

If anyone please know a PTSD treatment center with affordable cost. It will be good please"
How do you take care of yourself during hard days?,6,lvxn5l,4,"Things have been tough lately. Since I started therapy, my symptoms have been much worse than they were in the past. It’s really getting to me and it can be hard to self-soothe when I’m having a rough day. I’m also starting my first session of EMDR this week and I’m not sure how it will go. How do you all take care of yourself during difficult days? Is there anything you do to make it better? I tend to beat myself up about my struggles, but I want to start easing the pressure off and allowing myself some grace. What are some things you do to ease the stress?"
"Drugged, Carjacked, and Who Knows What Else",10,lvvn6w,3,"I won’t make the story too long, but basically several months ago, I was drugged when I went out alone and carjacked. I only have memory of a dark haired dude sitting in my car while I was terrified and crying, a memory of standing in a convenience store crying, another memory of me standing on a road in front of the driver door, another of being driven around in the backseat of an unknown car, and a final memory of being in an ambulance. I woke up the next day next to my husband, explained what I remembered, and then we made our way to the ER to do a rape kit. 

Apparently my husband was in touch with the police during the course of me being missing that night and picked me up from the ER. Rape Kit status is still pending and I’m of course in therapy and have been struggling immensely.

I guess I’m writing here because silly me was sharing a little bit of this experience on a different subreddit along with all the horrible crimes I have witnessed in Seattle in the past 6 months (which only made my anxiety and ptsd worse), and this really awful person started calling me psycho and following me to other subreddits calling me that name again. I also suffer from CPTSD from childhood abuse, and this kind of sent my inner critic into full force, and I’m just feeling a lot of sadness, guilt, and shame."
Keeping a 'diary' helped me to believe myself,42,lvjjlc,5,"When I started university, I began a diary of the various things I did, saw, and thought during my studies. Uni's wild, and if you're going to keep a diary at any point in your life, that's probably the time to do it. Now that I'm working, it's fun to look back and reminisce.

I couldn't predict the traumatic events that would happen during those years, nor any aftermath of existing issues - but having them recorded, hours or a day or two after they happened, forces me to accept I'm not hysterical, or a liar.

It helped therapists diagnosing me with something I didn't even know I had, and it helped the police. Whenever I find myself just not believing my own memories, I still occasionally go back and reread things.

I'd recommend the same for anyone else - even if you're not recording anything you think is special. Bit of a retroactive success, I suppose."
Empowered gaslighting is bullshit,19,lvok73,3,"Thanks for those that are downvoting my post in a PTSD support subreddit.  You are some truly special people.

I did my first session of EMDR today, second session with a new therapist.  And I was feeling really down about the direction she wanted to take things.  I felt like she is trying to push me to be more socially open when that isn't really what my goal is.  She had me focus on the idea that ""the world is a safe place"" and do homework to challenge my idea that it isn't.

But after thinking about it for a while, I think more than anything I am angry because it feels like a really convoluted way of victim-blaming.

I feel like the things she said all come back to this root where we should be able to tell good people from bad people and if we could just learn the signs we could comfortably move through this life again, untarnished by our traumas.

In our session, I told her that there were things with one trauma that, looking at them now, I feel like it was evident this guy didn't want anything more than sex from me, our friendship was a sham and me today would have recognized that and wanted nothing to do with him.  She wanted me to focus on how I would have acted differently as a way to feel like the world is safer than I give it credit for.  I understand how realizing those things can be helpful, but hindsight is twenty-twenty and you cannot possibly know how a situation will play out until you are in it.

Any other notion is purely theoretical, and, in my opinion, garbage.  You can be prepared, I suppose, but that isn't a guarantee.

If I examine another of my traumas, I was living at a house full of youths smoking pot, and the father that owned the house didn't care.  With my adult lens this sends off horrible red flags, I would never want a child to be in a place like this.  But abuse happens in houses that otherwise seem normal too.

In the first trauma I experienced, a friend's old babysitter smoked a joint with us before offering to help with my homework.  My adult brain that is wired for red flags is telling me it is a risk to go into the house of someone you don't actually know, especially one that would smoke a joint with kids.  But people are assaulted by people close to them all the time, not just strange ne'er do wells.  People who don't use drugs.  People who were trusted.  People in respected positions of authority.

I think it is easy to look at my situation and think that I should have done a better job of protecting myself when I was a teenager, and that guilt is one of the darkest things I struggle with personally.  But at the same time that those people were doing drugs and being nefarious, there I was with them doing the same, and yet I have never had the urge to hurt someone.

To act as though bad people have specific attributes discredits individuals with shared attributes, such as drug addiction, who have never had violent urges or have successfully suppressed the ones they have had.  It isolates people who have been victimized by individuals who don't fit stereotypical depictions of violent offenders.

And most importantly, it undermines all victims because being in a bad situation is never an invitation to violence. PERIOD.

Bad people don't look or act a certain way, sometimes the only thing connecting them is their violent actions.

If we could continue with the moment we have been gaining, that the most proactive way to address this is by treating perpetrators of violence like criminals, maybe one day there won't be a constant stigma that victims just need to know better.

To suggest someone disregard the lessons they feel their trauma has taught them while at the same time relying on information they have because of that same trauma is insensitive.

As always, thanks for listening."
Dealing with guilt.,8,lvuept,5,"So I'm a single mom and I have a four year old daughter, and she's absolutely my everything and I love her from the bottom of my heart. As she's getting older and just this super curious and playful being, she can be really aggressive when we play. Like sometimes she'll pull my hair (playfully, not to hurt me) or pull on my arm, or hug me super super tight, squeeze me etc. And I've been finding myself just going into full blown panic. Like my heart will start racing and sometimes I'll end up just raising my voice (not to yell but just yelling out ""stop it, PLEASE""). 
It's just sometimes we'll be playing and having fun, and of course it's so easy for kids to get over excited.
Of course I've used this as a teaching opportunity to talk about how we need to respect when someone says no, they don't like something, or want to stop playing a game (even if it's right in the middle of the game and they were initially having fun but decide its not fun anymore), consent in general. 
But I just can't help but feel so guilty and sad about it. Of course I can't explain why mommy gets so scared, obviously not an age appropriate conversation. It can get really frustrating when ptsd manifests itself in totally innocent situations and it's so easy to feel resentful towards the past when these things happen. 
I'm just wondering if anyone has any feedback or has gone through something similar and might have some insight on how they've dealt with it or talked themselves through a similar situation."

I went grocery shopping during the worst possible time and was able to actually complete the trip!,8,lvqfiz,0,"TW: Descriptions of hyper-vigilance and anxiety/panic (I'm still learning the rules here so sorry if thats not what one writes here).

tldr; My trip to the store felt like I was existing in a horror film, but I actually did it.

I apologize if this doesn't belong here, but I had to share with people who would understand.   
I've been having a rough go of things on and off this past month. Sleep and diet issues, hyper-anxiety paired with bouts of depression being the major factors among other things. I've been having difficulty finding work, but we get by with enough budgeting, so I've taking on the role of stay-at-home dad. This includes things like handling the meal-planning and shopping.

I usually try to shop around mid-morning as the store is MUCH less crowded. Loud unexpected noises and crowds in general really ramp up the anxiety and hyper-vigilance. Well, after a bad night of sleep and a fair bit of physical pain in the morning I was feeling so drained I just didn't want to do a thing. Thing is, we needed food in the house, and we had splurged on grocery delivery the past two weeks in a row. The nature of my wife's job makes it so she has to be present at almost all times. So I told myself I would take some time in the morning to just mentally prep for the chore and go in the afternoon. Just robot my way through it. I figured around 2:00 would be good, the lunchtime crowd would be gone and the post-work crowd wouldn't have arrived yet. Right?

Folks, I was very very wrong. I forgot about after-school shoppers. I almost turned right around the moment I saw how crowded it was, but I knew I'd feel like a failure and that would just make things worse.  

It was like a gauntlet of everything that makes my body tense up. Random children screaming out, carts ramming into each other, no social distancing whatsoever, lots of sudden movement. I was sweating and shaking almost immediately, trying to focus on my list but also be aware of everyone around me (easy, right?). I can't tell you how many times I'd turn around and someone would be directly behind me. FOUR times I had people REACH OUT FROM BEHIND ME to get something on the shelf I was standing in front of, making me almost scream. There were so many times I wanted to just abandon my cart and run out. By the time I got to the register my eyes were tearing up, my heart was racing, and I felt ill from clenching my stomach muscles for an hour. 

But. I. Fucking. Did. it. For the first time in almost a month I managed to leave the house and buy everything my family needed. I maaaay have burst into tears the moment I shut the car door and probably got some odd looks as I ugly cried for the entire drive home, but I don't care. It's been an extremely rare experience lately but I feel proud of myself."
Why am I helpless,1,lvz9pt,0,?
I have a favorite book depiction of PTSD,4,lvr2ay,0,"I have a favorite book depiction of PTSD. It is a book called Brit-Marie Was Here and it's about a woman who lost her sister as a girl. My maternal grandfather also lost a sibling. Anyway this woman lost her sister as a girl in a car accident.

Can you get over a trigger?,15,lvh20p,7,There’s a certain video game that I really love but I can’t play it because I was playing it when the traumatic experience happened. It’s my favorite video game but every time I try to open it now it’s extremely triggering and it’s too painful to play. I was wondering if anyone knew how to get over a specific trigger related to the trauma? I’m in therapy currently so maybe there’s something there I could do?
Just need a little encouragement to keep healing and fighting,10,lvk31v,2,"So I'm currently in CPT for a lifetime of trauma and it's hard as hell. I feel like I'm being split in half. I recognize my stuck points and see how illogical they are (hell I've taken the LSAT like it's so easy to see how they're flawed) but it's so hard to try and believe anything else. 

Specifically I'm having a lot of problems getting over the suicide of my Dad. My mom was in a car accident that basically left her a vegetable in 2005. She's still alive but of course over the years we had crazy financial problems because of the cost of her care and my dad was really depressed. Like stay in bed for days and days depressed. But as a kid you just assume that he's tired or something from working all the time. 

Anyway I survived all that bullshit and was in college killing it in 2017 when out of the blue my dad killed himself. Forensic evidence was kinda sus and because of shitty police work I didn't find out how he died until weeks after we already had his funeral. So for the past four years I just completely ignored how he really died. Like completely. Had a dead dad but that was it really.  And of course then I was left with the responsibility of my mother and younger sibling who was still a minor. 

And basically CPT is tearing me apart. It feels like to come to terms with how he really died I have to destroy myself. It's so much easier to think that he just died rather than him deliberately leaving all of this to me at only 19, and leaving his disabled wife behind. He was all my mom had. No one else in our family cares about her or sees her in the nursing home. It just feels like healing comes with the trade off of having to destroy all the happy memories I had with my dad. If I face the reality of his life, death, and legacy, then I have to face the reality that those happy childhood memories I had running around unsupervised weren't so happy. And that all the times he said he loved watching me grow up that he was lying. Because he chose to stop watching us grow up. I had no parents at my college graduation as a first generation student because his selfish choice.

Greiving a suicide sucks. In my experience in sucks worse than financial trauma, medical trauma, or being in a severe car accident. I feel like it was the cherry on the trauma sundae that has damned my life to sadness and these awful awful PTSD symptoms. I stay high all the time just to get through my days. Someone please tell me this CPT stuff just gets worse before better. I need to feel like it isn't for nothing or I'll shut down and stop feeling again. 

Anyway. Hope you guys are hanging in there. Took so long to get here and it's hard to have all your toxic post trauma thought patterns looking at your pain while healing and telling you that not feeling really was the right way all along. Best of luck wherever you're at on your journey. I hope to come back here one day and share some story about how I no longer have any symptoms but in this low moment that feels like a pipe dream. 

Thanks for letting me vent 💗"
Is this PTSD?,3,lvrajh,1,So my parents are kinda emotionally abusive and whenever i hear footsteps or people walking towards my direction it makes me freak out. Like today my parents were walking around downstairs and just their footsteps made me want to start screaming for them to shut up. And whenever I hear them approaching my room my immediate reaction is to hide or to start crying. Or when we had a handyman at our house once I heard him walking in the direction of my room and I automatically shut my computer (which I was doing school work on so nothing bad) and picked up a book to pretend to be reading so he wouldn’t think I was lazy. I knew the handyman wasn’t my parents but I still felt as if it were them walking down the hall and that I had to do something productive quick or I would get in trouble. Also I should add that one time in early covid I had online class and my parents were walking around downstairs because they were exercising and I literally hid in my closet for 30 mins in fear that they would walk into my room even though I knew they were downstairs. Could this be PTSD?
Triggered from webcomics,2,lvticb,0,"Hi 👋 I'm new here.

Anyways, I don't really get triggered often. It's a relatively small occurrence for me, even when media is marked with a trigger warning I rarely find myself affected by it. But today, I found myself shaking while reading this webcomic. It's almost as if the person who wrote it did so completely from personal experience. Every nuance to the scene was spot on to how I felt and thought during my trauma. At first I was impressed, taken aback by the accuracy of the depiction. But before I realized it, my hands were shaking and my heart was beating out of my chest. Since it was only a mild reaction, I continue reading webcomics like this. Its like I've been spooked by a scary movie, unable to sleep for a week and nervous. I know its not healthy for me to subject myself to this stuff, but I can't help it.
Do you guys think I should avoid reading stuff like this?"

Fantasy land :/,17,lv7uie,4,Because of all the trauma I went through I am constantly in my head daydreaming. It gets to the point for I can’t tell reality vs my fantasy thoughts.

I don’t feel anything yet... so when is coming?,4,lvireb,4,"TW: online predators, home invasion, sexual assault, child porn

Hi there! I’m a 20f who started therapy because I was struggling with anxiety and depression. It turns out that it was ADHD the whole time, but that’s another story...

I suffered trauma as a kid from an internet predator pedophile who groomed me and forced me to send him pictures and explicit videos. I honestly thought I was in love with him, and then it was explained to me he was using me. My step mom thought my behavior with this man was “slutty” and kicked me out of the house after a string of abusive behaviors on her part. I was 12, and my dad is still married to her. They live out in California now. I never went to therapy for it and my family hasn’t spoken of it Since. The pedo got released from prison in 2016 and I felt... nothing? 

Last January a man broke into my sorority house and entered my room. He watched me sleep and I woke up to him masturbating over me. I screamed and he fled and my sisters called the police. And my life just... went on?  I didn’t miss a class, didn’t get any extensions. They haven’t caught him and I haven’t checked in with the police at all. 

When I talk about those situations in therapy I don’t FEEL anything. No fear, no sadness... it’s like they never happened. But for the first time the other day, I got super triggered seeing someone who LOOKED like the online pedophile and I felt sick to my stomach.

I’m terrified that all of this shit will remerge with more panic attacks or that I’m already suffering from PTSD but it’s getting conflated with my adhd, anxiety, and depression (all of which I’m medicated for).

TDLR:
Why can’t I feel anything about this trauma? Maybe I’m just lucky and I got out of all these things scot free without emotional impact but the eery internal stillness I feel regarding all these situations is disturbing. It’s been years! When will the shoe drop?

Has anyone else experienced severe numbness for years after situations? And when did the numbness end so you could confront your issues?"

I knew it meant I wasn't ""properly"" dealing with anything, but it meant I was sleeping, and anytime I could sleep was a win.

In the past year give or take, I started having dreams again. Every goddamned night. Vivid, intense dreams that I wake from disoriented, and have to remind myself hours later that it was just a dream. That I wasn't interrogated by my bosses about cappuccino mix.

Do I have PTSD or some kind of trauma?,1,lvs6ut,1,"Hi. I (F21) just recently did a burn out, possibly because of my GAD and its limitless insecurities. I got diagnosed with GAD at 15, and sometimes its worse sometimes its okay, its kinda mild symptoms. The point is, I noticed that, even though I’m a highly nervous individual, when I see someone drunk/high (out of control intoxicated) in a social scenario, i get very irritated, angry and mean. I really just dont feel good and i have a very weird feeling that it will be out of control soon, when sometimes, it’s actually manageable drunkenness. With my therapist today, I was able to put into words all of that and we resurfaced one of my childhood “traumatic” experiences in which my mom and my aunts got into a fight (a physical fight) at Christmas dinner, and my little brother who was 2 1/2 that time was persecuted as a result. I was maybe 11-12 but I still have a very vivid/core memory of my little brother being in the middle of this when I think about all of this. Is this PTSD? Should i seek more help about this? I never really thought of this situation as threatening to my survival when I was a kid, but when I think about it now, I see how my young self could have perceived it as dangerous. Thanks all, hope it goes well for you xx"
Screaming at my memories?,5,lvgp4w,2,"So I'm not professionally diagnosed with PTSD but it's been pointed out to me several times by people online and offline and recommended I seek therapy which eventually when in the right situation i plan to but currently it's not an option. But I'm not here to talk about therapy and therapists I'm actually here to get something explained to me and to ask a question I'm needing answers to so if we can please focus on that instead.  

Does anyone with PTSD have memory's come back to them either something someone said to them or a memory of something they regret and you start screaming and yelling at the memory to shut up? It almost feels like the memory subsides for as second but of course it's a memory and it comes back. And it's usually just a repeat of me screaming at the memory to shut up the entire day of half the day. It's like my brain wants the memory to stop being intrusive when I'm trying to have a good day. 

Why am i screaming at my memory? does anyone else do this? is it a flash back? idk what this is and i just need a resource to why I'm doing it so i can better understand it."
Any recommendations for non-spiritual guided imagery sessions?,3,lvhi9e,1,"My therapist is adamant I continue with her guided imagery voice recordings but I can’t let go of how goofy they are.

I want guided imagery that will actively help me heal, that actively attacks the negative memories, even if it is extremely difficult/painful. 

Any recommendations are very appreciated. The ones by Belleruth Naperstek are the ones that aren’t working for me."
I want to drop out of high school from PTSD,3,lvgrdw,16,"I’m in grade 11 and about to turn 17. In grade 9 I was drugged and sexually assaulted by someone I thought I could trust. I was diagnosed with PTSD and every single day I’ve been thinking about dropping out.

I always wanted to become a doctor, but it’s hard just to simply go to a high school class. The night of the traumatic event, I did my math homework, so doing math is a trigger for me now. I can’t graduate high school without my math credits. And I can’t do any sort of math without getting a panic attack. Because of this, my grades are dropping and my attendance is weak. I’ve always been a straight-A student but PTSD changed that. 

I just don’t want to be one of those high school dropouts that can barely get by. However, at the same time, I can’t go another day to school. I’m the smartest kid in my grade but my PTSD is making me stuck and I’m becoming suicidal. It makes me feel worse that my attacker went to university and because of him, I can’t even get a high school diploma. Is there anyone who’s made it through schooling with PTSD?

"Trigger warning ⚠ I keep putting myself in traumatizing situations involving men, trauma",6,lv8a8v,8,"First time poster. Sorry for the format, and I hope this is posted in the right place 


So basically I have been through several different traumas during my life, it has resulted in a laundry list of diagnosis and struggles, including CPTSD.

Some more backstory : I am terrified of men, it took me years to be comfortable around my male therapist, I have struggled a long time with anxiety, fearing men, always prepare for the worst and basically not living but existing. I always feel I owe people stuff, if they are kind or give me stuff I feel I am in a huge debt to them. 

So to the issue: I keep setting myself in situations that re traumatize me, I get in touch with men and I let them do what they want, I am usually drunk. I feel so bad after, I keep having flashbacks and I have trouble trusting men I know and should be able to trust. I have read that people with PTSD avoid situations but I leap head first into those situations. What is wrong with me? Is this normal? I know i should just cut contact with the men I have contact with but one gave me some money because I was struggling. So I feel I owe him, even though his messages gives me anxiety, I am usually OK and then he sends something that makes me scream no at the phone and I end up ignoring the messages. I know this is not healthy, I know what it does to me, I know it affects my sleep and my symptoms and function. Its like I have dug a hole and I am stuck there, because I owe the earth worm something. But i also know I have played along with his sexting, sent pictures and what not. But what If it isn't enough? Yes I will basically let him r*pe me (not interested in sex, I just let them do whatever and just hope and pray they will be done fast. I dissociate a lot and can't remember much after) 

We are planning to meet, even though I know it isn't safe due to the pandemic but I just want to be done with it you know. He keep pushing the fantasies, add more and more stuff I am not comfortable with and wants to punish me for not complying. I answer his texts and play along while I am questioning myself and get the panic attack after panic attack because of the content in the messages. 

Not sure what the point with this was. But how ""normal ""is this behaviour?"
Just started EMDR and not feeling sure about my therapist,1,lvk7y5,2,"Hey everyone!  Hope you are well!

I have just started doing EMDR with a new therapist and I am having really mixed feelings about it.

My main goal is to have better sexual functioning, as I can't seem to really get into it and enjoy myself unless I have had a little alcohol, even though my husband is a wonderful man and we have been together for ten years.

My therapist seems really focused on the fear I feel in a general sense.  I have been through three traumas and, after a lot of therapy, I feel like anything can happen in the world and that is just life.  I feel like that is a deep truth that I will never forget.  It no longer keeps me up at night or causes me to get panic attacks when I go out in public.  At this point, I just don't really have much of a social need.  I like to be by myself and my husband and family (parents, nephews, and in-laws) take up all the social time I feel I can give.  I know that my social need is low because of my PTSD, but it doesn't really bother me.

My therapist wants me to think of daily goals that will challenge my fearful beliefs and encourage me to be more social.  But I don't really know what that is supposed to mean.  She said ""like going to the grocery store alone"", but I told her I already do that.  Two years ago I went to stay on farms for a work stay without my husband to learn about farming and it was hard but pretty panic-free.  A couple of years ago I had a work friend and we would do game nights with our SOs, but it ended when she left the workplace and stopped returning my calls (it doesn't really bother me).  I think I do put myself out there when it feels like it makes sense to do so.  I don't really feel like I have the time or desire for friends, so I don't really want to go out and actively seek a friendship, but if something came up I wouldn't avoid it.  There are still risks I wouldn't take, even if I had a male friend I don't imagine I would invite him to hang out in a private place just the two of us.  But I have been in private places with men, on the farms, at work, and when we stayed in an Airbnb, without it causing me distress.

I feel like she expects me to just let go of that fear I have, but for me, it feels like the fear doesn't control me anymore or stop me from doing anything.  It is more like it is just a knowledge now, like the worst is always possible so don't ignore the signs and enjoy every moment that is good.

Maybe I am just resistant, but I am not sure how it is supposed to be any better than that.

Have others gone through the same thing?  Did you get better than you imagined in your wildest dreams and I need to work harder on the process?  Would you find a different therapist?

In my last intensive round of therapy five years ago or so now (talking every day) the goal was moving past that sense that the fear dominated my life.  I was incredibly unwell at that point and I have made huge progress and maintained it very well.  I feel like my old therapist would still be proud of where I am and I am not sure that she would be pushing me so hard towards something more.

I am having trouble gauging my expectations, of myself and the process.  

Am I right to feel this way or am I just kidding myself?

Thanks for listening."
Second worst thing about being traumatized is when nobody believes you,268,luem3y,32,"I have been crying and shaking for hours and days and yet people believe i could be lying about what happened 

Sometimes i wish i had more visible bruises so they’d believe me but I doubt even then they’d listen

TW: Loss/Death. How to work through painful triggers,1,lvdgjb,0,"TLDR at end. ; My mother passed away when I was young. I now have trauma around losing people I love. Whenever I see posts about other people experiencing things like surgery, loss, sickness, it sends me into this spiral of worrying about losing more people I love. I want to be able to move through this but I don't know how to. When the emotions are high I focus on grounding and calming myself but then I don't want to address the trigger later and work through it.  Does anyone have any advice on how to stop avoiding this and start on working through it?

My mother passed when I was young.  Since then I have distanced myself from most people.  I don't want to form close relationships because of the fear that they too will die unexpectedly and I would have to experience this trauma all over again.  However, I dump all of my love, affection, energy, etc. into my romantic relationships.  I don't worry about them breaking up with me but I have a deep fear of them dying.  Whenever I see other people going through a sickness, surgery, accident, loss, all the bad things; I can't stop myself from spiraling into ""this could happen to the person I love. What would I do if this happened to them?"" I try to plan for every possibility, which is of course impossible.  But that fear causes me to panic whenever these triggers come up.  In the moment I usually try to just ground myself and calm down, but whenever I'm in a safe headspace, I don't want to go back and address what happened.  I don't know how to exactly work through the trauma.  I've talked with my therapist about this and she said it's very common to use this avoidance technique but clearly avoiding the issue isn't healthy.  I just don't know how to do it.  I don't know how to work through these emotions when they are so intense and cause so much distress and panic.  She recommended a DBT group but I'm not sure of the cost yet.  Does anyone have any advice on how they work through this.  It feels like a double-edged sword; triggers cause me to feel bad so I want to calm myself so I can think more rationally but then when I feel okay I don't want to think about it because it will only cause me distress again.  I can't seem to break from this cycle."

Dealing with the person who caused me a good amount of trauma in one of my classes. I hate it so damn much,8,lv0h16,0,"About 3 years ago, I was threatened, stalked and harassed by my ex to the point of a restraining order. The threats were EXTREMELY vulgar, with extreme plans to badly injure and possibly kill me. Dealing with that resulted in me dealing with PTSD from that on top of PTSD from my parent’s very violent divorce, extreme anxiety, trust issues, you name it. 

I was in 7th grade when this happened, making me a sophomore now. He was put in a grade below me for my safety and also due to his lack of good attendance in general. Him being away from me grade-wise helped me with my healing, calming my triggers, and just overall helped me feel safe again. Knowing I wouldn’t have to see him outside of the halls at school and coincidental timings, helped me feel 100% safe.

With high school, my freshman year was easily the best year for me mentally since. Due to him being in 8th grade and still in middle school, I only saw him once in a blue moon if he was coming for marching band, which I’m not in, again, for my safety and due to my busy schedule during band season. (I’m a competitive equestrian and competition season starts heavily continuing around the same time as band season, we’re April-October, band season is August-Octoberish.) I knew I may have to deal with him in regular band class in sophomore year, but I thought Covid would save me due to us having supposed to be on different days in person due to our last names (My last name starts with A and his starts with M). I wasn’t told or even hinted as to otherwise.

Or so I thought. Second day of band class, guess who walks in the door? Him. The causer. Right smack in front of me, walking through the door. It was like getting slapped in the face, healing for nearly a year through quarantine and it was like it’d all went to waste. I’d handled myself quite well through this, though. I kept my eyes down, quiet and just pretended it didn’t bother me. It fucking did.

The school knows he shouldn’t be around me. The school was TOLD the mental distress it would cause me. I’ve stayed up on school nights fucking anxious because I hate seeing his face and now it’s burnt into my mind all over again after a year. The fact I wasn’t even told this was going to happen even after it wasn’t fucking supposed to happen by the school or literally anyone just makes the sting all the more worse. I fucking hate it so much. I want to be stress free again.


I knew this was going to happen one day, I just wanted to know it was in advance. Three years and I still fear what could’ve happened and what still could happen if his therapy doesn’t work and if he’s still out to get me."

"27 F looking for support, Disturbing Childhood memories. CW: Molestation, Neglect",3,luq6md,7,"When I was in middle school and high-school I was responsible for babysitting my 2 younger siblings while my parents worked over the summer. I spent most of the time locked in my room alone on the computer while my siblings were watching TV.

Reading a post about a child that got molested by their older brother made 2 memories in particular re-emerge. One was my sister playing with little people dolls making one go to the bathroom while the girl doll said ""don't look at my privates"". I think in another instance (IDK if this is me creating a false memory or dream or whatever) I remember her saying something to the effect of my brother touched her. This was infront of parents in the room and I don't know if anything came of it.

My brother has Autism.

I have a slew of mental health problems.

These are not excuses. I just feel like I possibly created an environment that lead to my sister getting abused, altering her life permanently. My neglect was the cause. If this is true I hate myself. But I don't know and I can't ask her. I won't ask her because I can't make it better. I will only bring up trauma by asking.

She has had therapy some therapy.. The brother has had years of therapy. So have I.

I'd like to think if my sister was hurt in that way that its been addressed by now. But the anxiety and guilt are eating at me.

I'm afraid to talk about this to people I'll because its a family secret and will influence the way me and my family are viewed.

Idk how to live with this

In retrospect, I feel like my 14-15 year old self didn't take it seriously? Maybe it was a defence mechanism because I did not want to think it was real? Maybe it wasn't real. Maybe I'm just triggered. I don't know."
Some advice on my PTSD,3,luqypy,3,"

I am 15, about two years ago i had a very traumatic experience after reacting to an injection i had, i was in hospital for about a week and had loads of tests, nobody knew what was wrong. After coming out of hospital, i struggled with depression, it took me a while to get me the support i needed but when i finally did, everyone was brilliant. I got diagnosed with PTSD and am on the autism spectrum.

However, i still have a crippling fear of doctors, appointments, dentists, orthodontists, needles and even the thought of a covid test makes me panic. Obviously i’m under the age of 18, my mum books and takes me to appointments. I have non stop nightmares weeks before the appointment, flashbacks and i even worry about appointments i aren’t even gonna have. 

I am concerned, i tend to avoid appointments as much as i can due to the trauma. I am a very healthy person apart from a few hormonal issues which is the main thing that keeps me going to doctors. I haven’t been back in the hospital i was admitted to since the situation, we try our best to arrange appointments somewhere else. I haven’t been to the dentist or the opticians since either, i struggle even walking past places like that.

I’m worried because when i’m older and more responsible, am I gonna be able to do this? I need to keep healthy and get checked but going to the doctors is so much for me. I’m willing to go down private healthcare (i’m in UK) or even if people have doctors/dentists in the south that they recommend for people like me. I’ve googled some of this stuff and a lot of people are like ‘you just need to get it done’ but it’s really not as easy as that.
 
Many doctors that i have seen have rushed appointments or made me feel bad and weak. I was told earlier this year that i needed a blood test, I burst into tears and her exact words were ‘calm down and get on with it’. I don’t want this to happen.

any help will be appreciated <3"
Trauma therapy,2,lutvzq,1,I started trauma therapy for about a month and I currently stopped seeing my therapist because after my sessions I only feel worse.. The first appointment we had I explained a couple occurrences which I have flashbacks on and she asked if it really happened to me.. every session since she has made me feel like she questions everything I say and it feels useless. I feel hurt and embarrassed for even talking about. Honestly I have a hard enough time talking about it so for someone to react the way she did it makes me not want to ever talk about it again.. help idk what to do 😢

I don't know how long I can suppress my feelings and trauma,5,lui22l,0,"TW: se*ual assault/harassment


So today I reported this security guard who m*l*sted me 4 months ago. I basically told him not to contact me again, otherwise I'd report him. And he did... today... hence why I reported him. I fucking opened up to a complete stranger about what he did and it was so weird to talk about and holy fucking shit I forgot so much details and information from how fucking badly I suppress. Thankfully I had live footage of me describing everything... anyway....

So after reporting what the guard done, I been told he's been fired and out of work for 4 months. Therefore, no justice with him.

I feel like a complete fucking failure. I feel so pathetic and stupid. Like... how can I be SA many times? Not only by that m*l*ster, but I been r*ped by 4 diff ppl and completely diff times. I don't understand what is wrong with me? I know its not my fault, took me ages to stop blaming myself but I really do feel awful. I feel so disgusted and stupid- like I'm pathetic. The more it happened, the more I changed my ""strategy"". The first time, it was in school. It was from behind, but the second time... it was my virginity taken. And I fucking hate being asked about my fucking virginity. Like ""how was your first time, how'd you lose it"". It feels embarrassing and disgusting. I feel so violated every time just getting asked that. I was fucking drunk and passed out too. Then the other time, it was my (ex)boyfriend and I was sober and I was fucking vocal but disassociated completely. The next was the same day that occurred with that security guard. It was by someone I considered a ""friend"". I didn't see it coming coz we didn't even flirt at all and he just gaslit me. Like..... I reported the first 2 r*pes, I reported the time someone else gr*ped me, I reported my attempted kidnapping, I reported the security guard.... and NOTHING. NOTHING FUCKING HAPPENED BUT SHIT TO ME. EVERYTHING JUST GOT WORSE FOR ME.

The first ever report got me expelled from school. The second forced me to be abused by my own mother- she forced me into a hymen repair surgery. The gr*per threatened me so bad I had to withdraw the case. The kidnapper guy... NOTHING HAPPENED. The police just said ""don't tell anyone about this"" and that was it. The security guard, well I mentioned it in the first paragraph. 

I can't seem to get anything right. I do anything to avoid such situations but my mental health keep deteriorating more and more. I don't know how many mental breakdowns I can handle or how many panic attacks I can deal with in public or privately even. I don't know how long I can keep up with my abusive mother — living in fear. I don't know how to stop being so idealistic bc my BPD keeps blinding me, making me trust someone enough that they end up assaulting me. My own fucking brain is against me. My brain is the reason for my traumas. My brain is the reason I am in pain, its literally my enemy. I do everything right, I do everything to make sure I'm happy and stable. I meditate, I do spiritual shit, I study, I distract myself, I went to therapy, got pets and friends..... nothing .... fucking.... works.... I don't know what more I can do... I don't know how much longer I can take any of this and I CANT KILL MYSELF. I'm not currently suicidal but I just want to escape this earth... I just want to stop feeling forever. I want to be free from this country and this household. I just wish I had love and care. I just.... don't know what to do and I have no one to fucking talk to."

How can I help my girlfriend who is currently dissociative,3,lukq8l,4,"
Due to a horribly abusive relationship that she got out of less than a year ago she’s developed ptsd, and is now dissociating for the first time because of some flashbacks that happened yesterday.

It started yesterday and has been ongoing today

I’m scared and I don’t know how to help

I’m looking up things to do but am a little overwhelmed and currently can only text her, though hopefully I can take her somewhere in a few hours.

She can still talk and remember basic things, but I’m scared it’s going to get worse and I’m not going to be able to help when it gets that bad.

Is there anything I can do right now? Or any other resources I can look at that I haven’t seen?"
I'm not giving up yet. Can somebody give me advice on what to do.,5,luih6f,2,"First I need help on diagnosis. Is it just trauma or ptsd? I think it's a mild case of ptsd. I know that some people see images of the trauma in thier head. But I don't have images in my head. Instead im easily triggered. My triggers are going near places where the guy is. (Yes I actually have to endure seeing him everywhere at school. He doesn't bother me anymore. Sometimes my friends but everytime I see him I just want to lie on the ground and cry.) And hearing words like. Sexual harassment, harassment in general. Just stuff like that. I'm almost completely clueless on the subject of ptsd. I've marked a date in my diary. Where I will tell my parents of wanting to go to therapy. ""March 31st"" thats the day I will tell them and ill just brace for impact for the rest of the month. The reason why I have picked that date is because most British students go back to school on march the 8th. Giving me time to see if the situation has gotten better. To see if I can cope for another year. If I can't I tell them on that date. Also my parents do know about the ""incident"". I told them 3 years ago. But the thing is they think I've gotten over it. Which I haven't. I don't want to bring it up again. They look so upset whenever I tell them about it. Sometimes angry. I just don't want them to worry about me anymore. I'm age 13 if that helps. If you have any advice on what to do. I'd be so so grateful. I just feel like I'm stuck in a pit which is going to take years to get out of. Thanks for reading this."
Fear of church,3,lukhxe,2,"I was raised by baptists in Ohio, who forced me to go to church every single Sunday until I was 17 and told them specifically I was not going and they could not force me to go. They got angry with me and left, and didn't speak of it afterwards. Church was very scary for me growing up, being forced to sit in the adult group and being yelled at about how I was going to hell. 

Essentially now that I've grown up, my boyfriend is Catholic and wants me to attend catholic mass. At first I said no because I'm just not religious but after a while I said yes and then figured out a separate problem. 

I am TERRIFIED of church. I break down in hysterics in the car before I go in and sometimes while I'm inside as well. I've essentially tried forcing myself to sit through it but it's horribly traumatic in itself for me to do so. 

Has anyone else had this problem? Do they have coping mechanisms? I want to be able to have my wedding in a church but at this rate it doesn't look like I physically can."

I want to tell someone about my childhood trauma (HUGE TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️‼️‼️),4,ludqp2,1,"HUGE TRIGGER WARNING: 
this post discusses topics of: 
- sexual abuse 
- rape 
- repression of memories 
- female genital mutilation
- self harm 
- mental health hospitalizations 

I’m sixteen, and about three years ago I started recovering repressed memories of being raped and sexually abused by my uncle over and over again for years, starting at 5-6 years old and ending at about 8-9 years old. At first I was convinced I made these memories up, but now there’s too much evidence behind the memories. It’s bittersweet knowing that this actually happened to me. 

I’m starting to really feel the effects of the abuse now. I thought I was getting over it until i realized how scared I actually am of my past. In school we skim over subjects of CSA and rape. I thought it was normal to have panic attacks whenever I heard about the subject. Apparently not. I can’t wear certain clothes anymore. I can’t let anyone get too close to me. I shower in darkness so I don’t have to look at myself. 

My genitals are mutilated from the abuse, and I’m so scared I won’t be able to have kids. My cervix is completely numb and it’s rough, uneven, and bumpy. The inside of my vagina has so many ridges which almost blocks the actual opening. It’s my dream to have kids. I’ll be devastated if I can’t have them. 

I want nothing more than to just tell someone what happened to me when I was younger. No one knows. I mean some people do, like a couple close friends. But my parents don’t know, nor do the police or anything like that. It’s eating me up knowing that my sicko of an uncle is probably hurting other kids and ruining their lives because I’m too much of a pussy to speak up. Other kids are being hurt and it’s all my fault. 

Except I know if I say something my mother will literally go insane. It will break her. 

The uncle who sexually abused me for years is my mothers brother in law, and did the exact same kind of stuff to her. My mother, due to I believe the convincing of my father, forgave my uncle. They began contacting each other and with that, my mother let my older sister and I develop a relationship with him. 
If my mother found out that she let this happen I really think she’d just kill herself. I don’t think she’d be able to cope with the guilt. I’ve been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for the past three years because of the trauma and I know I’ll never be the same. It’ll kill my mum knowing that she could have avoided all of this. It’ll kill her. 

But at the same same time I really need to get this off my chest. For a while I’ve been counting down the days until I turn 18 so I can tell someone without them having to contact my parents, but I really don’t think I can wait until then. It’s all getting too much. 

I just don’t know what to do at this point. I really don’t. It’s either: 
A) I tell someone about what happened to me, and I’ll probably have to share more than what I’m comfortable with, and my mother will probably have an actual nervous and/or psychotic breakdown.

or 
B) I’ll stay quiet so my mum doesn’t find out, but then I’ll have to deal with it all myself when I finally do tell someone about what happened. I won’t be forced into crying to my parents for advice/help. I’ll deal with it all myself because I know that my parents won’t have to know. I also know if I keep this all inside, I’ll get more mentally unwell and I might end up losing my battle before I even turn 18. 

I just don’t know what to do. Please I’m begging you I really just need someone to help me. I’m so tired of dealing with the memories and the flashbacks and the guilt and anger and pain. I need it to go away. Please help me."
"PTSD, has someone triggered you badly by accident?",16,lu3fce,22,"How were you able to rebuild trust with that person after that trigger? Even if it was out of care and love let’s just say, was there ways for you to rebuild that trust (space, time, etc)?"
"Ten years after my relationship ended and a triggering video, I realized I might have PTSD.",0,luktnm,5,"Hi, I’m not sure I have PTSD, or if this even applies. I would like some thoughts pls. 

Firstly, even at nearly 32, I am a very sensitive person, but I try to hide it and act tough. I’ve hardened for sure over the years, but I still cry during intense confrontation, even though I don’t want to and try not to. I dunno why my body responds by crying. I also heavily attach myself to people I feel a connection to, because it’s rare and I have Borderline Personality Disorder. 

My first and second serious relationships were back-to-back between ages 17-22ish. I was very naive, oblivious, and extremely stupid. Both of the guys I dated lied all the time about big and little things, manipulated me, and one for sure emotionally cheated on me, but I fell deeply in love with them before I knew any of this. 

To this day, when I randomly think about it or when something reminds me, I can still remember the immense pain these relationships caused me. I get severe anxiety in my chest and stomach, and I cry or almost cry, despite being completely over these assholes. I wasn’t in a serious relationship again until 4-5 years after the second relationship. It took me approximately 1-2 years to finally get over them. 

Last night I went on a Boy Meets World binge and watched some clips of when Cory cheats on Topanga. This triggered my subconscious memories, and I felt the anxiety, sadness, and hatred I sometimes feel when I’m reminded. I did not expect to, or think about it prior to doing so. I think it felt worse because Cory is a perceived as a great guy, almost a perfect bf with insignificant flaws, yet still cheats. This is how I perceive all relationships; cheating/lying is inevitable. 

Moreover, I woke up this morning from a nightmare of my current bf having sex with another woman, which I periodically get. Ninety-nine percent of my dreams about him consist of cheating on me or hurting me in some way, which usually causes me to experience real emotional distress, anxiety, and pain during and after my dream. It’s become sort of an inside joke between us where I playfully scold him for cheating on me again in my dreams. He always has nice dreams about me. QuQ 

I also had a falling out with a buddy almost a year ago who I strongly attached to that still gets me very sad and hopeless when I think about it. 

These events made me realize it’s kind of similar to PTSD, which I don’t know too much about. 

The symptoms I have recognized are:

Anxiety

Stress

Sadness

Sometimes Chest Pains

Unwanted Flashbacks

Periodic BF Nightmares

Distrust/Hatred for Most People 

Loss of Optimism/Seeing the Good in People

Sometimes I feel I’m almost asexual because I’ve lost interest in men and relationships. I used to be in love with being in love, but I think it’s a waste of time and energy in comparison to life’s other offerings, like helping animals. Yes, I have a bf currently, but it’s complicated and most of the time both of us are playing video games. I think I’ve become numb to our relationship. 

I know you may be thinking “three relationships and you think you’re asexual now?” I’ve had a sprinkle of really bad encounters, predators, fling relationships, shitty brothers, and a shitty dad throughout my entire life, trauma starting as early as age four. I do not trust or expect much from men, but I don’t like most people in general.

tl;dr I’m damaged."

It’s not really fun doing something then randomly remembering my abuser cutting herself in front of me then saying I made her do it, cutting the other girl she abused, cutting me, and stuff lol (sry I kinda just awkwardly laugh about this stuff).

DAE do pettyish stubborn things because you were disregarded?,0,lur3vy,1,"I'm pretty ""low maintenance,"" meaning I'm either so numb I don't care or I'm so conditioned to just allow others to do whatever and say nothing. I also have trouble with people interrupting me or not listening to me and that hasn't helped at all.

My friends know I'm this way and usually try to encourage me to actually give my opinion and do what I want, but less so when it comes to *them.* I know they don't mean it and it's probably just habit because I'm so passive, but sometimes it hurts because they are my friends and I've talked to them about it before. Sometimes I lash out by being a little quieter if they've been interrupting me or something.

For example today we decided to order food, and they (27/28ms) decided completely themselves what to get. One mentioned burritos, I chimed in I'd been craving burritos, I was ignored, and 27 started ordering Indian food, occasionally asking 28 if he should get this or that. Didn't even look at me.

I like Indian and would've been totally cool with it had he asked me, but when he brought it home and asked why I wasn't eating I just said ""sorry yeah I wasn't feeling Indian food, I'll figure something else out"" nicely and made a salad. I kinda wanted it, but I felt like I needed to make a statement and I'm so sick of awkwardly bringing this stuff up all the time and seeming overemotional and annoying.

I know it isn't a healthy way to go about it. I wish I could just say something in the moment, but I'm afraid I'll come off bitchy or high maintenance- and I'm trying so hard to kick that instinct but it's so ingrained in me. Anyone else feel this? I know the myth of being low maintenance is pretty common"

maybe i did deserve it,3,lu9ob7,7,i was sexually abused from 5-10 years old. i feel like it’s kind of my fault though. i would encourage it and would not tell him to stop. but as i got older i started to have a problem with it. he came into my room late at night and touched my chest and i threatened to scream if he didn’t leave my room. but is it my fault for encouraging him to do it? i knew it was wrong but i still encouraged him to do it.
"If I get a fright, it puts me in a bad mood",5,lu1fy0,4,"I was in a great mood, day going well. Then my dog barked in the car and it was so loud, I yelled at her, I thought I'd pulled a muscle in my chest I jumped so hard. Then my husband jammed on the breaks in the Starbucks drive through because the jerk in front of him did, this frightened me too.

After that, I physically felt my mood change. I was shaky, I wanted quiet, I felt worried, I felt like crying, emotional. I feel bad because I was in such a great mood before this happened. I feel bad for my husband having to deal with these sudden mood changes just because I got a fright. 

Does this happen to anyone else?"
Not sure what I am looking for...,3,lu48qs,3,"I had a rough childhood but what really bothers me is an experience I had in the army while in Afghanistan. Fellow service members are not always the best support. I remember to this day the incident the timeline. The hours and days on guard after the fear and shock of my joes and those above me. Some days I relate to it, it may not always be relevant. I don't remember all of it but I know I was shook that day. I did what I had to for me and mine. I stood strong I acted when others were unsure but honestly I was scared that morning. I thought that was going to be it. I had just a second where I decided I would try I would be ready for the enemy I knew I would lay down and let them take anyone else...."
dealing with panic attacks,1,lu3op0,8,"I was diagnosed with ptsd in November after a shooting at my apartment. I had been in a school shooting in high school and had previous trauma from that. Unfortunately I live in a very gang active area and there’s a lot of guns, so it can be really hard to avoid gunshots from nearby (the sound of them). I’ve tried the whole telling myself I’m safe etc, but I can’t seem to calm myself down. 

What are your guys’ best calming down activities or thoughts? I take hydroxyzine for anxiety, but that isn’t immediately helpful."
PTSD School,0,luapto,2,"Don’t you ever hate when you get in trouble at school and the teachers are mean to you. I remember a lot of those moments of my life and I still feel regret. I remember in 3rd Grade I went into the school during recess without permission for water a teacher came in and said “Did you tell your teacher you’re in here” I said no because I was being honest and she told me to leave. Then a year later the same teacher was a chaperone for a field trip and was being mean to me and yelling at me. I did nothing at all and she kept being mean and grabbed my arm for most of the field trip. I felt really sick. 

Part 2.
In first grade I got in trouble because I didn’t understand something well and I didn’t know anything so when the teacher asked me what did another kid do while the time off I just said what another kid said “He peed” I was sent to the principals office repeatedly to tell more of what happened and go taken outside to tell the principal what happened then I realized the teacher only treated hispanic and black kids bad it still hurts me to this day. I said yes and no to stuff I didn’t even understand. Kids are kids you have to realize that. You can scar kids by getting them in trouble. Just punish them nicely."
Disgusted by promiscuity,46,ltm9k0,14,"I totally know this is my own issue. People have their own bodies and should be able to do whatever they want with them. But my trauma makes me FREAK OUT whenever I'm around sexual promiscuity and I don't know why.

I hate it. All these sexual posts on reddit. All these nudes people post on here. I can't be friends with those who sleep around with different people. It disgusts me. And that makes me incredibly ashamed of myself. I was never like this before my trauma :(

I'm by no means a prude with my fiance, we're in to all kinds of kinky stuff, but I'm comfortable with it because it's just between us, nobody else. It would make my skin crawl to discuss it with any other person on this planet."
I am FRUSTRATED and ANGRY with the stigma that people have.,4,lu2085,4,"I got assaulted about two years ago at work by a client, and they repeatedly hit me in the face. It caused me a lot of emotional trauma and caused me a lot of grief, stress, anger, and all the other words that describes the feelings of trauma. I am mostly over it, but my PTSD and anxiety over the situation flares up every once in a while. My brother has been home from school since the start of the year, due to the pandemic. A few times he ""pretended"" to punch me in the face, and I have said every time I don't like it but he mocks me and says I am making a big deal over something that is just pretend. It reminds me of my assault. Then, today he did it again and I finally stood up for myself and told them to stop, because I have trauma around assault, and even though I know he would never actually hit me I have really had enough. If it was an accident, or if they did it and then immediately apologize afterwards that would be a different story. But they don't care. 

My mom was in the same room and I strictly said to STOP and that I have trauma around aggression, and she mocks me. I then raise my voice again and tell him to stop mocking me and respect that I don't like it. Of course, I get in trouble and yelled at because ""it was only a joke"" and ""I am overreacting"". They weren't the one who dealt with the physical and emotional pain of assault. I seriously am fed up with getting told I am too sensitive, or for getting in trouble for expressing when my feelings are hurt for something that my brother is doing. They didn't work shifts after and face extreme anxiety levels. They didn't feel like their career was ruined because of it. They didn't experience burn out and imposter syndrome. They didn't have to deal with bad dreams and flashbacks from the event for months. 

I feel so frustrated. Nobody is respectful of this situation in my house, and of course I get painted as the bad guy for explaining how their actions upset me. My boyfriend understands and completely supports me, but I just wish for once people (especially my family of all people) could have compassion for their loved one who suffers from PTSD."
Do you hear the music too?,5,ltxidk,6,"Hi all. I am not officially diagnosed yet (seeing a doctor soon) but I do very much believe I have ptsd. What I’m wondering is if this symptom is common- music. My brain literally starts playing music when I think of stressful things. It’s so loud it drowns out my thoughts until I just give up. It’s like trying to talk to your friend at the bar, but you’re standing next to a super loud speaker and all you can see is their lips moving. I think it’s a defense mechanism against myself basically. It’s frustrating, and leaves me feeling cloudy and like I can’t work through what I’m trying to process. I have a very busy and demanding life with a baby so I quite literally don’t have the time to deal with  my trauma right now and I think my subconscious knows that so it stops me from thinking too hard.. idk. Just wondering if I’m alone in this experience."
Relationships and long term recovery,1,lu7dkq,3,"So I have about 7 years since I was diagnosed. My trauma is related to a well publicized tragedy, and it has always been difficult to avoid constant media updates/memoirs/Hollywood renditions of it. But otherwise I’ve managed to live safely thanks to my therapist, my friends, and my family. One thing that has been immensely difficult is romantic relationships. I find that my boyfriends from before my diagnosis are still supportive friends to me, but every guy I dated after is unable to handle me. My trauma impacts relationships in that I have to manage my anxiety and sleep first. I don’t have trouble managing a relationship otherwise. But guys either want to save me or they want nothing to do with my recovery(I had an ex tell me that no one was going to care if I was struggling so I immediately got out of there). I hate the idea of someone saving me. I put in all this work, my friends loved me so much, I don’t need someone to come in and act as if there’s something wrong here. I just want someone to let me keep coping and trying my hardest. I think no one with PTSD has answers and that’s sort of what it is. The point is something immensely overwhelming happened to us and it can’t be made sense of. I went to work one day and ended the day having to escape a tragedy. I wont ever understand why and I don’t need to know because it’s too dark for me to comprehend.

I know because my friends love me that someone else will love me too. My recovery has to come before anything else and I know I can do that. But I feel so little self esteem when it comes to dating. I feel like I have to tell someone up front that I have ptsd, partly so they know why I’m weird and partly so they can leave if it’s too hard for them. I find myself dating friends of friends so I can feel a certain level of safety but that doesn’t work that way I have found. A couple weeks ago I downloaded a dating app just to try it out and way more guys liked me than I knew ever would. I didn’t last long because I realize I’m too sensitive, but I really don’t know how to begin a relationship because I assume no one will want to be here. I’m wondering if anyone out there struggles with this or if they are with someone who manages to be supportive. I’m tired of my friends getting their hopes up every time I connect with a guy just to find out I’m letting them down again because he couldn’t hang."
Free online support groups for PTSD?,6,ltvzso,2,Hi! I was wondering if anyone knows about any free online support groups for PTSD? (This is not for a veteran.) Thank you very much.

Do you ever fully get over trauma?,6,ltvf9n,6,I was talking to my therapist yesterday about how I feel like I should be over my trauma after thirteen years and he told me no one ever gets over it. I know you can learn to cope and manage it better but it feels like a slap in the face that no matter what I do I won't ever be completely over what happened. What are your opinions on it?

So about my meds...,1,lu1m0r,7,"So they've really reduced my flashbacks. I no longer have the graphic, vivid nightmares, and my mind doesn't wander as much during the day. It's a huge relief and I hadn't even realised they were PTSD flashbacks before. I've had them for most of my teen and adult life. I even had people tell me it was normal. I am so relieved to have them gone/almost gone.

However I'm tired as heck, sleeping for up to 20 hours a day sometimes, and I still don't have a lot of motivation. I feel pretty low.

I'm on venlafaxine 37.5mg. Are there other options?"
CPTSD symptoms vs regular PTSD symptom differences,23,ltj5nb,19,"I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD for a while now, but I still get confused about my symptoms. 

I’ve gotten to known some people that have PTSD after suffering through a horrible event as an adult. I always seem to notice how their symptoms are different than with my CPTSD symptoms.

I guess I wanted to know more about the differences in symptoms between someone who has PTSD and suffered through a traumatic event once in their adulthood vs the CPTSD symptoms of those who had to withstand repeated and long term abuse in their childhood. 

I find myself questioning my diagnosis a lot because I feel like I don’t relate much to the regular PTSD symptoms. Am I the only one?"
Looking for interview,8,ltoirp,11,"I'm a 16 Y/O Male, I am currently writing a book, and to get a better understanding and grasp of how PTSD affects people, I'd like to interview people to learn how they first fought with PTSD, how it's being treated, and how their daily life is with it. If anyone would oblige me in this, I would be very grateful."

Here’s your more detailed TW: I’ll be talking about online child grooming. This will be venting but feel free to comment.



When I was 10-11 I was playing animal jam. There was this place where you’d be peoples friend, parent, fake spouse, etc. I forget how it happened just that our first interaction was there. He gave me gifts. And you have to understand these were the rare type that people would sell for real money to people. We’d do normal things in the game together. And then it got weirder. Like just having my character dance. And then “adopting” a child. Going on fake dates. I had been told to avoid these things but a person was showing me affection during a hard time in my life. And then he had me (I’ll call it roleplay) with him. I said no and he threatened to leave or take stuff away from me. And when I didn’t know things in the (roleplay) he explained them. When he asked for my personal information I knew what was happening and I left. But he got angry. He told me a lot of stuff about how my parents would be mad. I never told my parents till a month ago because I knew part of it was my fault for not stopping it sooner. They just knew I had been addicted to the game. What’s worse is that the reporting feature on the game doesn’t work and they draw people in safety wise with the sense of “National Geographic). The worst part is I don’t fully remember it. It was months. I can remember the game music and a few details but not the worse. But I want to remember it because limbo sucks."
Can too much internal stress lead to exhaustion?,5,ltqc4q,3,"I know I’m not having a depressive episode, and I know it’s not ‘the virus that shall not be named’ I’m just so physically and mentally exhausted and I’m looking for advice on how to try and feel better. 
It’s hard to concentrate and anything that was aching slightly aches a lot now.  I is feel like I could sleep for days and don’t want to. I’m too tired to even eat and too nauseous to try. 
Aside from eventually having food, are their any other simple tricks and tips I should be aware of or anything concerning?
I don’t have a lot of resources so I can only do a few things by myself right now and I don’t have family or friends who can physically be here to help.  (Already in therapy and take meds, no more can be done on that front)
Any suggestions would be appreciated"
"TW: mention of fighting, bl*od & h*ir pulling, ab*se",1,lty9za,0,"yesterday my abuser attacked me out of nowhere.. like literally for no reason. for context he's my family member and he suddenly attacked me. he pulled my hair out, dug his nails onto my hands and back of my head and kept kicking me repeatedly in my stomach.. plus more but i'm not trying to have a flashback rn. of course, i fought back and defended myself and got myself out of that situation and now he's thankfully gone far away from me but i'm just so fed up. yknow? i was doing pretty okay and distracting myself, especially with the comments you guys left on my last post it really helped me and made me understand i'm not alone. But it's like every time i try to move forward or i'm even nearly happy, more trauma adds on if that makes sense. I just.. feel so tired. I'm tired of crying, tired of the flashbacks etc. if you read my last post, tomorrow is my mother's birthday and i feel so alone without her."
I'm embarrassed to use the word 'triggered',332,lswpgh,76,"I assume most of us here have things that either set off a state of panic, or immediately put us in an anxious mindset, where a flashback is more likely to take ahold.

The best word to use for that is a 'trigger', but it's been so co-opted by people being dramatic in political discourse that it just sounds silly to me. The moment I even begin a sentence with 'I got triggered by...' it just makes me cringe.

Is there anyone else who feels the same, or have I just spent too much time on Twitter?"
My PTSD is so bad right now I’m on the edge of my seat all the time.,29,ltc27c,12,"I am 54 years old and have had PTSD most my life.  It really didn’t show its ugly head until until A7 years ago when I had a near death experience.

My PTSD “causes” range from early childhood sexual abuse to being bullied to becoming a sexual object to 2 date rapes to being a victim of a malignant narcissist to losing my parents within 3 months of each other to a couple of near death crap.  So much to unpack.

I have gone through periods of time when I can control my thoughts and be positive.  Now, I’m just at rock bottom.  I am triggered by damn near anything.  I am always at the edge of my seat (literally) and last night I caught myself rocking.

I have had a hell of a time with my mental health journey.  I also have depression and was not actually diagnosed until well into my 20’s.

I am trying so hard to get trauma therapy.  Something always gets in the way.  So tired of living like this!  I just want help!  Uggggg

Don’t worry about anything drastic, I have my beautiful 23 year old daughter living with me and we are best friends.  Someday she will leave and get married.  I hope I am better by then."
(TW: DEATH THREATS) my ptsd manifests in anger & i want to threaten and hurt whoever triggers it,1,ltuf2m,1,"sometimes they have it coming when they purposefully invalidate my abuse (a trigger) but sometimes someone wont know i have ptsd and will accidentally trigger it & i want to hurt them or tell them to kill themselves. what do i do about this? its not an immediate reaction, its only when it gets really bad, when i'm having an attack. regardless, i dont want it to happen, otherwise, im a pacifist, so it feels wrong. what do i do? sometimes i dont see it coming so i cant always leave the situation in time."
How to cope with flashbacks when the process of grounding is a trigger itself?,1,lttaon,0,"I have flashbacks about being (trapped) with my ex, who was abusive to me in ways that I’m still coming to understand. However, he had PTSD and flashbacks himself, but would use it against me in order to make me feel guilty and do whatever he wanted and not leave him, despite him hurting me and me being so scared of him every day whether he was there or not. 

On a bad day, almost any reminder of him will send me into flashbacks or a panic attack, and I’ve been trying the usual techniques to cope with them. The catch is that my ex would talk incessantly about grounding and those other techniques, so when I try to do those to cope, they just make it worse since they’re just as connected to what happened as any other trigger, if not more. 

If anyone has any suggestions of what I can do or what might help, I would really appreciate it. So far it’s just been like a vicious cycle that I can’t get out of, since the only tools I have to come out of it just do the opposite of what they’re supposed to do."
I'm stuck in a thought,3,ltmdwu,0,"I keep thinking over and over ""How is it NOT selfish for me to want people to give me more attention and love and do things for me and give me gifts?"" friends do their best to do this but it never feels like enough. my friends say this is trauma from growing up with a sister who always put down my interests, plus we always shared a birthday so I never got a day to myself as a kid to celebrate me. now it feels like nothing is enough to satisfy this hunger for attention and love. isn't this selfish? isn't it? I can't stop thinking this and no one is awake to stop it from cycling over and over in my head."

Does anyone here ever made a SGB treatment?,2,ltmhhw,0,"I just saw an clip from 60minutes, about the SGB treatment in the US, for PTSD. Now, I wonder if anyone here does have experience with SGB, and if one can get a shot of it in Germany?"
I hate what I become,2,ltkqrc,4,"As I kid I was not only physically and mentally abused by my moms then second husband but he also molested me. He put my mom in the hospital with a broken back and 30 years later I can’t forget it. I still remember him telling me I’m too ugly to smile.. 
After my mom left him she became abusive to be blaming me for everything wrong in her life. 
Later on I was nearly raped in a train station but got away as he was removing his pants.. only to come home and have my then boyfriend get upset because I did not want sex. 
I ended up with a guy who ignored me left him for another that basically ended up doing the same and I left him. He became an asshole and toms me I should kill myself. 
My next boyfriend put me through a living nightmare for 5 months because he went into psychosis due to drug use and Schizophrenia that runs in his family. He beat me till I learned to defend myself he broke my things and drove me to near insanity myself trying to help him and doing what he asked. Now that he’s gone I still wake up screaming not just from him though but from everything that is my life. 
Now I’m single no friends about to loose my car and I’m at a loss.. oh I’m coping with meth and dint care too much if I live or die."
I was a victim of sextortion at 13 years old. Is it possible I have PTSD?,16,lt7frc,11,So when I was 13 I was catfished by a guy pretending to be a girl and tricked into sending nudes (i deeply regret it you don’t need to tell me) The person then started blackmailing me telling me if i didn’t send again they would send the pics to all my friends. I actually can’t remember if i sent again or anything. At this time I also met a dude online who claimed to be playing college basketball and I believed him and we became friends. Turned out the girl was actually him and I blocked both of them. He kept trying to make accounts and harass me so the stress got too much and while crying i told my parents. We all made the decision to just try and move on and not get the police involved since it seemed like they weren’t contacting me much anymore (and other reasons). For the last few years they’ve contacted me here and there sometimes it’s obvious it’s them and other times it seems like a kid my age. The more time passes the less he contacts me. But anytime someone adds me on snapchat I wonder if it’s him. It’s been a few years but I’m still so anxious about it. Is it possible to have PTSD without physical abuse?? Is this PTSD or is it just a thing that I shouldn’t be worried about?
trigger!!! im (26f) having a hard time with my ex (29f),7,ltduuf,2,"okay so me and my ex gf have been dating on and off for the last 3 years.

there's so much ptsd involved in our relationship strictly due to the physical abuse I've dealt w. phone breaking, choking, window smashing, hitting, verbal abuse but I need help maybe with moving on.. what are some of your tips.. this is my story for the mot part. many violent fights were left out.

we met thru my best friend & were only friends for the first year of knowing each other. well I started realizing that I in fact like girls and wanted her opinion on the matter because I was raised christian and felt... dirty, I guess is the term. it was a huge issue for me int he beginning. I struggled for about 2 years if god still loves me for doing this but anyways I would break up with her a lot due to this reason along many others. continuing my personal backstory I am incredibly jealous IF given reason. I got her a job w me at my work place a few months after talking but nothing serious, but as we worked together we clearly started something and she eventually told me she loves me in like mid April of 2018. I was NOT ready tbh it was only like 3 weeks into being together romantically, we hadn't had sex yet of anything either. and don't get me wrong I did like her a LOT but I wasn't prepared to say I love you because it was so quick. it confused me. anyways back story w her is she's a kid at heart, very friendly unless she's not. she has this...outburst side of her. she's quick to throw out I love you (which is another Eason I didn't wanna say it back) she's a violent alcoholic, but she's fun guess. its your typical toxic relationship in the least. anyways I got her a job at my place of work as the cook & she was able to make friends w all the teachers because she had more free time not being w the kids. which I didn't care until one day me, my ex & about 5 other of us women were all hanging out in the lobby & she walked up to the lady who worked the front desk & said ""tara\* you're such beautiful woman"" and I was like... hold up no this bitch didn't & everyone else looked at me like uhm are you gonna like...oof embarrassing basically. it got awkward idk. that's when it all started. that's whenever I became a jealous psycho it seemed. I didn't leave her but I would leave her at this point because when she would drink it would get really bad. despite all that I ended unmoving in with her around august 2018 cus we worked together and lets be honest I was staying there more than my own house. in those few months it got really bad between us. just too close. we would fight our asses off. we ended up quitting our job together in November 2018 the same day cus I was that supportive gf even tho everyone knew wtf was happening behind closed doors. I got really suicidal during that time of not working and living in her house which didn't feel like home, but more so like an uncomfortable trip to your aunt you see every 10 years, but everyday. I ended up finding a new job & also found her texting her ex gf of over 10 years ago so I didn't think much of it but yeah she tried adding me on fb too which I thought was weird as hell. so anyways I mentioned being suicidal and I went to act on it thanksgiving day 2018 but came home cus there were ambulances at the river already which pissed me off. but she didn't care she laughed at me. I began having panic attack for the first time which wa the scariest thing id ever experienced in my life so far. thought I was laying on my death bed from a heart attack every time. she tried helping me thru them but her presence made it so much worse. its Christmas time all of this happening w panic attacks and then I started feeling HOrribleeeee and was going to the hospital so much for a uti that ended up Turing into a kidney infection so I had my parents pick me up in the middle of a snow storm since my car wouldn't have made it thru & looked at her and asked her if we were gonna be okay cus she was staying home & she said of course and hugged me. it wasn't all hate or else I wouldn't have stayed. I left the house and went to the hospital for my mom to convince me to break up w her & I did because at the time the drs were telling me that I have chlamydia before even got test results back. so I lit her phone up on impulse & left her. 4 days later I passed kidney stones. I never had an std. the next day my parents take me to move my things out of her house, still under the impression that she cheated and I have an std, but she wouldn't let me get my things and threw me down, & as I was trying to leave her mom pushed me down the stairs. so I called the cops cus my ex is scary af and I was worried shed rip or burn my stuff or just never give it back. I got a cop to escort me to get my things but later that night she would text me things like ""I know where you'll be sleeping, ima crawler, have fun closing your eyes"" yada yada so I got a restraining order on her cus she's stalked her exes in her past and I didn't wanna chance it. needles to say the restraining order didn't keep us apart in fact it just let up this past January lol. we got together in February & had to hide it from everyone for MONTHS to a year depending on the person. its 2019 now and I leave for vacation feb 27-march5th to visit my good friends in another state. she's acting weird as hell w me while im there. not communicating well. the last night I was there an old friend of mine who dated my ex & helped me thur the restraining order process against her, messaged me asking if I had spilled beans about what she said about the ex gf who I found messaging my ex that I mentioned & of course I said no but it made sense. I called my ex out on it & she said she's not cheating on me after screaming at me. I get home & we go on a date to see each other and whenever I got home for the night she said I gotta tell you something & tells me she saw her ex gf while I was gone but nothing happened. BITCH WHO YOU LYIN TOOOO. who's ex gf comes over to just hang out. lol she told me she was getting her ex away from her current gf who was drugging her. lol what. so I left her & it ate me up for forever. it still eats me tf alive. id find notes in her room from this chick n everything. so now im like cool you're cheating on me and we still would see eachother maybe once a week for months at a time. together but barely. and then my dad started getting sick. its now November 2019 . dads got cancer. I start getting lonely as hell. I start being myself and allowing ,myself to see my friends because I needed them. wed go out & my ex was never a jealous person at all when it came to my friends. did she like them? no but she was never one to say you can't see them. so I started going out and having fun that I hadn't had in what felt like a good 2 years. im gaining confidence back & my manic bipolar starts to flare so I leave her after a night out because she was boring me at this point. I started talking to someone the next day who I felt was nice, we went on a date & my ass was such a drunk mess he ghosted me which I was fine w. a few weeks go by and im working for this lady baby siting for a full week going completely insane & thinking about how its almost Christmas & my dads sicks but here tf I am, so I got lonely and went back to her for like... a month maybe? left her again. was partying. dads rapidly getting worse off. get back with her, break up over stupid things that I didn't wanna deal with. im a go w the flow person and she's really needy and has specific things she does that annoy tf outta me so at this time period I was leaving her and getting back with her every 3 weeks. & that's how its been ever since. stay for 3 weeks, leave for 3 weeks. I ended up dating this guy during quarantine for about a month and half a few weeks after me and my ex split. one day I woke up and was like ew fuck this guy & wen to see her instantly that morning. stayed with her for a day & left her the next. about a week later I start dating that guy again out of boredom. I leave him 2 weeks later for good to be w Lauren for what I was hoping for good. she hated me & I did what I could to repair what had happened. she told me I was a slut & I cheated on her. I mean we would be having good time and then BOOM ""YOURE A SLUT!!!! FUCK YOU SLUT!!"" and I felt horrible. I knew I didn't cheat on her but I felt BAD cus I knew how devastated I was whenever she told me about her ex staying w her whenever I was out of state. so I did what I could until I couldn't take the name calling anymore and told her to leave. we were broken up the whole summer of 2020 and got back in September to find her high as a god damn kite & in a psychosis induced by what she tells me is wee but I know its from meth. (I don't do meth & didn't think she was the type either but I was WAYYY wrong) so anyways im trying to be there for her while she's down and out but I could handle how she was treating me as such scum. she deels with grandeur delusions & already thought herself as a princess even before her psychosis so it made it so much worse. she ended up going to many mental hospitals to help her figure out who she is. well one of them was like bitch you're crazy & gave her a halloo shot which messed her up so bad for about a month and a half. I was worried for her so whenever I figured out she was in the hospital I reached out to her on twitter & basically took care of her for that month and a half. the people she talks so highly of were no where yet im a pos for helping idk. this girl has my heart. im hopeless and helpless. I just found text messages from the same ex gf I've been dealing with this while relationship. I want to cry cus I just want us to be okay. we've gone thru so much together and somei=times our relationship it GREAT. sometimes we just laugh our asses off together and shack up for days. but idk man she's flirty and im too insecure for that. someone who preaches monogamy & has made me feel like a...idfk.... a pos.. the worst person in her life. she tells everyone im a cheater even when were together. to embarrass me infant of whoever. its toxic yes I know. but I need help. I don't know what to do. my dad is dying. im crying. im alone. I have no insurance so I can't afford to talk to anyone. I can't keep going to my friend every 5 seconds when I feel low. no one wants to deal w someone who's not happy all the time. and im using it. because she is even still my comfort. she knows me inside and out, but she lives a complete double life from what she tells me. and its upsetting.. im REAL, I may fuck up but if I do I own up instantly. I've always told her instantly if I fuck up despite the repercussions. I keep going back to her because she has a hold on me. she acts really nice at first and then switches up. how do I get over this? im going insane. there so many people who I could ""date"" but I want her. she's never tried getting back w me. its always been me. this last time I left her I had to sneak out of the house in fear shed hear me leave. she told me im a slutt and im the one who's cheating on her.. heard it from someone I've met one time for 3 seconds before. she's posting me everywhere. her fb, twitter, yadayada. idc if someone thinks im a cheater btw. let the rumors go its kid stuff. I need help on how you let go.. or what you did to get away."
For those of you who have therapists (and are okay with sharing) what do your therapists do to help with the trauma?,8,ltatsz,10,"Sorry if I used the wrong flair. I am looking for advice not giving it. But the title basically says it all. I am trying to find different ways to manage the PTSD because what my therapist is having me do doesn't seem to be working.

When does the therapy start to “work”? Does it ever? TW: car accident,2,lthj4f,0,"I’ve been involved in 2 car accidents, both extremely traumatic for me and have been in therapy for my PTSD for a year now. My fear is usually contained (for the most part) until I am actually in a car. I’ve tried meditating for 4-5 minutes before actually driving, deep breathing during the drive, and taking breaks. I’ve gotten to a point where when I am not in a car, I rarely think about it (though the dreams are intense still). 
The fear and severe stress is getting worse than it was a year ago. Hyperventilation, heart palpitations, screaming, crying, panicking, the whole bit happens nearly Everytime I am on the road (passenger or driver) I’ve been driving everyday to try and expose myself more but I have happened upon some health issues and I am concerned my constant stress is causing some of my symptoms to flare up. 
So, in your experience, is it worth it to keep exposing myself? Is there another therapy besides medication I could try (I am extremely sensitive to meds). Thank you!"
Medical traumas... where do I start with the invalidation,5,ltarx6,12,"Like yes, I understand you too have been in a hospital before but you did not experience what I did.

You were not threatened to go through with anything you expressed a very clear desire you did not want to do.

You were not verbally abused and did not have disgusting things said to you when it was thought you were too drugged up to hear.

You were not talked to by a fantasising creep about what he was going to do at every stage of drugging you.

You were not forced to strip naked in a room full of people when you said you felt uncomfortable doing so.

You were not forced to piss with someone else in the room holding your hand, all while treating you like you are 4.

Yes, I know you went into a hospital and came out fine but some of us didn’t. Why is that so hard to grasp??"
I need advice,6,lta8lk,1,"When I was 15 I met a guy who was 2 years older than me. I hated myself at the time so when he showed interest it was the most exciting thing. He was really nice to me for the first two weeks and when I finally said I’d have sex with him it changed. He had sex with me but wouldn’t kiss me and wouldn’t stop when he saw me crying, he also tried to film it without me knowing. I went and saw him a few more times because I thought he would like me, but he would just make me do things and then kick me out. His ex girlfriend would tell people she was going to bash me and girls from school found out and hated me because of it. It was really one of the most traumatic experience of my life. Now every year for the past three years I experience major depression and hate myself so much around the exact same time of year, I feel disgusted with myself and it triggers me to fall back into an eating disorder. Could I be experiencing this at the same time every year because of the incident or is that not really something that would happen ?"
Do I possibly have PTSD from college and an IUD fiasco?,1,ltjx33,0,"Edit: adding TW (pain, isolation, possible abuse)

Hello. I (25yr old female), am still figuring out if I actually have PTSD, and I wanted some input.

1. From 2013-2015 I was in a music program. During this time I was slapped across the face at school, was isolated from friends and family, emotionally manipulated from a former fling, dealt with sexism and harassment. Yup, all that in two years. Memories became so bad that I left my career due to anxiety and flashbacks. I was told to look into PTSD, but no one formally said I had PTSD, but was dealing with trauma. In your (the reader) opinion, is it trauma or PTSD? 

2. My IUD insertion was so painful that we took it out within an hour. Over the last three weeks I disconnected, avoided intimacy with my husband, and dealt with pain and discomfort daily. It does not help that my regular doctor didn't seem to be empathetic  towards my feelings. Words like endometriosis and pelvic inflammation disease popped up, making me more scared. Same question, is this showing signs of PTSD? 

I'm so lost on what I'm dealing with. I would greatly appreciate insight and opinions. Thanks in advance."
So angry (tw: drug use),2,ltgd3t,0,"I have PTSD (diagnosed about 12 yrs ago) and part of that trauma is negligence and abandonment. Around Thanksgiving someone who had always said I was a good friend to him decided I do not have any value anymore. They said they needed to be alone but I learned they have not been alone, they just decided that I am not worth their time anymore because of politics (I choose to stay out of it, which is apparently worse than having the wrong politics).

And he has said some extremist things that horrified me.

Yet I refuse to believe I did nothing wrong even though everyone, including my therapist, says he is at fault for putting conditions on his caring. I refuse to believe he is a bad person though he has said some horrifying things and the way he ditched me was cruel. I am so angry cause I cannot reconcile any of this. He was one of the few people in my life that made me feel like I mattered and then just like that I meant nothing. And I want to scream and cry and tell him how dare you.

I wanna die.

In April I will be two years sober from cocaine but damn I am really craving a massive binge right now. My anxiety is getting so much worse, I am lashing out easily and I hate feeling this way.

my genitals are ruined from being raped and being on lexapro. i don’t want to do this anymore,2,ltf16q,7,"being raped and being on lexapro ruined my genitalia, and it’s ruining my state of mind. please help

hey yall. not sure how to start this so i think i’ll just get into it. at 12/13 years old, i (f19) started feeling deep depression due to extreme bullying at school. i started therapy, and then lexapro at 17. my anxiety decreased, but i now also had an extremely low sex drive plus genital numbness. i decided that was better than daily panic attacks and constant depression, so i took the pill regularly and properly. 

when i was 18, i was unfortunately raped several times by my long-term boyfriend, who i considered to be the love of my life. what was left of a sex drive was now destroyed, now matched with even deeper depression and incredibly, incredibly low self worth regarding my body and my sex life. 

not long after that, i was diagnosed with spastic pelvic walls, or an extreme form of vaginismus. ive always been incredibly ‘tight’ for a lack of better words, not able to fit a tampon, usually passing out from extreme panic and pain when i tried. i’m not able to have proper sex because of it. the only time i’ve been penetrated was by my ex when he would rape me, and that was the worst pain of my life, physically and emotionally. 

i was then also diagnosed from ptsd from the rape and the bullying. 

i’m now 19, and i’m in a happy committed relationship. i love him deeply, and he’s a great partner. however, i find myself so depressed that i can’t provide for him sexually. not only for his sake, but for mine. my entire genital region is broken, and it makes me feel like less of a woman for it. i understand that a working vagina (or any vagina for that matter) is not what makes a woman, but it’s the only way i can describe it since there’s no proper term for female emasculation. 


ive started wellbutrin and stopped lexapro around two weeks ago, and im very anxious to not see any improvement. i also start pelvic floor therapy next month to help with my pelvis spasms. 


i understand that it can take up to three months, but im looking for reassurance from others in the same boat.


i can’t keep doing this anymore. i hate myself and body, and suicide is constantly on my mind. if anyone has dealt with this or something similar, i’d love to hear your advice. thank you :)

(please do not tell me that sex isn’t that important. ive had several people tell me it’s okay to not have it in our lives, but this is way deeper than that. this is now a physical issue.)"
Can I get PTSD from going to the dentist?,1,lth58b,1,"Hello, a year ago I went to public dentistry for tooth decay and the operation was so painful and stressful. The tooth drill even drilled my gum for a second because I couldn't endure the pain any longer and moved my jaw. After that experience, I have always gone to a private dental clinic. It is much expensive but at least they don't torture me or treat me like shit. But I still feel extremely nervous and anxious when I am getting my tooth drilled. Could this count as PTSD or am I just overthinking it in my brain?"
How do I stop the day mares?,1,ltgpnr,2,"2 years ago I lost some fingers in a wood working accident. I've started wood working again because i love doing it.

My body reacts negatively to sex,52,lsqozu,4,"Throwaway because family members could see this. 

When I (27F) was 15, I had my first real relationship with a younger boy (14M). Long story short, it turned bad very quickly. Sexual and physical assault was involved. We broke up a year later.

My first sexual experience wasn’t really a pleasant one. It was with him. He convinced me to lie to my mom about my whereabouts, leave my house at 4am, take the light rail, walk to his house by myself, and meet him at his house. I did it, we fought, and then he kicked me out of the house on my own. 

Fast forward to today. I’ve been with my current partner for 8 years. To be clear, he has not harmed me in any manner. Lately, I have noticed that whenever my partner and I are intimate, my body will involuntarily jerk in various ways during sex as if it’s screaming “NO!”

Without being too detailed, I just have a few examples:

-One of my hands will shoot up and lightly shove at his chest. Not harshly, but noticeable enough to where he’s stopped to ask if I’m okay 

-My hands have shot around his wrist to prevent him from getting closer to me (intimately) 

-If it starts to feel like I’m being pleasured too much, I will suddenly say “stop” and then switch positions. I just can’t be the one being pleasured and I don’t know why. 

I have a feeling it’s due to that relationship. I have blocked a lot of those memories out (apparently he pushed me down a flight of stairs at school in front of people but I seriously don’t remember). I don’t really know what to do about this other than therapy, which I can’t really afford right now. But I feel like when it comes to sex, I don’t have control over my body or my mind. 

Any guidance?"

I was recently diagnosed with PTSD,76,lsk0e8,41,"Hi there, I was recently diagnosed with ptsd that has been caused by my childhood. My parents are alcoholics, and honestly I never even thought that I had it. I'm still wrapping my brain around it and trying to process it because I had always just chalked it up to just *having a shitty life*. But now I'm starting to understand my triggers, some atleast.
I had just started therapy and im coming to terms that most of my issues are from my mother because I'm basically her emotional punching bag. I have yet to even tell her, I mean, how do you properly tell someone ""hey, because of you I have ptsd"". Like I don't hate her, but she has (and some other people) have definitely messed me up emotionally. She's done some things that I will never forgive her for, if I'm being honest. I'm still angry at all of the things she has put he through, and she will never see what she has done. She's become this very selfish.. victim playing person and it's impossible to (most days) have a conversation with her.
I'm still trying to process this and I hope therapy helps me understand but just coming to terms with this is so.. insane and kinda hurts more than when I just thought I had depression and anxiety. The more I realize the more angry I get, it's frustrating as hell at this point."
"If not me, who? How does one learn to trust?",2,lt4ops,0,"Of several traumas, two featured a theme in which multiple people that I considered friends and had mutual expectations of supporting eachother, failed me, left me vulnerable to be hurt. Did nothing to stop the harm, did nothing to apprehend the involved party, or any response was far too late to be of any meaning.    

After the first trauma, I told myself if there was a second time, it would go different.            

The second trauma was functionally identical. However it brought more hopelessness. That, those who I trusted to stand up for me, did not.     

These traumas do not pair well in addition to childhood abuse.    

Family has hurt me.     
Friends have been complacent.   
Strangers have hurt me.   
Heck, sometimes I hurt me.    

I am the only person who can protect myself, but being hypervigilant is counterproductive.    

How am I supposed to learn to trust others?     
To feel safe?    

Not having safety has been the only constant in my life."
Can you make up with your abuser?,1,lt8yfx,1,"I have someone in my life who I dated in high school. We aren’t close but I’ve invited him to parties in recent years and I get along with him. Our breakups, probably at least 4 total, were very rough. The first was because he’d forced me into sexual acts, both physically and through manipulation. I broke up with him, we got back together because I was 17 and a survivor of worse abuse so it didn’t register with me that his behavior was unacceptable. The second time, he cheated on me 2 days before prom. The third was because of constant gaslighting and emotional abuse and me “just getting through” intimacy. The 4th was not necessarily a breakup because we weren’t “together” but I did halfheartedly cut him off because he assaulted me in my car. I didn’t speak to him for about 2 years apart from the occasional text from him basically expecting me to tell him everything he did wrong because he couldn’t remember and needed to know for his 12 step program. He added me on facebook in 2019 and i invited him to my NYE party and a few get togethers after. I just kind of set everything aside because it “wasn’t that bad” and “it was years ago” but now i’m thinking of it as if this had happened to a friend and i know i wouldn’t forgive him. i’m starting to wonder if i blew everything out of proportion because if it was as bad as i said it was, how could i be okay being in the same room as him now?"
Anybody use the ‘diving reflex’?,3,lsxe72,1," I was taught it by a mental health worker. I was wondering if this is as extreme as it gets?

Really really need advice. Panicking.,3,lsxdmu,1,"Tl;dr: I [30F] think my mother and partner [38M] are abusive and manipulative in the same ways. How to moved forward?

The story is very very long. Years of what I consider abuse on the part of my mother and now my partner. I am 30 and my partner is 38. We have been together four years. We just moved next door to my mother in my grandmothers house as my grandmother is now in a nursing home. The past few days have been hell. Every interaction with them is subtly or overtly insane to me.

Two nights ago, the three of us were standing in front of my grandmother’s piano. My mother was and is always agitated and stressed and stressful. She always has so much going on, more than anyone else, and her issues are more important than anyone else’s. We were standing around the piano, and I remembered how my mother had said that she wanted to try to move the piano next door to her house because she wanted to start practicing again. So I said, “So are you going to take the piano?” She then told me that she wanted to sell it back to the Conservatory.

I expressed dismay, but I was not angry, I was just emotionally sensitive because all of this stuff relating to my grandmother is sad for me, of course, which is normal. I listened as she explained this wasn’t really the important piano, the important piano is in another country and we can get it back. So even though I was sad about losing this piano, I was a bit relieved by the thought of having the other piano. However because I was sad, because I still felt attached to the piano I heard my grandmother play my whole life, I pleaded a bit saying not to sell it. All I said was “No don’t sell it,” but not in an angry way and I wasn’t crying. And she immediately snapped at me, “I’m not giving it to YOU!” And this was when I started to get upset, and I said “I’m not asking you to give it to me I was just asking you not to sell it!” I tried to explain that I had brought up the piano because I wanted her to have it (more on that layer) but she wouldn’t even let me talk before she kept saying again “I’m not giving it to YOU! You never consider me! I might need to sell it to SURVIVE!”

At that point I got really upset and started crying and when I cry I talk more loudly and emotionally and it sounds a bit like yelling and I started pleading asking what she was talking about, she can’t sell our things to live off of. She owns both houses and has very little living expenses and we have quite a bit of money to invest. Not millionaires, but there is some money and the two houses. For YEARS my mother has been terrible with money, saved absolutely nothing, and earned almost no income. Which is fine, I don’t judge people who don’t work but all this to say that if you own two beautiful houses in a desirable area on some land, you don’t sell those houses to “survive.” You rent out some rooms, you rent out a house, you have a garden and grow vegetables as much as you can to reduce food costs and when you have money to invest, you find a way. She has always had an intense scarcity mentality and even though she offered for me and my partner to live here, since the day we have moved in she has been passive aggressive and hostile in small ways and not small ways.

She then told me that she is an adult, I can’t tell her what to do with her piano, that I don’t want her to have anything, that how dare I say I “want” her to have her own piano, that it’s not my piano. I got really upset, I started crying and yelling asking why is she doing this, why is she saying all this, that you can’t talk about money this way and threaten to sell our things to survive. My partner thinks I’m insane, calls me narcissistic and borderline. I don’t know anymore. There’s so much more to the story and writing this out makes me realize that this story doesn’t really mean anything. It doesn’t prove anything.

Since then my partner has threatened for the thousandth time to leave me, that I am crazy, tonight he came up to my room as I he been avoiding him and he yelled at me for using “his” pot to cook. There are a lot of problems with that:

-That pot was given as a gift to both of us
-It is a pressure cooker and he doesn’t even know how to use because it is me who does all of the grocery shopping and all of the cooking. He thinks because he’s come to the grocery store with me a few times and makes a couple smoothies that he does as much as me in that regard. I cook real meals every day, multiple times a day for us.
-I have an eating disorder and am desperately trying to gain weight and yelling at me for using this pot is triggering and he knows it
-When he is angry at me he doesn’t give me money for groceries and right now we are low on food
-He is in MY house not paying rent or utilities, he gives me spending money and does pay for eating out. We just moved from an apartment where he was paying for everything but I was doing all housework and we had come to an agreement but one where I didn’t have any money of my own. I have been asking him for a year to help me make money as we have a few side hustles going on, but I need his help. He has his own business and I have helped him with his business a lot but of course he doesn’t see it.

Anyway so he tells me not to use his things, while being in my house and sleeping in my bed and having only contributed $80 for groceries so far. We spent a week making 6 different trips, three times with a uHaul to move his enormous inventory of musical equipment and things to my house. I have almost no things and yet my whole life my mom has always told me I have too many things. I had about four boxes worth of things. My grandmothers house is packed, almost every room, with his stuff.

I haven’t been keeping up with the laundry the last few weeks with the stress of the move, and three days ago, he asked me if he was going to have do everything alone? I got upset and I asked how can he say he has to do everything alone as I had spent days helping him. He in fact had me helping, his brother, and a friend drive an hour and a half to help us move. So he’s definitely not doing everything alone.

So even though he doesn’t buy food when we fight, doesn’t pay rent or utilities now, and won’t help me in making money so that I have my own income, he left all his dirty dishes last night. It was after cleaning up all his dishes that I then cooked for me, and that he then came to tell me not to use his things. I said nothing and didn’t argue and didn’t cry because I see now this is insane. I called my dad and he said that my mom and my partner want me to take the bait, and that they expect me to react in a certain way.

When I was pregnant two years ago my mother screamed at me that my partner was going to leave me and that she wasn’t going to pay for the baby and that I was going to be a single mother. I was really ill at the time and I ended up losing the pregnancy due to health reasons. I was desperately terrified for my health and my babies and she was screaming at me. My partner still to this day doesn’t think it’s as bad as I do. Which makes sense because after I lost the pregnancy I was a mess and having panic attacks and during one I ended up in the corner of the room on the floor sobbing asking what we were going to do about money and health care he spit on me out of frustration. My crying and talking when I’m crying sounds like yelling and it’s very triggering for him but no matter how much I try to stay calm, I become increasingly hysterical. When I had Akathisia from a rapid benzodiazepine taper I was on the ground in pain and she was telling me I was pathetic. (That’s a whole story in and of itself and involves my mom pushing diagnoses and meds on me which has left me traumatized, I went to intensive PTSD therapy after losing the pregnancy, my therapist tells me they are narcissists but still I am trapped). It’s been years of this abuse. I am stuck. Why do they hate me so much?

I’m sorry this is so long and disjointed, I feel really tired now.

Edited to add:

The house is mine in the sense that my mother said she is giving it to me. My partner also has issues with working a traditional job and I have helped him build up his business, I helped with marketing and the actual physical labor working ten hours a day that I get paid with through the food and shelter my partner was providing. So I do work. I didn’t tell my partner it was his job to figure it out when he thought he ruined two of his jobs. I got up and helped him fix it and reassured him and helped him grow his business and have supported all of his endeavors with my time and effort.

I don’t have to pay rent because my grandmother and mother want me to have the house, but when my mom is stressed she threatens to sell it before she puts it in my name. She told me this year she was going to put it into my name relatively soon.

I have PTSD and a therapist that I had ten months of PTSD therapy for after the pregnancy loss and how my partner and mother reacted. I was also ill and made my recovery last summer so I am better now and that is why I have spent the last six months working for my partners business. We have another side business but I can’t do it alone yet.

I do contribute. I do all the house labor, the grocery shopping, I help my partner with his business without real pay. I let him live in this house without asking for him to pay the utilities or anything except groceries. All I ask is for him to do his part of the side business so that I can have my own money in a way that will benefit both of us. I support his creative career, this house has a huge sunroom he is using for his art studio so he can stop working on his main business and pursue his dream of being a famous painter. What more can I do?

I can contact my old therapist but I am ashamed I am still struggling with the same things, albeit I am better than when I first saw her. She helped me get out of it and I know she thinks they are toxic so what can she do to help me if I don’t have the courage to leave?"
My therapist is now over two and a half hours late for our appointment / how do i deal with a shitty therapist,1,lt3d4k,7,"I’m on medicaid so my choices are very limited and I’m going through one of the 3 approved practices. My doctor is fine but my therapist is, for lack of a better word, a quack. I don’t know how she has a license, I’m honestly not sure she does.

As a preface, no offense to anyone who practices or likes eastern medicine, I’m sure it is helpful to some, but not me.

My therapist is an “energy medicine practitioner” and told me that tapping different parts of my body would release my trauma. She believes in things like aromatherapy and reiki. I told her I prefer CBT and trauma based therapy, and want to work on processing my trauma (not tapping it away) and she responded that it’s worked for people for hundreds of years so why wouldn’t it work for me. At the time I didn’t really know what she was talking about but i’ve had a week to research it and it’s all pseudoscience with no evidence that it works, and lots of evidence it’s a sham/placebo effect.

Today we were supposed to discuss my treatment plan and I was going to tell her I do not have any interest in energy medicine and want therapy that’s based on science, but she’s now exactly 2 hours and 43 minutes late for my appointment, which I confirmed yesterday. 

No call to cancel, no email, nothing. She’s usually like 15-20 minutes late but this is absurd. I’m sorry but i have a debilitating mental health illness and I can show up on time. This just seems like proof that she’s unprofessional. I want to call the practice and request a new therapist, but i’ve already called twice to see wtf was going on and the man i talked to could tell I was pissed. 

I am not confrontational at all and never complain like this, i’m the type of person who if a restaurant messes up my order i just say oh well kinda sucks and move on. This is my mental health and well-being though, so i feel i have a right to be pretty pissed, and i know i’m not good at advocating for myself and i’m trying to work on that. At this point i honestly just don’t know how i can call and request a new therapist without being bitchy about it because i’m PISSED. what should i do?"

“Eh yours isn’t that bad” or “no one would believe you have PTSD, you’re just weak”

And logically- I know these thoughts aren’t true. But damn if I still don’t feel a little guilty, or weak, or less-than, or stupid for calling my past “trauma”.

Does anyone else understand were I’m coming from? Have you dealt with these feelings before, any advice?"
Nightmares,2,lsvxzr,0,Last night I had the nightmares from trauma and when i woke up i found myself having the same dreadful feelings that just knocked the shit out of me. Pretty exhausted. Just wanted to lie down and let go of everything.
Incite appreciated,1,lszpxd,1,"Just joined this group. I’ve had PTSD for a couple years more. It sucks. Prior to that I did see a counselor for depression and anger issues. After a few months with that counselor I thought I was ok and stopped going. Then my PTSD incident occurred. Like others, after a grieving period I thought I was ok. Several months later, I began to see signs that I was not right. I reached out to my counselor, but got no return call, so I was like fuck him, I’ll find someone else. Luckily, someone else in my field got me in touch with. PTSD therapist who specialized in EMDR treatment. Not gonna lie, it was tough, and physically and emotionally draining. But nearly a year later, I was starting to get back to my old self, then COVID. I haven’t been to see my therapist in a year due to Covid. My therapist would only do video or telephone sessions... but they’re not the same especially for my type of treatment. 

I messaged my therapist a week ago to try and set up an appointment, but they are pretty booked and will try to fit me in where they can. But that was after a week of waiting to hear back. I really like this therapist and don’t want to start over with someone new. Thoughts?"
"[TW! Gaslighting, emot. abuse, manipulation] Parents are a cause for a lot of trauma, now I'm an adult I need to move out ASAP. Is it a normal response for me to feel like a ""horrible kid"" for wanting to effectively run away from my parents and just go live my life? Often feel I'm being dramatic.",11,lskpyw,6,"*{ Okay. This feels very long and ranty and I feel I'm whining a bit, but that's also kinda the point of my issue right now, so here we go. I tried to give examples, as context for why moving out is so essential. Also trying to convince myself it doesn't make me a bad person to do so because of evidence. There's a lot more trauma I won't be mentioning as I feel it'd be too triggering but I've mentioned some of the milder things they do to mess with my head. }*

&#x200B;

So much of the time my parents trigger me and I have an intense initial response (anger, frustration etc), so ready to make a plan to just go and live somewhere else, and then the trauma exhaustion and resignation kick in and I'm too tired to have any fight left in me and I just switch to **""wow I overreacted and I'm just being overdramatic and a sucky family member""**.

**Is this a normal/common reaction for people with trauma to have?** Or am I really a horrible family member for just wanting to up and leave? I wasn't even allowed to leave the house alone at all until I was a legal adult (and even then wanted to place a tracker in my phone) so I just feel I've been living in their prison for so long but they always turn everything on its head and blame me for everything.

They've spent so much of my life pretending I'm not there when I'm trying to talk to them, flat-out ignoring me or talking over me when I'm trying to tell them about my day when I came home from school, taking no interest in my life except to criticise something the context of which they were too lazy to look away from their phone and listen to (e.g reasons for a slightly low grade), only to complain I never told them things and never spoke to them or spent time around them (due to giving up).

I ended up developing at least 1 extra personality (*not* D.I.D) during 2019 when I was deeply dissociated 24hr a day from the constant, unrelenting stress and trauma my parents caused me (I won't specify). Every day I experienced dissociation, derealisation and depersonalization that has only recently gotten better.

They tried to discourage me from going to university, and now suddenly because I briefly had student accommodation but then had to move back home (thanks COVID), they ""missed me loads"" and ""are so glad I'm back with them"". I get paid £3k in student maintenance loans to look after myself and pay my flat's rent and my parents seem to think that money is ""basically theirs anyway"" and I should give it to them when I already pay them weekly rent too.

I have trauma from years of gaslighting and being controlled to mad degrees, and having them even gaslight me about my own disabilities (physical & learning) and telling me I ""just seem to conveniently have an excuse for everything"". I've had them interfere with medical appointments, trying to manipulate my doctors into not listening to me and not thinking I had anything wrong with me besides being ""lazy and a slob"". One minute they say I'm too sick to be allowed to go for a stroll, the next minute apparently I'm not sick at all and I'm just faking my tears of chronic pain and fatigue when I'm unable to clean their house for them (I'm... I'm literally disabled). They frequently call me useless.

My mother listens to phone calls, often rummaged through my things, is generally super invasive and has no respect for privacy. This year she hurriedly returned to me a diary she had stolen from my room when I was around 13. I also have ADHD and struggle severely with sensory processing, and the amount of noise in my house is insane to the point where I end up crying because there isn't a single room where there isn't *someone* shouting or shrieking or singing or shoving things into walls.

&#x200B;

This is absolutely only a fraction of the issues I have with my parents, **so my question is...**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**I should feel fine about moving away from them, right?**

He Burned Me When I Was a Child,9,lsljmt,4,"This story might be distressing to some but this is my reality...

When I was 6 my mum was very busy with work and handling stress, which i wasn't aware of at the time because she was an amazing mother. Growing up I had a multitude of babysitters and this specific house was with a woman my mum went to secondary school with. I would like to add that her children were also present and took care of me also. I enjoyed going to her house because they taught me maths young and how  to read (I'm extremely dyslexic btw) Anyways back to the story. Despite being close to her children, there was one who never really interacted with me much. We'll call him Cory. Cory agreed one day to take care of me whilst my mums friend was busy, he took me into the living room which was wall filled with a large bookcase of books. Following him in silence I awkwardly stopped after he did.

""You can sit down"" He was polite but the tone showed proof that he didn't want to deal with me. Without hesitation i obeyed his request childishly saying ""okay!"" I remember that the chair was made of leather, it was red and tall enough that my legs dangled.

Cory pulled out a ironing table. Excited, i asked ""Could I help you iron? I actually like ironing, my grandma lets me but mum doesn't like ironing very much.""

""No its okay I don't need any help,"" He took an awkward pause, ""I'll call you if I need any help""

""Okie"" I sat back in the chair dangling them silently thinking about if i stretched them out if they would reach the ground. Time passed, I'm not sure how long.

""Amaya (placeholder name for myself)?""

""Yes!""

I cant remember what he said exactly but it was either ""come here and help me"" or ""I need some help.""

I naively sprung up from the chair and walked calmly towards him, he made me nervous with his silence but it was cut this time. He was ironing a shirt and set the iron upright on the table as he looked down to me.

""Put your hand up here."" He tapped the side of the ironing table twice, because of how close to the table i was standing i first placed my left hand then my right because it was less of an uncomfortable hold (Ill mention that the table was very tall in comparison to me at the time) ""Place it flat"" I spreaded my hand out not expecting his next decision.

He picked up the iron and pointed it downwards. ""Stay still"" he said a second before placing the tip of the iron on the centre of my hand as he carved a C into it. I watched him. I can't remember my emotions whilst he did it. I don't even remember crying but i do remember him telling me ""You cam go and sit back down."" Once again politely but  irritated.

I sat and sucked on my right hand burn silently crying. I remember telling myself ""Don't cry"" over and over again as i silently sobbed. With a smirk, he walked over to me and knelt.

""Please don't cry,"" he said softly, ""at least don't cry too loud""

After that I think started crying louder. His mum came into the room confused, she walked to me.

""Aweee Amaya why are you crying? Did someone hurt you?"" I nodded, ""Who?"" I stopped crying, looked away and said nothing, ""Was it Cory?"" I started crying again and nodding. She asked me if i wanted her to beat him up. With tears I said yes. She left and i heard the commotion, I sat sucking on my hand as i curled into a ball and cried.

I haven't been diagnosed with PTSD but this event makes me feel like I could suffer with it, one of the reasons is because sometimes when i get stressed out I suck on the scar on my hand. I also go blank when i get distressed, its like my whole face rests an I become silent. With thoughts sometimes completely blank.

I'm much older now but  still live with his C on my hand, weirdly enough I must've blocked that memory out for a while after that because as a child I was almost proud of that burn. I called it my moon shaped scar. Thank you for reading my story and I'm very sorry for any grammatical issues.

I don't hate ""Cory"" as a child hate was something i just didn't feel in the same way grown ups do. To this day I want to confront him and ask him ""why?"" I don't think I blame him. I just want to know what I did wrong, I was a obedient child who would listen to anyone I trusted.

I could add a pic of my scar if you guys want to see it (Its much smaller now and not graphic) 

Id love to talk more about this, I've only opened up once and its something that still effects me today."

A breakthrough in grieving for myself. Tw: CSA,2,lss60t,0,"I've been in therapy through the Australian public system for 2 years now, with intermittent psychology sessions. I've been dissociating on and off for years since I experienced incestuous CSA in my teens.

But I've been sitting with my emotions through daily journaling and discussions. It's been incredibly rough. My husband is a saint for supporting me through it all, what with my struggle with executive function and feeling overwhelmed by the smallest of things because I'm so raw. 

Today I was already feeling overwhelmed because I was having difficulty getting basic, inexpensive underclothes in my size at the local department store. So I was feeling a lot of shame about my body and it just built up into this big thing and suddenly as I was driving to the family home I had an outpouring of grief, asking ""Why would they do that to me?"" I've never cried over the abuse before. It wasn't until this year that I finally felt the anger, and now I'm feeling swings of depression.

I'd previously spent a lot of time in the bargaining stage, convincing myself that I was at fault. Hopefully acceptance is around the corner!"
I wish I never met my ex,11,lsh5fm,4,"TRIGGER WARNING 

Abuse, gaslighting, self harm







I posted this in trueoffmychest before I discovered r/ptsd. I don't know if I actually have PTSD but... I have flashbacks and ... I just really need to talk about it. Not to someone I know. I feel scared for whatever reason. I don't know if I can tell my mom or my gf maybe because I blame myself. I feel like I ruined my own life.


It's been a little under a month that she moved back to her home country. She's from Kazakhstan and she moved here for education. I think she has PTSD and it probably is a really big reason why she had a lot of the reactions that she did. 

I can't stop thinking of the things she did. It doesn't help that I'm living in the same apartment. I have to move out, but I don't have the means to right now. Sometimes my flashbacks feel like they're happening right now, and the fear is immobilizing. She used to put our lives in danger when she drove recklessly, I remember running out of the car screaming after she accelerated into the parked cars in front of us and then slammed on the brakes. She used to choke and beat herself in front of me during our arguments, screaming. She would cut herself then send me pictures and show me in person. She painted massive words on the walls of our apartment in black paint. ""You should kill yourself. You're worthless."" Directed towards herself. Huge words on our newly painted walls. She justified this with, ""at least I didn't hurt myself."" And said I cared more about material things than her. She would chase me down every time I needed to get away from her, sometimes that would give me panic attacks. Her insecurity completely choked and smothered me until I couldn't breathe. She would badmouth herself constantly... she'd assume I thought badly of her before I ever opened my mouth. There was a constant stream of self hatred from her but it was extremely manipulative. She made me feel guilty if I didn't feel sorry for her. She told me if I ever broke up with her she'd kill herself. She said I'm the only reason she has to live. She eventually made me disconnect from friends and family and gaslit me constantly, telling me that our relationship was normal. That everything she does is normal. That actually, we have a great relationship. That I'm making a big deal of everything, I'm being childish.

She tried to guilt me into marrying her because if I didn't her entire future as an immigrant from a 3rd world country was forfeit. She blamed me for everything when something went wrong in her life. She made me work on her homework and her own work took priority over everything I had to do. Ultimately my struggles were nothing compared to hers. She would excuse all of her own behaviors, constantly saying things that contradicted herself. She would call me non stop if I didn't pick up and message me nonstop, and did the same to my own family members. Begging and pleading for me to answer when I finally moved to my mom's just to get away from her only to be faced with her boyfriend who hated me.

She ruined our personal belongings. She threw glass jars, broke plates, broke doors. She read my personal messages.

She did this and so so much more. Always with, ""this is normal. I'm not doing anything wrong.""

I think of every one of these things a lot and it makes me feel so much fear and regret that I feel sick. I feel like she was a curse that visited my life and I'm trying hard to get over it but... it's haunting me. Her name, Alex, is extremely common and I think of her every single time I hear it. My cousin is named alex, my friend's friend, my friend's ex boyfriend, my hairdresser. I can't escape.

I used to self harm and I have a lot of problems with depression but now when I feel depressed the very first thing I think of is her and her abject insanity and I'm terrified because I feel like that's what I'll become. Obviously not but my own mental illness reminds me of her, and I don't know if some day I'll stop thinking of her. I wish it never happened. I wish I could forget she ever existed. 

I'm polyamorous and I'm with my girlfriend. I was with her at the time I started dating alex as well. I feel like this is all my fault. For dating her, for giving her so many chances, for ruining my own life. Everything seems to trigger thoughts of her. When I see violence I imagine her abusing herself in front of me and screaming. When I'm depressed, when I think of hurting myself or suicide, when I hear people saying that they're worthless, I imagine her manipulating me to tell her she's not worthless, and exploding when I don't give her the response she's looking for.

I'm scared. The flashbacks are scary. I want to stop thinking about her. There are specific moments that never leave me. 

I don't know if I sound... valid or... 

I'd just like some confirmation I suppose 

That what I'm feeling is real

Did I fuck up?

What should I do aside from what I'm doing now (trying to get a psychiatrist and a therapist)?"
Self care after trauma therapy sessions,3,lslzz9,9,"I have just started working with my first trauma therapist. She says I am ready for my first session of EMDR next week, which I did very briefly years ago and don't remember. Thank goodness I had actually told most of my history to other therapists before. Please, how do you decompress after sessions? I feel like I have spent several rounds in a boxing ring. I've stirred up so many ghosts and past issues today, and my brain won't stop worrying away at them, even though I know it's going to get me nowhere. I understand the difficulty only goes up from here.

(deep breath) What got you through it/is getting you through it? Any and all suggestions welcome."
PTSD severely re-triggered. Insomnia is relentless. TRIGGERING content,29,ls4ji5,7,"I recently started a volunteer training to field calls for a domestic violence and sexual assault/abuse hotline. I thought I was ready. I have always felt the need to give back. I have been abused in many ways and now as an undergrad I am persuing a BS in psychology/minor in HDFS and gathering as many research/volunteer/intern opportunities as I go. I hope to become a counselor in some form.

So this hotline training. It has wrecked me. I am in my early 20's on my own. I work, I go to school, I got a grant and am working in an undergraduate research lab. My life is full, I look for opportunities everywhere. I don't have much of a financial/social support network. A week into this training and I didn't feel right. I kept going. The modules were incredibly triggering. I ignored my initial feelings as stress (taking on too much to begin with, which is also true) and kept going. The live trainings and discussions over zoom made me start to completely disassociate. Driving to work after 4 hours of heavy lecture and not remembering the drive. Clocking out, going home, not sleeping. Remembering things I had stuffed so far down that I thought they didn't exist, suddenly coming into my perfectly crafted, hard earned life. I'm so upset. I'm an overachiever, I am a perfectionist, I just want to make a few people proud and help some others with their inner turmoils. I see the flaws in these thoughts. I just want to help others.

I've been in therapy since I was 10. It feels like it will never end and I have so much weight on my shoulders, so many things to do and maintain. I had no idea I'd be so incredibly triggered by events in the past that I have now been processing for over 10 years. I'm ashamed, upset, feeling like a failure. I just want to help people. I just want to give back. It pains me to think that I wouldn't be able to because I've been so damaged by my own trauma. This was a long, rambly post, but ultimately I'm looking for advice. Do other people experience this when they're triggered? Not sleeping? Has anyone had a re-triggering event so intense it kind of pauses life?

It's 3am. I can't sleep, my brain is humming along in endless cirlces. Thanks for reading."
Today was a bad day.,2,lsm0ek,4,"Today was a bad day. I'm fine for several months. I'm good at suppressing. But I have flash backs to a few hard days during my wife's seven months of dying from lung cancer. The worst was three weeks before she passed. She was holding her own after chemotherapy and we actually went out for dinner. Right after eating and a block away from the restaurant. She had massive pain in her stomach. Unbelievable hard pain. I turned around and took her to a hospital. In short, her intestine had dead tissue from chemo and stomach acid was leaking into her abdomen. She was calling out for God to help her. The staff was unable to do anything except fill her with pain meds until the following mid morning when they finally took her into exploratory surgery. I stayed by her side and awake the entire time to protect her. I carried medical records in the car. The hours during the evening dragged on as she suffered from the pain until they finally had no recourse except to medicate. During one of the nightly checks her heart beat was so slow from massive pain meds they pushed me out of the room until they brought her back. I actually still feel her pain and my anguish from feeling so helpless. And stuffing away everything  to stay strong and coherent in case I had to make sure she was being taken care off. Its been since 2007 but every few months the anguish pushes through and I relive it again for a few hours. I know others have it worse, and I feel like a whiner if i bring it up. I've never talked to anyone about that night before. There are other episodes during her seven months but this was the worse."
How are you guys dealing with flashbacks?,5,lscwvi,6,"I have PTSD from a terrible car accident 10 years ago. I’m still getting flashbacks of it every single day and it comes by very randomly—when I’m in the shower, or eating my meal, or when I’m in the middle of doing my work. There’s no trigger or anything. 

Generally I think I’m doing “fine”, just living my day to day life “normally” (if we’re not factoring in the flashbacks). I’m not depressed or inflicting self-harm it’s just that getting those flashbacks every.single.day is very emotionally and psychologically draining."
Could this be ptsd?,1,lsn7tu,1,"I know I should talk to a therapist and I will, I just thought I could share my symptoms and experiences to see if they’re similar to others with ptsd, and just to get some clarity.

My ex partner had mental health issues and would often project those issues onto me. Verbal abuse was consistent when he would get into these bad episodes saying that I’m worthless, pathetic, poison to his life, worse than his toxic ex gf, etc. he would constantly try to break up with me and one minute later take it back. He would often tell me he’s going to drive off a bridge so I would go stand in the way of his and the car keys or door and get pushed and shoved leaving bruises on me multiple times. 
I witnessed him attempt to hang himself and self harm. I had to wrestle him to get the knife off him before he hurt himself, had to hold him back from gouging his eyes out. 
I feared for his life every single time, and my life multiple times. I did all I could to keep him safe but it happened time and time again over the course of 3 years, it would cause me panic attacks every time I would witness his outbursts.
I recently broke up with him for completely different reasons and all of a sudden I’m getting worsening problems. I now get flashbacks of the knife and picture him there ready to hang himself. My body just shuts down and freezes up I feel like I’m back in it again. I get triggered by small things like opening YouTube or being near the house we used to live in together.

Is my story similar to anyone else in terms of having PTSD? Any comments, advice or insight is greatly appreciated!! Tia"

it feels like my life is already over.

i dont know how ill ever be able to recover. ever since my diagnosis its gotten worse and worse. its just brought all my repressed memories back to the surface. i have been having nightmares and panic attacks daily. my body remembers things and i can feel the pain i felt so long ago. but i have no memories attached to these feelings. it just feels like my body is attacking and hurting itself for no reason. i dont even know what triggers them at this point. it all just feels like a punishment

i have cut myself off from all my friends because i can’t handle to see them be so happy when i hurt so bad.

i dont know what to do. i just started to go to therapy weekly, and we have been working on recovering. i feel like giving up. i cant imagine how hard its going to get as i have to dive deeper into my memories and find ones that are far worse."

He saw that I was covered in scars and started asking questions. He knows I have PTSD, and I don't think he meant to be pushy and make me uncomfortable, but it was just rapid fire questions about them for about 5 minutes.

And then he showed me his scars. He told me how he got each one, and how he got over the trauma from them. He showed me his bullet wounds, his burns, and his knife wounds. And he told me not to get heatstroke by wearing sweaters all summer just for a few scars. We talked about his tattoos and what I would want to cover mine with.

Day to day I feel like I’m 95% better. I don’t wake up every day feeling like I want to die anymore.

It is not our fault that we have PTSD but it is out responsibility to keep it in check and not harm others. The amount of blame I'm seeing being put on the partners of members of this community after a person with PTSD has an outburst and abuses them is unsettling at best and triggering at worst.

Imagine if someone was excusing your abuser in this way.

It makes my trauma feel less traumatic to see that still today, 10 years later, only veterans and sometimes r*pe survivors have readily available resources."
anybody else live in this constant grey zone between feeling like you made up your trauma and knowing it happened because of all the side effects,376,fl1ecl,61,because oh boy despite having to see a therapist and get interviewed by cps i still feel like i'm being overly dramatic somehow
Does anyone else get strong urges to cry when explaining your feelings regardless if it’s related to your trauma or not?,377,gz6z6w,50,"Whenever I’m upset about something, big or small, and im explaining to people what’s upsetting, tears immediately flow without my control and my voice cracks and my body becomes super tense. It happens all the time. Even at work if im trying to explain something to my superiors and i think i might get in trouble. It makes me feel super weak and like I can’t handle myself. And i feel like people think im crazy over emotional. 

Just recently my bf and i had a civil disagreement. I can’t even remember what exactly it was about, but i ended it with a point he couldn’t or wouldn’t refute and instead of concluding the conversation he just disengaged by turning away from me while im talking to look at his phone and read random forums. It was only mildly annoying but i found myself crying just trying to explain why i felt that was disrespectful which makes me look and feel like I’m overreacting. 

Am i alone in this? Does this kind of thing happen to anyone else? Im still kind of new to the idea of having ptsd, ive been diagnosed with it last year around this time due to physical abuse i suffered growing up."
Got emasculated for having PTSD today,376,a06iw0,99,"I was on a date today with a girl I’ve been seeing for a while, and I finally opened up to her about my PTSD, and she said she didn’t knew I served in the military. I didn’t. I told her that. She immediately became more cold and even called me a pussy and sick because I’m ridiculing others that actually have PTSD and have been traumatized by blaming all my petty problems to fake PTSD. She emasculates me for saying that I have PTSD when I don’t, because evidently I’m not strong or “man” enough to deal with problems normally. Sorry my parents fucking beat me for the first 18 years of my life. Now she’s left me and I’m just typing this out of anger and frustration because I’m sitting here not able to sleep because I know I’ll get more night terrors if I do let myself sleep and I just can’t handle them anymore. I hate this. 

Thanks for reading whoever did, just wanted to vent y’all. 

Edit: Didn’t expect to get this many upvotes, I was just venting y’all lol. Thanks for all the kind words, the encouragement to move on and realize that I dodged a bullet, and the hope that I’ll find someone who’ll have the proper compassion to accept me how I should. "
I hate it when people use the word “triggered” to mean “upset”.,365,e0q2p1,62,"It’s been common for a few years now for people to use the word “triggered” online when someone gets upset at something that was posted/said.

It bothers me because I feel it minimizes actual “triggers”.  When I’m triggered, my body almost goes into shock. I can’t breathe, my chest hurts, I get dizzy, etc.  

Someone getting angry at someone with a MAGA hat isn’t triggered. They are angry. 

I wouldn’t wish PTSD on anyone, but I wish more people understood the gravity of an actual trigger for those of us with PTSD.

EDITED FOR CLARITY : I am referencing when someone says that another person is “triggered” because they got upset or angry. (I’m my experience only online).

Example: 

Person A: There will never be equality because men are simply superior to women.

Person B: What the fuck is your problem, are you that stupid?  Go back into your hole, incel.

Person A: Oohhh, “Person A” is triggered."

Extreme Independence is a Trauma Response,343,jbdmp8,44,"
The inability to receive support from others is a trauma response.

Your “I don’t need anyone, I’ll just do it all myself” conditioning is a survival tactic. And you needed it to shield your heart from abuse, neglect, betrayal, and disappointment from those who could not or would not be there for you.

From the parent who was absent and abandoned you by choice or the parent who was never home from working three jobs to feed and house you.

From the lovers who offered sexual intimacy but never offered a safe haven that honored your heart.

From the friendships and family who ALWAYS took more than they ever gave.

From all the situations when someone told you “we’re in this together” or “I got you” then abandoned you, leaving you to pick up the pieces when shit got real, leaving you to handle your part and their part, too.

From all the lies and all the betrayals.

You learned along the way that you just couldn’t really trust people. Or that you could trust people, but only up to a certain point.

Extreme-independence IS. A. TRUST. ISSUE.

You learnt: if I don’t put myself in a situation where I rely on someone, I won’t have to be disappointed when they don’t show up for me, or when they drop the ball... because they will ALWAYS drop the ball EVENTUALLY right?

You may even have been intentionally taught this protection strategy by generations of hurt ancestors who came before you. 

Extreme-independence is a preemptive strike against heartbreak.

So, you don’t trust anyone.

And you don’t trust yourself, either, to choose people.

To trust is to hope, to trust is to be vulnerable.

“Never again,” you vow.

But no matter how you dress it up and display it proudly to make it seem like this level of independence is what you always wanted to be, in truth it’s your wounded, scarred, broken heart behind a protective brick wall.

Impenetrable. Nothing gets in. No hurt gets in. But no love gets in either.

Fortresses and armor are for those in battle, or who believe the battle is coming.

It’s a trauma response.

The good news is trauma that is acknowledged is trauma that can be healed.

You are worthy of having support.
You are worthy of having true partnership.
You are worthy of love.
You are worthy of having your heart held.
You are worthy to be adored.
You are worthy to be cherished.
You are worthy to have someone say, “You rest. I got this.” And actually deliver on that promise.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy to receive.
You are worthy.

You don’t have to earn it.
You don’t have to prove it.
You don’t have to bargain for it.
You don’t have to beg for it.

You are worthy.
Worthy.
Simply because you exist.

I’m tired of the ptsd gatekeeping,341,his9ld,97,"I have ptsd from an attempt on my life by someone close to me, i was almost str*ngled to d**th. I recently had someone tell me that I did not have ptsd and I was just trying to be special because I’m only 20 and not a veteran. They told me my experience was fake and that I don’t deserve to take up room in support groups. It sent me into a full blown panic attack. Don’t do that shit"
As a veteran,341,dfxido,74,"As a veteran, I just want to say that even if you do didn't serve, I know your PTSD is real.

I question if I had PTSD prior to my military experience. I've had childhood trauma that feel a lot like my combat trauma. I can easily see how the two are similar.

Unfortunately, it's much easier to get taken seriously if you are a Veteran. The VA is very aware of the issue and has plenty of resources. I thank God that I found this path to help me with my mental health struggles.

If you're ever doubting yourself, or finding it hard to find people that relate to you. Just remember at least one person believes you.

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented their appreciation. I hope this is a stigma that can be broken."
y'all ever look at a picture of yourself as a kid (or anytime pre-trauma) and wonder where that person is?,337,i0oxxa,66,
I'm embarrassed to use the word 'triggered',334,lswpgh,76,"I assume most of us here have things that either set off a state of panic, or immediately put us in an anxious mindset, where a flashback is more likely to take ahold.

The best word to use for that is a 'trigger', but it's been so co-opted by people being dramatic in political discourse that it just sounds silly to me. The moment I even begin a sentence with 'I got triggered by...' it just makes me cringe.

Is there anyone else who feels the same, or have I just spent too much time on Twitter?"
This sub saved my life. I thought my husband had mental illness and you guys told me he was abusing me and warned me of the red flags. I'm getting a divorce. Thank you guys so much.,337,blzenq,11,I didn't understand what was happening and he kept telling me not to go to therapy and not to go to the doctor when I was injured. I was confused and trapped in the house with him for a year. He was really dangerous and I didn't understand and I was isolated from my family. This group told me that it was starting to sound really fishy and warned me of red flags. You guys were right and I'm getting a divorce. I'm reconnected with my birth family and I'm going to be safe and recover. Thank you guys so much. You saved my life.
sometimes i forget my PTSD is valid,339,gfynye,37,"i saw this tweet today 

""it’s called “post traumatic stress disorder” not “military trauma for only people in the military disorder”""

ive always thought when someone was diagnosed with PTSD it was because they were in war or things like that. but when my psych said i have PTSD i didn't believe, i didn't think what i had was bad enough for that. 

i wish PTSD wasn't always shown as a mental illness from war"
What they don’t talk about. [NSFW],336,c7fqs8,57,"Triggers aren’t just people talking about violence or sex. They can be anything.

No one talks about how a trigger can be the type of door handles someone has in their house, the way someone’s hand grasps a cup of water, the design on their shirt that looks just enough like something else, their misaligned bottom front tooth, the way they pronounce the word “star”.

No one talks about how you lock yourself in the bathroom crying upon meeting your daughter’s new boyfriend, because his skin colour and the shape of his nose look too much like your father’s. Feeling every single hit and those hands where they shouldn’t be every time you see his face. Knowing that you can’t stop her from seeing him because he’s a genuinely good person and great to her, and you, but having to suppress the constant need to rescue her since it looks like she’s being taken away by your father. Having the boyfriend ask over dinner one night why you always look at him so strangely, and having to answer some bullshit about just being overprotective over your little girl, while feeling imaginary hands under the table the whole while and for the rest of the night after.

No one talks about how you’ve earned a trip to a Floridian resort with your air miles, and can’t bring yourself to take it, or even finish reading the brochure, because the town it’s in rhymes with your father’s name.

No one talks about people watching music videos on their phone in the train next to you, and seeing a dance move out of the corner of your eye that looks like the way he used to move at you, and not being able to turn it off since it isn’t your device.

No one talks about the hits of physical pain you feel when someone says a random word like “fun”.

No one talks about trying to sleep at night while feeling phantom fingernails digging into where the sun don’t shine, all because you saw a picture of a hat earlier that looked like the one he used to wear.

And you can never tell anyone that. You can’t just tell someone to change their shirt, hide something in their houses, stop a video they’re enjoying, or god forbid change the way they look or move, or stop using some innocuous word. You just can’t do that. You can’t lose your nerve on the train or when someone else is over. You just have to push it down and deal with it. The therapists say the more you put yourself in a triggering situation without reacting, the less it triggers you, but I’ve yet to experience that. 
These are all true by the way. I don’t need support, I just felt like venting."
Sometimes I think I don't have PTSD and I'm overreacting but then something will trigger me and I'll be like oh nevermind,329,c1c7jf,49,
Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?,313,hyy2h7,28,"Who else is so tired of being in survival mode constantly due to this unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD?

I usually am hypervigilant and quick to advocate for myself as a result of my trauma history--racial, sexual, and emotional abuse. I've spent a lot of my life being gaslighted and mistreated. I have become more confident in standing up for myself, setting boundaries and trusting my intuition these days. I love and respect myself and do not tolerate others who abuse or  disrespect my boundaries. I have always been assertive and have leadership qualities, so this is also part of who I am and who I have to be to survive. 

I want to live in a mental and physical space where I can let down my guard and calm my nervous system so I don't feel the need to put all my energy into advocating and fighting back every time with all my force as if I am dealing with racist, sexist, narcissists or sociopathic abusers everytime. This unsafe world is draining my energy as I frequently have to be in survival mode. When I do let my guard down, I am vulnerable to be attacked or preyed on--recently I have been experiencing racial and sexual harassment. 

((The world is not always unsafe of course, Sometimes there are just miscommunications and people are not out to get me or don't have deceitful intentions due to racism, sexism, etc. I have had to check myself when it was time to let an issue go as I am not able to control everything just myself. There have been times I was embarassed for jumping to conclusions and being overly suspicious and mad when someone was not being deceitful and there was a misunderstanding instead.))

I am working on finding safe physical, mental, and spiritual places where I do not feel the need to protect myself as much and can conserve my energy to heal from cPTSD. I cannot expect to heal as effectively when I am in a place where I keep getting burnt by more abuse. I need to be safe first. It is tough though because as a black mixed woman, there are a lot of places where I am not safe and I have to advocate for myself due to people being out to get me or mistreating me. I cannot wait to move next year to a place where I do feel safer and can let my guard down more and can heal my CPTSD.

Who else is struggling with being in survival mode constantly due to this  unsafe world and your hypersensitivity to it with CPTSD history? How are you dealing with it?"
Guys! My family finally got rid of the painting that triggers my trauma.,310,gavy5l,28,There's a story behind it. I really don't want to elaborate. Thanks for understanding.
Does anyone else have a hard time during a disagreement knowing if your concerns are valid or if they’re a product of your ptsd induced anxiety?,312,fe9esl,42,When I’m trying to express a concern I find myself second guessing myself. Wondering if it’s valid or if I’m just freaking out because my brain is broken. It’s so frustrating ugh. Like I can’t trust my own gut anymore because it tells me everything is bad. Dating is not fun.
Annoying trend: Casual use of the term ptsd/triggered in pop culture,313,jw6nti,105,"Not to be that overly offended person, but I feel like I've heard a lot of flippant use of the term PTSD lately. Eg: omg that tik tok was so stupid it gave me PTSD, they changed the formula in my favourite lipstick - now I have PTSD, ugh minions are so annoying they gave me PTSD. 

It just rubs me up the wrong way to hear it used as a joke to replace 'annoyed' or 'shocked' or 'having a tantrum'. 

Don't even get me started on the ""hashtagtriggered😋"" stuff.  Like: Oh my god, I hate that girl, I'm so triggered right now #triggeredlol. (I don't mean legit use of triggered, I mean I've seen stupid uses that I feel devalue the actual term and make me hesitant to even use it properly cos I feel stupid saying it.)

Like, occasionally I'll use it meta/ironically in a self deprecating way, to let my partner know I actually am being triggered but don't want to get too emotional about it. I get that being sincere about trauma is hard. But in general, it's just a joke to so many people these days. It grinds my gears 😩


I'm not sure if anyone gets what I mean, but I feel it makes it harder to talk about and even take myself seriously when I'm trying to hard to work through trauma. I know that triggers can be anything, but I'm talking about a specific trend I've noticed when people quite clearly are not actually talking about trauma. Does it bother anyone else? Just me?"

Rape jokes really aren’t funny,312,hnxyrr,68,I was repeatedly raped and physically abused by a romantic partner of mine. It happened almost a year and a half ago and after intensive therapy and medication I finally began to feel like I was regaining my life from my ptsd and that the fog was starting to clear. It’s been a couple months since I’ve had any intense flashbacks and I honestly didn’t think there was anything left for me to remember. Earlier tonight I was on a call with a bunch of my brothers friends and one of the guys made a rape joke towards me. I didn’t think that sort of think would trigger me so bad but I’ve been having panic attacks for the past three hours and I simultaneously feel like I’m going to puke and pass out. I’m having intense flashbacks and I can seem to fall asleep for the life of me but I don’t think that’s a bad thing because I know that whatever nightmares await will be a lot worse than what I’m going through now. I don’t know how I’m supposed to avoid this sort of thing. There’s no way to really know that someone about to make a rape joke until it’s too late. It makes me feel so frail and damaged. How are people able to just laugh it off and go on with their lives?
"LOL, SO MY RAPIST JUST LANDED HIS ASS BACK IN PRISON!",313,hkolsz,14,"I know that's a very ""wtf"" topic title, but weird times call for weird celebrations.

Just googled him for the first time in eons and found new news articles.

Now I'm just sitting here laughing at how thoroughly he's fucked up his life. Probation violation :) Actually, twelve of em, but who's counting?

**He has** ***nothing*** **left**.

He has forfeited a high-paying licensed career, almost a decade of life outside prison now, his well-known local reputation, and probably his marriage. And, let's be real: the rest of his future.

And now he has to live out the rest of his life in the wreckage of everything he used to have. Plus 5-10 *extra* years in lockup.

""I'm going to end this man's whole career,"" I seethed ten years ago, helpless and blinded by untreated PTSD.

""It's okay, I'll ruin my own whole life,"" was his reply, apparently.

Life is pretty good nowadays on my end. I don't wake up screaming or begging anymore. I have a lot worth living for. Most days, I'm pretty happy.

Meanwhile, the man who ruined half a dozen lives is probably never going to be happy again. :)

*Was it worth it, my good bitch? Would you make the same life choices and still be a degenerate piece of shit...or do you regret it a lil by this point?*

I'm just so fucking jazzed at this news. That violent waste of oxygen can eat shit and taste his own karma.

It annoys me when trauma survivors say their trauma made them a better and stronger person,293,8sj0tr,107,"I've never said this to anyone, especially not trauma survivors, but I dislike the belief that trauma molds people into better, stronger people. I think anyone who experiences trauma has a right to feel stronger, more empathetic, braver, etc. if that is what they feel from their unique experience. But it's okay to not feel that way. It's okay to feel angry, sad, scared, hurt, and any negative feeling that comes from experiencing a traumatic event.

I am a survivor of childhood sexual assault and I f-ing refuse to attribute my positive qualities and achievements to those traumas. Before the traumas I was happy, confident, full of life, trusting. The sexual assaults literally altered my body and brain development. My childhood was hell. It was my inherent strength that got me through, not the events themselves. 

Maybe for some people, their trauma helped them see that they were strong and brave all along, but I already knew that about myself BEFORE it happened. I actually lost confidence in myself for not being able to stop the abuse when I tried. 

I'm not some happy, smiling, cheerleader who says, ""Rape made me better"" because it didn't. Maybe for some people, it does, but not for me.

**ETA: I know why some survivors say their trauma helped them grow to be stronger, more thoughtful, and better people BECAUSE they made themselves learn to cope in healthy and beneficial ways which makes them feel stronger as people. There's nothing wrong with that and that is what I agree with. That is an empowering thing to know YOU got YOU through. Not the adversity, but what you did to face it and overcome it. But some people don't attribute their strengths and positive experiences from the trauma(s) itself and that's okay. Everyone's feelings are valid, but we do not all feel the same and should not be lumped together. Please don't invalidate commenters in this thread for discussing their feelings because it's not easy to talk about this. Thank you**"
Does anyone else hate their hometown because of locational triggers?,291,ja1ule,44,"I still live in the city that I grew up and where my traumas occurred. It’s both a blessing and a curse because there’s stuff that I actually enjoy here. 

Then, there’s the locational triggers that exist and certain streets I avoid like the plague because it triggers me. I can’t even handle the name of certain streets because it’s that triggering. It’s not even just streets. It’s also neighborhoods that are close to where my traumas occurred. Certain highway exits are also included in the list. If I’m even heading towards that direction, sometimes it crosses my head “X distance to the (left/ right) is where (insert trauma here) trauma happened!” Then, my entire directional sense is with respect to the location of the trauma."

Shoutout to all of the people with PTSD that have horrible memories,289,gjxcmv,50,"My memory has been deteriorating a lot over the last few months, and I recently learned that it probably stems from trauma. Apparently PTSD can wreak long-term havoc on the brain (which makes sense, I just hadn’t thought about it before) and has a particularly nasty effect on the hippocampus.

I’m young, maybe younger than most people on the sub, and memory loss has always been one of my biggest fears. So to learn that PTSD can permanently effect my memory and double my chance of developing dementia later on, is taking a toll on me. 

If anyone else has been affected like this, hi, you’re not alone. Shit sucks but we’ll all get through it.

Edit: I didn't expect this to even hit Hot, but I'm so glad so many of us can relate, and all in different stages of it. Some people are young and scared like me, while others are a bit older and have found ways to cope. Much love and hope to everyone that commented and everyone else on the sub."

It’s been a few months and he wakes up screaming frequently. Like vocal cord ripping level screams. It takes forever to get him to calm down,afterwards I’ll carry him to my room. It’s horrible. He stays around me and often snuggles with me, I think he’s afraid of losing me.

I JUST GOT MY FIRST INTERVIEW SINCE THE SHOOTING,282,bxw8vi,31,"Edit: I GOT THE JOB!!!

So, for background purposes:

I was in the shooting at UNC Charlotte April 30th, and it fucked me up. I already had really bad PTSD prior to this and the incident brought back every single demon I’d already been battling from that. 

After the shooting, I completely lost my mind and had a failed suicide attempt. I also quit my job because I couldn’t handle everything I was going through plus the demanding work environment. 

I just got my first interview after it all and I go in tomorrow at 1pm! I’m stoked dude. I’m starting to have hope again that everything will be okay. 

Just wanted to share because I’m super happy and excited.

Edit: thank you for the gold, kind stranger"
i wish someone protected me as a child,283,kj4wiy,33,"i am a csa victim and was brutalized for the first decade of my life. trauma began for me as an infant and it's left me feeling like a shell. i wish someone did something. i wish someone realized i wasn't ok, that there was a reason i got violently ill so often, that there was a reason i was terrified of my male relatives, and that i would throw tantrums in the mornings before school. i wish i didn't spend my childhood scared and volatile and dissociative and getting the daylight either beaten or fucked out of me. i just want to be held and loved, i want my mom to be alive again so she can tell me it's going to be ok and that she still loves me even if im dirty. i wish i could say sorry to her. i wish she could say sorry to me.

Why Do People Demand You PROVE Your Trauma?,278,ii54dq,65,"I suppose this is rhetorical, but how F-ing horrible when people find out your diagnosis, but they feel they have to approve of it to be valid? I have a hard time talking about it to my therapist. ESPECIALLY if you are non-military.

Last thing I want is to have to explain to people the many forms of abuse from childhood, somewhat resembling Gypsy Rose Blanchard but with violence and a few other horrors. 

You don’t have to share yours because I know it’s hard. Is anyone else sick of this? It’s stressful opening up to friends. Anyone found a good way of setting boundaries? “I don’t like to talk about it” tends to leave people incredulous for me, but I don’t think I owe them anything more."
people overuse “ptsd” and “trauma”,279,lno9kv,186,"edit #2: i am going to preface this by saying PLEASE actually read my post before leaving a comment about how people shouldn’t decide what is and isn’t trauma. i do not support using trauma as a competition to see whose is worse, and it’s never okay to try and discredit other’s traumatic experiences. i am also 100% NOT saying that an incident is only traumatic if it fits ptsd criteria. this post was only meant to express my frustration with people who use the term ptsd to describe healthy, normal negative feelings, and people who like to make compilations of courage the cowardly dog and call it their “childhood trauma.” if you have any other issues with the post, i’ve probably addressed it in a comment. i don’t want anyone to feel like their experiences are invalid because of what i wrote. so now that i’ve cleared that up, here’s the original post:

it’s so exhausting to see people constantly claim to have ptsd and claim that every. negative. experience. they have had is “trauma.” 

throughout my time on social media i have seen SO many people claim to have ptsd from a significant other cheating, losing a friend due to petty drama, etc. 

i am not trying to invalidate anyone by saying that these experiences aren’t hard and that they can’t be traumatic, and i have no problem with people asking about this to genuinely understand the disorder, but by definition in the DSM you do not qualify for a ptsd diagnosis unless you have been “exposed to one or more event(s) that involved death or threatened death, actual or threatened serious injury, or threatened sexual violation,” by either you directly experiencing it, witnessing it occur to another person, learning of it happening to a close friend or relative, or being repeatedly exposed to details of a distressing event. 

i am so tired of opening up to people about my PTSD and hearing “oh yeah i have ptsd too, my girlfriend left me for someone else.” like...really? 
do NOT compare me being raped, someone nearly getting killed, or witnessing an act of extreme violence to you having a bad break up. it’s fucking insensitive, minimizing, and plain disrespectful to everyone with a ptsd diagnosis. 

im sorry if this sounded harsh, but i am just so fed up and tired of this shit. it’s hurtful.

edit: i am not talking about people who actually have ptsd and choose to only share smaller events. i am also not saying it’s okay to compare traumas to see who’s is “worse,” and i am not trying to tell people what is and isnt trauma. im just stating that recently people have been throwing the term “ptsd” around the same way they do adhd and ocd, and it’s actually really harmful."
"Does anyone else have those moments of realisation, where you’re like: “What the fuck actually happened to me?“",280,go6018,86,"I sometimes just do a random chore or something that doesn’t require too much attention, and all of a sudden I get this flashing feeling, a thought of “how the fuck did this *actually* happen to me”, like, true shock that something like that is part of your life story..?

The person who sexually abused me was denied parole with no chance for another hearing!,282,cchxuv,19,"The hearing was today. I didn't go but the victims services advocate I've been talking to emailed me about it. I didn't end up writing an impact statement. I tried but it was too triggering so I let the advocate know that and she asked for my permission to tell the parole board that I was too triggered to write an impact statement because that alone gives an idea of the impact. So I told her to tell them and that I also thought they should know that I've been diagnosed with PTSD and I'm in therapy and on antidepressants and anxiety medication and medical marijuana for it.
The email said: ""The reasons for the denial are: nature and circumstances of the offense, injury and impact to the victim’s and inadequate institutional program participation.""
I replied to ask her when he'd be up for parole again and she said: ""He won’t be.  The board denied him with no chance for a re-hear.  There are other means of release thru the department of corrections, please be sure to keep your registration current so that if he applies you will be notified.""
I'm so relieved. 
And he didn't even get to leave prison to go to the courthouse. They did a video conference from the prison.  And no one showed up in support of him or even to do an impact statement. No one he knew cares about him anymore. There's no one who wants him released. He has nothing and no one and I'm glad.
Even if he does get out, there's at least 7 men in my family who own guns and want to shoot him and he's well aware of that so he'd probably stay away. I found out recently that when he was first questioned after I reported the abuse, he asked the police to protect him from my father. He's a pathetic bastard."

"The word ""trigger""",279,cemx2h,43,"It really irritates me that the word ""trigger"" or ""triggered"" has been turned into a joke and a meme and people just casually throw it around whenever something is mildly inconvenient.
Then when I try to explain to people what my triggers are, they treat it as if I'm just being overdramatic because of the contexts in which they normally see the word.
It makes me feel self-conscious about asking someone not to do something because it's triggering since I worry that people who don't know what I have been through will assume I'm just an overly sensitive person who needs to ""get over it"""

9 YEARS TODAY,273,c77zfj,49,"Today is the 9 year anniversary of when I was kidnapped, raped, and almost murdered. I escaped by jumping out of a moving vehicle (45 mph or more). I survived.

There are more ways to die than just physically. Some of us experienced things that pushed us beyond our ability for parts of us to survive. Some of us can't even pretend we are who we used to be anymore because the pain and the fear destroyed that person. If you ask me, that's not surviving. My joy didn't survive. My humor and my internal peace didn't survive. I may be breathing but I'm sure as hell not living.

Congrats to those who *are* survivors."
Second worst thing about being traumatized is when nobody believes you,268,luem3y,32,"I have been crying and shaking for hours and days and yet people believe i could be lying about what happened 

Sometimes i wish i had more visible bruises so they’d believe me but I doubt even then they’d listen 

All I’ve been told with little to no comfort is to just “get over it already” i cant believe someone saying “You didnt deserve what happened to you” would be too much...."
I wish people understood the way triggers work,268,jijezf,67,"Although lots of my triggers are very reasonably “scary” things, lots of them are also seemingly innocent or harmless. I don’t really talk about my PTSD but the few times I commented on something being “triggering”, I got laughed at. I wish people understood that I’m not traumatized by something “silly”; rather, that thing is somehow a reminder of a much much uglier part.

Just because something is a trigger, doesn’t mean that particular thing gave me PTSD. I’m not a “snowflake” that got traumatized by something so trivial, ANYTHING can be a trigger. A word, a smell, a picture, a concept, literally anything. Even a puppy can be a trigger. A trigger doesn’t have to be something blatantly ugly. 

It seems like people confuse the trauma with the things that trigger it, such as flashbacks and what not. They’re nowhere near the same thing. If someone drops a pen, and they have a full blown episode over it, it doesn’t mean they’re literally afraid of dropping pens. It’s just a reminder of something much much more sinister that happened to them.

Obviously, everyone in this sub already knows this. So I guess I’m just venting instead of educating. I just get so frustrated with this."

Do you ever look up symptoms of PTSD just so you don’t feel so insane?,267,ala06x,43,Sometimes when I’m especially struggling with my symptoms I spend hours looking up symptoms of PTSD so I feel a little less insane about what I’m feeling and what’s happening to me. Sometimes it makes me feel like I fit in a small niche of people who can relate.
PTSD makes me see myself as a person that things have been done to and less of a person that does things,264,ds8aof,42,"it’s easier to recall the traumas i’ve experienced than my own attributes, accomplishments, activities, etc. it makes me feel so inhuman, like i’m a punching bag and not a person."
"Is it common to downplay or even question your trauma? To feel that your pain isn’t valid, that you’re making it up, that you have no right to suffer because of it?",263,cx2rb3,67,"I could always acknowledge that I had some bad experiences in my childhood. My mom was bi-polar, an alcoholic and addict. My dad traveled for work and when he was home, he ignored what was happening. I spent most of my childhood being the protector of my younger brother.

Anyway, I’ve had anxiety and depression my whole life (as far back as I can remember), but this past year it has been particularly bad. Inpatient stays, outpatient, therapy, etc. A few weeks ago, I started having flashbacks, and my mind just can’t stop thinking of the things that happened. 

I’ve been angry. At first, it was towards my mom, but lately I just feel angry at myself. I think things like, “did this even happen? why am I making such a big deal out of this? Do I just want attention? Do I just want to feel bad for myself? I didn’t know exactly what was causing my anxiety and depression, so have I just resorted to blaming it on my childhood? Was it even that bad? I just need to suck it up, stop thinking about it, it’s over and I’m fine.”

Has anyone else had this experience? 

(I am in therapy but the CPTSD symptoms have only recently manifested so I’m very new to this and so far, I guess I just don’t feel like any of this is valid)"
Let’s talk about the elephant in the room,263,m7z65v,51,"Every time you see PTSD symptoms online or elsewhere, they include the classic symptoms such as flashbacks, hyper vigilance, etc. However, nobody talks about another common symptom, minimizing your trauma. Saying things like, “What happened to me wasn’t that bad. Others have been through worse.” The reason why we do this is because it’s our brain trying to protect itself from potentially more emotional damage but in reality, that’s exactly what it’s doing, causing more damage. Think of it like a fever. A fever can help you recover. When the fever gets dangerously hot, your body is still using this as a way to protect itself but in reality, it’s just making the illness worse. 

I also use apps to help with my trauma but none of them have anything to help out with this symptom when they really should as it is a very common and miserable symptom. That’s all I have to say. Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
Did anyone else make potentially very problematic mistakes immediately after the trauma? And now the memories of those mistakes are as bad as the memory of the trauma?,261,i41i5y,52,"I have the memories of trauma under control (sorta) I tell myself it's not my fault. 

But then I also have memories of making bad mistakes post trauma event and my brain's first thought is that death is the only option."
This has probably been said a lot but...,260,gwwayj,246,"...I am so sick of people claiming to have PTSD who simply do not. I just got told that “basically everyone has ptsd.” Actually, there are a lot of people who do not. And to say that being traumatized is the same thing as having ptsd has to be the most uninformed opinion I have ever heard. Being diagnosed by a doctor is important and it matters. Our episodes are real and dangerous. I’m just sick of people making light of the situation."
"I don't like them taking away the word ""victim"".",259,f18z9g,72,"There's a real push in PC culture right now for not just people with PTSD but rape and abuse victims also to not call themselves ""victim"" but rather ""survivor"". The problem with that is, I WAS victimized. That kind of language benefits the people who harm us, because if they see us as ""survivors"" than they can go on abusing us and it's like it doesn't matter. You can do anything to a ""survivor"". Also, it shames people coming forward because the word ""victim"" has become negative and shameful. I think instead of replacing ""victim"" with another word, we should be making it so that ""victim"" is not a shameful thing to be. You hear whining mostly on the right, mostly aimed at women, about people, mostly women, accused of ""playing the victim"". The solution to that isn't to call yourself something else, but to assert that yes, I am a victim, but no I am not playing or pretending. This all actually happened to me. If I were a ""survivor"" I feel like that just makes me violable because I'm then expected to be ""tough enough"" to ""handle it"". It puts pressure on victims by telling US to get over it and cope and be strong, rather than pressuring abusers to change THEIR shitty patterns of behavior. I understand that individual people might like feeling like a ""survivor"", but I feel like the label is toxic because it's telling the victims how to approach handling being victimized. I do want to be a victim, because I was one, and fuck anyone telling me what to call myself. 

This was also brought up in the second season of *Thirteen Reasons Why*, and I thought, like many mental health issues in that show, that it was handled in such a garbage way. Basically, a main character was raped while under the influence of alcohol at a party. She has a hard time getting over it. A feminist in charge of a ""rape survivors"" group tells her to join them ""when you're ready to stop being a victim and start being a survivor"". In other words, her shaming the character into being the right kind of ""strong survivor"" type of person, and being sad was seen as weak. She was also shaming her into going forward with legal action against her rapist. The show acted like it was important that she do that, no sympathy for victims who do not report. I feel like this is reflective of larger problems with society wanting everyone to always project an aura of strength and confidence, where we bully, ridicule, and shame people for being weak or emotionally damaged."
One of the most simple yet painful things nobody talks about,256,jvns8u,26,Is wanting be taken care of when you’re sick. Just wanting someone to hold you or bring you soup or water or hold your hair or go to the doctor with you.

My first psychiatrist told me I wouldn't live past 18. I am almost 21 now.,255,d4bj39,36,"Today I logged onto my insurance's website to see what my options were for a psychiatrist due to PTSD flare ups and flashbacks over the last year. The first one to pop up was the same guy I saw at the age of twelve when my mom had cancer and I had found out I was sexually abused.

He put me on a cocktail of medications, switching me between about eight different SSRI's within four months. I tried to kill myself twice in that time, ran away three times and was baker acted. He told my therapist and mom I wouldn't make it past 18.

My therapist disagreed and referred me to a new psychiatrist, who got me off all of my medications and weaned me to the smallest dose of Klonopin instead of the 6mg/day he had me on.

I turn 21 soon and I want nothing more than to schedule an appointment just to show my face - grown up, alive, living on my own, two jobs and going to school.

I am by no means past my PTSD or anxiety but I am definitely still alive and no longer suicidal.

Anyone else feel their cPTSD recovery is like a full time job?,245,hlsudx,37,"
Anyone else feel their cPTSD recovery is like a full time job?

Healing from PTSD has been the hardest but most important job I've ever had! I am so glad my real job is so low key that I am able to have more time to take care of myself.

There is a lot of crucial energy and time spent trying to heal from trauma such as processing the emotions from trauma during hard dreams/ triggers/flashbacks, educating myself about the abuse, the self care, mental health care, leaving toxic relationships, isolating, learning and setting boundaries, self parenting, etc ..

This hard work is paying off and I am so proud of myself and glad I love and care about myself enough to do it. I will never give up on myself, I am my number one advocate and supporter. Who else feels like recovery is like a full time job? Who else is proud of their inner strength to do this warrior work?"
Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?,244,bfa8ho,45,"
Do people assume you’re “dumb” or “slow” because of trauma symptoms?

I’ve been called slow and dumb my whole life. A lot of people think I am ditzy and an airhead. Often I’m not aware what is going on in the present moment because I am in my head (anxiety, dissociation, ruminating thoughts). I often will have slow responses to people because I am emotionally dysregulated, I was distracting myself and/or hypervigilant as I try to read the person/situation (I try to figure out if I am safe and can trust them). When I get dysregulated, I often freeze and forget what I am doing. I know my cPTSD symptoms are a big reason I appear “slow” because when I take a mood stabler, a lot of those symptoms go away. I also I wonder if having cPTSD for so long had changed my brain so I am slower and have a slower processing speed.
It bothers me a lot when I get patronized and treated like I’m slow/dumb. Sometimes people think I am lying when I say I went to graduate school. Also, sometimes I attract manipulative, insecure and sexist men who like to feel like they are superior and try to infantilize me because they think I’m
Slow and inferior. 

Anyone else relate? How do you deal?"
Update on predator lurking this sub. TW CSA,243,i4qeqg,47,"I’ll try keep it short because we had a post like this not too long ago but I’ve got new info I wanted to share. 

There is a person lurking this sub who has gone by previous usernames such as “coder” and “isusha”. They started by messaging me with something along the lines of “hey I saw your post on X and I was hoping I could just vent to you. Awaiting your reply” 

They say they are a minor being abused. When you engage them they are extremely insistent on NOT calling CPS or the cops. They say they just want to vent and they eventually just want to describe the abuse to you. 

I didn’t report it immediately because i was worried it might be an actual confused child :(
But another user messaged me the other day saying she had received the exact same kind of messages from “coder” (his old username). 

I think it’s safe to say this person is going to a lot of these subs and messaging people. Since they have created new usernames and deleted old ones I also think it’s safe to say they will continue this behavior. 

I’m sure there are other people like this lurking as well. I just wanted to share this persons particular narrative and method to help you guys identify them if they try writing you from a new username. 

Stay safe everyone. I know this sucks but we are adults now who can make safe choices and I am trying to see this as an opportunity to practice setting boundaries, and standing up to creeps. The younger me would have given this abuser endless empathy and tried to help them/given them the benefit of the doubt that they were a child in need. 

I feel empowered that I am learning to trust my intuition! My gut knew something was off when they first messaged me and it was confirmed when another user told me they experienced the same thing."
Does anyone else use humor or act really casual when you’re trying to communicate to others that you are actually having a major crisis?,240,deymfr,30,"I’m looking back at some very serious situations throughout my life, things like severe flashbacks, panic attacks or even worse, and since I usually always keep everything related to my PTSD to myself until I absolutely need somebody’s help, I have noticed that I when I do finally reach out, I always say to my friends something like, “hey man, i think i might be, like, buggin’ out big time.” Or my most recent one, “uh, i think i’m going off the rails, dude.” And my voice will be very even and calm, but I can feel how much I’m physically shaking, my heart is on jackhammer mode and I’m sure the sheer terror is evident in my eyes, because my friends always know something major is going on. Is anybody else like this?? I think I do it because I don’t want to make a big deal about shit, or maybe I’m scared if I were more expressive then people might not take me seriously or something (unfounded, my friends are very empathetic) and then I would feel worse.

"People have such burning hatred for poor people, and it's extremely..... upsetting",238,f6zhl4,65,"I suffer from PTSD from mutiple different things in my life, but one of the most intense and horrifying to remember is when I was homeless for a year. 

In America at least (though Im sure in other places as well), once you become homeless or in poverty, you're no longer a part of ""society"". You're not a ""member of society"", you're a Burden. A 'leech', for needing anything, anything at all, even something as small as a listening ear or breadcrumb. It's an offense to even suggest you may need help, to suggest that anyone should even consider helping you. Because in their eyes, you must have done something to ""deserve"" poverty, or homeless. It's like a moral branding to them. It doesn't matter how you became severely poor/homeless, and it doesnt matter how desperately you're fighting to survive/escape your circumstances. ""Poor/homeless"" is all they need to know to ""know"" that you're unworthy of help, or of compassion. You're the scum beneath their feet. You're not even human.

Even after being homeless and tormented for a year, and then in poverty for 4, I still feel myself become crushed under the weight of people's disgust for poor/homeless people. It utterly shocks me. It steals the breath from my lungs. 

The internet is full of cruelty and anger, obviously, but..... it's not just on the internet, anyways, not by a longshot. People are not shy about their disgust for poor people, and if you haven't been in extreme poverty you may not have even noticed how bad it is. You may have some deeply rooted hatred and judgement inside you, too. 

It's. horrifying. And it brings me back to the most horrifying days/experiences of my life. I think i had a conclusion to this, but i feel like a child again, starving and absolitely terrified and being proven to that even the mostly seemly compassionate or kind people will turn on you the moment you have no money. The moment you become """"worthless"""". 

Here's a conclusion i guess,,, Anyone else traumatized by poverty/homelessness, or more specifically, how people treated you because you were in poverty/homeless"

I just found out my father is a narcissistic pedophile.,240,e99dy8,30,"Welp. I went to family therapy to try to work out all the demons caused by my parents for covering up my brothers repeated violent sexual assault of me when i was a child from the ages of 5-14. Our family had always unusual dynamics, that much was clear, a genre of abuse could be spotted with some time spent around my parents. And not the masks they put on for the guests. Their true, screaming “YOU BRING ME NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS, YOURE DESTROYING THE FAMILY, I WISH I NEVER HAD KIDS, I WISH I WAS DEAD.” selves.

We went to therapy and I had suspected the truth but I could not believe it until I had confirmation. My brothers abuse has been hid from everyone in his life including his wife. To ask an oblique question I asked my mom, “What would you do if you found out Dad was a pedohpile?” My question was to her but my eyes were on him. 

The shock.

My heart sank.

I gave my brother an out not an excuse to explain the chain of abuse. 

“Did dad sexually assault you?” Crawled out of me. 

“Yes.”

It was the weakest, most pathetic thing I had ever seen. But it was the truth. I had worn down their defences. I am going no contact with two people now. My mom is a victim of abuse herself but grew up in the 50’s and also had her story brushed aside. That set an example for her. She’s now brushed aside her husbands and sons acts knowingly just to keep the family reputation. I was the sacrifice for the cogs. 

I have never felt more old or more tired."

I'm so sick of being afraid and turning that into anger at myself for being scared at basically nothing.

edit: i see some people misinterpreting my point so i’ll say again that i’m not implying that weed or other substances don’t help people, it’s just hurtful when people refuse to take no for answer and try to pressure you to do it, whether that’s through friends or dms. i’m glad some people have good experiences and want other people to as well, but it’s not helpful to nag someone about it if they say no, especially when it’s a stranger."
"""The Body Keeps the Score"" is probably the most comprehensive and easiest to read book on PTSD",234,cxhu5q,24,"I've posted about this book before on /r/ptsd , but it helped me so much, I think it bears reposting. The book came out in 2015, so its relatively new. It was written by a psychologist who attempted to treat PTSD in Vietnam Veterans in the early 1970s and has been trying to understand trauma of all forms for his entire career. It is written partly as a description of his career and the technological developments that helped doctors understand trauma, but it also goes into great detail describing the physical mechanisms of trauma and how to overcome them. And yes, you can overcome them.

I have PTSD from a near death experience that landed me in a 9 day medically induced coma. In trying to recover, I kept meeting people talking about 'energy' or memories living in our muscles and it just always felt confusing or vague and even more disempowering. This book REALLY demystified a lot of these concepts for me and helped me believe for the first time that not only were my problems understandable, but that there were practical things that I could do to move beyond them."

A more recent example I've seen is in my favorite game Persona 5 the Royal, the character Ryuji had already been physically abused by his dad and coach, then his friends casually called him ""stupid"" and beat up on him. There's even a controversial scene in the original Persona 5 where Ryuji is implied to get assaulted by two stereotypical gay men. And this isn't the first example of a character abused for comedy in the history of Atlus games.
As a domestic violence victim who's abuse was treated as comedy or punishment in real life, it brings me back to a time where my pain was used as a punchline. My abuser and his friend thought it was funny when I got upset in response to abuse. Im not trying to be some tumblrina complaining, im trying to explain that abuse isnt funny and shouldn't be treated as such."
"I suddenly understand what that whole ""being relaxed"" thing everyone always talks about is like. It's astonishing what therapy can do when done right.",232,l1zct8,29,"After years and years of holding on to various traumas that manifested themselves in a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from excruciating nightmares and panic attacks to hallucinations and psychosomatic heartache, I finally went through an intense process of treatment. I was so skeptical before and during the process(And damn, it was hard), but suddenly, something clicked: I could look back at myself in those memories and feel sad for that girl instead of living in those memories as if they were constantly surrounding me.   
I experienced an intense release of emotion(for quite a while, bless my flatmate's hearts for dealing with me) and my body finally stopped tensing up like it constantly would. I stopped feeling the urge to drink every day. I got my period for the first time in 4 years. I find myself sitting in my room feeling abnormal about finally feeling normal. It's insane.

I know I'm not fully healed, I still get intrusive thoughts, still have nightmares, and still get anxiety attacks among other symptoms. It's a work in progress. I still need to get back on the job market and know that once the lockdowns are over, I might be confronted with certain things again that might require more help. However, I found solace in the knowledge that things truly can get better. If you're reading this and feeling low: I wish you all the best and am hopeful that you will feel better. No feeling lasts forever. :)

I really miss being neurotypical...,229,ghcc57,62,"I miss having great memory, i miss having a lot of friends, i miss having energy, i miss being happy for no reason, i miss being able to articulate myself clear, i miss... me... the me that has been lost"
Does anyone else “forget” that their trauma actually happened to them?,227,e12eh2,58,"To me, mine just feels like a fairy tale that I tell people when the conversation arises (For context: I’m fairly open about explaining what happened). It feels distant or cutoff during my explanations to others. Often, it doesn’t hit me that it *actually* happened until I react to a trigger or someone says something that brings it all back. I don’t know if that made any sense or not, feel free to ask for clarification. I’m also undiagnosed as a disclaimer."
You dont have to justify your diagnosis,227,dub9ut,55,"I posted an article on Facebook about PTSD and my exfiance's aunt commented on it ' Why did you have this? Were you in the service'

I immediately want to respond and defend myself. But I realized I don't need to open myself up about my traumas on a Facebook comment. 

Just because you don't have PTSD from combat experience doesn't mean you weren't traumatized. And you  don't have to justify yourself to anyone. If you opened up to a therapist and they diagnosed you with PTSD that's all the justification you need. 

I think I'm just going to respond to her with general information about PTSD. Because my trauma isn't anyone's buisness but mine."
Think the stigma ever goes away? Think again.,225,h0adkq,28,"Two nights ago I had a pretty uncomfortable conversation with one of my best friends. I’m not sure if this necessarily has changed our friendship but it just reinforces that there is a long way to go with society’s view of mental health issues - especially in healthcare where they are “supposed” to at least show some compassion in treatment.

But anyways, my friend is an ER nurse and no lie she works in a pretty rough spot. I know she’s got to see some shit every hour. I get that. I’m a school teacher at a rough school too. I get frustrated with shit. I know with my ptsd, I might have something in common with the harder students. So I keep an open mind and heart.

Anyways, that’s why it was hard when my friend started laughing and talking about one of the patients that came in. She gave me details, it was basically a man who was suffering at first what they thought was hallucinations/paranoia. Turns out he was a war veteran and experiencing severe flashbacks, talking to himself, screaming, flailing, you get the picture. 

I was shocked at her tone and how she was laughing, I suppose out of shock herself because she had to help restrain the man and called the cops to transport him to a different psych hospital. At the end of her story, I just said “Don’t you think that could’ve been me? What’s so funny about that?”

I could tell immediately she was thrown off and she just started insisting that no, mine was different and blah, blah, blah. Like no. That man and I might have different symptoms/circumstances but we’re still in the same boat. How am I supposed to feel when a health care professional has that attitude - and when that person knows the delicate details of my own condition? 

Sorry for this rant but I suppose I needed to get it off my chest. As I’m wondering how far we have to go in order to get people to understand us, have sympathy. We don’t choose our triggers, we can’t wish the trauma away. We can’t put a band aid on our brains."
"""Your PTSD can´t be that bad, you have not been to war""",227,c1p29o,151,"Hello, sorry if this does not fit here, but it is something that has been bothering me for a long time. I am a 20 year old female and have been struggeling with PTSD since my childhood.

Does anyone else have this problem? I always get responses like ""But you haven´t been to war, you were just in a bad family"" Or"" Your'e to young to have that"" or ""Everyone goes through hard spotts in life, just get over it"" Or "" That is so unbelieveble, No like I litarly can't believe you"" And it really hurt so I just resorted to keeping quiet about it, but the people notice I am weird and just don't hangout with me.

A small victory.,224,ltsszw,19,"Today I brushed my hair and ate solid food for the first time in 2 months! I also managed to blow off some steam,maby not the right way I handled it but I got some stuff off my chest, I also managed to drink 5 glasses of water. Its small but for me its huge, im so happy and hope I can keep this up and not be let down if I have an off day again."
My grandmother is dying and I could not care less. Fuck her and that time she tried to kill me.,221,loyzj4,48,"I don’t even know where to begin.  My grandmother is the most toxic and vile person that I have ever come across.  Not only just in real life either, but even across movies and TV shows.  I can’t think of a more disgusting repulsive human being.  

My first ever memory from my childhood is of her beating the shit out of me.  I couldn’t have been more than 6 years old.  I was on the couch in the fetal position trying to cover my head whilst taking shots.  Then I blacked out.  

This is about par for the course for grandma.  In my family they say, “oh it’s just grandma being grandma.  Just don’t think about it.”

I guess that’s just what you say when you’ve spent a life time taking beatings from this fucking midget ogre.  I hear my mom and her sisters took beatings even worse than we did.  I still remember her losing her mind and beating the living pulp out of my brother and my cousin.  My grandpa had to tackle her and restrain her on numerous occasions.  Prying whatever object out of her hands that she decided would be the tool she would use to beat us with; Broom handle, wooden beating paddle, bare knuckles with rings, didn’t matter. 

It’s not like we were the worst kids in the entire fucking world either.  Like we deserved to be beaten that way.  All you had to do was look at her funny, or say something in the wrong tone, or disagree with her, or express your feelings, or just simply exist and be around her.  Didn’t matter.  If she wanted to dish out a beating, simply because she felt like it, well then you were going to catch a beating.  

For some reason, everybody in my family still supports and sympathizes with this tragic waste of human life.  I can only imagine this must be due to Stockholm syndrome.  I sure as hell don’t fucking understand it.  Fuck her.  

The first and only time that I (or anybody for that matter) ever tried to stand up to her I almost died.  She was calling my girlfriend a slut because she liked to wear thigh high skirts.  I told her so what, I like the way she dresses and that’s all that matters.  She told me her parents should be ashamed of her, I interrupted her and told her “yeah but you’re not her parents,  she can do whatever she wants and she can wear whatever she wants.  You are not her mother.”  Grandma screams at me “EXCUSE ME!  DONT YOU EVER TALK TO YOUR GRANDMOTHER THAT WAY!  YOU LISTEN AND SHUT UP!”  To which I carelessly and recklessly replied “fuck you, go fuck yourself.  Nobody cares what you think”

She grabbed the biggest knife out of the kitchen, at minimum a 12” kitchen utility knife, and trotted her fat ass right towards me.  Fire burning in her eyes.  I jumped out of my chair and threw it behind me in the hopes that it would get in her way and slow down her chase.  She stops at the other end of the kitchen table.  I’m at the opposite corner, trapped.  I instinctively grab the other chairs and pull them out, hopping I can use them some how to escape.  We play a game of cat and mouse.  Jab stepping both left and right to see who is going to make the first move.  The stupid bitch takes my bait and goes right to where I faked, I dip and go around the other way.  She lunges at me over the chairs and table, swiping at me with the giant fucking blade in her hand.  I narrowly escape.  I dip and bend my torso to avoid her savage attempts at murdering me.  I sprint down the hall to my room.  I try to shut the door but she’s right behind me trying to push it back open. I shove the door back into her and just barely get it to close behind me.  I lock the door handle whilst she kicks, punches, and stabs at the door.  All while screaming and screeching that she’s going to fucking kill me.  

I call the police.  They arrive moments later.  I’ve already packed a bag of my necessities.  I just want to get the fuck out of dodge.  The cops escort me out as my my grandmother screams and yells to the cops to arrest me, to kick me out of her house.  I walk out quietly and tell the cops I just want to leave and go to my friends house.  They oblige.  

This woman, my grandma, this piece of shit Is the reason that I suffer from PTSD.  I don’t believe in a heaven or a hell, there is no reasoning or justice for the bull shit that she’s put me through, but I hope she spends eternity suffering a miserable existence.  I don’t care what or where that is, just make her as miserable as she’s made the rest of this world.  

Fuck you grandma you lousy piece of shit.  I don’t give two shits about your final days here on earth.  I hope it hurts, I hope you regret everything.  I will never forgive you.  You are not my family.  We may be related by blood, but you are not my family.  I get to choose the people in my family.  Good fucking riddance."
I'm a man who was raped by a woman,224,jgsh1v,56,"I understand most people don't take this seriously. The first and only time I have ever told anyone else outside of writing it here, I was told ""So, you got laid. Coolio. Good for you! There's no way you didn't like it. She's hot, man, how was it?!"" Had I been a young female, I think my friend's reaction and people's reaction would be different. But because I'm a man, I like sex, apparently.

Anyway, I was in college and starting to deal with my childhood traumas. I opened up to a woman not much older than me for the first time about that stuff. We were in class and tasked with writing a personal story and share it with our partner for feedback with regards to the style of poetry we were told to use. The first red flag should have been when she asked ""Are you **sure** you were abused as a kid?"" When I defended myself gently, she apologized very much and so forth. During our break, we got a coffee and she leaned in to kiss me. I leaned back and apologized, saying that I wasn't comfortable with being intimate with anyone that I wasn't at least a year or more into a relationship, and how I was also the type to save sex for marriage."" ""Sure you are."" She said smiling. She forced herself on me, kissing me, and I caved. Anxiety. Fear, my body saying yes while my mind was trying to escape in fear.

Long story short, we had a back-and-forth love/hate relationship and I was too spineless and weak to break out a partnership in class off. She needed my help with something one night at her house, and she paid me for it. All good. But then she pushed me on the sofa, took our clothes off... and I'll leave the rest up to your imagination. I felt broken, nearly crying in front of her, but then played it off as anxiety and anger, scurrying out of her home, barely putting my clothes back on before exiting the door. 'Was that good for you too, baby?"" She said when she saw me leaving. When I'd tried to fight her off initially, she was like ""I always control the situation. Why would you fight me? Just let it happen, let me ride you, you might like it since you're a virgin, I promise you'll be safe. Learn from your past punishment.""

I'm pretty logical. I haven't done therapy for this, but previous traumas and never found therapy helpful. But this just gets to me because since I am naturally attracted to women, I have this poor defense when I'm near one because I know that I probably wouldn't be strong enough to fight one off of that happened. When a man did the same, I was able to try at least, to fight it off because there was no level of attraction. Yes, I orgasmed in her and that's what breaks me. I made a vow to save sex for marriage and she forced it out of me. Maybe I shouldn't say forced, since I wasn't strong enough to stop her. If I had... anyway. It's been years since this happened and I feel more ashamed about the girl-raping-guy part than the guy on guy part.

Not sure what my intention here was, I suppose just to vent and see if anyone has relating feelings or experiences."
Anyone else have digestive issues and when your PTSD flares up so does your digestive issues?,222,imeaoc,58,"My PTSD has really gotten out of hand this week. And now I can't seem to stomach anything. Even when I try to eat, I get the worst stomach aches. Does anyone else relate?"
Whenever a man yells at me I start crying so hard and get really triggered and it's exhausting,221,fx96i6,23,"Thanks, dad. I really appreciate it."
There is a negative lurker in this sub,219,efol2x,32,"I made a post and recieved negative messages from someone claiming they have cPTSD. 

If you post something on here, know that you are very brave to even open up to a bunch of strangers.

Thank you for the support and for listening to others.

Do any of you feel as though you attract abusive personalities or that your PTSD makes you more prone to tolerating others that you wouldn't otherwise?,221,cgzuoe,65,"***I am NOT saying that the victim is to blame - nobody EVER deserves abuse or anything less than the best in any relationship dynamic. I do not think that people with PTSD are merely crying wolf over and over; I want to clarify that, so that people don't get the wrong idea. Below is merely my experience, and I know a few friends with PTSD/histories of trauma have related to my experiences & interpretations.*** 

&#x200B;

I've realized that whether it be friends, romantic partners, even roommates - I tend to find myself with people whom are narcissistic & don't want to recover or take accountability for themselves, people whom take advantage of me, or whom are abusive. I know that I don't deserve or want this treatment, but I know that my PTSD often takes over, and doubts the ""red flags"" I feel other people would react to, or I allow many more boundary violations than I should. Essentially, I feel as though the ways in which my PTSD has manifested causes me to allow really abusive, manipulative, etc., people into my life whom I wouldn't otherwise give the time of day.

&#x200B;

Does anybody else experience this? It's really started to fuck with my head, and makes me wonder if my roommate's claims (most recent occurrence of this) are true. Especially since he's started to be all buddy buddy with my other roommate, since I put boundaries in place and I stopped tolerating his BS. It does make me wonder if i'm just such a fucked up person that I don't even realize I'm fucked up - if that makes sense?"
"I just realized I’m not lazy, I’m emotionally shutdown",221,ipqwaf,29,"Just venting:

I’ve been fortunate enough to have five days scheduled off from work. But during this time, I laid around and didn’t do anything productive *even though I wanted to*.


Today it dawned on me that I’m struggling doing tasks because of issues relating to executive dysfunction, from being emotionally shutdown and numb. 

I’m temporarily living with a relative that is causing my PTSD symptoms to, “come out.” And these past five days have been difficult with her. We’re stuck together because of finances. I have no idea when I will be able to leave."
"""My trauma is worse than yours""",218,jg0gf1,61,"These are words I hope no one ever hears or says to anyone else. It's extremely belittling and ignorant to say this to someone else. Unfortunately, these are the words I heard from my mom last night. 

Honestly, I know she went through more than I did. And I constantly tell myself that what I went through wasn't ""that bad"". But there's just some days where it really gets to me, and that's when she tells me to just ""get over it"". She wanted me to do my schoolwork, but I had a nightmare and it really messed me up for the day. But instead of offering support to me, she said, ""A nightmare? You couldn't do schoolwork for a whole day because of a nightmare? You want to talk about trauma? Mine was worse than yours.""

So that wasn't fun. My nightmares are occurring much more frequently atm because it's almost the trauma anniversary, and my mom doesn't seem to care or want to help, even though we went through one of the traumas together. It sucks.

Anyway thats my first post here, thanks for having me here."
Small accomplishment: I took pain medication instead of just letting myself suffer!,219,gxw8xm,24,"It may seem silly. But a lot of my issues come from being raised in a toxic household. I was constantly belittled or even punished for showing any ""negative"" emotions. So showing pain or taking any medication that could help was taboo. Even taking prescribed pain medicine after a surgery was laughed at.

I've been trying to listen to my body and realize it's okay to seek help when I'm hurting. I'm really bruised and sore from a fall a couple days ago.... So I took some medicine! Now I feel so much better and can do other things besides be in pain! :)"
"Something I’ve noticed about trauma... The longer you wait to cry, the harder you do.",218,fi7nam,22,
I called out my abuser in his establishment’s TripAdvisor comments for what he did to me and all the girls in the group I was traveling with. I feel both empowered and very alone.,213,crkxq9,22,"Ten years ago I traveled abroad with a group for a “gap year” in South America. We had a weird and terrible experience when we went to a spa retreat owned by an ex-pat American man. 7 of the other girls were molested during a “spiritual healing” ceremony without anyone saying a word, they all were 18 and that’s the only reason I can think they didn’t speak up. I went last and fought the abuser and got out of there, then went to my group leader with it and as I told her about it the rest of the group chimed in saying “me too me too!” Against our wishes the group leader told the abuser the reason why we decided to leave early, and the abuser came to my room at night to try to tell me it was all innocent. I was still just a kid but I had to be the face of the group. Then our own group’s leader talked to me about it later in the trip and said it was all a misunderstanding, that things were different back in the hippy days and she was raised with that kind of thing and he didn’t mean anything by it. I went home from the trip afraid of being touched at all by my significant other and it took months for me to recover enough to just be touched. 

Flash forward to today. I watched a documentary about a man who abused foster kids, and at the end the story said the abuser had moved to a tiny island outside Guam where there was little oversight. I remembered my experience and I realized it’s possible he’s still out there doing exactly the same thing. Sure enough, his TripAdvisor is full of recent reviews - he’s definitely still in business. And as I searched I found out a woman went to his establishment and was raped by him, two months after our group’s visit. She traveled back to his country with her husband to sue him and talk to the media. Reading this really validated my experience because I had been wavering in my mind about the experience all these years. But this was a totally separate incident right at the same time we were there. 

So, I wrote about the experience in detail in their TripAdvisor comments. I explained exactly what happened in that public forum. I felt I needed to take some sort of action and I think this was an impactful thing to do. I’m worried TripAdvisor might take the comment down. I got a message back from his wife on my review and it essentially said I must be mistaken. It brings me joy to think he and his wife had to revisit this subject yet again, and that I might save someone else from going through what I did. 

It feels good to have done it but it hurts me that I can’t share it with anyone. I feel empowered but also alone.

Edit: Thank you for the support. I have actually been feeling guilty for possibly hurting this guy’s family’s livelihood and started questioning myself, so your support is really appreciated. I’m thousands of miles away and relatively anonymous, but I still don’t feel “safe”."
Anyone here enters a freeze/dissociated state instead of panic/flight/fight? How to cope?,216,jmua86,69,"I don’t want to go into detail as to why i have PTSD but i noticed instead of panic/flight/fight, i have started to dissociate/freeze which is even worse than the panic. 

There are literally days where i can’t remember what i did at all, my mind is empty and i didn’t accomplish anything i wanted to. 

I have a xanax, seroquel & propranolol prescription. I also take adderall for ADHD (30mg total daily) and smoke half a pack a day. None of these seem to do anything though. 

Would love to hear from other people here who enter a dissociated state when triggered and how do you cope?"
Good sex!,216,cj20ex,23,"My PTSD is a result of sexual abuse. It took me a very long time to even be open to the idea of sex. Once I began having sex with a guy I was dating it messed me up a lot. We ended up ending an otherwise great relationship because of all the sexual incompatibility and I've felt very hopeless about dating since then.

But last night I had sex with a guy who was incredibly gentle and asked permission to do everything that we did. I didn't cry or get in my head or lose my shit, and we actually had a second go round. Basically my first overwhelmingly positive sexual experience and I'm so happy that I've cried! There's hope!"
Sometimes I'm So Furious That My Abusers Get to Go on Like Nothing Ever Happened,213,jzsn5s,47,"Today I  stumbled  upon some information  about  2 of my abusers  (my ex-wife and ex-girlfriend). I  saw they both now are involved  in  the  LGBTQ and BDSM communities.  This means  they  will  likely  be  at events  and  those are my communities.  It just  pisses me off they  get to  go  on like  they they  weren't  abusive to  a person  who  belongs  to  those communities  and  now I feel  I have  to  avoid  the  communities  because  they  might be  at any event  sending  me into  a trauma response.  I half want to  spread word in those communities about  what  they did to  me  (sexual and  emotional  abuse), but  I  feel  like if I  do, I  will  just  look  like  the crazy  ex they paint me as. The thing  is,  if those communities  knew the truth  about  them, they  would  not accept  them. Why do  they  get to  go on, keep  friends,  keep  the house, keep the financial  assets, etc. and I'm just  left without  a  community and  CPTSD."

"My girlfriend had a panic attack, we went into a quiet room, and the secretary triggered her PTSD",214,ea8ohm,22,"This took place in school. She was having an attack, and I took her down to the counselor’s, and we went into a quiet room. I closed the door to keep her more comfortable as she cried. The secretary ran, POUNDED on the door, and then SCREAMED that we could not keep the door closed. After opening it, my girlfriend began balling and shaking, the secretary could have cared less. Then, a counselor, actually the school THERAPIST walked by and said that they should send me back and that we’re co-dependent. She knew we could hear. 

I fucking hate people, and I fucking hate school. When we got there the secretary was fed up that we wanted a quiet room. She looked pissed, I could see it. Aggravated, disgusted. She doesn’t deserve her job here. My girlfriend has a crisis card for a damn reason. She comes to the counselor’s for a damn reason.

The way I don’t resist them, I freeze and leave my body when they touch me. They think it’s hot. Even if they did know that they’re triggering my PTSD, I’m not sure if they would even care, just as long as they can get what they want from me. Just a vent I guess..

I've had quite weird and scary dreams these past two nights. The first one was where I was alone with a man in a car, he resembled my abuser body shape wise. I was in a parking lot and the man was in the front seat and I in the back. He got out and walked to where I was, I immediately began to panic even though he didn't enter the car. I was thinking that something bad will happen, he entered the car and I scooted away from him, the dream gets blurry from here but I vividly remember that feeling of extreme fear and helplessness while he was hugging me or having his arm around my waist. (I'm scared of hugs because of what happened to me, I guess that might be connected but I don't know) I was just feeling so so terrified, and I felt that exact same blood curdling fear when the traumatic event was happening. I felt completely frozen both in the dream and the original event. 

Then I was outside a police station and that's where it ended. (I never reported) 

The second one is a lot more obscure and confusing, it was like any ordinary weird dream, I was driving somewhere, it felt as if I was in a video game, but then I was again at a police station. I was inside of the building and then I hear a 17 year old girl scream, 'get off me, get the fuck off me. I'm 17. Stop it, stop it.'

I began to feel fearful and I froze again, but I got the courage to turn the corner and I caught a small glimps of an older man cuddling this girl, I'm assuming it was tight since she couldn't get away. She started to scream something about her boyfriend but her voice didn't sound like it was a little whimper, it was screams of anger, frustration and being fed up. But the man wouldn't let her go.

Then a woman police officer was way too calmly walking down the hallway this was happening, it looked like she won't do anything about the situation because of the way she walked but I woke up straight after seeing that officer so I don't know if she would've done something or not. 

I'm just in a weird place right now. I've been having dreams of sexual assaults/ abuse, even rape (I was never raped) ever since the traumatic event happened. I never had dreams like that before, never. 

Can anyone relate to my situation and is this normal?? I feel so ashamed that I'm having such fucked up dreams even though I was never raped, or touched anywhere private without my consent."
I’m fed up with people constantly telling me to find “meaning“ in my trauma.,210,dv2vch,43,"Let me heal without always having to dig into more pain. I was five. I was 17. I was 23. There are no hardcore “meanings” behind whatever that took place. It didn’t teach me anything positive in life except to fear men. 

If that’s the only way people know how to console somebody, I’d rather be left alone."
I grieve the person i was before,209,d51bvy,24,"i look at old pictures and videos of me and it breaks my heart. I was so full of life even my eyes looked like they had sparkle in them. I was so loud and confident and wasn’t scared of anything or anyone for that matter. I walked with a purpose and a sense of happiness every single day. I loved waking up in the morning and I loved going to sleep knowing the next day I would be able to enjoy life again. I was artistic and loved photography it was my passion and pure bliss to me. I was very social and enjoyed traveling and going out. I always felt things with such deep emotion wether it was good or bad and I truly feel like that is why I used to enjoy life so much. My siblings loved being around me and I enjoyed their company just as much. Are favorite thing was to go to the beach and get pizza afterward. I would find the beauty in the tiniest things that normally people would pay attention to. I would laugh at everything especially with my friends. They were the best friends you could ever ask for and I miss them dearly. I miss always being known as the “hard working” person in my friend group. I miss sitting outside in the middle of the night on the porch with my dog feeling the breeze and having this content feeling within myself knowing that whatever happens in the future that I would get through it. 

My trauma has taken that ability to feel at peace in my soul and heart. 

I hope one day my siblings won’t look at me in such confusion as to why I am not the same anymore. I hope one day I will be able to finish an oil painting without dissociating for long periods of time and not being able to concentrate. I hope one day I am able to hang out with people without freaking out internally because they want to give me a hug. I hope one day I can sit on the porch again and feel that internal peace I once felt before. 

time heals all. i’m hoping time can heal me"
Something weird happened. It saved my life.,209,lys8ua,56,"I was suicidal yesterday and actually planning on using my .357 to end it. My work environment is so negative and everyone hates me so much and they make it a point to let me know so often that I had literally lost the will to live. I’ve had no one in my life for 13 years, no friends, no one. I have nothing. It was my time. 

But I went to a facility at work where I deliver to. Two nurses came up from the bottom floor and immediately asked me about my adoption tattoo. Then they immediately gave me a group hug. It was amazing. I haven’t felt physical affection in 13 years. I didn’t know what to say. I don’t even know them at all. I’ve never believed in god, but sometimes I wonder if we do have people looking out for us. It’s just such strange timing. Plus the topic was brought up in aa meeting tonight. So another coincidence. 

Just thought it was strange, but it saved my life. Maybe I can improve myself enough where people will give me a chance again."
"I don't need a ""breakthrough"" I need relief. I need life to be more than an endurance test",204,ma9xqu,57,"It's not a matter of reframing, I'm not delusional, I'm not in denial, or suppressing my memories:  I'm VERY KNEELY aware of how I'm impact by PTSD. Clinical discussions don't change how I feel, nor do labels. Coping isn't sufficient for me to do more then surivive. Being aware doesn't equal relief and if I cannot do things like work a job, have a relationship, have regular restful sleep, feel the full range of emotions, or even get through a single day without being drained, I'm not sure how I am supposed to have a good quality of life."
I feel ashamed for having PTSD when other people have much more traumatic and understandable causes than mine,206,kd2ba3,103,"I know veterans aren’t the only ones who have PTSD, and I know there are plenty of veterans who probably also feel weak or ashamed or embarrassed for having PTSD. I’m not a veteran, and I can’t stop feeling like my reason for having PTSD isn’t good enough or isn’t as bad as other people’s, especially veterans’. 

I went through almost a year in a relationship filled with emotional and sexual abuse, and now almost half a year of the reporting process with my college that has honestly ended in disaster, with the conduct board blaming me instead of my abuser. I know what I went through was traumatic, I know that PTSD is what I’m struggling with now, but I feel so weak and ashamed for it. I don’t mean for this to seem insensitive to anyone, but for some reason I can’t stop thinking that at least veterans with PTSD (or others who got PTSD from service to others or their country) got it while doing something brave and noble, while I got it from just letting another person have power over me and letting that person make me afraid. 

If I had just been more assertive, maybe he would have stopped. I could have just left — I know now all of his implied threats were empty anyways — he never would have hurt himself, he was just saying that. 

I only let this happen to protect myself. I have no noble reason for it. I was selfish and dumb and naive, and it really is my fault for letting this happen. There are plenty of people, like veterans and firefighters and EMTs and police officers and doctors and nurses who have PTSD as a result of serving their country and their community, not from being too weak to stand up for themselves like I was. 

On the one hand, I really believe this, that it’s my fault, that I should have said something, and that other people who have PTSD are so much more worthy of support and admiration because they’ve been through so much more difficult things for better, more noble reasons than me. But on the other hand, I rationally know that that’s not how this works, or at least I hope it’s not. 

If anyone has any advice or just a response in general, I would really appreciate it.

Edit: Hi everyone! I cannot believe the incredible amount of support I’ve gotten from all of you, thank you so much!"
Don't Freak Out -- People are Going to Ring the Doorbell and Knock Tonight,205,jlnys5,42,"My husband had to remind me not to freak out if people ring the doorbell or knock tonight since it's Halloween. He made sure to make direct eye contact with me, and held my hands, and was like, ""I need you to remember, that if the doorbell rings or people are knocking, they are not people coming to hurt you. They are simply kids looking for candy. Don't freak out.""   


Hate that I had to be reminded, but it helped. I'm really glad he told me, because honestly, I would've forgotten


EDIT: Not a single kid came. It was a quiet night."
"""You're more than your past""",206,hrn4vt,12,"Oh how I hate that phrase. If one more person tells me that I'm ""more than my past"" I'm going to rip my head off. As PTSD is me just fixating on my past rather than a disorder that doesn't allow me to forget. My entire life has been dedicated to trying to forget. From eating disorders to self harm I've literally spent my whole life trying to keep my trauma out of my head. It's not a fixation, it's a disorder. Like depression or anxiety or any other. Anxiety isn't you fixating on panic. Depression isn't you fixating on sadness. I understand it's meant with good intentions but I take it as an insult. If I could take a pill to forget, I'd take it many times over.

Thank you for listening to me bitch."
One of the most gob-smackingly awful things about PTSD...,207,k27vl7,69,"Is when you can only deal with 20 minutes or so of the ""real"" world before realising you would rather be dissociating. x"
Who has difficulty breathing as a symptom of PTSD/Anxiety condition,206,jkcd0n,48,Hey guys who here experience this symptom ?
After a bit of scrolling... I’m crying because reading some of these posts really make me feel validated and like I’m not alone.,207,d2uf9w,24,"This week has been god awful, but finding this sub and being able to relate / not feel so alone is really helpful and I’m really happy that this community exists."
My future PTSD support flower garden (Want a flower?),202,m1zl8e,383,"For every person who comments their favorite flower out of the ones listed, I will plant one in my garden. This way I think it will be nice for them to know they’re cared for!

Flower choices: Zinnia, Merrygold, Poppy, Sunflower

I make a butterfly garden every year and thought this time around I’d support others with PTSD."
Does Anyone Else feel shame for not being able to work because of their trauma?,202,jtrk4t,106,"Hello 

So I have PTSD and it can be so debilitating sometimes that I am in and out of bed all day. I dissociate daily and feel anxious constantly. I'm a full-time college student and it can be so hard to focus on the simplest assignments or even taking notes in class. I'm in therapy and taking SSRIs and Buspar for anxiety.

I come from a very ""just get over it"", ""put yourself up and move on"", ""stop being so sensitive"" sort of family. My mom essentially forced me to not accept all of my aid money for school so she could financially support me with my groceries. Other than the fact that she barely gives me enough to live off of, she also expects me to get a job.

Don't get me wrong. I really really want to work and be independent, but I feel like dealing with the symptoms of my trauma is a job in and of itself. How can I possibly work when I can hardly keep myself from dissociating and I can have a flashback at any moment? I feel so much shame because I feel like I should be able to work just like everyone else and function just like anyone else.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope with this and stop feeling so much shame for how your brain responds to trauma? Thank you for reading <3"
I miss my intelligence,206,9m08om,43,"Since my major trauma 7 years ago (along with other traumas) which have caused me to spend most of my days in a dissociative fog, I feel like the act of thinking is so difficult. I was labeled a 'gifted' child, and I remember my mind being quick. But now, my cognitive processes feel so scrambled up and sluggish. I get so confused sometimes I have trouble filling out simple forms or answering questions on the phone. I'm in my 3rd year at a major university but my brain feels so messed up I don't know if I'll be able to finish. Does anyone else experience this? Have you found anything that helps? "
Just dropping in to remind you that PTSD does not make you weak,205,leaqzv,33,"In case you needed to hear it today, you are not weak because you have PTSD. PTSD is a biochemical response, and studies have shown that that response is (partially) genetically programmed. Your body's reaction to trauma is not a reflection of your mental strength. Be kind to yourself.

Here's an example of a study linking genetics and biochemistry (specifically of vitamin D) to the development of PTSD: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic\_stress\_disorder\_is\_associated\_with/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItsAllInYourGenes/comments/ldnbne/posttraumatic_stress_disorder_is_associated_with/)

Let this also serve as a reminder that there are people working endlessly to understand PTSD, and that research will lead better treatments for PTSD. Keep on kicking, it will get better."
ALL medical professionals should be required extensive training on PTSD,197,emapgp,41,"Just a rant. Its long.

Malware is software written specifically to harm and infect the host system. PTSD is the malware infecting my system and FEAR is the virus that wrecks havoc.

So I have been triggered and my symptoms take over my entire being.
I have 3 options

Flee
Freeze 
Or Fight 

These are the ONLY options fear will give me, suddenly a harmless and simple situation  has turned into a battle for my survival. And yes, to me, its as dire as it sounds. So my logic and reason programming has been overridden -its not gone, its still running, but its only running at minimum so the virus can feed off the program and piggy back on the signal to proceed with the virus’ own programming.

So I am faced with the three options mentioned above. What do they look like?

Flee- Literally leave the situation in any way I can. Seeing as the logic and reason programming is still running albeit at a limitation, I can process enough information from my environment to look for an immediate exit and follow through with fleeing from the situation. Analyzing my environment for an exit is about the only way I can use the logic and reason program that is still running. And this is an immediate reaction, either i phsically leave my environment ASAP or make arrangements and overcoming necessary hurdles to leave. The way I flee is dependant on the trigger that accessed the survival instinct. And the severity of my reaction to flee is also dependant on said specific trigger. No matter what I'm doing or what's going on, when I'm triggered it's time to flee.


Fight- So my fear of my survival has been activated (essentially, my logic and reason program has been infected with the malicious code FEAR) and my logic and reason programming is running at a minimum. I’ve already scanned and processed the option to leave but I have come to the conclusion that fleeing is not an option. Meaning my exits in my environment are blocked or there are people who are blocking my exits. For my reaction to be extreme enough to want to fight, the people blocking my only exits must be some type of authority. For example, police officers, EMTs, or any type of medical professionals. My understanding is  that these people are the only people who can act on their authority at will with or without good intent. In civil society, these people are considered as necessary and these people are supposed to hold good intent. I am recounting VIVIDLY how each and everyone of these so called “authority with good intent” VIOLATED me. Physically and psychologically. Seeing as I don't want to relive said horrible experiences again I consider theses authorities as ENEMIES to my survival whenever I see them when my survival instinct has been severely triggered. I will FIGHT these authorities. I will flail and scream and cry and do whatever makes them feel uncomfortable by being naked or screeching and howling when they touch me.  And it seems like, in my experience, these authorities do not have the faculties or understanding to not not treat me like an animal. I mean in all of my recounted experiences of cops, EMTs and nurses they exacerbated my symptoms by physically hurting me and demeaning me. Remember my logic and reason program is still running in the background so i’m still aware of what’s being said to me, how they are touching me, how they handle me and what emotions they evoke when they demean me. Plus im cogiscent enough to realize, causing injury to said authorities is a metaphorical DEATH SENTENCE. I don't want to go to jail or be arrested, or treated like a dangerous and malicious mentally ill person, so I am cognizant enough not to cause injury to others- I'm just SCARED and I CRY. Do these professionals really think I’m a danger to them when I’m naked and  bawling and screeching about being raped and that I don't want to be touched without care? Don’t I have a right to say “don't touch me” during perineal care yet said medical professionals disregard my repeated requests? Rendering me even more panicked about being in the ER? They think im insane. Well THEY are the ones who are insane with reasoning that extreme measures of restraint, ridicule and deliberate touching of my clitoris is the only way to treat a frightened, crying, naked young woman. Who let these people be medical professionals? And they get to live their lives thinking they did nothing wrong while I SUFFER .I’m reliving these memories to the point of not functioning due to the extreme anxiety that these memories induce. I have PTSD from my experience at the ER. PTSD that is being treated with the help of my primary doctor. Who btw, I can barely see because he triggers such horrible feelings and memories. 

Medical professionals are suppose to be a beacon of hope, but instead they are psychological abusers. When it comes to psychological trauma, it's like all their training goes out the window and I'm just some animal. These medical professionals should not be  allowed to wantonly explain away their cruelty and the robbing of my humanity with a phrase of “that just my job.” yet I have no name of the woman who touched my clitoris deliberately while providing perineal care. I don't even recall if she was an RN or CNA. But the restraints? Those were uncalled for and I’m going to have to live with that trauma for the rest of my life. 

Freeze: knowing I cant fight or flee my body and brain just shuts down. I'm immobile, incapable of normal interaction. I'm still cognizant of what's around me but I'm being forced to watch the memories like some sick psycho is tying my down to a chair and forcing horrible movies about my life. I'm shivering, holding back tears gripping whatever is in my hand with dear life. Just visible distressed and immobile.

Every single one of these reactions are EMBARRASSING and SHAMEFUL in polite society. I'm no longer worthy to exist because people just dont understand what trauma does to a person.

EDIT: I didn't expect my post would get as much traction as it did! Thank you for your stories! I feel kinda weird for being grateful to share this specific type of trauma with others, yet before the PTSD sub-reddit I felt so alone and so ashamed. I wish you all safe travels on the path to healing!

P.S Any medical professionals who just have the need to ""educate"" me or anyone else on proper EMS procedure with the intention to exonerate EMS personel...well I cant stop you...but just know your unsolicited advice will fall on deaf ears.

P.S.S I'm coming off as angry and maybe a little harsh in my writing tone because...I'm angry 🤷‍♀️ I'm not neccesarily proud of sounding so angry but  I think I have the right to do so in order to express the trauma I received. I believe it's part of my personal healing process."
having to grow up too fast due to trauma damaged me,200,k4ztum,32,"i used to love when people told me i acted mature for my age. i was always seen as a kid with lots of potencial and very intelligent. this was all due to having to ""grow up"" too fast because of being traumatized since i was 3 years old and developing anxiety disorders. i was a child worried about life and existence, and very very scared. i had toys but i wasn't the typical child who always wanted to have more and more toys, simply because that didn't matter that much. all i wanted was to feel normal.
since i always felt like i had to act older than i was, now that im 18, i feel like crying because i didn't actually get anything from being very ""mature"" for my age. it's all loneliness and regret for wasting my potential, because even tho i really was creative and smart i never had the energy to actually use that potential because i was just so damaged. i just lost my childhood and now at 18 with all this isolation from covid i am starting to realize that i want to be a happy child for just one day. i want to be taken care of and loved instead of yelled at. i don't want to have panic attacks or phobias, or responsibilities etc. i simply want to be a happy kid with no fears just for one day. i want to know what that is like. i hate being a grown up. i feel like that's all I've ever been and I'm exhausted."
Anyone else FEEL annoyance physically?,199,g2g9kb,49,"It feels a knife is going through every cell in my body. Like an electrical stab. I'm so fucking tense. They're doing construction in the front, side and back of the apartment. The foot steps of people above me trigger me, a dog bark triggers me and now this is going to be going on 7am-7pm, 5 days a week for the next 3 months? Hell no. Sorry for bitching, I'm so pissed and angry."
It’s so hard going back to being a horrifically abused little kid every night that no one wants and then waking up bouncing back as an adult no one wants. I just wish I had a mom and dad that loved me :(,198,da7qe9,35,
DAE find it incredibly frustrating that recovering from trauma is a traumatic experience in itself?,196,e6q5tt,49,
I have strong compulsions to tell people about my trauma and it sucks.,198,ix0bcc,35,"So, I got my diagnose last year and I have been in denial the majority of the time. 
But this summer has been like an apiffany of me realising it's true.

And then that has escalated into that I'm telling everyone I know about my trauma, I'm even telling strangers at a party if I somehow has gotten triggered by a subject. 

And I always regret it but I can't seem to stop thinking it's a good idea at the moment? I don't know what to do or why I am doing this. It feels like I am ruining myself.

Edit; Thank you all for commenting and liking. I tried to Google this symptom but I didn't find anything about it so I felt like I was the only one. 
I'm happy (and unhappy) that several of you seem to relate. I've gotten a lot of good comments which has given me a lot to think about. Love to y'all<3"
I finally understood why I prefer to stay up at night.,198,ibbbz1,19,"Its not just insomnia, it's not sleep apnea, just nightmares or the silence.

I stay up at night because I'm hypervigilant all the time, and being alone awake at night triggers my alertness so much I'm unable to sleep without medication.

Of course, when I eventually end up sleeping its out of exhaustion more than anything, but it's better than the dreadful feeling of going to sleep without knowing who or what could end up waking me.

I was terrorised by a babysitter as a kid, and I lived in rough neighborhoods for four years. Those factors, plus my other child abuse and depression is what I think truly triggers this now."
Does anyone else jump out of their skin from loud sudden noises?,196,c8c7zj,62,"I feel like I'm going fucking insane! My roommate is constantly banging pots and pans around and slamming cabinets in the kitchen. She watches TV insanely loud and when she watches sporting events she screams out randomly and it triggers my PTSD. Also, my upstairs neighbor's stomping around from about 5 p.m. until about 3 in the morning and I feel like I'm going insane from my constant noise.

I realize that people are allowed to live their lives but I'm just sick of being surrounded by the constant noise and it's triggering my anxiety. Sometimes my roommate is so loud that I scream what the fuck was that?! Then she gets mad at me for saying something to her. I'm like well you don't have to slam the fucking cabinets. You could just shut them like a normal person. Then she yelled at me it's not my fault you're sick. And I was like yeah I get that but I still think that you could be a little less noisy. Does anyone else suffer from this? Am I just being petty?"
Does any one else go through cycles of being hyper alert and then so exhausted you can barely move?,199,jrv83w,35,"I’ve had PTSD for 32 years, knife attack when I was 14 and then two abusive relationships as an adult, finally got treatment EMDR in 2019 which has turned the volume way down on my PTSD but it’s still there. My brother in-law lost his year long battle with lung cancer last Saturday, my body seemed to dump a ton of stress hormones into my body as I was a bit hyper trying to look after hubby who was really upset, yesterday Monday, it was as if I’d run out of steam and could barely think or talk and today Tuesday I just feel completely exhausted, hyper sensitive and irritable which is frustrating as I feel I should be looking after hubby instead of him looking after me. Does anyone else have this stress response and any advice on how to deal with it?"
I almost had a panic attack in class BUT I DIDN'T!!!!,197,jo63gg,25,"My math professor is upset because only half the class showed up. She's taking it out on the students who did show up. Yelling/voice raising is really triggering for my PTSD, and it **skyrocketed**. I started disassociating, but I did 4-7-8 breathing. As I breathed in and held my breath I clenched my fists, and as I breathed out I released my fists. Ended up not having a panic attack and not disassociating!!!!

My PTSD symptoms still aren't at baseline, but it's a win in my book!"
"I would rather be me, with PTSD, than anyone else.",196,juq0m8,22,"I was walking around today, in a really good mood, and I had a happy realization that I thought I'd share. I was thinking about all the things in my life that I appreciate, all the things about myself that I love, everything good that has happened in my life... and I realized that I would rather be me, with PTSD, than anyone else. If this is the trade-off I have to have, the thing I have to deal with... that's fine. It's worth it. I wouldn't trade being me for anything else.

I know when I'm going through a darker time, it can be hard to remember that. But I wanted to write it down and share it with all of you, and maybe it will help someone else have that realization, too."
I’m so sick of people telling me...,196,bin2fo,25,"That I should talk to my parents. That it’s “so sad” I cut them out of my life. It’s not sad, it’s the best god damn thing I’ve ever done for my mental health. They continue to deny my trauma, gaslight me and protect my abuser. They punished my daughter and refused to see her because they were mad at me, and that was the wake up I needed to their bull.

My entire childhood was spent being gaslighted about my feelings, being told no, being brow beaten Into who they thought I should be while refusing to do anything to help me. When I told them what he did to me as a child, they didn’t care. They’d rather bury their heads in the sand and expect me to “let it go” because it’s easier for them. Not once did they ever give a single shit what I was going through. They paraded me to the family when I was put in a psych ward to say “see look how loving we are” but not even a week prior my mom told me “you didn’t really try to kill your self or you’d be dead”.

I tried everything I could to fix things with them, gave them every opportunity to be a part of my journey and they didn’t want to. That’s not on me. I will not be sorry for refusing to poison my peace with people who don’t care what I’m going through. 

Sorry to rant but I needed to vent. People just have no clue what it’s like to live in fear of my trauma. To live in endless loops of it, to hear my abusers voice at night when my husband talks or see his face when my husband touches me. I wish I could just “let it go” but I’m not fucking Elsa, I’m working on it but it’s not that easy."
I got through a really hard PTSD anniversary the best way I could yesterday.,195,jl176y,20,"Tw: murder, drinking

Six years ago yesterday, my friend and neighbor was murdered by her ex. I was the last person, other than him, to see her alive. I had walked onto the street to call my (then) best friend at midnight, bc it was her birthday and I wanted to be the first person to wish her well.

I had to share all of that at the trial two years later. It happened in the middle of my stint at university, I lost out on a symposium award bc I was such a wreck over it.

Since it's so close to Halloween, the triggers are impossible to avoid for weeks at a time. Every year I take the day off, start drinking at 9AM, and am drunk by 10. Last year I managed to go to work but got drunk as soon as I got home. It has been my mission to not remember the anniversary, to not think about what I could have done. The last couple years, my best friend has abandoned me for reasons unknown, so I can't even celebrate her birthday to distract myself. That especially hurts.

But two years ago I met my current partner on Oct 27. He is a recovering alcoholic on and off, and we never drink together. He came over on the 28 to celebrate our anniversary, helped me sleep through the worst of the timestamps, then went to the store for me.

He is a chef, and I'm a home cook. We spent a whopping 10 hours in the kitchen, making soup, salad, and breadbowls for 8 people, all from scratch and as homegrown as we could make it. Every time the urge to think or drink came up, I had something to do. I listened to all my favorite podcasts, he deferred to me as head cook so we wouldn't butt heads, and cleaned up behind me. By the time it was over I fell asleep quick.

Now it's the 30th. The anniversary is over. I don't have the hangover I usually drink through to Halloween. More than anything, I am grateful to have such a supportive person in my life, and a little shocked I've let the relationship grow to this point.

There is fucking hope."
Technique for intrusive memories,195,igledb,14,"I come from Scandinavia. We fish a lot, in wooden boats on the fjords. And the sea is so vast, deep, blue and endless. If we catch a fish you cannot eat, we unhook it and toss it back into the sea. Where it swims away, into the deep.

So, when I try to sleep and intrusive memories pop up. I think ""back into the sea"", catch and release. And I imagine just letting it go and how vast ocean is, and how it is room for it there. Then I actively focus on daydreaming about something cozy and pleasant instead. So that cozy fills my mind. And strangely, this works a lot of the time. While many other things have failed completely.

I'm not sure this will help anyone else. But I just thought I'd mention it."
PTSD's A BITCH,195,b85qdv,32,"&#x200B;

To those with PTSD:

I know what you’re going through. Your life was taken away from you by something you couldn’t control. You struggle everyday, and feel detached from the world you once knew. Everything you thought you knew about yourself is gone. All you can dp is rebuild. All you can do is get through it. IT WILL GET BETTER.

I have felt true loneliness during this time. I have felt true helplessness. Don’t ever give up on yourself. You are strong. You are worthy. You are whole.

People joking to have PTSD,193,f0gda4,86,"Does anyone else find it annoying when people use the word PTSD as a joke?
Just a few seconds ago I saw a post in my feed about someone having PTSD from their exams. I am mildly annoyed by this. The person who posted this writes a lot about their struggle with anxiety and depression but then goes ahead and trivializes ptsd."
Someone finally noticed my flinching. Success story!,193,cpok3j,15,"It’s been a long time, but I’ve never been able to school myself into calm when I see something moving out of the corner of my eye. Walking across a baseball field, basketball court, or anything with moving projectiles puts me on edge and every sound is like something being thrown directly at me.

After a year of dating, it finally happened. My boyfriend made a gesture like pointing at me, with something in his hand. I flinched. As usual, jerked my head and closed my eyes. 

He held tightly to me, and told me over and over again (with tears in his eyes) how he’d never throw anything at me. Ever.

It just shows, after the many years of my life, I finally have a shoulder to lean on. And yours may not be far away, so please don’t give up."
Does anyone have no will to socialize?,188,kwjmhe,34,"I lost most of my friends and I just have no will to make friends and socialize. I don’t think I can relate to anyone anymore or will they ever understand me. Everything people talk about seem so pointless and first world problem-y. I just can’t socialize or have the patience to, I just prefer being alone. People annoy me a lot. But I picture my ideal life with few good friends and a meaningful partner. So it’s like a bit of a paradox."
Does anyone else end up exhausted after flashbacks/re-experiencing?,195,hohzi5,50,"I find that after I’ve either had sensory overload or a flashback or an episode of re-experiencing some aspect of a trauma, I am exhausted as if I haven’t slept in days. If I am with someone I feel safe around, or alone in a place I consider safe, I will take a nap. However, if I’m not feeling safe to do that, I really struggle because I’m groggy almost to the point of being impaired, but with no chemical cause like drugs or alcohol. Does anyone else experience this?"
May be controversial but does anyone else get annoyed by the overuse of ptsd?,192,hiaflj,139,"Edit-I didn’t think this post would get so many comments so I’d like to clear a few things up. I’m aware that betrayal trauma is a thing however it’s not PTSD it’s betrayal trauma, they aren’t the same they just share a few characteristics like PTSD does with anxiety/depression etc. 
Also a few people are confused by the spicy food comment so I’ll clear that up for you. I went out for some food with a friend, the food was quite spicy as it was authentic Korean food, I suggested we go back after a while and her reply to me was “thinking of that place give me such bad ptsd, it was too spicy for me” 

I would like to start if by saying I’m aware ptsd comes from many forms of trauma and no two are alike. However I’ve noticed more and more people say they have PTSD over stuff like being cheated on once or food that way too spicy (two examples I have seen) I understand that people often use ptsd as a joke and all but it’s kinda annoying when people are like “oh I have ptsd too, i got cheated on once” I’m not trying to diminish anyone mental health but there’s a difference you know"
[Rant] Stupid question,191,g7qupp,109,"Everytime I tell people I have PTSD, they immediately ask what happened and what traumatised me, and I’m like???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

Seriously are you stupid ffs?

I’m sure I’m not the only that faced this before. I’m so annoyed.

I successfully had a sleepover!,189,cihlxz,15,"Sleeping with another human in the room is a big struggle for me. Even worse if I'm sharing a bed with them. And even worse with a *new* person. 

But I had my first sleepover with my girlfriend! We only held hands, and then I cried and we built a blanket wall so we wouldn't have any accidental skin-to-skin contact. But then I successfully fell asleep and slept through the night! I almost always have to sneak off to the couch, either because I can't get to sleep at all or because I woke up in the night and freaked out. But I'm very pleased today. Just had to share my excitement with people who understand."
"Something I've learned that is important for my self validation: absolutely no one, and I mean no one, gets to have any say on dictating what my reality was in those traumatic situations",188,bjb13b,16,"It seems like everyone has an opinion and they want to tell me how it's my fault and how I did something wrong. Yeah right, they're not there in the situation and they have no idea what's going on. My opinion and understanding of my experiences and my role of them is the only one I care about. I am self-aware and humble enough to admit when I'm wrong so I don't need anyone else's criticism on me. They are making up their own story in their own head that is only a reflection of who they are inside. I don't know about anyone else  but this is what I know about my life and I'm sticking to it. Their bullshit rolls like water off my back. I can't hear those stupid lies anymore. I've just got the beautiful noise of my own self through my ears now."
“My daughter became possessed by the devil when I showed her a picture of Jesus”,187,g0t59p,48,"I sent her a picture/link of Jesus Christ our lord and saviour dying on the cross for our sins. Only god knows the end of times are near, especially with this virus going on, she needs to be saved. She should stop refusing the name of the lord, the truth, the light.

Once I sent her the link, she texted me immediately swearing at me saying F words. 
She must really hate Jesus. 

I hear her go to her mom, I think she is complaining about my message I sent her. Next, her mom comes to my room to talk to me. Then my daughter comes to my room swearing at me . Calling me fucking idiot . Fuck u . Etc. 

Next thing I know she became fully possessed by devil. collapsed to the floor , yelling at the top of her lungs, crying, swearing, kicking walls.

Satan is alive in her. 

Her face looks red , red bruises around her eyes and forehead. 
Further proof, 
Satan possessed her.

^ [my father’s account].

..........................................................................................

My account :

My religious, idiot father sent me a text message of Jesus dying on the cross . A very graphic one with the look of torture on his face and blood dripping all over his head and body. 

I immediately text him..
“What the fuck ! Why are you sending me graphic images for !!! I’m blocking you! I’m not even Christian for fucks sake! “ 

As I’m in the process of blocking him, he sends me that picture AGAIN.

I show my mom, she goes to his room to talk to him.

I walk pass by raising my voice ..” stop sending me that shit! Do you think I want to see blood like that ?! Do you think I want to see blood like ?!!!!! U fucking idiot ! U think I don’t remember ?!! I remember every-fucking-day !!! Fuck u !!! “

( btw , I never swear especially at my parents ^ but I was really upset ^ )

Next thing,  I’m collapsed on the floor having a full blown panic attack . It lasts almost 30 mins. I couldn’t get up, so I crawled to my room to look for a bottle of Ativan. Took 1 to calm down.

After, I looked in the mirror, the blood vessels burst around the skin of my eyes, temples &amp;amp; on my forehead. 

................................................................................................

Note : if my father wasn’t an inconsiderate, self-righteous, bigoted idiot, maybe he’d remember that I lost my cousin (whom I was closest to) along with her unborn son, 4 years ago from an extremely, graphic homicide committed by her husband. 

It’s been 2 years since my last panic attack, each panic attack I’ve had was triggered by the subject or any reminder of my cousin. My father witnessed almost all my panic attacks. 

Fucking asshole . 

He’s probably praying real hard for Satan to come out of me."
I'm sad that I'll never get to meet the person I was before my traumas.,190,f23y2p,35,"I've never known a life without trauma. The first one happened when I was a month old. I don't remember it but the effects still linger to this day. Obviously, that means that I've lived my 99.99% of my life with trauma... I had other traumas happen throughout toddler hood, childhood, and into my teens. I'm sad that I've never known what it is like to be completely carefree and without damage. Despite being on better terms with my past, a small part of me wants to live in a life where my traumas never happened."
Anyone sometimes feel like their trauma wasn't real/is a lie?,189,8xj0lp,38,"I sometimes get the feeling that everything that's causing my symptoms is a lie that I made up, or the events of the trauma didn't happen the way I remembered.

I was re watching Jessica jones today and was utterly amazed at how they showed ptsd and abuse.,190,k6gkmh,34,"I’m going to mention two scenes so TW 

So during the show you actively see her have auditory and physical hallucinations, you see a colour shift and then something will happen.
An example is when Jessica is sitting on some stairs and the colour shifts to purple and then you hear this voice telling Jessica something and she gets a massive fright. 

Another example is when you see the abuse happen, the dude tells her to cut her ears off cause she wouldn’t listen and then when she actually goes to cut her ear off he tells her not to and that he loves her.

I was watching those scenes in shock because for the first time I went “hey that’s like what I go through” “hey that’s what I went though” 
I’m actually planning on using the first scene to show people what my hallucinations are like."
Has anyone else developed severe social anxiety overtime after their trauma?,188,jewmz8,29,"After the suicide of my last partner I developed severe crippling social anxiety over the past 5 years. I used to be an extremely out going and confident person who could hold conversations with ease. Now I find that I literally can’t even get my mouth to open when I want it to. It feels like someone sewed my mouth shut. And I am now extremely timid and shy. The idea of any social interaction even with a delivery or cashier person paralyzes my entire body with anxiety. I spend the majority of my days trying to understand and fix this just trying to get back to who I used to be but I feel lost. 

Anyone else experience this?"
Are you ever just suddenly filled with nothing but rage for your abuser and only your abuser,187,ge3p67,32,And it only lasts a few minutes. like it’s this horrible blind rage u have to fight everything in your power to not accidentally hurt yourself or some shit like that?

I remember random things sometimes and keep thinking about them but can't really let it out because it's just not something you say in a casual conversation. So it just stays repeating in my mind.

My traumas keep piling up. Even though they’re years ago, the trauma starts when I realize it, so one is less than a year ago, one is just a few months old, even though they both happened within a month back in 2015-16. Then there’s the whopper that initially gave me ptsd. I’d like that one’s head on a spike, tbh.

People probably think I’m crazy. Don’t really care though, I know this is a coping mechanism so I feel less alone until I develop my chosen family.

I wish someone would've told me how healing running my own businesses could be... Instead everyone discouraged me because of my PTSD! + more thoughts on jobs and managing PTSD,185,hwsika,27,"**EDIT:** Ahhh omg! My first Reddit award 🥺!! After I posted this I had the usual PTSD self-doubt, worrying that y'all wouldn't understand, but of course YOU UNDERSTAND IT MORE THAN ANYONE!! I will be posting more here and hope to keep swapping stories and inspiration with everyone in this sub :)

&#x200B;

I have PTSD from an abusive relationship I had when I was 14-18 years old. I also have anxiety, OCD/dermatillomania, depression, and chronic pain.

I come from a family of entrepreneurs and was raised to be one. I have dabbled in a few different industries, spent a lot of time helping create and run newer nonprofits and community orgs. Now I'm working for a small tech company as a partner and I manage all my own clients, customer service, website, etc.

A couple years ago, I decided I really wanted to start my own business from the ground up, by myself. There was a few different reasons, mainly being that I wanted more freedom and ability to creative (my current work is monotonous as hell). Once I started digging further, I realized that I also wanted the freedom to live by my own schedule, and once I figured out why, it all came back to my PTSD.

As I'm sure you all know, there are days, weeks, months that are difficult to work through. Especially when you're in a company with strict attendance requirements or customer/client service. Even though I run my own stuff at my current day job, there is no flexibility when it comes to taking long breaks or avoiding customers. This can be really tricky to manage with PTSD :(

I faced a lot of discouragement when I started exploring options for businesses that I could run myself **that would also allow time for rest and recovery.** Everyone kept saying to me that ""making it"" would be impossible, too stressful, too much time, too much energy. But stubborn and determined like I always am, I kept researching a business model that I could gel with.

I paid for a lot of online courses and listened to a lot of ""experts"" who really believe they have the answer. I will admit that the haters were a little bit correct in that pursuing entrepreneurship is an energy drainer. BUT!! Through all the classes and mentorships, I learned one big fat lesson about running your own business - you have to deeply know yourself to be a successful entrepreneur. (I know everyone here struggles with knowing who your ""true"" self is... I know I do... so this lesson hit me HARD).

Why do you have to know yourself? Well, a million reasons. But the top ones - 1. You have to pick what your business is about, and in order to do that, you have to know what you like and don't like (not so easy for us w/ PTSD!!) and 2. You have to understand how you get shit done the best! Instead of following someone else's schedule and guidelines, you really have to craft your own, and in order to do that you have to kind of ""study"" yourself.

I did a lot of work and exercises related to this all in hopes of becoming a successful entrepreneur. And I realized that **a lot of that work was helping with my PTSD recovery, too.**

Anytime I disregarded my own ideas and tried someone else's because they were more successful etc., I would fail. Then I would stay true to who I am, the way I work, what I care about... and that's what worked.

Am I saying that entrepreneurship cures PTSD? Lol. Hell no. Is it a replacement for therapy and other forms of recovery? No.

BUT! As someone who has had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur my whole life - I really really really wish someone would've told me **all the healing and positive parts of having PTSD and running my own biz.** Instead of just throwing discouragement at me.

I could talk about this forever... I know this is a long post, but I wanted to share in case anyone else on here has **ever felt discouraged from pursuing self-driven or creative work.** You don't have to sit in an office all day and play by the rules. You also don't have to work a million hours and stress yourself into panic attacks. You can pursue what you want with self-care and your PTSD does NOT make it impossible. In fact, sometimes I think the resilience and stamina I have because of my PTSD *actually helps me*.

I'd be curious to hear anyone else's thoughts on careers and running a business and how their PTSD helps or hurts. Thanks for listening, I love lurking this sub and this is my first post :)"
Anyone else experiencing forgetting words or an entire train of thought?,182,gryueg,119,"As I’ve only been diagnosed last March, I don’t know if this is because of my ptsd or if it’s some other thing.

While in the middle of a sentence, I’d sometimes forget the next word or sentence. Sometimes I’d lose my entire train of thought.

For example: “So yesterday I baked, uh...” *forgets the word “cake” and spends an entire minute trying to finish my sentence*

Or 

“I was working out last night but then...... *long pause* sorry what was I saying?”


Haha I hope it’s not silly. But if someone can enlighten me on this one, that would be a great help."
Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?,185,bvx3ut,35,"Anyone else tone down your femininity/sexuality to prevent sexual abuse?

I stopped dressing feminine, wore baggy clothes, channeled my masculine energy to scare/intimidate men so I don’t get sexual attention. Yeah, I did this. And also when I was covertly sexually abused by my dad, instead of protecting me, my mom got jealous and stopped taking me to get my hair done and wouldn’t let me get my nails done even though she had originally promised. I looked unkempt growing up.

And now at 27 that I know what happened to me and have come to reality with the abuse I went through... I have no sex drive and have no interest in flirting and emitting sexual energy towards other men. Also, when I have flirted in the past, I realize I behaved like a little girl. So now I’m grossed out that men were attracted to me when I acted like a little girl, does that mean they have pedophile tendencies?

Also, I’m really intimidated by dominating and masculine men but also attracted. Like I only can be around men who exhibit feminine/passive energy right now and I get scared around dominating men who can make me submissive and thus controlled. Controlling my environment helps me feel in control and feel calmer due to my abuse history. Weird part is my abuser (dad) was actually passive and had submissive energy but was still abusive, creepy and manipulated by playing the victim. You would think I would be more scared around those types of men But I still find myself feeling safer around these kind of men over dominant because I can intimidate and scare them away by channeling masculine energy.

I am grossed out by men and don’t trust them—too many creeps out there who seem nice but then betray you. If I had a daughter I’d be so protective. It’s a scary world out there.

Anyone relate?"
Anyone else want their abuser to die already?,182,jegxfs,80,"I'm eagerly awaiting his death announcement, my parents lied to me before saying he died but he's actually still alive.  He's in old age and been there for a while"
Trauma Is Like A Mold,185,hcmgw1,25,"This analogy was told me to me when I was in an inpatient treatment facility for ptsd and it really helped me understand trauma, shame, ptsd etc. 

Trauma -and the shame it comes with- is like a mold. It grows and thrives in the dark, in closed off, damp places. Imagine mold growing in a closet in your home. You can close the door, and you won’t have to look at it or even really deal with it at all. 

The thing is, when you come back to check on it a year later, two years later, 20 years later, it won’t be the same as when you left it. It will have grown. A lot. 

Trauma is the same way. A lot of people understandably want to put off facing their trauma through therapy/treatment etc until they’re in a better place in their lives. It’s inconvenient and most people want to wait until they’re done with school or more comfortable at their new job etc etc. So a lot of people close the closet door and tell themselves it’s fine and they can look at it later when they’re more ready. 

When you come back to look at trauma later, it won’t be the same as you left it. It will have grown, a lot.

Shame and suffering grows when we hide it. It thrives off secrecy and alone-ness. The burden of hiding our pain from ourselves and others multiplies it. The burden of protecting others from our reality multiplies our shame. You will see people on this sub and in other areas of treatment who are just beginning their journey and they will say “I wish I dealt with this 20 years ago”. 

The way to begin addressing trauma is the same way we can begin addressing mold. We need to air it out. Open the closet and leave the door open. Let sunlight shine onto your trauma and let it be seen. We don’t have to keep it a secret anymore to protect ourselves or other people. I’ve found that speaking the truth about what happened to us is the most terrifying thing in the world until it actually comes out of our mouths. The more we talk about it, the more we let the day light fall on it, the less power it will have over us."
I Miss Me,187,9vytf4,35,I miss me. I miss the person I was before PTSD. I miss my sense of humor. I miss not having five cups of coffee in the morning just so I can  function and hopefully get through the day. I miss getting comfortable and falling asleep. Now I can't go to bed unless I'm so exhausted I can't keep my eyes open. I miss doing my nails just to look pretty. Now those long nails are in case I have to defend myself. I miss being able to go shopping without having to look over my shoulder. I miss the ability to turn my back on a crowd. I miss the ability to sit down in a restaurant without keeping my back to the wall. If someone sneaks up on me I'm likely to tear them a new one. I miss the woman who didn't wear baggy clothing. I miss not being hypervigilant. I miss life without a service dog. There's no real point to this post except to vent. Thank you to everyone for reading it.

The way men look at women,180,fggcfi,130,"I want to start by saying I am not gloating here. I am an average looking woman. I’m also not here to play the victim. Nor am I saying all men do this. 

I hate how some men look at women sometimes. For example, when I’m walking around the store, I’ll see a man (sometimes even with his significant other) check out me or other women. And it disturbs me. It’s so obvious their thoughts are sexual. Every time a man looks at me with those sexual eyes, I get triggered. I end up having an episode soon after. I hate it. Why can’t men control the way they look at women? DAE have this problem?"

Never Ask A Survivor Why They Didn't Leave Sooner,178,fllsje,12,"If you’re a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for “asking for it.” I recall reading a book called “Can’t Buy My Love” that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria’s Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too “uneducated” to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I’m sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn’t how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a “love bombing” or “golden period” that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I’ve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors. The handle alone makes me feel validated since I was never hit. Never let anyone judge you for not leaving right away. Leaving is a process and often involves extensive planning to be able to do it safely. No one understands your reality unless they’ve been through it themselves.


Edit: the “account” I refer to is on Instagram. Sorry for the confusion!"
Does anyone else feel like experiences they have while triggered also become traumatic?,174,h87rx0,21,"I won’t get into detail but what I mean is say someone does something that triggers your PTSD, and then you continue interacting with them. Then later down the line, you’re triggered by remembering your interactions with them vs the actual originating event (ex. Childhood trauma)

Does anyone else have this happen to them? I feel like I can’t have normal social life or just a normal life in general because if I’m triggered by something the people and place I’m in while I’m triggered suddenly become a trigger themselves. This has happened with friends, jobs, places ect"
I prefer dissociation over fight or flight,177,j8upvx,30,"Just wrote a post venting about my PTSD and how my mother denies it/how it came to be, and suddenly I find myself completely dissociated. I have to say, out of the range of reactions my triggers can give me, dissociation almost seems like a kindness. I much prefer the unsettling calm over the heightened awareness or uncontrollable emotions. The worst thing about this for me is that my memory seems to be limited to 5 seconds. I've already re-read this post 3 times by this sentence because I forgot why I was writing it.

Think I'm going to go take the trash out while the outside isn't so scary."
I realised today that I like myself!,178,gq0m6g,9,"For the first time, in.. well, ever.

I'm not sure exactly what changed or when. But today, after I did something dumb (I don't remember what, something insignificant like walking into the door frame), the inner monologue said something like 'it's okay, I like myself'. 

It stopped me in my tracks - I don't remember ever thinking that before. I took a moment to look in the mirror and see myself from a positive, more objective perspective; not just in my appearance, but in the person I am.

And I am here to tell you, kids, that I saw it all, and I liked it. I didn't see some dumb, fat, dropout loser like my brain tries to portray me as. 

Instead I saw beauty. I saw a compassionate, weird, creative, fierce woman, who suffered trauma upon trauma but somehow overcame. Who even in the lowest points of her own life has never turned away a person in need. Who continues to grow and evolve into better versions of herself every day.

I'm telling you this partly because I'm proud of myself and wanna show off a little, but mostly because I want anyone and everyone out there who's struggling with themselves, to know that it's possible. It's not just something people say to make you feel better; it's real and it's attainable.

I'm 24. Two years ago my girlfriend (soon to be finance) and I wrecked and she passed. I suffered severe injuries and still haven't recovered and the PTSD from this night stops me from doing anything.,175,loa0w3,105,"I don't know what I can do. I feel guilty and I feel remorse and I just feel awful everyday. Ever since this accident happened my life has gone downhill. I dropped out of college in my last semester, moved in with my parents, and haven't done anything since. I just can't even leave bed and all of my friendships and relationships fail so I'm constantly alone. I don't even care about waking up anymore and every night I relive that accident. I have severe PTSD and my therapist just tells me to stop it. I don't know how I can stop it. I got pain killers when I got out of the accident and I've been addicted to them ever since. I can't stop taking them and I don't even want to but they're my only way to cope. I just feel hopeless and have no idea what to do. That one night ruined my entire life and I feel like she's the lucky one. 

She was just completely smashed when the car flipped and my bottom half of my body was as well. The images from this night are in my head at all times and I revisit this accident probably a dozen times a day. If something reminds me of this night then I just shutdown and try to get to the ground so I can curl up, plug my ears, and let it pass. It's happened in restaurants and I can't cope with it. I just can't deal with these images and events being replayed in my head. It is a true nightmare. One time the song that was playing when we wrecked came on randomly and I fell to the ground and essentially blacked out like I was having a seizure. I don't know how I can stop this from happening at this point. It's been two years and it seems like they're getting worse. 

We weren't even that drunk and because of a stupid fucking mistake she's gone and my life is miserable. We made this mistake and paid a cost beyond belief and I don't know how what we did was justifiable of these reprocussions. We had wine is all, with dinner. I wasn't even classified over the DUI requirement that night."
"I'm about done with EMDR, and I've come to a realization with my PTSD.",173,lgydd7,25,"I've had a hard life. Especially in my childhood. 

I know everyone has a different story. My story is a childhood of being told I was not good enough. Being told I was stupid. Then I was assaulted when I was still naive and did not understand the world yet.

EMDR showed me that my trauma was complex. In fact, so complex, it's almost incurable. I've made some progress- but when your childhood is a decade of being told you aren't good enough, being mentally abused, then physically by others- it's just, hard.

I'm never going to completely give up, but as a 30 year old man now, I know that I just have to make good with what I've  been given. I'll always have to carry a childhood of trauma around with me wherever I go. 

But EMDR has showed me that I can somewhat deal with the pain in a different manner, healthy, and more constructive. I try so hard to tell myself and the hurt parts of myself I am worth more than what I was given ages ago.

It's a bittersweet truth, but I've made some progress. I used to actively hurt myself because I was so used to others hurting me and telling me I was not good enough. I don't do that anymore."
"Does anyone else feel like they overcame their PTSD, and then just have a meltdown/episode/panic attack out of nowhere?",176,izkzo4,29,"I noticed that since the beginning of the year, I would have these on and off meltdowns/episodes/panic attacks. I would cry all night after, shaking and trembling, while my husband would hold me and try to console me. The next day I would usually feel fine and even enlightened, and I would write down some new insights about myself or the world. I would feel like I've finally overcome my PTSD and that I won't breakdown again. Then a few weeks later I would have one negative thought, then talk it out with my husband, and next thing I know, I'm having panic attacks again. 

I have panic attacks at least once a month I'd say, coupled with a sleepless night full of crying, shaking and self-loathing, and sometimes suicidal thoughts. Most of the time though I think I feel fine and even positive about healing...then it turns out I'm not."

A TMI success but one I haven't had in a while,175,bl6ope,30,"I have PTSD due to being violently drugged, kidnapped and raped in college. My boyfriend and I have had lows in our relationship sexually because of this. Most times I have flashbacks because he does something small that triggers me and idk how to explain it to him so I act like nothings wrong but he knows. Today before we had sex we talked about it. We discussed for 30 minutes everything we wanted to do and I told him everything I could think of that made me uncomfortable and I had the best sex of my life. It's a small success to some but being able to be intimate with my partner without fear of my ptsd and how it may seem to him is a huge step for me and I am happy to be able to have sex for the first time without any kind of trigger or fear. Normally I dont tell him during sex if I'm triggered but he can tell and he stops anyways. Today we had sex after 3 years of dating that was just us. No ptsd. Just us and I feel like I made so much progress. It just feels so good to know my rapist has no control over that part of my life anymore and that my intimacy with my partner sexually can develope more now."
"Has PTSD made me ""stupid""?",174,fko9ky,82,"Hi guys,

I used to be someone who was in tune and quite sharp and had amazing memory and was a good thinker. 

I have noticed since I witnessed many traumatic events that I am not myself and seem to act ""stupid"" and ditzy.  I do Biosciences in a Level 5 HND and I can do it but I just can't seem to grasp the information like I used to and people think I am stupid (and have told me to my face).  Can this happen from traumatic events?  If so, any tips or advice? 

Many thanks

Is it normal to heavily doubt your trauma?,172,khy1hm,34,"I was recently diagnosed with PTSD but I guess I’ve just been told none of it happened so often that I have trouble even accepting them as real events. I hardly remember anything until I have a panic attack so it’s hard to prove myself to anyone anyhow. It’s strange, and I don’t know how to describe it. I feel like I know it happened, I have a diagnosis and a shit ton of trauma after all, but the other half of me refuses to accept it. Is this ‘normal’?"

A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!,171,jyosvj,73,"A spiritual leader just shamed me after I set a boundary saying I did not feel comfortable discussing my childhood sexual abuse! Wtf!

So I did a virtual appointment with two spiritual people who guide plant medicine spiritual sessions for healing. My main purpose was to ask them more about how they could help me and the different types of Spiritual ceremonies they hold. I spent over one hundred dollars to get more information about them and they barely answered my questions.

First, they ask me about why I am looking to work with the medicine. I tell them childhood sexual, racial and mental trauma. Then I tell them how I am looking for safe spaces because unfortunately I've been getting preyed on by predators in these spaces. He asks for more details about the predator experience and asks if the predator flirted with me. I briefly summarize what happened then change the subject by discussing some of the positives of the past spiritual events I went to. Then he keeps asking me for more details about the trauma and my intentions, but I continue to give vague answers because This spiritual healing work is pretty personal, independent and you actually don't need to tell your guides the specifics of your trauma. He kept pushing and I tell them I don't feel comfortable sharing my childhood sexual abuse especially because I just met them and this work is personal and knowing the details of my trauma is not necessary. I ask them what is their purpose of wanting to know? They say ""it will help him figure out what intentions I should set and what ceremonies are best for me."" He continues pushing and asks if I have a therapist? I tell him that I've been in therapy for years and also have a degree in psychology/counseling.

Then he says we are just souls that pick up stories (trauma).. So then why was he so persistent of hearing about my trauma when he is saying it doesn't matter so much?! 

 They wasted my time, it was obvious they hadn't read the form I was told to complete beforehand for them because he said ""next time you will have to fill out the form and we will discuss what ceremonies are best for you."" I told them ""I already filled out the form and did they read it?"" Then the female leader was like oh yes. Obviously they didn't otherwise they wouldn't have been asking questions that  were already answered on there. Then he kept filling up the time with random psychological information (and he is not a trauma trained individual) about our brain being stuck in child trauma.. it's like they were just trying to fill up time because they were unprepared. Then he tries to tell me I am not allergic to mushrooms and it is just anxiety. He was acting like he was all knowing and knew what was best for me and he had just met me! 

He told me to stop being logical and get in touch with my intuition. When I told them I would want to do the healing work in women spaces due to my trauma, he said he couldn't change himself into a woman.. so basically Id be stuck with him as a guide.

Then he tells me I need to work on surrendering because I am hyperprotective. I told him I did struggle with surrendering and he asked why. I said it was hard to give up control because of past trauma. He said control is all a perception and I needed to surrender.

He tells me predators I've been harassed by recently have been attracted to my energy due to my struggle of surrendering. He says ""everyone has childhood trauma and you shouldn't come to just take.. When you come to group meetings, you need to open up and give and take.. you should come with a nonjudgmental ear."" He tells me he doesn't think I am ready for a spiritual ceremony soon and that I need to do gentle things like yoga and find small ways to surrender. He says next time I come I have to be willing to share everything about me. WTH!!! So I am being ""judgemental and just taking"" because I set boundaries and don't want to unnecessarily share my childhood trauma to strangers?! Notice how they are using ""surrender"" to push boundaries?!

How disappointing that he tried to shift the blame on me when they were the ones who were unprepared and prying personal information by pushing boundaries! I feel mad and triggered. He shamed me for setting and sticking with my boundary. I also feel proud because I've come so far that I set and stick to my boundaries. The fact that someone is telling me I need to open up tells me I've progressed because I used to be called an open book! Not everyone gets the privilege of knowing my trauma...that may come once trust is established.

ugh!! Validation and support would be nice, thank you."
When you realize just how different “normal” life is,172,eiib14,32,"Overheard coworkers talking yesterday about anxiety/depression screenings. How prevalent they were with routine health checkups and the number of questions asked.

Well, my therapist absolutely laid into my mom, I’ve never heard someone say those things about her before but they are so damn true. She also said that out of all of her patients who have troubles with their mother MINE IS THE WORST!!

She said I grew up with a narcissistic mother and was a victim of serious neglect. Not really knowing the depth of either of those I did some digging and yeah, emotional and physical neglect and for sure narcissistic mother. My therapist also told me that my mother has never offered me a true apology for what happened and owned her misdeeds.

I called her this morning and laid everything my therapist said out, gave her all of the clinical examples of physical and emotional neglect and told her the markers of a narcissistic parent. She said I don’t know how many times I can say sorry. I asked her if she could own up to any of the abuse she inflicted on me and she absolutely denied everything and I told her until she owns up to it we are done talking and hung up.

That means no contact with her only grandchild. It feels good to finally say, no you own your mistakes, I have a fucking right to be angry and sorry isn’t enough anymore."

But the thing is I believe everyone is a threat, so my eyes follow and watch everybody through my peripheral vision beyond my control. As if my subconscious is taking over and shutting down what I can control in the present time. The thing is having this issue is nearly destroying my life. I will literally stare everybody down until they are out of my eyesight lol, I have caused hostility, frustration, and creeped out people, but its like my animal brain doesnt care or listen to me or their responses. Its incredibly difficult if not impossible to be in a classroom (it making me really want to drop out) because I am more focused on the people around me than the teacher/board.

"After a long time of feeling frustrated by lack of progress in therapy, I finally told my therapist something that turned it all around",169,b8c17j,16,"Disclaimer: I began therapy less than a year ago and have only ever been to one therapist, so my experience is very limited. I have no idea if this will help others or apply to anyone else's situation, but since reading it would have helped me, I thought I'd give it a shot.

For the longest time I felt like my therapist basically chatted with me, gave me compliments (telling me how strong I was, etc) and just told me what I wanted to hear. This made me angry and so many times I would leave our sessions thinking ""I don't need compliments, I need *help!*"" I could tell I wasn't getting anywhere, but everyone I talked to who had been to therapy kept telling me that it takes time and I just needed to be patient.

I got so frustrated that I was one session away from switching to someone else. I worked up my courage a little bit, went into the session, and said ""I'm frustrated with my lack of progress. I feel like you are treating me carefully, like I am fragile and ready to break at a moment's notice. Telling me I'm strong makes me feel good temporarily, but then I leave and I'm still in this deep black hole. I need you to push me out of my comfort zone. I need to know, is there a way I can make faster progress?""

Stupidly, I was afraid this would somehow offend her. Instead, without batting an eye, she simply said ""Yes. We can delve deeper into your trauma and start getting into the heavy stuff. That is the fastest way for you to make progress. I wasn't sure if you were ready."" For the rest of that session and for subsequent sessions, she completely changed her whole demeanor/approach. And let me tell you, it was (and continues to be) so, so shitty. It's been hard. But I'm in a better place, I can feel the sadness slowly lifting, and I actually feel like I'm making progress now. 


I'm so glad I didn't switch therapists before saying that. It almost didn't even occur to me as a thing I should say. To everyone out there, whether you're in the same boat or not, I wish you good luck <3

Who else here has problems with concentration and memory,166,kagx4i,42,"Where to start?

I want to start my story with the problem. 5 years ago I had a child. She had stomach problems so she kept me up for hours at night. That's hard obviously. I was exhausted. I've always had problems with concentration and memory. But after I had my first baby... I felt I was losing my mind. I could not do the simplest task like grocery shopping, let alone my job. most importantly I failed my child as a mother. I also had a lot and physical pain, after being misdiagnosed with fibromyalgia I did fasiatherapie. Which did wonders! Really. I am almost pain free. But I still felt like I was losing my mind.

I went to a special unit consisting of doctors but also a psychologist. They found  nothing physical wrong with me, the psychologist diagnosed me with PTSD.

I wanted to get better so badly, for my child. I 'confused' to my biggest secret, even though I did not really want to talk about it. I was molested for years by my grandfather. I don't remember when it started,  my first memories I think I was 5 but i think it was going on longer then that. It stopped when I was 11 and he died when I was 12.

I remember flashes, my memory of my trauma is fragmented. The psychologist said all of my concentration and memory problems are a result of repressing memories for almost 2 decades. She said, the only way to get better is to talk about it with the help of EMDR. 

I really tried but my mind resists to the point of fainting. I was pregnant at the time and the psychologist opted not to push me. But the therapy seemed pointless to both of us after a few sessions.

I don't know what to do now. I work part-time out of necessity. If I get to tired, I can't remember anything and I can't concentrate on anything.

I just had covid and am extremely tired, even working part time. My colleagues don't know about my mental health, I don't feel safe talking to them. They just keep saying to 'think positive'. When I mention PTSD they laugh and say that's what soldiers have, so I just drop it. My husband does support me. He's an angel. He is so patience, i'm so grateful.

I feel stuck. I don't want to remember. I really, really don't want to remember more then I already do.

Is there really no other way, no other therapy to get better? To improve my concentration?"

Comparing yourself to who you were before your trauma / Mourning who you could have been without trauma,168,mjjau5,25,"TW: childhood sexual abuse

I know it's unhealthy to keep wishing that some things didn't happen or complain about life being unfair, but goddamn is it unfair sometimes. it's pretty useless to mourn the person you could've become without the trauma because that person simply doesn't exist. I just still feel envious sometimes of everyone who hasn't experienced sexual abuse. 

Before I was abused as a child, I was a lot more talkative and extroverted. The year after the abuse happened teachers started expressing their concerns to my parents, that I am unassertive in class, too shy, etc. What would my life be like if some horrible things never happened? I know I need to stop thinking about it. Today is just one of those days I feel angry again that I am one of the many unlucky ones who were born into a dysfunctional family. I have done some EMDR therapy and made tons of progress already, have a loving boyfriend now, but I still get setbacks. I know it's all part of the recovery process, but today I just wanted to express my grief. I feel unable to talk about this to people in my life, because they wouldn't understand. 

I wish I didn't have to get triggered during sex. It's so maddening. I feel angry that I should even have to remember horrible events of the past. If I never got abused these flashbacks wouldn't have to happen... Sometimes you think you're making progress and doing well and then those traumatic memories just punch you right back in the face :D. Oh well, I shouldn't beat myself up about it. I can't do anything else but surrender and accept my past, unfortunately."

Then calling a friend, getting her to stop by yours before she gets there to take your gift and lie for you by saying I had to work (night shift, I'm a nurse).

Then, spending the evening beating yourself up for missing yet another event, ruminating on what they're doing, what they're talking about and the memories they're making without you. Knowing it's just a matter of time till everyone finally stops inviting you to things.

Then of course walking home leaves you even more freaked because your PTSD makes you jump at every loud noise out there and its fireworks season.

My boyfriend purposefully triggers me to get his own way,162,lacl3n,98,"
My boyfriend always brings up the time I was raped. He uses it as an insult almost trying to play it off like I cheated on him or something.

It’s getting me down so much. I don’t understand what he wants me to say. I dident ask for it.

He keeps trying to stop me from doing normal things. I want to go out with my friends still. I still want to wear dresses. I still want to drink. Every time I mention I’m going to go out with my friends he will try to scare me out of it telling me I’m going to be raped again and how he won’t care this time because of whatever dress im wearing etc

I don’t want to be raped again. I also don’t want to be miserable for the rest of my life. It just feels like I’m trying to move past my rape. But he keeps dragging me back to it, blaming me for it, purposefully triggering me and making me panic so he gets his own way.

When he dosent want me to go somewhere he’ll put his hands on my neck in a choking type of way and say things like “you want this to happen again ? It will happen if you leave the house”

He dosent choke me but he puts his hands there cause he knows it triggering enough to make me panic so I’ll stay at the house like he wants me too.

It feels disgusting to know I told my boyfriend details of my rape because I thought he’d be the one to help me overcome my fear. Instead he knows that hands on my neck will scare me so he does it on purpose to get what he wants.

I’m so done but I can’t leave I just can’t it’s too hard but sometimes I just wish he wouldn’t be such an asshole."

I’m scared. And I have no one. Can someone please talk to me?
"DAE HATE when people say “it will get better” or “I went through x and got through it with praying, you should too”? Or am I just sensitive and caving to the aggression of my PTSD symptoms?",161,czgwxk,68,"It really plants a deep seed of anger and irritation in my heart when I hear those words. I also hate being told that I have to be strong, even though I know it’s relatively decent “advice”. No shit, I have to be strong. Otherwise I wouldn’t even be here right now. 

Someone said to me that they went through a comparable minor incident (breakup of a <2 year relationship), and got through it by praying to God, saying it liberated him and made him feel so content with life. And while yes, he is valid to feel upset about it, I don’t think it’s appropriate to bring that up to compare to my bus crash and my mental recovery with it. They and their family also went on to tell me that my medication was all gateway bullshit that I need to get off of and being the passive dipshit I am, I agreed with them and went along with all of it. 

Not to mention, when I told them I have PTSD, they went on to ask about my symptoms and even asked “oh, what are your visions?” “what are your nightmares?” “what do you see at night?” and a TON of follow-up questions that forced me to go into detail that I didn’t want to. Again, I’m passive as hell so it’s not easy to say no to anyone, but I just wish people were more considerate and understanding. It’s not like I’m asking them to never talk about vehicle accidents, or to never make any quick movements, so why is it so hard to be decent and accommodate my basic needs? I’m sure people who don’t have PTSD at least know not to fucking ask about their flashbacks in detail."
It’s been over year since my parent’s murder suicide.,163,byw205,25,"To give some context, the event happened on May 20, 2018. We had just moved into a nice apartment after living in Extended Stays for the past couple of years. I got my own bedroom and the complex had a small pool I could swim at during the summer, which was really exciting for me since I was so used to sleeping on air mattresses.

It was around 10:00am. My mom went to pick up a dog that my dad was supposedly going to give me as a gift. Me and my stepdad expected the trade would take only a few minutes, as they were meeting at a gas station across the street from the complex building. An hour later, she didn’t show up. My stepdad tried to call her over and over again, but she wouldn’t pick up. I didn’t worry that much as I thought that the trade was taking longer than expected.

A little later, we hear a knock on our door. It was the police who told us that my dad shot my mom, than shot himself. Everyone was in absolute shock when they heard the news. They were crying and screaming with grief while I just stood there trying to comfort anyone I could. It didn’t set in with me that this was actually happening.

A lot happened during that year. I’m leaving out a lot of details, but I ended up being put in a mental ward for a week after threatening to commit suicide. After the event, I bottled up so much emotions that it got to the point where I just snapped. In that instance, I wanted to kill myself. I wanted to kill other people. I wanted everything to just stop existing for as long as I wanted it to.

Needless to say, I didn’t feel so good for the next few months. I still struggle with the grief but I try to manage it as best I can. It’s the middle of the night as I’m writing this. It keeps on playing in the back of my mind so I can’t fall asleep. I felt like I needed to get this out there so I would stop destroying myself over something that wasn’t my fault.

I was 14 when it happened. I’m 15 now. I can’t see myself the way my peers do anymore. I feel like my childhood was taken away from me.

TL:DR The murder suicide fucked me up big time, and I’m trying to get over it the best I can. Sorry for the long post. I just felt like I needed to get this out there."
I love when I tell someone I have PTSD and they go on to try and scare me as a joke,160,lmyuhf,33,I know they probably forgot I told them but they continue to jump up and scare me as their way of the trying to have fun with me. Like is there not a more fun way to get my attention or is triggering me just so funny?
DAE hear music constantly looping in their head?,166,jan5kq,66,It's like my brain is trying to continually distract itself in attempts to calm down . It gets annoying at times. Usually just a specific part of a song I recently heard looping over and over or a random melody in my head. I used to get it intermittently before the trauma when I was anxious from smoking too much weed or something but since the event it's been a.constant. particularly bad when I'm lying in bed or have just woken up.
Everyone assumes military,162,ehvw1h,52,"I told a coworker a few weeks ago that I had a doctor's appointment and he asked why. I couldn't think of a lie in time so I just told him ""Because I have PTSD"" (which was the truth). His response was, ""You were in the service?"" I said, ""No, my dad was a piece of shit"" to which he just said ""Oh, yeah, me too"" and we stopped talking about it pretty shortly after that. 

I'm not really angry about it or anything - just bored enough to complain about it - but I hate how everyone assumes that if you have PTSD you must have served in the military. Just weird to me that nobody thinks of all the other possibilities."

I feel like I’m friendly and loving, but sometimes I just shut off and I can’t interact with the people I love. Other times all these people say I’m their friend, yet I don’t feel friendship? 

A lot of my trauma happened at the hands of those who were supposed to protect me, my parental units. I don’t know how to have a mother and I can go on. Right now I’m in EMDR and it’s helping me. I’m currently in between jobs and went from a very stressful job to doing nothing and have been digging through some shitty memories with my therapist, so there’s a lot happening.

I just took my first shower in like ... months,163,avzgq7,18,"I get how gross that is ....


I use to be on point with my personal hygiene - haircuts every 2 weeks like clockwork, daily showers (sometimes more than one if I worked out), you know the basic self care things .....

Well I've spiraled into a really deep depression and have just given up on everything ..... the only thing I've made sure is that I wear deodorant and clean clothes (which is a miracle in itself ....) but then I got the flu .... and I've been sick for a few days without being able to do any laundry or even really get up and you know how you get that sweaty gross feeling? Well I finally dragged myself into the shower .... it's strange how fucking accomplished I feel at doing something most people don't think twice about 

So there's that.... I'm gonna try to do it again tomorrow so I can maybe force myself back into the cycle of taking care of myself 

Edit: - UPDATE - ... Thank you all for the support ... it gave me the motivation to go and get my haircut! I figured since it was kinda clean I needed to try to get it cut .... I was really worried what the person was going to think but I called a friend to come with me for support. I started to apologize to the woman for the state of my hair and she couldn't have been nicer. Anyways I wouldn't have done it without so much support from everyone! Thank you all!!!"
"Happy rant: I had sex without having a panic attack, crying, or dissociating!",165,7eozur,7,"CW: Sexual assault/abuse, pedophilia, panic attacks

I am so happy and just proud of myself in general. I was molested and sexually abused as a kid, and it left me with a lot of emotional scars. I get flashbacks and panic attacks a lot, and even in a safe, consentual environment if someone touches my genitals I have always either started crying or dissociated. 

I've been on tinder lately and I met this really sweet woman (lets call her Stephanie) and we sent each other memes for a couple days. We decided to meet up for coffee and we talked for hours about music, spirituality, art, being gay (we're both women), and we really hit it off. We went to the book store and then played video games at target, and then we went to a park. We kissed at the park and her lipstick got all over my face and we laughed at each other and I felt really comfortable with her. We decided to go to her house to watch a movie.

Long story short we cuddled for a bit and then ended up having sex! It was really weird actually feeling comfortable enough to express myself like that with someone. I didn't even have a glimpse of a flashback. This probably sounds super lame but I'm really, really proud of myself. I feel like this was a huge step in healing from my trauma and allowing myself to exist beyond what happened to me as a kid. I feel like one of the reasons why I felt so comfortable was because we talked a lot about boundaries and stuff beforehand, and I mentioned that I'd been sexually assaulted in the past and that I might need to stop if I start freaking out, and she was really understanding and sweet and always really communicative. Stephanie and I both agreed that we should definitely go on a second date. I'm just really happy and gay and proud of myself and Stephanie is really cute that is all"

Can I get a little hooray? Today I did something that scares me the most,166,i80aiv,14,"I won't bore you guys with the details but I was retraumatised by a doctor when giving birth and had a breakdown at the beginning of lockdown. I managed to reach out to a therapist and have been doing EMDR since. 

But I'm due to go back to work at the end of this month and am not going to be well enough to do so. I'm still in the 'it gets worse before it gets better' stage and I am fucking terrified of doctors now. But I managed to call the GPs surgery, get through the receptionist and have a teleappointment. I managed to say what was wrong and they  didn't minimise it or ignore me. They've signed me off sick until the end of September and said they'll give me whatever kind of note I need. I felt so sick and nervous. I don't think i'd have been able to do a face-to-face appointment and definitely not any kind of examination. 

But even a small win is a win, right?"

Psychiatrist said it's impossible for me to have PTSD,161,hqecjk,110,"I brought up that I think I have PTSD from my near death experience last year where I had multiple bowel obstructions and internal hernias causing excruciating pain that I endured for over four hours before the doctors could get me into surgery.  Seriously the worst pain I have ever felt and I've had it happen before that along with my gallbladder almost rupturing.  This was so much worse that I begged the doctors to kill me.  I still have nightmares about it and my anxiety shoots through the roof whenever I get stomach pains.  

Anyway, my psychiatrist said that only people who have been in war can suffer from PTSD.  That goes against everything that I have read on the subject.  I really liked him up until this point, as it has been really hard finding psychiatrists who take my insurance.  He gave me a prescription for Prazosin.  Short of that, he didn't offer my any other suggestions on dealing with this.

Should I start trying to find someone new?  Or is it true that only people who have been in war can suffer from PTSD."
Does anybody else keep waking up multiple times a night for no reason?,164,hox5cz,36,I wake up maybe 5 times a night. Most of the time right when I wake up my mind would be racing about my trauma. I would just keep thinking what my life would be if it didn't happen. Sometimes I would be panicking and breathing fast.
I (17) once saw my childhood abuser (19) at a diner. We were both kids. I realized I didn’t have to be angry anymore.,164,gyu1ze,8,"We’ve both grown up. After years of being so angry and afraid of some threat bigger than me, I realized after seeing her that she didn’t scare me anymore. That this big bad wolf in my head was just another kid like me. 

I cried on the way home. Not from fear, but from relief. She apologized and told me that she didn’t expect forgiveness. That’s something no one who’s hurt me ever said. She’s gotten so much better. I realized that she was also just an abused kid. 

I found closure in that aspect of my trauma. My other abusers, I will never see again or get an apology from, but this one I did. I’ve been a lot better since. My mood swings aren’t as violent and I’m better at calming down. 

I just wanted to share this progress. Sometimes it really does get easier.

PTSD IS REAL.,162,bbjjkp,23,"Most everyone here already knows this. This is to the people who dis-believe in it and I hope to reach the ignorant or misinformed.

The insomnia is real. No one chooses to stay up all night and go to bed at 4AM, be tired as hell in the morning ,and feel like ran over garbage.

The triggers are real. Certain movies, noises and visuals can cause anger, fear, anxiety, depression, and sadness to the point of crying (even for non-cryers). This is due to the feeling of re-living the event(s).

The trust issues and suspicions about people are real and don't take it personally. Ever hear ""I like to keep most things to my self""? That's an auto-response, nothing personal.

The nightmares are real. Sometimes nightmares of re-living the event and then waking up feeling a chaos of bad emotions; often ruining your entire day/days.

Anxiety is real and is often because of [insert event(s)]. Creating it for people who didn't have it prior.

Avoiding talking about it and avoiding things that remind you of it doesn't make the problem invalid, and aren't just ""faking it"". It's a logical, natural coping mechanism to avoid thinking about it.

An aversion to being physically touched is real. Ever hear ""don't touch me"", or the person is uncomfortable with being touched? Well the [insert event] is *likely* related to that. Again, don't take it personally.


Point being: no one fakes anything I listed above for the sake of feeling pity or ""just playing the victim"". It's a real problem just like anything else and it doesn't *only* apply to veterans and law enforcement.

Hope I could shed some insight."
I have ptsd from domestic abuse. Now I am homeless.,161,mf192c,40,"I am a 27 year old female and I was in an abusive relationship for three years. I want people to understand that the PTSD caused from my abuse was so bad that it resulted in several health issues. I was so sick that I was unable to work a job for months. I recently could not afford rent and now I am living out of my car. 

I wanted to share my story because I want to feel seen too, just as much as anyone else. Domestic abuse survivors are not taken as seriously by the judicial system and SSD, but the lasting affects of my abuse has ruined my life all the same."
"My doctor told me that I most likely will get disability due to PTSD, and I finally feel okay with it.",164,hwcnug,77,"Long story short, I have struggled with PTSD most of my life due to sexual abuse in childhood and teenage years, abused by my mother and her partners, bullying and other incidents. I have been in and out of psychiatric hospitals for almost 10 years with treatments, and will still do this in the future. 

I have now recently kind of accepted that my PTSD will be chronic, as my last therapist told me at the end of my EMDR - treatment in december last year. However, I got a little surprised when I was to my doctor today and she told me I most likely has to get disability in the future  due to the illness I have. Along with PTSD, I also have ADHD and chronic pain. My doctor told me that my PTSD will make the chronic pain worse on the worst periods, and that it was no point to focus on treatment with the intention to remove my PTSD, but rather get treatment to get the symptoms to not bother me so much when I have bad times. 

I have a long time blamed myself for feeling that I cant do stuff others can, that I cant function in work like people usually do and have had a hard time accepting that I am indeed sick and have chronic illness that I cant control at all. I have always felt that my PTSD wasnt a excuse enough to not work as much as other people, and that I should just try a little bit more to function. I have struggled to understand how serious PTSD can be, and I have learned the last year how much PTSD really affects someones health both mental and psychical. When I first got the diagnosis, I just got told that the symptoms were anxiety, flashbacks, depression and the need to avoid certain people and places.  Now I know that PTSD is so more than that.

Who would have guessed that almost a lifetime with PTSD would end up with me getting chronic pain in the early adulthood? I still have anxiety and flashbacks, sometimes nightmares and paranoia, on the other hand, I have experienced more of the psychical symptoms of the diagnosis the last year than ever.  That makes me ask how a lot of doctors I have met and talked to havent informed me about how much PTSD impacts someones life, and about other symptoms like anxiety and flashbacks. I remember that I felt I was ""cured"" from it because I felt little anxiety and flashbacks for a period, however, I can see how wrong I was and how little educated I was with my own illness. 

I wish healthcare professionals were more educated about PTSD and how much it can impact someone - both mentally and psychically. PTSD is not only anxiety, nightmares and flashbacks like I feel most people describe this diagnosis. It is so much more, and will impact a persons life for most likely the whole life. PTSD can be one day with anxiety, flashback, nightmares, isolation and avoiding things that remind someone of their trauma. The next day, PTSD can be one day with back pain, shoulder pain, hurtful neck, stomach trouble, vomiting, eating disorders to cope with hurtful feelings and memories, addiction to drugs / alcohol / sex - and porn addiction. It can one day be with insomnia, on the other hand, you can have one day with hypersomnia due to exhaustion with the diagnosis and all the aftermath someone gets after trauma. It can be that people developå fibromyalgia or ME due to the exhaustion and stress after trauma. It could be one day where other traumatic memories shows up because something triggered them up - things you didnt even remembered had happened in the first place. It can be one day where you feel like your adult verison of yourself, and suddenly switch to this childlike behaviour and childlike version of yourself.

I wish someone told me this things when I first got the diagnosis. Because for now a lot of my issues makes sense to me. Some of it can also be from my ADHD, however, PTSD has impacted me more than I would ever imagined. One period, I used alcohol do deal with the unpleasant emotions and memories. I was only 16 - 17 years old. Then when I was 19 - 20 years old, I experimented with drugs like benzodiazepines and other type of drugs to deal with the emotional pain and unpleasant memories. When I remembered my trauma, I could feel my whole back get painful, my neck would tighten itself and I would believe that something was strangling me. I would hallucinate abusers visually or hear their voices when I had a panic attack. I struggle to go to the toilet due to anxiety and PTSD. I felt crazy and I was scared to tell someone about this because I didnt know it could be PTSD symptoms. 

Now I know, and the fact that I am sick and will struggle with this most likely most of my life, doesnt bother me so much anymore. I cant blame myself for having PTSD. My abusers didnt have to abuse me, they chose to abuse me for whatever reason they had. PTSD is just a result of what trauma does with someone. I never asked or wanted to experience abuse or to get PTSD - I never got the choice to choose if I wanted to either. The fact that I have to get disability sooner or later doesnt bother me as much as it did, because it isnt my fault. I have done a lot of treatments, both therapy and with medication to try to get my life a little easier. I dont function like people believe, and thats okay. I know I can do some things, and I have a whole life to find out what I want to do and not. 

After summer, I have planned to take a student program online about psychiatry and about mental health, different challenges and diagnosis, how to treat them and how to spot them. I look forward to that.   I want to be a mental health worker, part time, where I can talk to people with mental health issues. When I was younger, my hometown didnt have that offer to kids or teenagers like I was. A lot of kids here start using drugs instead, which is sad. I want to do something about that, and try to change. I want to be there for the kids, teenagers and adults that struggle and havent someone to talk to."

I spent so much time, energy, blood sweat and tears on my stupid fucking degree and now not only do I have nightmares, but I don’t know what to do with my degree and can’t get myself to even try job hunting.

Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?,158,fej29a,18,"Who else had to unlearn normalizing and being flattered by men creepily leering and sexualizing you?

I thought the way men showed they liked me was when they leered and sexualized me. I was groomed due to child sexual abuse and our sexist society... I thought this behavior was normal. I was flattered, turned on (traumatic bonding and brain changes), and was attracted to creeps. It didn’t feel like love or like a guy liked me enough if they didn’t sexualize me.

Now as I have been processing my past trauma, I realize how much I hate and fear being sexualized. I don’t want to be sexualized at all and get grossed out when men do. I don’t want to do anything sexual or even date for that matter. I now see how wrong it is for men to minimize me to a sexual body!

I was so offended recently when I went to an educational discussion and at the end of the meeting the men were leering at my body.. how horrible that sex was the only thing that was on their mind instead of my intellect and what I could bring to help them!!!

So this is progress for me to realize how wrong sexism is because in the past, I never saw myself as a feminist. I still struggle with my body being turned on by creepiness because it was what was “normal” for so long. I am actually afraid of my sexuality right now and feel shame and disgust about it especially when I become turned on by violating sex. 

However, I’m also noticing When I watch movies or see pictures of women getting sexualized, I get grossed out and triggered More than I ever have. I am now allowing myself to get grossed out by the creepers and being mean to them when I wasn’t able to for most of my life. I still have a part of me that gets turned on by creepiness and sexualization but I can confidently say it is starting to fade away especially as I continue processing my trauma and become more of a feminist. I was brainwashed by society and the abusers in my life. It is so bizarre to now see the truth and how what I was told was a lie about the sexualization and abuse of women to be normal and flattering.

 I know with time and therapy, I will be able to retrain my brain to be turned on by healthy sex with consent and boundaries completely. I am already noticing that I am being drawn to these types of healthy relationships which I am very proud of myself for. 

Who else relate?"
"I feel such horrible envy towards people who had a ""normal"" adolescence & teenage life",158,mejeo5,21,"It doesn't help that I grew up in a sheltered & privileged suburb where it was assumed that bad things just didn't happen to us. No murders, no robberies, not even petty theft. It was the sort of place where kids took AP classes and went to Ivy League schools. Nobody got pregnant, or fought in the hallway, or dropped out. Most of my peers really had the ""ideal"" teenage life you see in YA books & movies like *Love, Simon,* etc.

I remember almost nothing of prom, graduation, senior year, all the milestones that mark ordinary teenage life—it all feels foggy, like it was happening to somebody else. I've left the room when my friends were chatting about their first love/first kiss/losing their virginity (which are also topics that I can't deal with), because how could I tear apart their normalcy with my own story of rape and emotional abuse in my first relationship at 15, and the broken dysfunctional relationships that followed me into adulthood? How am I supposed to talk about the parents & teachers who didn't know what was going on, the school counselor who assured me that the abuser was ""very fragile"" when I tried to tell her what happened, the friends who tried to keep their friendship with them, so that I no longer felt safe in my group? I still can't trust any authority figures or institutions today. Nobody has your interests in mind—you must fight tooth-and-nail to get what you need, and I don't have any soft or safe places to land.

I can't touch any positive YA books/movies like the aforementioned *Love, Simon* because it's too triggering to be reminded of what I missed out on, especially if they include relationships or supportive parents/friends. The last time I tried, I had these horrible vivid flashbacks that incapacitated me for the entire day. Those stories make me feel so alone, abnormal, and ashamed. I only feel less alone when I read about, like, children or teenagers who experienced fucked-up things that they bear the consequences of for the rest of their lives.

Before I was 15, I was normal. I had a good childhood. I was supposed to be an ordinary teenager who grew into a well-adjusted adult, but what happened to me then broke my life. I honestly want to scream whenever people act dismissive of stuff that happens in your teenage years—flippant statements like, ""Don't worry, you'll look back in five years and laugh!."" Life doesn't fucking work that way. For better and for worse, what happens when you're young ripples throughout the rest of your life."

Does anyone else feel attached to their trauma?,159,guyca4,33,"trigger warning: violence

A little over five months ago, I was on a bus that crashed into a bus stop, killing four people. I wasn't injured myself but I tried to help two people on the bus, one of whom I watched bleed out in a very violent way and another who was panicking while I stayed with her for several minutes. I've since been diagnosed with acute PTSD. My trauma counselor and me recently arrived at the conclusion that I might actually be attached to my trauma--that I'm resistant to getting over it and that losing the feeling of urgency and intensity would feel like losing a part of myself.

Does anybody else feel a similar sense of attachment to their trauma, especially if it was acute/a specific event? Like if they lost ""access"" to that event by going to therapy they might actually lose a part of themselves? I totally feel that way and I know how unhealthy it is and I'm looking for company/validation/tips for how to get over that attachment or cope with it."
Today I was diagnosed,158,ftwyd0,23,"Today, I was formally diagnosed with PTSD. I found out over a zoom call with my psychologist. I haven't told anyone, not sure if I even want to tell anyone, so I'll tell reddit. Thanks for reading.

Don't ignore your PTSD if you have to quarantine with the wrong people.,162,fpvare,31,"Alot of people are posting right now about being locked in with their abusers, and difficult family members. 

You have to remember, PTSD is a serious illness, and it can be just as dangerous and deadly as any virus. We're going to be dealing with these issues for a lot longer than coronavirus is going to be a daily headline. 
You need to ask yourself, if you're in a difficult or dangerous situation if it is really worth it, and if it would be worth the long-term damage to your mental health?

Just look after yourself, and remember that the the mental illness you're dealing with is just as important as any physical illness, and that deserves to be recognized and respected."

Reacting to trauma by immediately telling anyone and everyone who will listen about it?,157,drix9x,43,"From what I hear, most people seem to shut down after a traumatic event, refuse to talk about it (or are unable to), some even dissociate so hard they forget it happened for a while. But I've noticed that, for most of the traumatic things that have happened to me...... the opposite happened.

I feel this uncontrollable need to tell every person I come across, whether theyre listening or not.

I'll go into gory details, get way too personak in how it affected me and my past relating to why it affected me that way and then go into gory detail some more.  I'll just talk and talk and talk........ until it slowly tapers out. 

And for some of my traumas, it was only much, much later that I suddenly couldn't acknowledge it, or talk about it, at *all* anymore.

Once I stopped doing the constant word vomit for my first Huge Traumatic Event, I thought like, ""oh, since i talked about it so much, that must mean i 'processed' the trauma! that's what everyone says, that talking is what helps you process trauma!"" but Nope! I have not even remotely healed. All that talking, and explaining, and combing out alk the details, and talking, and explaining, and talking some more........ did literally Nothing for me. In fact, I think that reaction resulted in medical professionals not taking me seriously, because after all, ""it couldn't be so bad if he's talking about it non stop, right? He's probably Faking/over-exaggerating for attention......."". Which lead me to be further traumatized by said medical professionals.

Of course, barely anyone points out that he is sexually assaulting her and when I do, random reddit idiots respond telling me that he isn’t sexually coercing her and that I don’t understand what sexual coercion is (as if two years of my life weren’t made a complete and utter nightmare by my own experience with coercion and a police report for sexual assault was never filed.)

Our society’s views on dating, relationships, and sexual deviance (*especially heterosexual men’s views—don’t argue with me*) are so backwards and blatantly incorrect that I feel like it’s safer to be brutal and ruthless with my boundaries (and risk hurting a love intere’s feelings) or be alone completely. It’s just so deeply disturbing  how misogynistic, self-centered, and oblivious men are in their relationships with women.

My assistant told him I had ptsd, to which he scoffed and asked “has (my name) been to war?”  My assistant defended me, saying you can get ptsd from other things, to which he said “oh okay” sarcastically and went away.

It tires me out on a daily basis. My triggers are everywhere, especially when I leave my place and venture out in public. Being constantly set off by these things is exhausting. My heart races, my muscles tense, I start to growl... I'm basically thrown into fight-or-flight mode all the time. And don't get me started on the constant anxiety that forces me to be on hyper alert for my triggers.

Even short trips to the convenience store a couple of blocks away can run me ragged by the time I get back. It drains me so fast. I keep thinking that I should just lock myself away in my room, hidden from the outside world, but that isn't realistic, especially since I started working again in December.

I have to face it, so I do. It doesn't make it any easier. In fact, its twisting me in a way. I have very angry and violent thoughts about hurting others as a result, to add to the exhaustion. Dealing with those intrusive thoughts is exhausting in itself. Then there's the Worm, but that's a topic for a different subreddit.

Why am I so tired all the time? Well, PTSD is one of the reasons why."

I knew I needed to work on the core of why I'm so miserable (lots of trauma) so I scheduled an appointment with a well regarded trauma therapist. 

She spent the whole appointment covering herself. She said I was ""passively suicidal"" (I said I have no intention of hurting myself again but see no meaning in life). She said I needed to be ""stabilized."" She sort of threatened she might need to commit me (which was a very traumatic experience for me). And said she'd need to discuss my history with my old Psychiatrist and she probably wouldn't be able to work with me unless I was at least on anti-depressants again. She forced me to sign the release form to get on the books for another appointment.

I left feeling really pissed off. Drove home, wrote her an e-mail explaining what a disappointment it was, revoked her rights to discuss anything with my old Psychiatrist, and cancelled my next appointment.

I'm just venting. All I wanted was someone who could to talk with me and help me that way. Most of my trauma is centered around horrible medical care, so it's a big deal for me to reach out for help, only to be screwed over again."

"""The Body Keeps the Score"" My new favorite book",147,chmpta,25,"2.5 years ago, I had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days. I thought 10 years had gone by when I woke up and I lost 30 pounds of muscle. That experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me. I was sleeping at most 4 hours a night, barely eating and I couldn't stand the company of others. I was a horrible wreck and barely able to function.

1.5 years after that experience, I was able to start therapy. I also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact PTSD has on us. It was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s, starting with Vietnam War veterans, moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children.

It took me a long time to finally get this book. I was convinced the connection I had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience. I could barely feel my left side, my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later. The sheets of my bed made my skin crawl, reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed. I was too traumatized to believe relief was possible.

Then I started reading this book. Maybe this wont be everyone, but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable, its manageable, its treatable and its **not permanent**. I can feel more now, things are getting better, its easier for me to de-escalate the tension and stress I feel on a daily basis.

 like sometimes I will be confused about the year for ex, like I won't fully believe its 2021, I'll feel like it's the year of my worst trauma. as in I'll feel like it's not possible for the current year to what it is bc in my mind there's still a few years between *now*  & 2021 while also knowing it is 2021. Its like I'm simultaneously back then & in the present. sometimes I'll even accidently put that year in dates. 

I also feel the same for my age at times, like I'll know how old I really am but I also feel viscerally like I'm the age of one of my traumas and my current age is so old and far away, and that it's impossible I'm that age bc k still have a couple years before I'd be that age. like I really feel like I'm split. 

other times I'll completely act & think for a few minutes or a few seconds like how I did at those ages. it's super visceral and freaks me out so much. or I'll even think or very strongly feel like I'm those ages (still with awareness mostly that I'm not. but sometimes there's no awareness for a few seconds.. )"

But I wasn't even scared, or anxious. I was actually angry. My fight or flight clicked into fight for the first time in my life. He was a big guy and stood in my face and told me he was going to hit me, and I told him to just hit me. It's strange but as big as he was, he looked small to me. Like he couldn't even hurt me if he wanted to.
Anyway, he stood down and I left, then told my boss about what happened and that I won't be going back. The panic began after the incident and is still happening right now.

I keep her at a distance and learned I can’t have her visit, we only talk in the phone every few months.  I just ended a convo with her that went really well until at the end she said “and you so crazy and that’s what I needed crazy.” And it makes me want to cry. I wasn’t crazy I was hurting.

Today I deleted every single voicemail he left me. Erased all his contact info. Threw out all his clothes. Threw out every single gift he ever gave me. Started treatment on all the mental and physical scars that were supposed to be “love”. 

After four years, he’s purged from my life. 

It’s been a lot of tears, shaking, nail marks in my skin, flashbacks, guilt, panic attacks, lonely nights, hopeless moments, and ugly thoughts, but I did it.

Success: able to enjoy sex again (TW: Sexual abuse),146,m8psfb,18,"TW: mention of sexual abuse

If you told me only three months ago that I would be having sex again with no trouble whatsoever... I wouldn't have believed you. A break-up, a few therapy sessions and a new partner and it's like I'm living in a different world.

In my last relationship the inability to have sex started 1,5 years before our inevitable breakup. It started with no more PIV sex, then less and less and less sexual interaction until the last half a year nothing happened. I thought it was because of my other traumas, and was waiting (forever) for therapy to start. Now I've realised that he, too, did not respect my boundaries. I became scared whenever he displayed arousal, afraid he would coerce me into having sex, which would end up being uncomfortable(painful) for me, making the next time worse. I even got triggered by his heavy breathing. (Note: my therapist has since told me that sex should never be painful. If it is, just stop. If you continue your body is expecting the pain next time and tenses up, which just makes it painful again, and there you are in your own vicious cycle)

Now I'm working on my view on sexuality, especially my own sexuality & sexual pleasure. In the meantime I've met this amazing man who always asks for consent and backs off whenever I do not give an enthousiastic yes. My therapist is delighted I get to experience this right now, and for me it's like breathing a sight of relief. I don't even have to say no, though my goal is to be able to say no eventually. For now an ""I don't know"" is enough for him to not go further. A simple stop or even just laying my hand on his makes him stop as well. I never imagined it could be that easy. No whining, no passive aggressiveness, no disappointment, just happy to be doing whatever we're doing and just staying there.

The first time we met he asked me if he could give me a hug at the end. He saw my hesitation and immediatly said ""oh, that's a no, that's okay."" I felt the need to explain myself, of course, it was only because of covid, but it wouldn't have been necesarry with him. He was fine either way. It's been that way every step of the way, and I am so glad I get to experience this cause even if we don't end up working on the long term, I now know that there are good men out there who will respect your boundaries, and I will not put up with anything less ever again. 

I am starting to enjoy sex again and I'm just so happy I do. They haven't ruined it forever for me, I can heal and it's me that gets the credit for that. I am taking my power back."
"People diagnosed with PTSD, are you ever inexplicably drawn to or aroused by the type of abuse you went through? Do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? What is your reaction to the triggering usually like when you do that? (TW)",150,gkwu87,84,"(Im a survivor of sexual abuse in my childhood  but don’t have PTSD). It was an absolutely horrible thing which I have all kinds of complicated feelings towards. But even though my experiences were bad, I still am drawn to the abuse, almost aroused by it. Not in action of course, but only in my thoughts. After reading some threads here, I realised how common it is to almost fetishise your abuse as a way of coping, and how a lot of us feel ashamed for that too. Sometimes the abusers do things in a way that their victim’s body “responds.” 

In one thread here a woman was saying that when she was 5, her abuser was extremely patient and gentle and performed things in a way that her body responded and was aroused (and it’s of course still very traumatising nonetheless). But there was no “violence.” But isn’t that a criterion for PTSD? Is it possible to have PTSD from those kinds of experiences?


Also, as a survivor of sexual abuse, I know I seek out fictional material with sexual abuse or other kinds of dark subjects as it draws me strongly, and perhaps even arouses me. It ashames me that I’m this way but it’s a fact. Is this a way we purposefully trigger ourselves I wonder?

Are any of you who purposefully seek out things similar to your abuse, do you get triggered by it? What kinds of things do you seek out? If you aren’t triggered by it, then what triggers you? 

Second part of the question, do any of you purposefully trigger yourselves? How do you react to the triggering? 

I was reading some old threads on here about how people purposefully trigger themselves and that’s what had got me thinking. If you search “trigger on purpose” you’ll get some topics. Here are some examples of that: [#1](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/fbkpjm/ptsd_triggers_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#2](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/f3ocvn/i_trigger_myself_on_purpose/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf), [#3](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/g0lhbw/selftriggering/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). 

And also [this article](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/) is a more through and interesting example of that. 

A recap of the questions:

1. Are you sometimes drawn to or aroused by the abuse you went through? 

2. Do you seek those things out in a simulated way? Either by reading, watching, fantasising, role play, etc.? 

3. Do you get triggered when you do these things? If not, what tends to trigger you? If yes, what is your response like? 

4. Do you ever purposefully trigger yourself?(similar to what this woman explained [here](https://psychcentral.com/ask-the-therapist/2015/07/03/ptsd-cant-stop-purposely-triggering-myself/)). How do you react to this triggering? Is it milder than usual? Stronger?

I ask these questions because I was reading an article here about how those suffering from PTSD will go to ANY LENGTH whatsoever to AVOID that experience and anything that triggers them at all costs, whereas those suffering from some form of anxiety and who have past trauma will feel a very strong emotional response and discomfort instead, and that *that* is a distinction between both of these disorders.

That sounded a little different from what I’ve read from people’s experiences on here. Is this that these people were not diagnosed with PTSD? That those suffering from PTSD will always try to avoid those experiences at any cost?

Thanks for the answers guys. Sorry if you found it intrusive or offensive in any way. 

Sending love ❤️

I finally told my mom,148,fiimgh,34,"I am 19M and just told my mom about the sexual abuse from when I was 12 that I kept a secret for years. I also told her the PTSD I have from it. She was very supportive and loving, and made me promise to give her a big hug when I saw her next, which I obviously did. It’s still a big struggle, but having her unconditional love and support means the world to me. She said she would move heaven and earth to help me. It was really hard to tell her, so I had to by writing a letter, putting it on her bed and going to a friends house."

And I just feel kind of off. Like my trauma has been on my mind a lot, just really close to the surface and I find myself zoning out a lot, finding tasks harder to concentrate on. Not sure what I need or why this week specifically, just needed talk about this.
Update: having rough day mentally and physically. Not sure which one started things and then affected the other, but regardless I'm weak and feverish and so on so I took half a day off to rest before it gets to a point where I have no choice.

Does anyone else have PTSD from childhood sexual abuse?,148,bmqeyt,60,"Nobody I know has been sexually abused as a child, so I just want to know that I’m not alone. 

I have sexual dysfunction and have trouble having sex. During sex it feels almost as if there’s a little light switch in my head that goes off and suddenly I feel disgusting, alone and that I need to stop. Afterwards I feel terrible and like I’m repulsed by myself. It makes me want to be alone and distant myself from everyone, especially the person I had sex with."

I’m trying to write a cover letter in French for a fake job position and I’m so stupid that I can’t even write about myself anymore. I don’t know what to say or how to pretend to sound smart while writing it. I hate myself and I hate what PTSD and trauma has done to my brain. 

I used to do so well in school and had little to no trouble getting A’s. I’m so mad at everyone involved in my trauma and mad at myself for being so stupid and I don’t know what to do anymore. I wish my life wasn’t revolved around healing this stupid trauma that I never asked for.

Emotional Abuse Still Leaves Scars,147,fsw30q,17,"﻿Emotional abuse literally drives you crazy. You constantly think you’re overreacting or that maybe you did deserve the abusive behavior. My father is an attorney so I’ve always learned to have evidence to back up anything I say, with emotional abuse, it’s very difficult to find evidence outside of a few text messages or emails.

&#x200B;

 I had tried explaining what was going on to one therapist I had while I was still unsure of what I was going through and she told me his actions weren’t abusive. So, I stayed. This is why I always recommend you interview multiple therapists before just picking one to listen to. Had I stayed with that therapist longer, who knows where I would be. After I left the relationship, the lack of evidence drove me insane. I was always in so much psychological pain. I couldn’t interact with others without tears forming from his voice in my head or having memories pop into my head. I always looked depressed and was never invited to anything as I wasn’t “fun” enough. I became very aggressive during this time. I was kicked out of a bar and the bouncer called me a bitch/cunt and I went off. Next thing I know I woke up in the hospital with two black eyes. They weren’t from the bouncer, I had drunkenly stumbled and fell flat on my face. I was so shocked to see how awful I looked, but was at the same time relieved because I was finally able to see pain. Please note that I do NOT recommend accidental or voluntary self harm as according to one of my other therapists, that is common for emotional abuse survivors. Instead we need to break our silence and educate and have people start looking deeper than the skin level and understand that the scars that lie beneath can truly be the deepest. 

&#x200B;

 This was a post from Instagram \*\*he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* and really spoke to me and helped me understand my need for self harm and how it isn’t the answer."
Who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive?,144,erxkee,52,"Who else became really good at seducing men as a way to control them in order to survive?

I was sexualized starting as a child from my father through mostly covert sexual abuse. The way I survived was by seducing and flirting with him. My mom was out to get me and the way I learner to receive love was by seducing. It became a way for me to get control in an unsafe situation. If I got the man to develop a crush on me, distract them and become infatuated, I was more able to control them so I was safe. I notice this pattern will come out especially around unsafe and angry men. I’ve done this technique when I felt I was being discriminated against, too. It gets the men to let their guard down, be nicer to me and get what I want because to them I am flattering their ego and playing submissive. Obviously this is maladaptive coping mechanism that I am unlearning. But yeah I realized recently it has helped me survive racism and sexism And to avoid others’ aggression. I also realized I liked how it kept me safe and gave me power in an unsafe situation. It gave me power over my abusers and I was able to punish men by seducing them and rejecting them and keeping myself safe. 
Sometimes I think about about becoming a stripper because I am really good at seducing and making myself Into a man’s “dream girl.”

Your pain is your mythology...,146,jvad9c,22,"My friend and I were discussing mythology and goddesses, and I started looking up different mythological women on wikipedia. They were described as being beautiful, captivating, the goddess of fertility, the goddess of beauty, etc... but none of them were perfect. They all had a backstory, a tragedy, or something they had been through. In fact, without that backstory, they might be boring...

As I sat there, reading these stories, a thought occurred to me. I have my own mythology... PTSD is a part of my mythology. It wouldn't be my story without it. Something about that idea was so comforting to me. It helped me to see myself in a whole new way.

So, I'm not any less for having PTSD. I am, and always have been, a goddess in my
own story. And PTSD is only a small
part of that, a part of my story and my mythology."
"I want to be a psychologist, but I'm sick of what people say behind closed doors.",145,g04z6n,47,"Hi Sorry for the long post, ive not really made a post before and my thoughts are all over the place at the moment.

Not many people I know professionally know that I have PTSD. It's something I've been made to be ashamed about after working on a psychiatric ward and now while I study my Msc.

I was on a 1:1 with a patient who was in the midst of a breakdown and was performing similar (and very distressing) behaviours as my abuser. When I asked my co-workers for help they told me they would come and assist. I was left waiting for 4 hours, (even though I was only supposed to be on 1:1 for an hour, as trust policy dictates). I told them that was not ok and to not do that again. They did it again the next shift I was with them.

At the next staff meeting I told the team about this incidence and how it should not be happening, if a staff member needs to tap out, they should be able to tap out. The manager said I was right to tell everyone and she would have words with the staff on shift that day. I was really happy to have had that conversation and to have it out in the air.

Fast forward to handover straight after the meeting, where there were 10 nurses in the nurses office, I was sitting down while everyone was standing around me. The manager walks in and says are we looking after \*my name\* or are we looking after the patients? Everyone, apart form one nurse who saw me burst out laughing. Another nurse said I shouldn't be in the job. I coughed loudly and everyone went quiet. I walked out and kept myself busy looking after my patients.

Another time my colleagues said they could never be friends with/date someone who has mental health issues.

Whilst studying my masters a student in my cohort noted how PTSD is a disease and that those with PTSD have deformed brains. Well yeah I have a deformed brain but its not my fault, I went through shit, and that effected my neurology as it would anyone.

&#x200B;

* Am I just being really sensitive?
* Is there anyone else out there who works in mental health that has experienced the same?
* Those who look after others are humans themselves, surely we're allowed to have mental health issues aswell?

&#x200B;

I think going through my own mental health issues actually made me a better nurse because I know the *depths* patients are talking about.

I'm just frustrated, I'm largely ok now, I have the occasional wobble here and there but I pick myself up and carry on fighting. I don't even know if I should carry on trying to be a psychologist. But I don't want the career I've always wanted to be another thing he has robbed from me

&#x200B;

p.s. **Please please please** reach out for help if you need it, don't be put off by a few vile creatures I've worked with. Not all mental healthcare professionals are like this, I have had the pleasure of meeting some individuals in the industry who have restored my faith in humanity (which is no small task)."

Is anyone else’s mental state always deteriorate right before bed?,145,i1lj6n,17,"Noticing a pattern where I’ll spend all day content, think about how insane I was the night before, and then somehow, right before bed, get stuck right back into those intrusive memories.

So I looked up my abuser on FB,147,hs7lpj,9,"And it was the opposite of all my fears. My old gmail got a message saying he posted a pic. And I have him blocked on all accounts so I used my bfs to look him up. I was a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking, cyberstalking, harassment, and all that jazz. This was a few years ago. And I found out that apparently he's been sober from meth and booze for 2 years and is at least 2 hours away from me right now. I feel a lot of relief. his posts just seemed...less misogynistic and angry. I probably won't look again. The second restraining order is probably expiring soon and I've been worried about whether or not they'd grant me a new one. But I might not need one. Maybe there will be a day I can live my life without fear of retaliation and revenge for prosecution."

"Dear Brain, you repressed that shit for a reason. Don’t go randomly remembering it, especially without warning.",148,9ee68l,8,"I saw a post on one of the advice subs (idr which one). Basically this guy was having sex with his girlfriend and she asked him if he wanted to watch her have sex with his friends. 

My brain went... “Hey. That sounds familiar. Give me a second while I dig into that.”

Then I suddenly remembered... My extremely abusive, hyper-sexual ex... I think it was the same week, maybe even the same session (it’s all a blur) where he took the condom off and proceeded to fuck me despite me screaming no and pushing on him and crying...

Before all that he had asked me something about him watching me have sex with guy friends. He brought up a specific friend, Daniel. I told him I was uncomfortable with it and I didn’t want to do it or think about it. 

Later, he proceeded to describe it in detail while we were having sex once. Just thrusting that image of my platonic friend fucking me while he watched. 

I wasn’t able to look Daniel in the eyes for weeks. I got paranoid of every moment around him. 

Eventually we got back to normal. We’re not even that close anymore. But I hate what my ex did to me. And that friendship. 

You know.... I saw on social media that that ex had wrecked his car. I saw the pictures before I read the text and I found myself... Disappointed when they said he had walked away without a scratch. 

Fuck him. Fucking die for all the shit you did to me. For the bruises and the pain and the coercion again and again. For the gaslighting and the suicide threats and the rape. For taking pictures of me without my consent. For fucking existing. "
Officially diagnosed with PTSD after surviving COVID,144,m69j99,86,"I thought I was doing better and. It just spiraled so fast. I’m having severe anxiety on the daily. Feels like there’s glass in my skin. Sweating. Heart racing (I need to take meds to keep it lower cuz it’s like 130+ even when I’m sitting). Feels like I’m stuck in this weird fog. Or black tar pit. Feels like I’m suffocating. Reminds me of when I was sick and I could barely breathe. Remembering those weeks in quarantine in that empty house all alone on Christmas and it’s just a blur of fear and sobbing. Hearing my grandma yell for help as they took her to the hospital. Hearing her beg me to take her home. Crying as I tried to explain that I couldn’t. 

I have slept an average of 2 hours a night since I got “better”. When I do sleep, I am apparently screaming and crying in my sleep. I hardly sleep enough to have dreams anymore but when I do they are nightmares. Hardly eating. Can’t focus. Can’t focus at all. Not even on fun stuff. Keep buying more stuff thinking one of these purchases will be good enough that I can actually have fun again but it’s useless. It’s just all gathering dust in my room. 

I need to learn how to be human again and it’s hard. Especially with a family pressuring me to hurry up and be normal and be okay because they don’t like seeing me struggle. I keep trying to force normalcy for their sake but I feel like I’m dying all the time."

I impulsively texted my dad about how I was feeling at two in the morning. I was crying and kept thinking about how I was a burden, no one cared about me, and everyone would be better off if I died. He responded and said to take deep breaths and try to get some sleep. We’ll talk about it tomorrow. It’s tomorrow and we talked about it. He told my stepmom about the text, and the three of us talked. They didn’t brush me off and they didn’t say I was a burden. They said they’d already started looking into solutions this morning before I’d even woken up. They said they wanted to find a therapist and talk to them about what would be best. That they thought I might need medication, but they wanted that to be a last resort. They’re getting me natural things to try right now. Like a vaporizer for my room with essential oils meant to calm you. They’re looking into techniques for what to do if I have another anxiety attack. And my stepmom said she’ll help me keep on track with a healthier lifestyle, like taking walks and eating better. I don’t know what I expected, but this wasn’t it. I’m so glad they’re taking me seriously. I might finally get help now."

I didn't choose to be raped. I chose to keep my child and do what I thought was the right thing. I didn't choose the life sentence of harassment and abuse from my ex and his family ever since.

Today was different, I let my sister hold my hand and I didn't freak out run away or cry I had anxiety the entire time but it wasnt a out burst like normal.

Anyone else get PTSD from a parent with BPD?,145,cnn6mi,78,"I took my comment from another thread to start this discussion:

My mom had BPD and abandoned me when I was 3, thankfully my dad was amazing and held onto me. Whenever i would see her (starting again at age 6) her symptoms would have her be extremely volatile. She wouldn't give me affection unless it was a show for someone else, called me her niece in public for a while, drank all the time, and made her adult problems mine. I had to escort her out of family parties at 10 when she would get drunk and belligerent. When I was 13 or so I remember she spit on me. When I was 16 she chased me into a bathroom and told be she was going to beat my ass because I started calling my step mom ""mom"" too. I never called her by her name to her face, she just didnt want to share. Following 16, she started with a lot of false suicide attempts for attention, which I always treated seriously. Our relationship was so weird. First she didnt want me, then we were familiar strangers, acquaintances, distant cousins, and then friends.

Until her last suicide attempt, that accidentally went through. The table broke under her. The police I called called me to come down.  It was the day before her dads 70th birthday, and I had to tell him to his face that his daughter was never coming back. 

I did her makeup for her viewing. It's the least I could do. I loved her so much, in the most damaging way to myself. I put up with everything because it was obvious her BPD made her suffer and everyone except her family left her. I couldnt stop grasping for the love she wasnt able to give. 

Now I struggle to get and keep jobs. That was only the worst thing that happened to me. I had a marriage with a man that was practically the Male version of her, and I was raped after I left him...I got catfished...please dont call me stupid I was vulnerable. It took 9 months to meet. 


Now the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me. 

Sorry this was so long. 



TL;DR 

Mom had BPD, was abusive, killed herself and involved me. Now the obvious triggers get to me, cluttered houses, crowds, loud places, and the month of July is awful for me.

Edit: I havent cried about this in months, and now I'm sitting on my hallway floor, leaking through my eyes, and thinking about learning how to paint so I can get my nightmares out."
How do I stop getting upset when people try to invalidate my trauma and call me an attention seeker when I’m only trying to reach out for help?

In doing so I’ve come across some really awful people who have tried to invalidate my feelings and last Saturday it hurt so badly I felt so dirty I wanted to take my own life. They won’t stop coming at me and right now I can’t even breathe.

I am completely broken and suffering, I don't understand why I do the things I do but I have too. Everything has to be extreme, punishment I need to suffer to feel good or I never feel alive. Please, someone talk to me if you have similar feelings. I need to talk to someone real who's been here.

Edit- Thanks to everyone for your replies im not great but it's good for me to hear other people are going through similar things. I've got through this fuckout and am onto the next one when it happens. I hope everyone can find some catharsis eventually."
the relief and validation when your psychotherapist looks you in the eye and says “honey. you have ptsd.”,142,cjlphw,42,"after a lifetime of denial i can finally start healing..

it was really difficult to hear but i am coming to accept it.

i posted here the other day with my symptoms and today i talked over it with her. while i had most symptoms of ptsd i had not been able to believe it because i did not experience flashbacks. however she said not all people with ptsd experience flashbacks because we might have buried the memories very deep, but it comes out through our bodies, which is definitely what i experience, based on her observations. i thought this was interesting to share if anyone else doubts themselves. talk to a professional if you can.

i’m shaking. i could cry. it was not my fault. i was not “too sensitive”. i was not wrong. i was not bad. i legitimately experienced trauma, and someone TOLD ME SO today."
Anyone else have trouble making a phonecall or picking up the phone?,141,mecfs8,29,"For me calling is always my last option, though no one understands what the big deal is for me. This morning I have to call out for work for being sick and I seriously don't want to out of fear(?) Anyone else has/has had an experience like this with the phone?"
My Story Summarized,140,k4gq5f,30,"I died six years ago, a victim of domestic violence. You don't hear our stories because we are called liars, babies, not man enough, stupid, etc. ""Who are they going to believe, a 6 foot tall man or a 5 foot tall girl"" I was often told when I said one day I would run away and she couldn't find me. She would punch herself in the face and say I did it. She would grab hammers and threaten to bruise herself and say she would tell the cops I did it and she would get a warrant out for my arrest if I tried to leave. I was trapped.

Men can be raped as well. My abuser raped be on several occasions. If I couldn't get it up after hours of abuse I was called every name in the book and told ""What kind of f****t can't get up to an attractive woman?"". If I refused she would tell me there would be ""consequences"" and never describe what they were. Sometimes she would say things like ""I will wait for you at your mom's and you will see the consequences"" which typically made me do whatever she wanted. If I ever finished too quickly she made me sleep on the wooden floor in the corner of the room as punishment for ""using her like a piece of meat"".

I have been free of her for 3 years but her words and actions still haunt me. A simple nod or a juice container can send me into a panic attack. Those around me look at me like I am some weird weak man. They don't know the stories of men like me because no one cares about our stories.

Johnny Depp may know from his situation he is dealing with. But even in the press he is slandered on the fact he is a man. I know people will not believe my story too. My abuser has spent years creating paper trails and stories for this very moment. She's made me say multiple times that I was the abuser just to calm her down. She's hit me behind closed doors and screamed at me that I was hitting her. She took complete control of my finances. I was not allowed to make a purchase without her approval. I worked full days while she sat and took money from my account into her private account as she watched television. She made me put mint oil on my crotch when I told her I was reading an email but was really playing a game on my phone as ""punishment"" for not watching her get ready. 

She made me get rid of my dog and didn't let me see my family other than maybe once or twice a year. She made me lie and tell them all I was homeless to get money even though I was well off to fund her trips to Louisiana, New York, Spain, etc. Every day my appearance was scrutinized until I acted and looked almost exactly how she wanted. She turned most of my friends against me with lies and half truths.

Everyday I struggle to just get to the next day. I don't sleep. I can't work more than a few hours a day. Constant flashbacks keep me trapped in my head. Depression and anxiety make things like answering the phone near impossible and medication has not helped because the memories don't disappear. Every day I try to be something but deep down I know I am not living up to the expectations I have about myself which causes further stress."

Does anyone else use medical cannabis to help with symptoms?,140,iavcmb,75,"I have my medical marijuana card in my state and I was wondering if anyone else uses cannabis to help with their symptoms? 

If so, do you use a specific kind (sativa, indica, hybrid)? 

Does that stuff even matter? 

What’s your preferred method? Smoking? Edibles? Topicals? 

How has it worked for you? 

Just want to hear what other people’s experiences are if they’ve tried this- thanks everyone!"
"All this ""I can't breathe"" stuff (masks and otherwise) is triggering my PTSD",138,ho47mx,27,"I've seen many people say stuff like ""I can't breathe"" about masks. Some even compare it to George Floyd's death. It triggers my PTSD and I can't stand it.

I can't even watch the video George Floyd because it'll give me flashbacks. My abuser used to pin me down and sit on me when he thought I was too ""out of hand"" (I wasn't, I was usually just upset when he did this). He wouldn't get off until I calmed down, despite me telling him I would call down if he just got off of me.

I have autism and sensory processing, so it was only harmful to me. I can't even describe it. I won't go into detail, but it was horrible.

He ignored my pleas every time. He refused to listen when I said it only hurts me. I remember that I've even said ""I can't breathe"" and he didn't listen.

I can still recall his weight on me. How I felt like I couldn't breathe. How I begged for him to get off of me, but he wouldn't listen. How he would then play the victim because of the marks I left when I reacted to what was practically torture for me. How one time my mom was begging for him to get off of me, which he ignored. I remember all of it.

EDIT: I'm sorry for not responding to the comments, it feels a little overwhelming to do so. I am reading the comments and I appreciate everyone's input. Thank you"
do continuous noises help you?,140,g42r3d,51,"for example, i sleep with an AC on all night and the constant hum makes loud bangs/unexpected noises a lot more tolerable, is anyone else in the same boat?"
Did/does anyone feel horrified by decisions made when in a PTSD fog?,142,f5b2wu,37,"In therapy, I just want to see if anyone else feels this way.

Without going into too much detail. Multiple people and events in my life left me believing that only one thing made me worth anything. It led me to do things that I didn’t want to do. Now that I’m healing, I am struggling with these decisions. We are talking about anything illegal, just poor life decisions that makes life impossibly difficult now."
Why are ex-gang members and people who have been involved in that lifestyle for the most part shunned by society when they wish to seek help for trauma?,144,cezaln,24,"Its difficult for me to even say this, but I feel it to be very true. I lived in that world for many years. Lost ""brothers"" to violence, constant worry and fear that you will be next, things of that nature. Much of which begins at a fairly early age. 15 years old for myself. It often times feels as though society as a whole does not give a damn about those of us who survive to be productive adults. Which leads many to go undiagnosed, and afraid to seek help. At 35 years old, I have been fortunate enough to reach out to deal with the many traumatic events that have plaqued my mind for years. Just yesterday learning a name for what I have been experiencing since I left all that behind at 29 years of age. While it feels good to know a name for this...""hypervigilance"". I think in todays day and age people who have walked similar paths should not be ashamed to ask for help, and also be accepted in a sense. We know the things in are past are wrong and immoral. Many of us have payed for our sins in more ways than one would think. Just a rant and I appologise to anyone I have offended. Thank you."
Something I’ve found helps when grounding can’t bring you back.,142,c5lywd,9,"So my flashbacks tend to be very hard to come back to reality from. Sometimes I’m stuck in that moment and no matter how many times I say i’m not there, I’m in the present, 5 senses, all that; I still can feel stuck there. 

One thing I started to do is like, focus on something OTHER than the event but it’s still in that flashback time. 

So for example, my flashbacks are related to a sexual assault. Rather than focusing on the action itself, I try to remember what the stairs looked like. We were in a basement when it happened, so I try to picture the stairs and then maybe the walls. 

Another time, I tried to remember what was on the tv, or make up something to be on the tv. 

So maybe you’re stuck in the moment, but it’s a little more bearable if you’re not stuck on the action itself."
"Been a long time coming, but I finally did it!",137,bn2szm,13,"Well it cost me over $15,000,  hundreds of therapy hours, a wrong diagnosis, multiple years of effort, and an intense dedication towards becoming a better version of myself..but today I was told by my psychiatrist that it’s time for me to try to manage my life on my own, unaided by mood stabilizers. I’m thrilled, I’m terrified, but most of all I’m proud of myself for fighting so hard to be healthy."
I'm tired of everyone understanding everyone's perspective except mine.,140,i20d4g,24,"Literally this. Everyone always seems to think I am completely insane with the things I say or think. My partner , my friends and my family. The only place I get a peace of mind is at my group therapy or with my psychiatrist. Is this what it is going to be like? That only professionals and other people with severe PTSD can understand me? I feel so extremely rejected by all the others. Sometimes I think it is better to be alone aside from my therapists and group therapy members. It's kind of hard to explain what I feel aside from this stabbing feeling of rejection from simply not being understood by the people that you love. Is this recognizable? I'd like to feel less rejected and alone."
Anyone else feel like they have been abused everywhere they’ve gone/by every person they have ever met in life?,139,f1wwhv,34,"I kind of realized this today. Abused at home and school as a kid, abused at high school, abused in college, abused at my first, second, and pretty much every subsequent job including my current one, abused in my current living situation, and also a ton of random instances at events and other public spaces throughout my life. I actually started getting down to thinking about each individual friend, family member, neighbor, or close coworker I’ve ever had and they’ve all done bad things to me. I’ve forgiven almost all of them, but it still happened even if I’m over it now.

I know this sounds like a massive victim complex but I promise it’s not. My therapist says I’m one of the unluckiest people she’s ever met, sometimes life is just like that. Positive thinking helps me a lot. I don’t let this stuff get me down. I got punched twice in the last 24 hours (separate places and people) and still think it was a pretty good day. 

But damn, I’ve never met a single non-toxic person in my entire life, that sucks."
whenever i am in a public i always think i see the person who caused the trauma but its not them,139,d5katw,20,Whenever i go out and walk past someone not even similar in appearance my mind will ask is it them and then panic will arise and even though it isn't them my brain will play tricks on me asking over and over again. I dont know  what to do cause every time im in public the same problem will arise to the  where it can be unbearable. Any advice would be appreciated thank you
Friend thinks PTSD is a choice,141,hpsmv1,88,"Hi everyone! I do not mean to be rude in any way, more asking for help. I have a close friend whom I've known for a while. Recently we got into an argument and he said that we are in control of how we react to events and that basically having PTSD is a choice. Meaning the person had an opportunity not to get it if they are not strong enough. I think it's a complete bs obviously but since i dont have a degree in psychology or experience with it, i wanted to write here for support. Thank you!"
Witnessed my girlfriend having a PTSD episode for the first time,138,glwwd3,25,"Using a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

So I've been dating this girl for about two months, and I love everything about her. As cliche' as this sounds, she's been the greatest thing to ever happen in my life and I wouldn't trade her for anything. We're college aged lovebirds enjoying every moment together.

I've been staying at her place for about a week and tonight was the first time I've witnessed her PTSD episode come to fruition. Now, I already know about her condition and that she's had flashbacks and episodes before. This all stemmed from growing up with a mother who had multiple personality disorder to where during her mother's bad days she was abused heavily to the point of trauma. As of recent, my GF's episodes have been far less frequent and a lot better, and I personally have never seen it happen. 

Until tonight.

Earlier in the day, she mentioned about having hallucinations and seeing the wall turn from white to purple wavy colors. She mentioned it was really nothing and not bad at all. I put it in the back of my mind and paid no further heed, as the rest of the day was very much a happy one, albeit I did notice her seemingly tired a bit more. 

Tonight, we were laying in bed and after some merrymaking we were chilling and resting in silence. However, soon I started noticing tears form. She claimed it was nothing, but I knew better. I hugged her and held her close, then she started balling in my shoulder. As I have no experience, I did what I best thought I could do: I kept telling her everything is alright, I'm here, and I'll protect and be with her always no matter what, hugging her as tight as I could.

She continued for about thirty minutes in my arms, then seemed to have calmed down. She was less audible but she said she felt better. I turned on all the lights and currently have some of her favorite songs playing and get her comfortable enough to get some good sleep. 

I haven't had a deep conversation concerning the specifics of how her episodes manifest, what they're like, and how best to deal with them due to not wanting to instigate a possible episode. I've entered in this relationship knowing full well about her condition and I still love her anyways and want to be there even more and help her the best way possible. She's been seeing a therapist near our college since last year, until COVID-19 happened and we moved back to our respective homes from college. She said she dissociated a lot in the past and she's had a mental breakdown episode that lasted for two weeks last year that prompted her to start therapy. 

Anyhow, as someone who can say they don't have much experience with PTSD, how can I best help her as her boyfriend? As of now, I cannot physically be with her 24/7, so I'd love to know tips for long distance help as well. Just anything in general to help her through this condition and help her be as happy and feel as safe as possible."
To whoever needs to hear this right now:,139,gfjx1x,10,"You do not need to be ashamed of why you have PTSD. You’re not weak because “it could’ve been so much worse”, or “this same thing happened to so-and-so and THEY weren’t traumatized...” Your feelings are valid. Your reactions are valid.

Edit: I’m so glad this had such a good impact. All of you are amazing. 💕"
Being triggered by our President.,137,dc1r8s,135,"This sounds stupid I know, but I’ll try to explain.  I had to deal with a lot of gaslighting growing up.  It made me question myself my whole life and made me feel like I didn’t exist.  Trying to get help is a nightmare when your abuser is able to hide and deny that anything ever happened.  I was denied healthcare and food throughout my childhood.

I can’t believe I’m watching the country being run by abusive people that commit crimes and lie about it.  And the other party seems almost complacent by not arresting or fining those who are in contempt.

I feel like I’m living with my childhood abuser, and my guardian is turning a blind eye.  

Does anyone else feel this way??  Somebody please tell me I’m not the only one.  I feel like I’m losing my mind, obsessively reading the news every day on the chance that I might see some justice.  It makes me ill and I can’t stop obsessing over it.  I feel so stupid, but that’s what this illness is doing to me.   How do I stop? It’s almost all I think about anymore.   I can’t handle that my abuser got away with everything and I’m watching it happen all over again.   It’s a nightmare.


Edit:  Thank you all for your kind words and support!   Talking about this made me feel so much better because of y’all.    I’m going to try and block news sources and as one of you suggested watching Steven Colbert more lol.  I also love John Oliver! 


I can’t thank you enough for making me feel less crazy.   I feel like when I bring it up in real life, nobody really cares and they’re just like “yeah it sucks, oh well”.   But to many of us it’s seriously traumatizing and I’m forever grateful for your support."
I died that night.,136,d5pv1o,33,"I did. It doesn't matter that I physically 'survived'. **I** died that night. Something irreplaceable was stolen from me, some part of the core of my being, something I'll never have back for as long as I live. 

Not long after that night, I remember saying something like.... it was like my life was a movie that had come to an end, or was supposed to come to an end, but the credits kept rolling, and rolling, long after the screen was meant to go dark, and for it all to finally be Over. It should have been Over that day. It WAS over that day. 

But I'm still here. like a ghost......."
Sometimes I find myself afraid to go to sleep because of nightmares,137,d0g6aq,56,Does anyone else experience this?
Not being acknowledged sucks,137,curubo,59,"Yesterday I opened up towards my best friends boyfriend about my PTSD. He asked how I was doing and I felt comfortable to talk about my new diagnosis. 

But he completely wrote it off. Told me that he thought only veterans could have PTSD. Then when I explained to him that it’s just, you know, something that might happen when you got through trauma. He told me that it couldn’t be that bad then, and my PTSD would probably be a light version. 

Thing is, he knows about my trauma, I told him so much about it before. So it kind of stings when he tells me that I am not valid enough."
Anyone ever just wake up depressed for no reason?,141,ba4vq6,31,"This happens to me a lot and I always talk out my issues to my boyfriend whenever I start feeling like this. But there’s a lot of times where I just wake up depressed and I don’t really know what’s wrong. Like today for example, I had a bad dream which isn’t uncommon for me but when I first woke up I felt fine. Then within 15-20 minutes I just became sad. Don’t know if this is common for ptsd or maybe I’m just a bumbling idiot and I don’t know what I’m talking about. Just sick of waking up in this state and not knowing what to do because I don’t know the cause "

Guys! I did it! I graduated!!,136,8kfbcm,44,"I come here a lot to vent or ask for advice and you all are always so wonderful. <3 But today I'm here with good news!! 

I graduated college yesterday! 

I have PTSD from severe child abuse. My father, my abuser, works 5 minutes from my school and 10 minutes from the graduation location. Everyone said I'd never step foot on campus because he was so close and because it's huge. Not only did I step foot on that campus, but I GRADUATED!

One of the last things he said to me in court was that I'd never go anywhere in life because he ruined me. The judge said I was a bright little girl and I'd make an excellent attorney one day. 

Guys, I DID IT! (Kinda. I'm a paralegal! And I got my notary acceptance letter!) I don't know if law school is in my future or not, but I'm still so proud of myself. "
It's just hit me how young I was during my trauma,140,mgc7dw,18,"Today is my nephew's 12th birthday. I was watching him play with his 10 year old brother and suddenly it hit me like a ton of bricks that I was even younger than them when I was groomed by a paedophile.

They seemed so young and innocent playing together, it shocks and sickens me how someone could even think about taking that away from a 9yr old. I loved High School Musical. My room was pink everywhere- the walls, carpet, my bed etc. I doted on my Siamese cat, Lola. I loved my two pet rats but was allergic to them. I used to excitedly wait for my dad to get home from work so I could play on the PS3 with him. I would go for walks with my nan on the weekends along the beach, and run off and twirl towards the sea to feel free. 

Then that October I met someone on MSN who I thought was 13... and it escalated from there. My innocence was ripped away from me. From then on, all I knew was fear. Anxiety. Crying. My mum couldn't figure out what was wrong with me. I kept it secret for all these years, terrified whenever the phone or doorbell rang that it was him coming to get me. To tell all my family how disgusting I am. 

It's never hit me how young I was before. This is the first time my brain has actually allowed me to think about all of this."
"My trauma story. I swear it's true, I can't make this up. There is HOPE!",138,ma15j7,41,"Cliff notes of my life:

My dad murdered my mom when I was 1 years old, which sent me to foster care then to an emotionally abusive grandmother. 18 years of horrible bullying by my peers because I had a cleft lip and palate.

I fixed all of that only to have a child who inherited an extreme expression of my genetic abnormality that caused my cleft. She had tetrology of fallot (a serious heart abnormality) and other issues. I won custody and worked very hard to get her to a point to attempt a repair of her heart. In 2007 She was 3 and I made the decision and took her for surgery. 4 surgeries and 10 days later I was forced to make another decision. I scheduled the time to end life support and had to watch. Was the final straw.

11 years of alcoholism later (July 5, 2018) I drowned while intoxicated in front of my healthy 3 year old and 10 year old. 10 minutes underwater, 3 days in coma and thought to be brain dead, I woke up.

Took me 1 more year to get completely sober. Sober since June 2019 and I have also conquered my PTSD. There is HOPE. Do not give up and please get help. It is work and initially very hard, but the alternatives can be horrible for you and your loved ones."

DAE feel scared of sleeping/trying to fall asleep?,138,l81t12,41,"My intrusive memories and flashbacks have been coming up fast and furious and it's always the worst when I'm lying in bed in the quiet dark with nothing to distract me while I wait to fall asleep. I've tried increasing doses of xanax throughout the day and one larger one at night, and now switching to ambien but nothing short of actual tranquilizer shots while I was inpatient has worked to knock me out so I won't have a panic attack just from trying to get some sleep. I'm so tired. Tired of the panic attacks. of the wanting to sleep but actually being afraid to close my eyes and try. the constant fear of being triggered throughout the day. the never ending fight to not give in to my eating disorder and self harm urges to cope. I just got discharged from the psych ward today and I already feel like a mess. I'm so exhausted I don't know how to do this anymore. I told my psychiatrist I probably won't kill myself anytime soon cos I'm diving right back into work after this weekend, and being the people pleaser that I am, I won't leave for good until I fulfil all my responsibilities. Don't want to burden anyone with my unfinished work upon my sudden departure, amirite? But now I'm not so sure I can hold out that long. I just can't imagine living like this. I'm going to hang on at least until I see my therapist on Monday morning. But beyond that, does anyone have any advice? I'm willing to try anything at this point."
I finally said goodbye to my abuser.,139,jh990b,15,"The only thing I had tied to him since I escaped over a year ago was a mobile phone plan in my name that he made me get for him when we were together because he couldn't get one due to bad credit. 
He fell behind on his bills for a few months and I was done begging for him to pay it and letting him have this control over me.

I disconnected the service, messaged him to tell him to find a new plan, told him to never contact me again and blocked his number. 

I feel so free. I'm so thankful my therapist gave me the confidence and strength to finally walk away. Now I can truly heal."
I had a dissociative episode + panic attack and now my friends won’t speak to me.,141,iu22a9,37,"I guess this is mostly to vent but advice on how to talk to my friend and explain what happened is definitely welcomed.

I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD because of sexual assault and I have night terrors most nights still. I usually wake up in a sweat and while I feel crappy physically, that’s usually just it.

This time was way different. I visited some friends and spent the night at their home. I fell asleep much earlier than everyone else on the air mattress in the living room where everyone was just chatting. I “remember” my friends trying to sexually assault me and I ran, thinking I was escaping with my life (I punched my boyfriend while running out of the house - I do not remember doing this.) 

I said very mean things to my friends when they were trying to get me to come back inside (because I thought they were trying to harm me, not help me) and now my very close friend has kicked me out of her wedding and will not speak to me (though she did originally say she “supports me getting better.”)

After speaking to my psychiatrist and therapist, it seems the people being in the room and all blended with my night terror and when I woke in a panic, it triggered a panic attack that lasted about an hour (and ended with me in the ER.)

I’m scared that this will happen again. I’m scared because I’ve basically been told there’s no way I can work to prevent this. My psychiatrist said I just need to have friends that understand this may happen but I’ve lost my friends because of this...Is that really the only thing I can do?

I want to be invited back into the wedding and I want our friendship back. I hate that I have gotten so mentally sick that I’m ruining friendships now."
Does anyone else have worse symptoms at night?,138,hb9x2k,28,"I have worse intrusive thoughts, and everything else at night. I need to have a loud fan blowing in my face or I can’t sleep, and if I try to sit still and just relax, I’ll start dissociating. The only time I can truly relax in the dark without a loud tv or fan on, is when I’m on drugs. 

Is this the case for anyone else?"
Does anyone's PTSD get triggered by movies/television?,139,gnpm4f,88,There's a series in particular which no matter how I approach it or try to see it in a new light just triggers me.  After doing some soul searching and self reflection I feel it's because something in the story triggers a memory of an event in my life which to this day has had a profound impact on and which I've tried to move on from with varying degrees of success.  I've just wondered if anyone else experienced this.
My body is mine.,139,g747ye,15,"My body is mine.

I'm tired of being exhusted,138,l9akac,24,"I'm so tired. Why does it all have to be so heavy PLUS everything else in life? I'm tired of everything I do, all the choices I make being for my mental wellbeing and stability and even then, something else gets set off.   


Im tired of having so many complex and tightly infused issues that coping mechanisms and support HAVE to be tailored to work for all of them, and when theres 5+ traumas PLUS neurodivergency + PMDD; but I'M being difficult if I dont accept to try or instantly rebuff unsolicited advice.

I have to know the difference between my 'traditional' depression, PMDD depression, mental understimulation depression, and PTSD depression because they all have different results and need different support. I'm tired of doing that allthe fucking time, waking up every day and checking in with 'how bad is it today' and being genuinely shocked when its 'wow i feel well rested!'

Does anyone else have a very hard time leaving their house?,134,be8tgh,22,"I've been recently diagnosed with PTSD, but I've been dealing with this for almost a decade. Ever since something very traumatic happened to me, I rarely leave my house. I'm afraid to and I feel much happier and more comfortable at home. 

It seems like no matter how many times I leave my house, it just doesn't get any easier. All of the therapists I've been to have told me to go somewhere everyday, but it doesn't seem to work. I've been diagnosed with agoraphobia and it seems like facing my fears should help, but it doesn't. The therapist that I'm currently seeing doesn't seem to be focusing so much on me going somewhere everyday, but rather on dealing with the trauma. Do I have to deal with the trauma first in order to be able to go places?

Does anyone else have a hard time leaving their house? How do you deal with it?"

Would You Take a Pill that Wiped Away Fear-Based Memories?,134,eoubyp,47,">People with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) tend to have elevated levels of a biomarker called glucocorticoid receptor–FKBP51 protein complex. Fear-conditioned mice also have higher levels of the GR-FKBP51 protein complex.

>A new study of mice with PTSD-like symptoms suggests that using another peptide (TAT-GRpep) to disrupt the GR-FKBP51 protein complex blocks the encoding and recall of fear-based memories and prevents fight, flight, or freeze responses.

At this stage, studies on targeting the GR-FKBP51 complex to treat or prevent PTSD are still in their early infancy.

Saw dad die,133,gjacfe,27,"Hi,

I think me and my mum both have trauma from an event about a month ago. My dad got covid 19, he went to bed one night with a flu and the following morning he deteriorated very quickly, I was awake with my mum watching over him and he stopped breathing, I pulled him into the floor off the bed as instructed by the emergency responder to begin CPR and he passed away literally in my arms. My mum was screaming, I continued the CPR until the paramedics came and they couldn’t save him. 

Since then during the days I’m ok, I’ve made good progress with the grieving and I’m helping my mum but at night I just can’t stop thinking about that night, the noises, the images they just replay in my head constantly and it’s often difficult to sleep. I’m 23 years old, I don’t know much about trauma / PTSD but I’m assuming this is similar. 

Please if anyone has advice it would be greatly appreciated, I really want to remember the good times with my dad but those memories are blocked behind this repeating nightmare

"My landlord tried to sexually assault me and you know what, I’ve never ever been that scared.",133,ftjwj6,18,"Long story short my landlord decided he could turn me straight and when I turned him down he went ape shit and started threatening my roommate.

We where babysitting 2 young girls (nieces) and I was hiding them in the spare room and all I had was a fucking knife to defend myself, I was scared shitless and didn’t know what to do.

And do you know what I had to think about, the fact that these 2 girls have the chance to see me be raped, I knew that if this horrible excuse of a man got into the house I was his target and so I had decided on this.

If he got in I would shove the girls in the closet and get them to cover there ears and scream, scream as loud as possible so they wouldn’t hear me and I would willingly give myself to him to protect the girls, ANYTHING to protect those girls.

I’ve NEVER even thought that I would ever think something like this would happen but here we are.

I’m now sitting here a few weeks after the incident thinking about how This man almost ruined 4 lives in one night.

I’m so glad my roommate was able to defuse the situation and we have now moved on as best we can"

"Does anyone else find being in nature profoundly calming, healing and refreshing?",133,9m6gbq,21,"I've been curious if anyone else has experienced this, and I would like to get feedback from not just nature lovers but those who aren't so bothered about nature either. So also If you aren't really a nature lover, if you have been in places like forests/woodlands or very wild/natural picturesque areas, have you nevertheless found any kind of healing or extreme calm simply by being in that environment? I tend to feel this strongly myself, though I know that I am a nature lover, so I'm curious if its just simply connected with my love of nature or whether it could be a universally healing thing independent of being a nature lover or not.

I suppose that because I have a lot of social anxiety, the remote nature of a lot of wild/nature environments give me a strong sense of peace and calm eventhough it is still ""outside"" and ""public"", and its very refreshing, like a reset button in some ways. I'm definitely not a ""new age"" type hippy person but I find it profoundly uplifting and calming. I know that some people have investigated what some have termed forest therapy or forest bathing. It would be very interesting if one day someone does more in depth and comprehensive research and study into this.

People refusing to take responsibility for causing trauma,133,il02rm,12,"I think someone refusing to even acknowledge that they caused you years of fucking grief, years of pain, years of feeling dead inside, years of panic... I think that’s more infuriating than having c/ptsd itself. 

My mom is a paranoid schizophrenic and emotionally and physically abused and neglected me and my brother and outright refuses to believe she was anything but a good mom. She’s literally said to me that she was a great mom and that /I/, the literal child, abused HER. When I reminded her how she threatened to kill me in my sleep and how she told my little brother she was gonna smash his head into the wall because he was being loud, she told me I was lying and that I made it all up. 

My foster parents gaslit me and my brother too, and they still stand by that they were the victims somehow even though CPS determined them to be neglectful too and took my brother out of their home (I’d already aged out). 

I had a situation happen to me earlier this year where I started dating a guy who seemed completely perfect for me, who wanted to be in a relationship, who was communicating and open and I’d let my defenses down and been emotionally vulnerable with him, let him be more affectionate with me than I’ve ever let anyone be... just to find out he had another girl he was seeing long term (4 years) and just never committed to her, but he was talking about adopting her kids, talking about marrying her, he even spent Valentine’s Day with the both of us..... and I didn’t even hear the news from him. SHE texted me at random and he denied it up and down but then kicked me to the curb with no explanation. She said really vicious, horrible things to me that triggered me for literal months. Now they’re in a relationship and apparently a happy one. I know it’s not healthy but I keep checking her stupid Facebook page. They’ve gotten a puppy, bunnies, she checks in when they go on dates and they go on dates all the time. I was just completely discarded, with no explanation, and now I have to watch how he chose this other chick who’s even an anti-masker and anti-vaxxer instead of me . 

I messaged him a few months ago and told him how much what he did to me made me spiral down and how much trauma it caused for me. And he somehow doesn’t think he did anything to hurt me. He acts like he did absolutely nothing and like I’m being crazy or something for being so distraught to find out that someone I got so vulnerable with just ripped the rug out from underneath me and was lying and manipulating me the entire time I was with them. I’ve never, ever in my life been triggered into trauma episodes every day for months before this happened. And he won’t even acknowledge that what he did was wrong. He won’t even acknowledge that he did what he did at all!! 

I’m so infuriated by these manipulative ass abusive people who traumatize us and then don’t even give us the sliver of respect to admit that they did."

Crazy neighbour doesn't beleive me about my child!!! TRIGGER WARNING!!!,131,gcn5e0,44," 

**backstory: so, i was r\*p\*d when i was 13 by my step-dad, i got pregnant and i chose to keep the baby. i moved in with my girlfriend and her parents. I am now 16 and my son Logan is now 19 months. It was not my choice to have him, but it was my choice to keep him. and he is the best thing that has ever happened to me.**

**story: My girlfriend's parents (who I live with) moved into a house which is two 4 bedroom houses connected together by a small door downstairs. Me and my girlfriend live together in one of the houses, and her parents live in the other. in our house we each have our own bedrooms, but tend to sleep in the same room, with Logan. he has his room which is more of a playroom at the moment because he still sleeps in a cot in our room. my gf takes pride in the fact that she always keeps the house clean and loves to clean. also, we still technically live with her parents.**

**we have regular social services visits to make sure that we are all OK because we are so young, she is 16 as well. our neighbours (not her parents but the ones next to us on our side) are entitled parents. and this week came to our house about 10 minutes before a social service visit. they started screaming at us for having a child so young. i have extreme social anxiety and ptsd from when i got pregnant with him. I don't tell anyone that i don't trust completely about his father. so our neighbours don't know about the circumstances about him.**

**on this particular day she sees me and my gf playing with our son in the garden. he is only wearing his underwear because it is a hot day and he is in the pool. and he has plenty of sun-cream on. she comes knocking on my gfs parents door. her parents tell her that we live next-door not with them. she comes and knocks on our door and is shouting about how we shouldn't be living on our own, and we should have a responsible adult in the house. she then starts shouting about how we probably abuse Logan. she then asks how old i am and i tell her i'm 16, she slaps me and tells me that i am way too young to have a child and that i'm lying to her about him being my son. i tell her that he is my son and i was just young when i had him. she slaps me again and calls the police telling them that I've kidnapped a child. i start having a flashback because it was a very triggering situation. she then starts saying that our house is a mess. my gf was so angry but at this point is focusing on my more than the woman. then she sees my son and accuses us of sexually abusing him because he is only wearing his underwear! this is too much for me and i pass out because that can happen in ptsd. once I had come around and calmed down the woman started telling me i was overreacting. so i just turned around and told her the truth ""I WAS RAPED, I DIDN'T WANT HIM TO DO IT! IT WASN'T MY FAULT"" remember i'm 16 so this was a pretty scary situation for me in this moment. the crazy neighbour looks horrified and starts calling me all sorts of racial and religious slurred. ( which doesn't make sense because i am white french living in England!) also, i am still in my wheelchair because i was using it in the garden, so she kicks my wheelchair and breaks it!**

**i turn around and the social worker had seen it all. the social worker explained to them woman that i was a teen parent, and then the police arrested the crazy neighbour! social services took her kids off of her during the trial! i pressed chargers and she was fined. she did get her kids back but she never bothered us again after that. all is going well now and social services were very happy about how we handled the situation!**"

I finally figured out how my PTSD displays in my every day life and that I am NOT asymptomatic.,133,f4ujte,12,"So, recently I’ve been trying to work things out with my ex and he’s been pretty nasty to me at times and at one point he called me a sociopath because I still wanted to talk to him even though he told me I was disgusting and a whore and this and that. And after having abusive exes and an abusive mom and shit like that, my PTSD allows me to completely disassociate when people abuse me. I disassociate and compartmentalize without even realizing it. And it’s like I do this shit with my mom because I love her and I do it with him because I love him and I just have this understanding that if I love them and want them in my life I have to take the abuse for a little while. But, wow. It was an interesting realization."
My dad is using my dead grandfather to guilt me into being polite to my violently sexually abusive brother over Christmas.,131,dzm8tq,54,"My dad called me the other day to tell me some news, my molester brother was coming to Christmas with his partner and my Dad was wondering if I would be able to handle it ‘without making a scene’. ‘Everyone will be there including (sisters boyfriend)’. ‘It would mean a lot to mom to have all of her children under one roof.’ He continued, \*\*’before grandpa died he said, “all I want is peace in the family”, and that’s what I want.\*\*

My brother used violence to coerce me to commit sexual acts on him from the time i was 5-14 and he was 11-20. When I told my school guidance councillor she was mandated to report it and an investigation was initiated. On the morning of my first interview with the police my dad took me to breakfast at my favour restaurant in our small town, where he said, “you can either put your brother in jail, or you can keep the family together.” I lied to the police, told them I didn’t want to talk about it. The investigation went away. My parents never punished Nick, when the investigation was over they let him pick any city in the US and they would help him move there. He picked NYC. That was 11 years ago.

Ive kept my silence to keep the family together. My parents keep reminding me in our bi/trimonthly family fights that ‘there was nothing we could do.’ and \*\*‘there will be no more family if you keep up with this.’\*\*

My brother is always playing the saint and they just fawn over how success and accomplished he is. He’s seen as the darling helper who could do no wrong.

Whenever I try to talk to my family about what he did they tell me, ‘Tell your therapist that, not us.’

In my Mom and I’s most recent fights, she let out a tirade of ‘why didn’t you tell me it was happening? why didn’t you tell me one time?’ And then followed that up with, ‘When I was a little girl I prayed to God that I would have kids, but now after all of this I wish I Never was a Mom.’

I have been trying to go NC with my brother but my family doesn’t seem to respect that. I often get texts from him in the family group text saying overly positive shit like nothings up. He’s coming to Christmas, and my parents wanted me to go on a trip with everyone else including him and his girlfriend where I would be expected to ‘Not make a scene.’

I need some sort of grounding because I’ve been keeping quiet with this hell of family and rape for 21 years, first so my brother wouldent get in trouble, and secondly so my parents wouldent look bad to their family and friends.

The biggest hypocrisy of this is that I was sexually abused as a child by another perpetrator. A older man who abused me for 2 years concurrently with the time I was being abused at home. I told my mom what had happened, he then was charged and convicted and sentenced to jail. I had my parents full support then. I told my parents about this man abusing me in particular first so they would know how to handle my brother. Turns out they didn’t. I am still glad I told them in that order, because if I had told them about my brother and then the older man they would have covered up both, and I likely would have killed myself from the stress that I otherwise barely survived.

Edit: Thank you everyone for your support."
Stop touching me.,132,jqst5c,45,"(T.W: Self harm and impulsive actions)

Why can’t people get that idea through their thick skulls. I don’t like being touched how many times have I said that. It’s my body and it shouldn’t be seen as disrespectful to say that I don’t want to be touched. Why are they so fussy over it? They need to do something better with their lives. 

Stop touching me, the few people who can touch me know who they are very well. It’s my right to say I don’t want to be touched. Then you panic when I rip my hair out and bang my head. Stop touching me I don’t care if she’s my aunt I don’t want to be touched. I have a right to feel intimidated so stop and respect my boundaries. But oh heavens if I cross their lines, god forbid! I don’t cross yours you don’t cross mine, why is that so hard to understand? 


Just stop touching me for the love of god, I don’t even like it when you look at me so why would you go out of your way to touch me? To make me feel so filthy from the inside out. It’s my right, if I want to rip every last strand of my hair out that’s my choice. It’s the one thing you can’t stop. Stop looking at me stop touching me that’s all I ask."

I hate Christmas,133,eb57vl,16,"I will try and keep this short. I (30yof f) hate Christmas with a passion. When I was 12yo my alcoholic mother and step dad arrived home with my 4yo brother at 1am on Christmas day. I put him to bed and they were so drunk the inevitable fight broke out. I was in the living room wrapping my brothers presents because they hadn't bothered. 3 times I went into the kitchen to tell them to stop. The 4th time I walked in just before she picked up the knife and stabbed him. Punched his lung. I screamed and she followed me out of the room. A few mins later he was calling her back in. Our massive kitchen was covered in blood and she rushed him to the hospital. I didn't want my brother to wake up and see it so I cleaned it up. I was covered in blood. I hid the clothes, showered and waited. 
She came home and spent the next few hours telling me I would have to raise my brother because she was going to jail for murder. They lied to the police and made me lie to everyone in the family. I found out years later that they were aloud to tell people about it but me being a stupid kid never did. 
I have other mental health issues and this time of year brings it all back. The nightmares start in September when the Christmas crap starts appearing. I wish I could hide from the whole season. I don't know why I'm venting hear I just feel like shit!

How a PTSD attack works,128,egqmr5,21,"This is an educational post for those that think anxiety and trauma is cute and romanticize it. Read with care. 
TW: MENTIONS OF TRAUMA AND ABUSE

I’ve been sexually assaulted and psychologically abused by my parents. I’m triggered by sexual abuse (or mentions of it), mentions of trauma, people raising their voices at me, when people pretend to throw things at me or harm me, and loud noises (such as doors slamming, crowds, screaming and yelling). 

When I have an attack I hide myself in a ball and I cry with my hands in my ears to protect myself from the noise. If someone tries to touch me during an attack I scream and I harm people unintentionally. I shake, I go pale, my heart races, my memories go back, the flashbacks go even stronger, my paranoia goes insane, and I can’t move at all. 

It’s not cool. I’m not “cute UwU so anxious”. My social interactions are affected by this. I’m scared to get out of my house alone. I’m extremely paranoid and I always walk around with a weapon or something to defend myself. My life is hard. Don’t make it seem cute. I suffer."
Why do people think its even remotely okay to to touch people,128,b7cknt,29,"I have really really bad touch based trauma and i have horrible panic attacks from being touched, and today during a saturday session for math one of the proctors touched me and announced no one can use phones <even though he didnt mention this at the start> and i told him ""dont touch me"" and he just laughed it off like it wasnt a big deal and i had to leave the room to try to calm down and i literally couldnt go back to that section of the session because of how stressful it was for me. 

I cant understand why people cant just use their words, i didnt have headphones in so he could have just said ""hey please dont use phones during this session"" and i would have been fine, but for some reason he decided it would be a good idea to touch me, specifically my back, which is the worst trigger area for me.

Obviously, there were many people involved in this situation, but there was one man that was mostly in charge. I got news a couple of weeks ago that he died in prison. Everyone in my life feels like I should be happy or relieved about that, but I'm not happy at all. It's really.... painful. I feel like I'm in mourning over his death. 

I keep having dreams about all of the ""nice"" things he did for me. Handing me a glass of water. Allowing me to sit on the couch after a particularly violent encounter. Giving me a blanket to sleep with when I was really sick. I can't stop. I literally catch my brain thinking that this dude loved me and I'm really sad that I'll never be able to see him again. Which is probably the most fucked up thing I've ever thought in my life. Seriously. This man killed my daughter and essentially ruined my life, but my brain is somehow trying to convince me that he loved me???? It makes me nauseous that I could even think that, but somehow it creeps back in. 

I've told a couple people in my life about these feelings and everyone is like ""dude, that's fucked up. How??"". I don't know how?!? I'm crazy. I don't know.

Please ask a mental health professional these questIons. This community cannot diagnose you and frankly, it's disrespectful to ask. 

You wouldn't ask a cancer patient if they think you have cancer; you'd ask a doctor.  The same goes for any other medical issue: if you think you have it, ask a professional. Don't self-diagnose. Don't ask people who are already fighting it to diagnose you. We can help on the back end with coping suggestions and techniques, but we cannot help diagnose you, and it would be irresponsible to try."
Family makes fun of my triggers,127,k78x89,15,"I grew up with an alcoholic and drug addicted father. He was never physically abusive towards me but I've had a lot of traumatic experiences of him high out of his mind,  driving drunk,  having a psychotic episode,  slamming things,  etc.

One of my triggers is when my family is heavily under the influence. If they're just tipsy it's fine but if they start acting delirious then I get really anxious. Anyway, last year my mom decided she wanted to try an edible (weed). My brother told her to eat a whole cookie. I was begging her to only take a piece of it (300mg cookie!!).

Anyways she took it and my brother went off to a party so I was home alone with my mom, who of course got insanely high. She was basically stoned on the couch speaking nonsense to herself and her mouth was so dry, her eyes were so red etc. In a certain way this image is funny, and that's how my mom and my brother see it.

But that day I was extremely triggered by the sight, and I cried for a long time. My mom and brother still tell the story of how I started crying because she ate an edible even though I explained to them its my ptsd. It's like they don't understand how real it is at all."
A lesson from someone who lost their battle to PTSD.,132,ion88q,24,"Hello. I was diagnosed officially I think a few months ago, probably actually had it for longer. My trauma stemmed from a relationship, but that’s not important. I took literally all the wrong routes on the road to recovery. I’m at the end of my road now. I’m fresh out of energy. Hurt. Hopeless. My only solace is since I screwed up an extreme amount, I can impart a lot of knowledge on to others. 

First, stay the fuck away from drugs. Especially the ones people tell you to , you know, stay away from. They’ll make you feel great, amazing. Then you’ll need them to function. Life without them will be so, so dull. It’s like having a heavy suitcase you never knew you was carrying taken away from you. Just... don’t. Please.

Second, never, ever RELY on one person. I did. Said they’d be there for me while I healed. Said they’d love me. Said they’d even help me get comfortable back on my campus. They ghosted around 4 days ago. A friend shown me their Tinder today. Of course, accept help. Love. Live life. But relying on someone like that, EXPECTING them to always be there, is a disaster. You need to be fully capable of being alone. I have no idea how to do this 

Third, keep trying meds. Switch therapists if it calls for it. Try, try, try. Misery is such an easy thing to get comfortable with. Keep moving. Always improve."
"Was diagnosed with PTSD as a teenager, never really took the diagnosis seriously until now as a young adult. Anyone else unable to remember the majority of their childhood?",129,hcf4dn,26,"I just, can’t remember it. I know it happened obviously, but I have very scattered memories just kinda sprinkled throughout ages. I remember practically nothing from up to around age 8. One really horrific memory from around 8 or 9. Then scattered blips of memories till around 16. And then  a couple more fully formed memories from 16-18, where I can distinctly remember how I felt and most of what happened. But still can’t remember the majority of all of it. I mostly remember things from age 19 to now, where I was out of the trauma itself and on my own. And a lot of it isn’t even remotely happy, but I remember pretty much all of it.

Is this normal or is it part of the ptsd? I didn’t even remember I was diagnosed with ptsd until around a month ago, when I realized what’s been happening to me is flashbacks. I wish the therapist I’d seen when I was little would have helped me with it, since now I feel like I’ve blocked everything out. 

The one memory I have from around age 8 was unearthed really suddenly during a therapy session last year. And even then the therapist I had had never mentioned that the episode I had in his office could have been ptsd."
does anyone else get overwhelmed/feel weird during sex scenes in movies?,125,gpi2p6,25,"cw: parental abuse implication, porn mention

i'm a 20 going on 21 year old man and i'm really embarrassed to admit this, but whenever there's a sex scene in a movie or even a really raunchy one (like in the lewd rom-coms, y'know? i can't explain it), i feel really... weird, like i want to crawl out of my skin. 

my parents like unwinding in the evenings with netflix and hulu, which is totally cool and natural-- but they always seem to gravitate to these kinds of movies. (both of them being sexual in front of me, my father in particular, is a separate issue that i won't get into here, mostly for the sake of brevity) my mom likes horror movies, and a lot of them have some pretty weird/fucked up sexual scenes. it's kind of a nightmare living in the same house as two people who always blare movies like this, if i'm being honest.

i also have a hard time watching porn because of this. this wasn't really a problem until earlier this year, and it doesn't really affect me as negatively as the stuff i mentioned in the previous paragraph, but i still thought it was worth mentioning.

something about watching people be sexual with each other just makes me feel gross all over.

edit: forgot to mention that i don't care about sex jokes or sexual lyrics in music, nor do i consider myself an asexual. it's just the visuals that i'm not a fan of."
"I have episodes where if someone touches me, even my SO, I have a mini panic attack. Can anyone relate?",128,enbnf0,38,"I haven’t been able to find much information about this online, so I’m reaching out to this community. I have sexual trauma from a couple years ago and it has been getting worse recently. 

One of the worst symptoms is that when my boyfriend touches me I just can’t handle it sometimes. It doesn’t even have to be in a sexual way - even if we’re just cuddling, I’ll suddenly become aware of his hands on me and I have this feeling that’s hard to describe. It’s an awful combination of disgust and anger. 

I can still feel it after he stops and moves away from me, and it makes me want to rip my skin off in that area. It makes me feel bad because he’s always respectful of my boundaries and I trust him completely, but these episodes still happen randomly. 

Sometimes they last for a full day after it happens, and it’s hard for me to even take a shower because being naked makes me uncomfortable. Even if it’s just me by myself. I have obsessive thoughts about the trauma that are so vivid I can almost feel it happening again. 

I feel really weird about it, and the fact that I haven’t been able to find anything online makes me feel worse. Can anyone relate? Thanks."
I'm not sure I know who I am without the trauma.,130,e1gmxl,8,"I spent 10 years locked in a violently abusive situation. (From 12-22(ish) and I'm just now starting to deal with it. Unfortunately, dealing with it is like pulling out a giant, festering splinter and it feels like I'm taking 15 steps backwards instead of making progress. I'm getting flashbacks of shit I didnt even know I remembered, I wake up and feel every single wound inflicted upon me during that decade all at once. It's taken up such a huge chunk of my life (I'm 25 now) that I feel like I don't know who i am without the trauma. It's like my core has been hollowed out to make room for all of it and as it's emptying I dont know what to put there instead. I have no idea who I am. I don't even know what I like and what I don't like. I don't know what kind of person i am at my core and that terrifies me. I hate feeling like this, but I have no idea how to even begin helping that. Has anyone else felt like this?"
I finally found a hobby!,133,blldrz,11,"I’ve spent my whole life being depressed. At 9 I was sexually abused and since then, I’ve just been trying to distract myself from me. I’ve never had a hobby because that required alone time with me. I got my first job at 14 and worked constantly to avoid thinking about the abuse. 

Most of my life, I’ve felt lost without a hobby. Everyone has something they’re passionate about- cars, cooking, baking, knitting, what have you. As much as I tried to get into all of those things, none of them became a constant in my life. But! I am now spending my free time with puzzles. I used to love jigsaw puzzles as a kid. Now, I do jigsaw puzzles, crosswords, riddles! I’m kind of excited about this. I’ve been so sad lately and it feels like I am taking back my life. There actually is something out there to enjoy."
A Message To All PTSD Sufferers from an Active Duty Military Guy,131,5k1r0q,17,"I suffer from PTSD and anxiety disorder with bouts of depression. Ive developed this through my time in the military due to things I have endured or witnessed, although most are non-combat related. I came here to seek a community of those who can understand what I'm going through. Upon coming here, I so often see people start their posts with ""Im not in the military"" or referring to their lack of military service as invalidating their PTSD. I've read enough of those statements to motivate me to come here and say one simple thing:

YOUR PTSD IS VALID

Stop feeling the need to defend your traumatic experiences when comparing them to military members with PTSD. Your trauma is no less real than what I experienced. My uniform does not strengthen my need for PTSD treatment any more or less than any of you. Many of you non-military PTSD sufferers have gone through things much worse than I or many other people in the military. You are valid. Your PTSD is real. Your trauma happened. And you deserve treatment and support...

... and most of all, you WILL heal. See you all on the other side. Thanks for being Americans worth fighting and dying for. Thanks for being non-Americans worth serving and fighting for. Thanks for being good people. "
Trauma Making You Feel Old??,130,k5tzyu,34,"I’m 24. And I feel old. I think it’s because I’ve white-knuckled it for so damned long. I only processed some of it in the last six months. I’ve lived three lifetimes in such a short amount of time. I’ve been through more but also lived so much more than some people twice my age and certainly more than a lot of 20-somethings. What is also contributing is that because of college and the trauma that happened there, the last few years have been a blur... like how am I already 24? I know mentally that I’m not old. But I feel like it, and it’s depressing me."
Can PTSD affect your general memory while trying to remember just normal day-to-day stuff?,131,id0041,32,"So I was diagnosed with PTSD when I was 16. I also got diagnosed with BPD when I was 21.

Both are mostly under control. I still have some days where they flare up and some self-destructive behaviour, and I do always have problems sleeping still.

A few people in the past have commented on how bad my memory is on just normal day to day stuff. One example is I was talking to a friend about their parents dog on a couple of occasions, and I asked him 3 times what the breed of dog it was.

Another one is my Mum asked me to get something from the shops, I had to call her around 4 times to see what it was.

Is this the PTSD or something else?"
Do you ever feel like the abuse never happened? (TW: sexual assault),124,gulxpy,23,"Lately, I've thinking of my r_pe by my first boyfriend. And wondering if it actually happened. In the relationship, I kind of glossed over it and told him he did r_pe me but that it wouldn't be taken seriously if I said anything about it. It was really jokingly and I never thought of it again.

But now, I'm wondering if I actually wasn't r_ped because, who acts like that the morning after an assault???? And it wasn't violent like other women's experiences. I was asleep and he did it. But I'm struggling with if I he actually did it or if I just misremembered it."
How do you keep doing life stuff while also doing trauma therapy?,129,glh5u0,19,"I'm in a very difficult spot right now. I've finally committed my whole heart to trauma therapy and recovery. Even though I'm scared to death of finally having to confront this with my full attention, rather than just running away from it, I'm going to do this.

However this is also a big time for me. I'm trying to quit self harm, trying to get a job and eventually move out. All of which are incredibly stressful. When I'm out on my own I'll not be able to afford a trauma therapist, at least not for a long while. So it's now or never. 

The difficult bit is that even lightly touching it is enough to put me out of commission for basically a day to two, sometimes more. Last therapy session I talked about maybe three or four sentences  about it was literally crying all damn day. Obviously not the most ideal thing when you have to maintain a job. 

How do you do it? How do you cope with all the stress it brings?"
DAE get triggered by people with short tempers?,129,dm80ip,29,

Anyone else have “nightmares” from their childhood that turned out to be real events?,130,cb4ij8,18,"Trigger warning: vague mentions of domestic violence
If this isn’t the place to post this, I’m sorry. I was diagnosed with PTSD and anxiety disorder a few years after a trauma I suffered when I was ten, but I had symptoms before then and I didn’t know why. I had “memories” of my father yelling at and abusing my mother from my really early childhood and my mom said I was afraid of him for most of my childhood because of it but until she told me this I had always thought the memories were bad dreams or that I had made it up. Her telling me that these things did in fact happen confirms that they weren’t dreams at all because I never told her about them but the stuff she described is exactly what happened in those “dreams.” I’m sorry if my writing doesn’t make sense. Has anything like this happened to anyone else?"
15 years since witnessing the murder of my boyfriend,126,fp2qfw,12,"As shocking as this title may come across, it isn't shocking to me anymore and in fact,I have become quite comfortable with it thanks to all the years of therapy I've done.  I only feel uncomfortable when i see others reactions when I tell them, and usually I do avoid ever telling anyone about it.  After 15 years it doesn't seem like I need to tell anyone anymore and if i do, it doesn't pain me the same way. 

I am over it. Yet, I'll never be fully healed.  I have moved on to the best of my abilities and quite remarkably considering the tragic nature of it. It has been a bumpy road and I've had times where i really struggled. But now, i see things in a new light.  I think EMDR really helped and i hope to help others with my  story in the future.  


RIP WK. You will be missed!"
"I’m been so broken and disowned so many times that I can’t get rid of anything with a face. I’m 23 years old and have more stuffed animals than most likely any six year old, I like the ugly broken ones, and I switch them between my bed every night so they all get love. It helps in my own broken way",124,e1amf4,15,"Even when I see a sad movie or a sad tv show and an animal dies, I’ll need to find that stuffed animal somewhere that looks like that animal, so i can feel like the animal lives on and is loved. They never go away unless one of my friends falls in love with one or they promise to love it as a piece of me. I have been disowned by my birth family, by my adopted family, by friends, by surrogate mothers, by so many people that I need to feel like I’m doing something even if I’m so broken I can’t do anything. At the same time I give myself some sort of a childhood, the part of me that was locked in a dark room and abused gets some release. I guess we all deal in different ways......"
I’m so out of touch with my body I don’t notice physical pain until it’s too late,127,lc5ccg,31,"I put my watch back on so tightly after my shower yesterday that I visibly bruised my wrist and I didn’t notice until today. 
It looks like someone grabbed me roughly which ironically has happened to me before and in this location in my body too. 
I’ve been doing yoga because it’s supposed to be good for that mind body connection but I can’t help but think I may never be able to listen to my body again. 
I’ve always felt disconnected from my physical body almost definitely as a result of my sexual trauma at a young age.
I also have a really high tolerance for physical pain. And I would dissociate as a coping mechanism for when I was being abused. 
Now it feels like this dissociative state has become a permanent fixture of my being.

Have you ever felt like this? How does it manifest for you? What do you feel like when you’re not with your body?"
Is it just me or is it SUPER difficult to find PTSD- specific group therapy?,123,jum9vs,30,"I’ve been searching for a PTSD group therapy session to join for several years. Literally every group I find is for Vets or women only or first responders. Every group has a qualifier. 

There is a real gap in support for men with ptsd. Society just tells us to “man up.” 

Everything sucks."
Finally had a breakthrough,124,jt7uoe,16,I finally had a breakthrough with my PTSD and haven't had an episode for over a month!!!!
Its hard to come to terms with being disabled,123,el5w03,20,"I keep trying to rationalize it away and say to myself that I'm just being overly dramatic. That I spent half of today on the couch staring at the ceiling in torment because I'm lazy. I guess it's easier to keep telling myself that I'm a piece of shit than it is to say that I'm broken.

I'm getting real tired of people being nice and helpful; I feel patronized. I tell myself that I could have done that thing someone else did, but I can't. I tell people ""don't do that thing. I will take care of it."" But after me not being able to take care of it for a few days it quietly gets done.

I feel like a leech.

Edit: thank you all. I had a rough night and really needed the support"
I made it,126,eg0mys,31,A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post about stop using Venlafaxine. It is a terrible experience. I just want you to know I made it and I am ok now.
I disclosed,126,b4l9ea,12,"

Wednesday evening I had a guy I’ve been seeing the last month or so come over to my place. We’d slept together before, and I’d already felt relatively safe, but this time I got triggered. I don’t know why, maybe it was the stress, but when he bit my leg (something I usually enjoy) I triggered, and I started flailing and kicking, then rolled over on my side and covered my face. He was gentle and checked on me and I apologized, and he pulled me in to cuddle. After I calmed down a bit, I said something about how we should talk about it, he said that we didn’t have to. 

I don’t disclose. I was in denial of my rapes and abuse for years, and when it all came out I told my boyfriend at the time. We’d been together for years, we lived together, I completely believed that he was going to be supportive. Instead he verbally abused me for hours, told me I was a slut and a liar and other horrible things. I have struggled with disclosure ever since, and have missed out on potential relationships because my fear of disclosing makes me disconnected and withdrawn. Disclosure is a huge barrier for me. 

But I disclosed. I had to work myself up to it, and he was patient. He already knew I had ptsd, so I said “my ptsd comes from sexual assault and domestic violence.” I talked a little about it and explained my reaction. I had to work myself up to it, but I did it. I was still very activated so I put on music and told him we should talk about other things to distract me, so he let me show him all my gemstones I recently got. He literally listened to me talk about rocks. I managed to pull myself back and finish having sex with him, and he was gentle even though I knew it wasn’t his preference. I kept apologizing to him about everything that happened and he told me it was okay, and to stop apologizing. 

This is a huge event for me. Disclosure to a sexual partner has never been successful for me. Most of the time it doesn’t happen. Potential relationships have been impaired by my avoidance. Disclosure itself carries trauma for me. I’ve been talking in therapy about how to disclose for years. So this is a big deal for me. And I’m proud of me. I hope that this means I’ll start being able to have this discussion with more serious romantic partners and I’ll stop ruining relationships. "
Anyone else unable to “relax”?,127,lmb2pd,54,"I’m not sure when it happened but for some reason I have lost all ability to “relax” in a “normal” way. I can’t not be doing something in terms of work whether it’s my actual job (BA & programmer) or cleaning or organizing or laundry or financial planning...etc. If I try to sit and watch TV or play a game or just spend time with my kids, I’m riddled with anxiety and guilt and my mind is racing and I’m trying to stop it from actually thinking because that is damned dangerous especially when it gets into “Hey! Remember 1996? No? Are you sure? Here’s 800 traumatic memories in case you’re not sure.”

It’s like there’s always an unattainable goal that I think is attainable and I will drive myself to exhaustion trying to do it.

Please someone tell me I’m not the only “CPTSD-workaholic-so-you’re-not-alone-with-your-mind” alien."
"I finally cried, 30 years later (TW: Sexual Assault)",124,iqz4er,14,"I grew up in a rural area and took the bus to school. We were the last stop on the route, so the bus was quite crowded by the time it reached me and my younger brother. We seldom were able to find seats together. Sometimes I had to stand in the aisle.

When I was 12, two older boys started offering to let me sit with them. I think they were high school freshmen (I remember who they are, I’m just not certain how many years ahead of me they were). 

Pretty soon, they began assaulting me regularly. One acted more as an accomplice, holding my arms back, that sort of thing. The other did the dirty work. I have a hard time piecing together experiences in my head; I don’t remember an encounter from beginning to end. I remember fragments, impressions. I recall being pulled back so I was facing up, looking at the curve of that sickly green bus ceiling. I remember being called a prude. I remember the shock and revulsion of having my genitals touched for the first time. I remember the smell of that boy’s unwashed genitalia. And I remember the audience, all those other kids looking over seat backs and craning their necks, standing in the aisle to watch.

The other day I was in the shower and for whatever reason I was musing about that last bit, about all the other kids who crawled over each other to watch. I considered how I never reported it to anybody, partly because if all those other kids saw nothing wrong, maybe I just *was* a prude. Surely if something wrong was happening, somebody would have said something, right?

So there in the shower, for the first time I thought “Wait a minute...why *didn’t* someone say something? Why didn’t anyone help me?”

The answer, of course, is probably because it was just a bunch of kids who didn’t know how to react either. But it was the first time I’d ever considered that *I deserved help.* I didn’t do anything wrong, I didn’t deserve it, and I was worth helping.

It seems like a simple and obvious concept, but it was the first time I allowed myself to feel compassion for myself, or 12yo me at least. I started crying. I kept crying until it was the gasping, sobbing ugly cry. I sat in that shower and cried for a half hour until the hot water ran out.

It’s been a couple days and I still feel gutted by it, but also...lighter? Like I’ve had some manner of catharsis. Like I’ve allowed myself to be deserving of better treatment than I received, even if I’m a few decades too late.

I apologize for the ramble. I don’t have anyone to share with right now and it feels good just to put it out there. Thank you for taking the time to read."
Progress! (cw roofies/sexual abuse),123,in8c81,20,"I was able to leave my coffee unattended. I was able to go to the bathroom and leave my coffee with one of my friends.
This was the first time in nearly three years, I finally was at a point to trust a person I am close with to overlook my drink in a public setting. Since I got roofied which lead to me being raped, I wasn't able to turn my head away from my drink for just a second.

I started crying right after the first sip I had when I came back. Coffee never tasted this good.
And I wanted to share my joy."
I did something different last night.,127,h0qqtp,21,"Bad memories often come up when I try to go to sleep. Instead of crying by myself like I usually do, I took a risk. I went to my mom's room where she was already sleeping and crawled into her bed.

Why is this a risk? Well, in years past, she's not been very understanding when I cry or get bothered over past events. The most devastating memory I have of her is her yelling at me for crying so loud to bother the neighbors. This was a couple months after my dad / her husband passed away. She often asked why I was so depressed when she was the one who lost everything. After that, I lost trust in her to show her my feelings. I would just cry alone at night whenever the feelings became overwhelming.

Slowly over the past couple years since I've moved back home, I've been working things out with her and she's reflected and apologized for not understanding how to help me. It's improved a lot, but I still never asked her for support whenever I cry at night.

Tonight, after a decade, my mother hugged me the way I wanted her to while I sobbed my heart out. 

It took some coaching to get here, but she did it. It felt like my hole inside heart started to mend. After I got all the crying out, she said she wished she could have helped me more.

We ended up chatted even more about random things, even ended up laughing during the conversation. I slept peacefully for the rest of the night sleeping next to my mom. :) I'm glad I took the risk to trust her when I'm sad."
This person smelled like my rapist,123,gnzxw7,16,"So i am in the library studying and this dude walks past me and for some reason after he walked passed me I got anxious and than I realized that he smells exactly like my rapist, I can still feel the smell in the air... it so weird that ptsd does this to one, such small things as smell can get you triggered. It's really annoying and frustrating."
Feeling hopeless during Coronavirus,128,fk3hhm,30,"The past few months I worked so hard to get my PTSD to s point where it was manageable enough to hold down a job.  I am working in a grocery store right now and as I'm sure you all now, it's been utter chaos and extremely stressful.  The amount of triggers I am having to deal with now on a daily basis are inumerable and unavoidable.  Trying DBT skills but they don't seem to help me get out of my mindset of being in danger.  I am already noticing myself start to disassociate or just be plain aggressive with customers when I feel in danger.  I am very very worried about my mental health.  

Just wondering if anyone else is feeling triggered by this and how you're coping."

i felt happy today,125,d3buxs,6,its been a while since i’ve found myself just smiling for no reason and *not* feeling on edge. i thought i was going to be emotionally numbed out forever and i had accepted that but lately i’ve had a bit of a resurgence. keep holding on ❤️
I fell apart at work and now my coworkers are gossiping about me.,121,cptxgo,19,"I’m so overwhelmed. Last week, the flashbacks were so bad the night before my shift (I’m a server) that I was awake all night, and I wasn’t able to call in. Needless to say, I was not in a good head space. Of course, that one day in particular was absolutely CRAZY at the restaurant, and I was struggling to keep up. 

My coworker asked me why I was so overwhelmed, and said that I should have been handling this better. So I, not wanting to divulge my whole mental health history, just joked that I must have partied too hard last night. I thought I made it clear that I was kidding, but I guess not, because she started spreading it around that I wasn’t able to perform my job and that I was falling apart. When my supervisor came to talk to me, I broke down crying and explained what happened. Now the coworker is accusing me of lying, and I heard her and some other girls talking about how I’m incompetent at my job. 

I can’t do this anymore. I understand making a hangover joke was probably in poor taste, but considering we’re all college kids, I thought it would go better than explaining the real reason. Just feel super demoralized and I hate myself for it. Why did I have to fall apart at work?"
"Those of you with sexual trauma, do you struggle with experiencing sexual attraction?",124,cm91po,76,"For a bit of context: I've experienced probable CSA along with repeated sexual trauma as an adult. I'm having a really hard time recently realising that it's so difficult for me to a) experience real sexual attraction at all, b) when I do experience it, experience it consistently, and c) decipher whether or not I'm attracted to someone.

For so much of my life I've found myself projecting my general feelings of sexual desire onto someone I wasn't actually attracted to, almost always someone who's expressed attraction to me - I think very often I misread the positive feelings of validation I get from knowing someone is into me as feelings of attraction on my part.

I'll think I'm attracted to someone until I actually do anything physical with them, and then I realise I'm just not feeling it at all. But even then I'll experience the physical sensations of arousal, which is always confusing and distressing for me - it feels like it's happening against my will and makes me second-guess myself and wonder if actually I *am* attracted to the person, even though there are alarm bells in my head telling me, 'no! This isn't good for you!'

There's been one person in my life - an ex - who I'm sure I experienced real attraction towards, but even then it was inconsistent. We had a romantic/sexual relationship, and sometimes I experienced attraction so strongly and it felt so good, right, instinctive and natural (though not necessarily without PTS symptoms during sex), and other times it was just like the attraction vanished (I found this tended to be when I felt less emotionally connected to my ex and/or when my mental health was poorer).

I suppose I just want to know if anyone here has similar struggles with sexual attraction? Does any of this sound familiar to you? And does anyone have any insight or any advice?

I'm struggling so much with this at the moment and am so fearful that I'll never be able to experience normal/healthy attraction, it would just help to get a little bit more of an understanding of my feelings."
Showered with almost no anxiety today!,122,cimtdl,5,"Last week I had a flashback in the shower and since then I haven’t been able to take a shower peacefully and without having extreme anxiety. Today I took one and I almost didn’t have any anxiety.

DAE think they’re not a person?,127,c66xo7,37,"I’m not sure how to explain it. I feel like people see me and see a human body, and I say things in a language they understand, and I can interact with them (more or less.) but it’s as though I have everyone fooled, I am living as an imposter in this human shell. I am a body that makes noise. I am play acting as a human being, always performing. It only gets worse the longer I know someone. I feel that this veneer will one day be torn away and I will be seen for the fact that there’s really not much to me.

Specifically as it relates to trauma, I’ve always had symptoms of depersonalization, but it’s gotten to the point now that I’ve lost all touch with the notion that I’m a human being. Do things like this bother anyone else?"

Today I had mediaton with one of my abusers.,123,m3p6nx,22,"We never had a relationship just FWB who ended up with a child,I did not see the red flags before I got pregnant. 

For 2 years he has been verbally abusing me, gaslighting me and treathening me.
We have had meetings on meetings than never helped.
And today was the day I feared the most,mediation. 

And I went through with it, I owned it.
I was scared shitless,I could not eat,my anxiety was at an all time high but I did it.
And im proud of myself, because for once I did not just sit there nodding my head saying yes to things I disagreed on.
No, I went in there full force looked him deep into his eyes and I said 

""I dont trust you,I dont respect you and I dislike you, but still im sitting here today trying to come to an agreement for our son.
It.felt.so.good.
It felt so damn good to finally being brave enough to tell him that. And when he gave me a letter from his lawyer where he treathened me that if I dont share custody he will take me to court.

I was even braver, again I looked him into his eyes and said no, he replied ""well ill take you to court"" and what I said its insane for me to even write ""Well then bring it on"". 

I am so proud of myself, I dont care that I have not been able to eat all day or that I feel like a truck has run over me. Im so damn tired I cant think straight, but none of that matters because I
I faced my abuser,I raised my voice,I stood my ground.

Thank you all for your lovely comments and thank you for the rewards♡ its the next day and im still dead tired but I feel good, in the middle of all of this I forgot the person who supervise the visitations had to work a late shift and it was visitation day, so guess who had to open the door and si hi to him.

I know asking for money on here is not allowed and thats not what I'm doing. Ive been trying to post something in r/assistance but they require a comment karma of 400 or more.

-------------------
> I ONLY date women like you. No, I am not some derranged perv with a thing for victimized girls. I am a male survivor with pretty significant trauma and 30 years of PTSD. You are like the perfect woman to me. I don't have to explain a thing, you already get it. People with traumatic childhoods speak a common language. We have similar issues to deal with, maybe even the same triggers. I have been with ""normal"" women. Never again. They are belittling and cruel. You my type and I cannot be alone in this. 1 in 4 girls. 1 in 5 boys. That's millions of people.

Topic title:
> [TW Sexual Abuse] Would you date/be interested in a girl that had been sexually abused as a young child?

Apparently he exclusively dates sexual abuse survivors because they can """"relate"""" to him. Only they also have to be half his age, because he fetishizes age gaps. Oh, and he prefers chubby women because they're ""more giving with themselves"", and ""more willing"". (Don't worry, we'll get to the lovely comments about that!)

Seems *legit.*

That whole suspiciously-enthusiastic, unprovoked, very r/SelfAwareWolves Not A Perv I Swear speech is because multiple people confronted him yesterday-ish about this. He's in full defense mode. Dude sure does like his ""my creepy sexual preferences are all because of PTSD, so I shouldn't have to worry about whether I'm hurting anyone else with them"" excuses.

Normal women are so bitter and cruel...lol. They call him creepy just for wanting to jack off to your sexual abuse, guys. :( This poor victim. There must be a conspiracy among all the woman who aren't half his age and so broken that he seems normal and safe for longer than 30 seconds. Yeah, that must be it.

He gets one creeped-out reply. As with every other comment from someone he creeps out, he immediately ghosts the conversation. Perhaps because he's had this conversation quite often *(for some mysterious reason)* and already knows how it's going to go, and he just doesn't care? 

But that's just my best guess at interpreting complete silence from someone who has had no counterargument to ""wtf this is predatory"" besides ""I have PTSD and I'm immature so I've decided it's okay. Anyways, why am I all alone? It's so sad how *""""""normal""""""* women can't stand me, even tho I'll never post a specific example because people sure do always agree with the womens' concerns whenever I do.""

[Here's him beelining to a topic posted by a virgin to give creepy, lurid ""advice"" that's really just him fantasizing about the situation.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/lg9i7f/first_time_with_a_girl_and_im_freaking_out/gmq4txw/)
-------------------
> Be cool. You guys are smack in the middle of that amazing young, lusty, passionate, mind-blowing sex phase that makes life worth living. Just go with it and try not to over-think the situation. Instead of panic about how you might fuck it all up in the future, live in the moment. Appreciate the fact that this girl is super into you right now. Nothing lasts forever, especially not these white-hot hookups. That doesn't mean they aren't worthwhile. Have high hopes but keep expectations low. Also, form your own opinions of people. That shade about her being impulsive and emotionally unavailable has little to do with your current situation. That's the past. People can stop being impulsive and unavailable when they enter into a more appealing relationship. It's possible. So, take it as it comes. And if in the end it falls apart, at least you got to experience that passion. A lot of people are too boring and too careful to even allow themselves this pleasure. Let it do what it do.

[Here's him reviewing womens' bodies. This isn't inherently bannable, but it is so fucking gross. You creepy fuck.](https://np.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/comments/lhaqaa/people_who_like_chubby_girls_what_is_it_that/gmw9r1g/)
-------------------
> Skinny girls are okay to look at (sort of) because of the way clothing fits them. Fashionable Western clothing styles are usually fitted to be worn by lean women. I don't subscribe to these standards. I like thick women. It's disapointing when a great beauty has no ass on her. That beautiful, big ass on a chubby woman is only part of it, though.

> Skinny women are bony af. Ever lay with a skinny chick? She's all elbows and knee caps. Sometimes a woman is so petite I feel like I might break her on accident. A chubby woman is much softer, and to me, much more pleaseant to lay with. Simply put, they feel better to me. There's one more societal reason guys dig the chubby women of the world.

> They try harder. A thin woman who grew up skinny has never known the ridicule that fat women endure. A woman who's been told her whole life that she's ""hot"" will assume her mere physical presence is enough. I find skinny women are sometimes a bit full of themselves, especially if they're also blonde. Maybe it's just where I grew up, idk? A chubby woman who isn't accustomed to these platitudes and accolades isn't so full of herself. She's typically nicer, more generous with herself, and a more willing partner. It's the same for men, too. People who're told over and over they're the embodiment of some highly desirable feature mistakenly think it's all they need to bring when it comes to relations. Chubby women don't usually fall into that trap. Mad love for the chubs!

Hey look, ***he targets women who ""try harder"" and are ""more willing"" (because they have presumed low self-esteem).***

Oh sure, this poor little victim has noooo predatory motivations when he targets young sexually-abused women. He just wants someone who understaaaaaands him.

Sure, buddy.

[Here's him victim-blaming someone in this sub for daring to expect men on dating apps to not be emotionally abusive, because ""let's be real"", ~~boys will be boys~~ men are just like that.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmnd5u7/)
-------------------
> I think you're really good at making excuses for why you cannot do things. Let's be honest here. Many guys are gonna be emtionally abusive regardless of your status as a survivor. What your comment says is you're still filled with lots of trepidation and feelings of unsafe vulnerability. Finding a match is an act of vulnerability. You might be excluding a lot of potentially good matches simply becuase you aren't ready to be vulnerable. It happens. We want recovery to occur quicker than it does and feel impatient we,'re not ""where we should be"". I get the deep lonliness. Remember I said I've had some success on reddit? I have been living in crazy, PTSD induced isolation, waiting 30+ years to find a woman like this. She's a survivor. She gets me. Talk to me in 2050 about your lonliness

Let me set aside a sec to wtf at ""my loneliness is so much worse than urs, OP, let me flex about that real quick"" but at this point, that's just a drop in the bucket.

[Oh and this guy, who - remember! - exclusively dates sexually-abused women, actively targets 'teens' in the ""age gap personals"" subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmn89ls/)
--------------------
> B) I have great success finding like-minded peeps here on reddit. There are tons of subreddits for dating. Because of severe trauma and PTSD I ***[48 M]*** am kinda trapped in the mind of a teen, so I've used the ""Age Gap Personals"" sub to find women closer to my mental age. You may want to skew your dating search older as a more mature man will (hopefully) not act like such fuck boi. Obviously, anything on reddit has the potential to turn into a gutter.

Gee, I wondered where all the refugees from r/jailbait went! 

Dude just *loves* the obvious pedo-magnet community that inevitably only survives because they insist you lie and say you're 18. I'm not clicking in there, but let me guess: the vast majority of the population is old looking for young. 

What a chickenhawk coop. Let's play a game: guess how many IPs in there are coming from prisons, or the residences of known sex offenders? 

[Oh, and OP should fix her post-sexual-abuse dating problems....by not just lowering her standards, but dating older men ***and*** advertising her abuse to them on dating sites more often.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/lfpznk/dating_is_exhausting_tw_sex/gmn89ls/)
-------------------
> C) whatever you do, I strongly advise you to disclose your situation i.e. recovering from sexual assault but tryna get back into dating. The honesty will attract the kind of sensitive, emotionally mature men you're looking for.

**He is literally targeting people** ***in this subreddit*** **and trying to convince them to heal from their sexual violence** ***by ""dating"" guys like him.*** 

And he refuses to even *acknowledge* the multiple power imbalances he clearly gets off on. 

Chubby women is his most legal kink. He doesn't say a single thing about their bodies that he likes, because he doesn't like them: he just looks down on them, and hopes they'll be too desperate and insecure to object to his glaring flaws.

Problem is, adult fat women often don't actually *want* to be with grimy assholes who expect them to abide by an unspoken rule of ""you're fat and worth less, so you should be grateful I even want to fuck you, and not have any standards for me to meet"". 

Just because *he* doesn't value them doesn't mean they're actually going to ""try harder"" - aka, ignore that he's a restraining order waiting to happen, that he likes em young, and that he talks about women like fuckable cattle. 

(And whatever else is horrible behind the scenes that can't be gleaned from literally just his public Reddit activity over the last day or so.)

Guess he's had more luck with sexually-abused teenagers.

Ban. 

Him.

I'm not going back farther in his post history. If this isn't enough, staff just doesn't give a fuck.

PTSD doesn't induce blameless *preferences* in grown adults for sex with insecure teens, insecure sexual abuse survivors, and insecure chubby women. That's not how this works. But it sure does get him misguided sympathy, and more access to sexually-abused teenagers than admitting the truth does.

I used to be a mod on a large mental health support community too. About 1k concurrent users at every hour of the clock. We banned pedos like this regularly. They crawled in to vent about their disorder, which sometimes existed and sometimes didn't, played the victim for a while, then told young girls over DM to take their clothes off.

"TW: Sexual Child Abuse. I am a man, 27 years of suffering from PTSD brought on by sexual trauma as a child.",125,inx12v,15,"The memories of it kills me, and it really hurts. The worst part is not remembering their face, not knowing who it was. I know it was a family member, I know it was probably done upon them as well. I just wish I knew, so maybe I'd have some closure. It made me such a mean person, it made me angry, hateful, spiteful, and made me say and do stupid shit that I wouldn't do if I wasn't filled with such hate. I fucking hate this. I just wanna feel normal, I just wanna love and feel loved. I want to stop feeling. I want to stop feeling everything. I just want to breathe without nightmares, I want to sleep without dreaming.

I want to be normal again.,123,gbtanj,13,I feel pathetic. Having people show up unexpectedly turns me into a shaking and crying mess. The fedex guy came 40 minutes ago and I still haven’t calmed down. Every time someone comes unannounced I’m worried that it’s my abuser and he’s found me again. I can’t hang out with my friends anymore. I can’t go see my family. I can’t leave my apartment at all because I’m too scared to. I’m too scared they’ll see how messed up I am now and they won’t wanna be around me anymore. I don’t want to have a meltdown in front of them. Even when I’m home I’m constantly dissociating and it’s the most terrifying thing I’ve ever felt. I don’t want to have meltdowns anymore. I don’t want to be secluded anymore.

"Anyone else just tired all the time, or is it just me?",124,g4ab0u,56,
Has PTSD played a part in you walking away from God?,123,m95sgh,80,"I was raised in a ""Christian home"", and for many years I believed in the theology that I was taught from a young age. However, due to incidents that happened to me during my childhood and my adult life I found it put strain on my religious beliefs. They're not the only reason I turned away from God, as I've put myself into the agnostic category because of faults I've found with Christianity, as well as the idea of a personal God. But my personal reasons have nonetheless played a part in it. How could they not?

Even if there is a personal God (as in a God that cares about you and what you do, listens to your prayers, etc) I've found the idea of wanting to having a relationship with him to be (for lack of a better word) difficult. I have a friend who I sometimes talk to, and her advice usually goes something like this: 

\- God loves us. He will make something good out of all of this suffering.

\- God is good.

\- Trust. Believe. Keep the faith.

These phrases sound inspiring, but I find them to be shallow and simple. I think it's easy for a person who does well in life, or goes through something hard and comes out better for it to give thanks to God. But what about all of the people God doesn't help? Everyday, as I drive to or from work, I see homeless people sitting on the side of the road living in tents, I hear about people being raped and murdered on the news. I hear about people being kidnapped and being held for years against their will. I see greedy politicians on TV who are legally stealing from the citizens they are supposed to serve. I see war and disease. 

Perhaps I'm jaded, but I find this constant rat race we're in to be tiring. 

If there is a God, I find myself not wanting anything to do with him anymore. I don't want to worship him, I don't want to know him. At one time I may have. But I found him to be rather impersonal for a God who is supposedly personal. Where were you God? Where were you when I was being abused? Why didn't you stop it, or give me the strength to stop it on my own? And after each time, as the abuse happened over and over again, you expect me to come crawling back to you looking for love and protection and a relationship? I don't want to. I'm sorry God, but I don't love you. I don't love your creation. I don't want to be a part of it. I didn't ask for this. I have so much hate and disgust in me that I want nothing to do with you. And yes, I guess according to Christianity I may go to Hell for saying that. But you know what? When I die, I don't want an afterlife. I don't want your Heaven or your Hell.

I'm sorry for the rant, but I had to get this out. Thanks for listening."

Hairdresser grabbed my face and kissed very close to my lips after haircut. Feeling triggered.,123,ljexag,27,"I've been getting my haircut by a 50+ y.o. Romanian man for over a year now. He's been nothing but professional that entire time. 

When COVID hit, he started to take some clients at his home and he would charge a little less than he would in the salon. 

This was my 3rd time going to his house for a haircut. The other 2 times, everything was normal. Again, professional. Sometimes we would discuss our love lives very briefly. I knew he was dating someone recently and I was happy for him. 

At today's appointment, I wasn't very chatty. I was really tired and just enjoying the feeling of someone touching my hair. When I first arrived and he was about to shampoo my hair, he asked if I had any Valentine's plans tomorrow. I said no, I'm single this year. 

We moved on to the haircut. I noticed he had a glass of wine on his counter. He told me has hadn't eaten today and he's a little tipsy. Ha-ha. I didn't think anything of it.

He asked me if I'm straight... I'm like...""yes?"" He continued the haircut. He asked me, ""Are you on any dating sites?"" I told him I was taking a break from dating, focusing on my new job, etc. 

So, at the end of the haircut, I paid him in cash. I thanked him. And...He grabbed my face with both hands...and kissed me many times on my cheek. Like, on my smile line. Which is really close to my lips. I really thought he'd end up kissing my lips. 

I just froze up. And then he walked me out and told me to drive safe.

I came home. Called my friends and family. Took Vistaril. I'm doing okay now. But I can't stop thinking about it. 

My PTSD comes from a life time and variety of sexual assault. So this was triggering to me. I feel confused. Violated. Naive. Shameful.

I'm having a particularly strong period of surrealism at the moment. I'm just baffled. I keep dreaming of waking up to what I guess used to be my reality, next to my rapists or on the street or anywhere else that I've survived something that sticks with me, as if the last year and a half never happened.

I want to write a letter to my former teacher,122,h14d65,48,"tw: rape/ sexual assault

I was raped a few years ago. I completely lost all trust in boys and men, I was terrified of every single male person. Later that year I started a new school, and one of my teachers was a male. He didn’t know about it, no one did, but everyone could see that I was struggling. With everything. He made such a huge inpact on me, he was always so calm and supportive, he saw me have a lot of panic attacks and mental breakdowns at school. Even though he didn’t know why, he always sat with me and asked if there was something he could do. He was truly an amazing person, and an amazing teacher. He was the person who made me trust men again, and I want to thank him for it. 

I want to write him a letter thinking him for what he did for me, because I truly don’t think he knows how huge of an impact he made on me. Is this even appropriate? Also I think its kind of embarrassing, and I dont think I want to deal with the question of if he will reach out to me, so I was planning to be anonymous. Once again I’m asking, is this appropriate?

Is anyone else fighting to reclaim things they love?,124,f7zz2k,23,"Video games, a language I want to learn, calico cats, the color orange, red hair, university. These are just some of the things that I have associated with my abusers. Something that could bring me joy has been marked and altered by those assholes. It's not enough that they took my dignity, mental health and will to live in that moment - their power has seeped into everything. I hate it.  


They introduced me to my all-time favorite band Glass Animals. I fucking adore them, but for almost a year after the abuse I couldn't listen to them. And it hurt more than other triggers because they mutilated something I love. And that is really shitty of them.  


Since then, I've been trying to listen to them again. I listen to half a song or a full one when I am feeling safe. I listen to them when I'm doing something fun. I make a point of putting them on when I'm around friends. I listen to them when I'm working out, so that I can run out the anxiety it induces. I'm trying SO HARD to get them back, and it is starting to work.  


I think this process is really exhausting, and I have to put away my anger in order to reclaim them. Like, I can't make progress on this if I am just pissed about them being taken away in the first place, ya know? Is anyone else going through something similar? I would love to hear your stories."
anyone else feel like they can’t love normally bc of trauma?,125,auetea,31,I have a gf of a month and a half and I like her a lot but it’s getting slightly more serious and i’m scared it’s just going to get to the point my relationships normally do where she falls in love and I just can’t let myself believe her or feel that way back because I’m so terrified of hurting or being hurt by others because of my csa and ptsd from that. i feel like i should warn her or something i don’t know i just feel like a bad person for not ever falling in love the way everyone else describes it even with my (now ex) girlfriend of two years. does anyone relate?

Can Complex PTSD “mimic” autistic traits,120,lrledg,67,"Does anyone have PTSD from an early childhood trauma or is diagnosed with C-PTSD but displays several autistic traits and symptoms? 

Also when you suffer from PTSD are you aware of your trauma or could it present in a more subtle manner? Is it always nightmares and flashbacks or more passive symptoms too?

Sorry if this is an insensitive question. If anyone could give me some answers I’d greatly appreciate it!"
Is it possible to forget a trauma experience but have PTSD?,124,iz01ge,50,"Just as the title says. To preface, I AM diagnosed with PTSD and do have a set of trauma experiences I can recall vividly and experience PTSD symptoms around, but I keep feeling this bugging feeling that something in my early childhood has been extremely traumatic and that I have yet to remember it/can’t remember it. I’ll get all the symptoms of being triggered at any mention of childhood or childhood trauma, even if it’s not even about me but just any random child, it’s like I can’t listen without feeling triggered by it even though I’m a 22 year old adult now. I also just have extreme anxiety and fear surrounding my childhood (will have outbursts of fear and crying hysterically about it) but I ironically have memory loss of a majority of my life before the age of 18, except for quick snippets at random intervals. 

Has anyone experienced this? Does it come back to you eventually? Is it better forgotten? If it’s forgotten but the feeling is there, do I tell my therapist? He has been prompting me to recall and retell my traumas recently in trauma therapy, but how can I even do that if a big part (but not all) of my anxiety/nightmares/etc is because of something I can’t even remember?"
30 minutes of screaming,120,i1ufid,15,"[TW: Sexual assault mention, me being very mentally ill]

I've been told that there's a point in EMDR treatment where your body just purges a bunch of the trauma all at once... and I think that finally happened this week. Recently I finally started to feel safe processing my rape directly, rather than focusing on tangential memories,  so I've been starting to go there. After my session on the 23rd, I started feeling really off. I got really intense and irritable. That feeling grew inside me throughout the week, and was becoming unbearable by the time of my next session on the 30th. After that, I started to feel anxious, like there was a frog in my throat. I tried going to bed early that night, but just couldn't sleep. At around 3 am, I lost control of my body and started twitching and screaming. I'm normally used to this sort of thing, since I've been having similar panic episodes for the last 2 years, but this was more violent. I could only stop screaming to inhale then continue screaming. When my roommate found me I couldn't even acknowledge her, cause the screams were spilling out of me like vomit. I was able to come down briefly with meds, but then I just started screaming again. It felt like forever, but afterwards, I feel... lighter? Like the trauma monster inside me has gotten a little weaker. I was really shook, though. I needed to sleep 11 hours and lay down all day yesterday to feel OK today. I don't wanna jinx it, but does this mean I get to live my life now?"
"If someone came into my room rn, theyd see me high, crying, sitting underneath my bed and eating soup straight out of the can and without a spoon.",124,ew1hde,25,"And, somehow, I'm still more stable than i was this time last year."
I lost my femininity,122,evn0ta,49,"Tw - sexual assault

Ever since my rape I have been slowly losing my femininity. It's been just over a year (it happened December 2018) and I just realized how truly painful it is for me to wear or do anything remotely feminine. I was dressed up for a night out with friends and I had to fo home from the hospital in a pair of scrubs because my clothes got ripped off.

Ever since then, I've lost my passion for makeup, which I was planning to make a career out of. I stopped dressing up, stopped wearing skin tight clothes, stopped wearing dresses or any other kind of girly clothes. I cut all my hair off and now I feel uncomfortable buying women's underwear. I have to buy men's underwear and order sports bras designed for trans people to help constrict my chest.

I have panic attacks when I go shopping, when I do makeup, and I have cancelled plans to go out with friends over the fact that I can't bring myself to get dressed up and I don't wanna show up in sweat pants again.

I dont really know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe just to know I'm not alone? I hate that I lost such a big part of myself. I loved being girly and now I feel uncomfortable even wearing shirts with scoop necks.

It feels so stupid and trivial, I know, but I just kinda needed to put this somewhere out there.

Edit - wow thank you so much for the love and support. Your kind words have really helped lift me today.

I am in therapy but we are working through some childhood trauma through EMDR. My assault is something I struggle to speak about and this realization is the most I have ever opened up about how its affected me  to anyone.

I will try and talk about it with my therapist on our next session."
Trump Jr’s Book Name!!!???,120,edwor2,30,"[This](https://www.amazon.com/Triggered-Left-Thrives-Wants-Silence/dp/154608603X) just adds to the misuse of the word and blatant disregard that it minimizes what “triggered” means for people with PTSD. 

I’m honestly appalled. And if I were to say anything about it other than a PTSD sub, people would literally respond with “TrIGgErEd!!”

When did people become so unaware or literally just don’t care about others?"
"Any other sexual abuse survivors constantly fear being sexualized then shame yourself thinking, “Who do you think you are? You’re not even that attractive.”",121,e0krs3,25,"Any other sexual abuse survivors constantly fear being sexualized then shame yourself thinking, “Who do you think you are? You’re not even that attractive.”

I am frequently fearful of being sexualized or liked by any one into women (male or female). I’ve been sexually harassed and abused throughout my life and I run away from people who start liking me or sexualize me. I just don’t believe there are men (or women into women) who are attracted to me that won’t sexualize me. I mean my own dad had a crush on me and sexualized me (covert child sexual abuse). I mean we are all sexual beings, is it even possible not to sexualize someone you’re attracted to? 

I now have a gay female therapist who I connect with so well but I have this fear of being sexualized. Sometimes I think I end up manifesting my fears because I focus so much energy Onto it due to my PTSD. I feel guilty for feeling this way about her because I don’t want to offend or hurt her especially because she is coming from an oppressed group. But there have been times where I’ve caught her looking at my legs and I felt she was attracted to them.

When I start thinking of this: what if they become attracted to me or sexualize me.. then I shame myself like, “who do you think you are? You’re not even they attractive. You’re so cocky to think people are gonna like you.” I now realize that my dad said the same thing to me when I confronted him. He said, “you’re not even beautiful.. I wouldn’t look at you down the street.. I’m sick Of your sick fantasies..” Then I’m like, “maybe I just want the attention.. maybe I want them to be attracted to me.” Which confuses me because yes, everyone wants to be attractive and have attention, but not unwanted sexualization or attention.

So sad.. anyone else have similar feelings?"
I don’t “warm up” at therapy until the end of every session,121,dlyun0,22,"Does anybody else have this issue? For the first 45 minutes of therapy, I can barely get a full sentence out about anything. But then for my last 15 minutes, that’s when I suddenly feel comfortable enough to start getting into a deep topic, but then there’s no time left to discuss it! How do I stop being this way so that my appointments are more productive?


Maybe I just need time because I haven’t been seeing this therapist for very long yet, and the scheduling has been inconsistent. But I think for me, it’s mostly that my PTSD makes me pay way too much attention to how my therapist might be feeling herself whenever I walk in, and then carefully reading the vibes of the room. It’s just a habit after living with abusive people for so long, you have to walk on eggshells and make sure it’s safe before you speak... but it takes me such a long time to finally decide it’s safe."
Traumatic birthing experience,121,d10pax,42,"Okay. So I have no idea where to start with this. I guess I should start with my pregnancy. I got pregnant last year, and me and my husband were ecstatic. But I had a very difficult pregnancy. I had pelvic pain that started around 8 weeks pregnant and continued up until I got induced. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes, had to change my entire diet and then I was put on 9 units of insulin a day. And because of that, at 32 weeks pregnant, I had to go to the doctor and me and my daughter had to be monitored once a week. Then when I hit 36 weeks, I had to go 2x a week. And then I was induced at 39 weeks pregnant. When they were monitoring my blood pressure the day of my induction, they saw that it was high. They thought maybe it was nerves or something. So they tested my urine for protein, and it turns out I also had preeclampsia. And because of this, I had to be out on magnesium, which made my entire body hot and uncomfortable. I was already hooked up to so many things in my IV, the list just kept growing. They started the induction by using a foley balloon, wasn’t comfortable, but it was fine. Then when it fell out, I was dilated to 4 cm. Then they gave me a pill called cytotec to soften my cervix. Still wasn’t dilating much. Then they started me on pitocin. They told me that the magnesium and the pitocin would work against each other, and we were in for a long ride. I got some IV pain meds at some point. I still wasn’t dilating, and it had been about 12 hours in. I’m only at a 6. Doctor came in, and they had to turn my daughters head in my uterus by hand because she was facing up and she needed to be facing down. This was super painful. (I can’t remember if I had gotten an epidural yet or not) but they think they got it. And then I started dilating more and more over the course of what seemed like forever. It was over 48 hours from the start that they told me that I was at a 9. And my epidural would move to one side when I laid on my right side. So I would feel all of my contractions on my left side. And then when I laid on my left side, it fixed itself. So eventually, I started pushing at the 56 hour mark. My epidural wore off and I could feel almost everything. I pushed her out for the next 2 hours. I had to get a tiny episiotomy. And when she came out, everyone sighed a sigh of relief because it was over. But little did we know, it wasn’t over. They laid her on my chest, and the doctors were trying to get the placenta out. They took my daughter to the warmer, and my husband followed. They started to massage my uterus, but it hurt. Really really bad. It hurt worse than pushing my baby out. I asked the doctor “Why are you doing it that hard?!” 
She looked at me and said “Trust me, you want me to be doing this.”
 My mom is standing next to me looking worried as hell, which doesn’t help the fact that I’m freaking out. I then hear one of the doctors tell the other one something about me needing blood. I start freaking out, so I try to call my husband over, but I’m to weak and he can’t hear me. My father in law gets his attention, and he comes over to me. I tell him that I need blood, and he’s freaking out. 

All of a sudden, I start to get really really sleepy. I ask my husband if I can go to sleep, the nurse said yes, and my mom said no. I tried to stay awake, my husband was trying to ask me questions to keep me awake. But I passed out. Well more like blacked out because my husband says my eyes were still open. He told me I threw up multiple times (I only remember 1 time). He told me that when he would try to talk to me, I would just stare at him with this blank look on my face and in my eyes. Like I wasn’t really there. There are a few things that I remember during my black out. I remember trying to answer people when they would talk to me. It felt like I was screaming, but nothing was coming out of my mouth. I remember seeing this new person in the room that wasn’t there before. Turns out he was like the head doctor or some shit. Then I saw that doctor doing an ultrasound because they put a balloon in my uterus to stop the bleeding and then I went back under. And then I started to come to when they hooked up the blood bag to my IV. I can’t remember when, but I’m pretty sure they gave me another epidural after I gave birth. They usually take out the catheter, but they left mine in. I remember being in the most immense amount of pain I’ve ever been in. My mom had to help me shower because I could barely move. 

I know there are a lot of things that I’m leaving out, but I can’t really remember all of it. 

But because of all this, I feel so messed up. Every time I watch a show or a movie where someone is giving birth, I cry. Every single time. And it freaks me out because I can talk about what happened to me, and not cry or have flashbacks (most of the time). But when I see a labor and delivery room on TV, I get scared and I cry. My friend gave birth 2 months after me, and I was gonna go visit her, but I got scared of going back to the hospital. Every time I have my period, the blood scares me and I think something is wrong with me again. I was afraid to go home after being in the hospital because I thought I was gonna die. I’m scared to get pregnant again. 

I feel like I can’t talk about this with anyone because they’ll get annoyed and think I only want to talk about myself. I’m going to therapy, but I’m not sure if it’s working yet. 

I also just lost almost all of my friends because I just had a very bad anxiety episode, and I actually let people see what I was going through. And they all bailed. So I’m afraid to open up to anyone. My husband is deployed now. So it’s just me and my daughter most of the time. 

I don’t know why I posted this. If you read this all the way through, I appreciate you so so much."
Does anyone else feel like they don’t deserve physical affection/ gentle touch?,120,cqwxs4,16,"Was scrolling through twitter earlier and saw a video of two girlfriends talking and one was stroking the other’s hair and holding her hand and I just,, started crying because I can’t ever imagine being the receiver of someone touching me in a nice way. I know it’s common for trauma victims to reject or avoid physical affection, but I really crave it with someone I trust, but I don’t understand why anyone would ever want to touch my skin or my body in a kind way.

The Body Keeps the Score -- Worthwhile Triggers,120,bawge8,31,"I was silly and didn't think thisnbook would be as triggering as it is. I tried listening to it while driving... bad idea. Dissociated while driving, then I would show up to group therapy totally shut down and numb.

It is a great listen, but I just want to put out a warning that it isnt easy. I've been taking it slowly with lots of breaks. Learning a lot but at a cost."
You know what really sucks?,122,axazcq,17,"(TW: Abuse)

That people who were traumatized by abusers have to deal with all of this shit and suffer all the consequences. I wouldn't even be in this position if it weren't for him. I was punished when he abused me, and now I'm still being punished in my adult life, because of what he did to me. He fundamentally changed me, and I can't get my self back. Some people don't know me anymore or wonder why I can't do things like I used to, because that old person before my abuse and before I realized it was abuse is loooooong gone. 

It sucks that I have to deal with this everyday, while he gets off with nothing. I already lost to him before this even begun. "
Can emotional abuse give me PTSD,119,jcaonf,49,"I’m not self diagnosing; I promise, I’m not like that. But it’s hard to ignore the symptoms currently. I’m in the middle of an emotionally abusive relationship with my father. It’s been going on for close to a year. Lately the effects have been getting more severe as the abuse has gotten worse over the past 5 months. I’ve started getting nightmares, intense anxiety when making a mistake or opening up to people in fear of being yelled at for it. I’ve had flashbacks from me crying my eyes out in a bathroom because of it or the times that he made me feel like crap and I couldn’t handle it. The times that he was at his worst have haunted me since they happened. Certain places give me intense anxiety because of bad memories of being there. I’ve had mental breakdowns, panic attacks and emotional outbursts about going over to his house (I mainly spend time at my mums but going to his house makes me feel panicky and anxious). All this can do is snowball into something worse. Does this kind of thing signal something?"
Anyone Else Sick of the Anniversary Effect? *O2*,119,fb6etr,25,"I'm just so damn sick of feeling shitty with thoughts or memories that can feel like they spring out of nowhere because something painful/traumatic happened on or around that time even if it was 10 years ago!

I'm over randomly being unable to honor my commitments or be able to connect with my partner because my brain decided let's be triggered today!

I'm sick of being unable to enjoy things people my age usually do because of my trauma and being the fucking weirdo-buzzkill! All because I grew up so fast just to survive, and it's hard to find people who understand who aren't paid to!

I'm sick of being told to go to therapy when I be been in it since I was 12! I just want to be young and stupid, but I just fucking can't when I know how bad the world can be because I LIVED some of the worst it has to offer.

Does anyone get triggered by things that have nothing to do with your trauma? (TW),122,cn9r9i,52,"I was diagnosed with PTSD 13 years ago. Since then I have figured out all of my triggers and have done my best to work through them. However, I have one trigger that is super random and has nothing to do with what caused my trauma! 

Here is some background-

When I was 5 I was sexually assaulted

When I was 10 I witnessed my dad try and murder my mom. He was on some sort of drugged and just flipped out on her. I'm not going to go into detail because it still makes me shake but it was horrifying.

When I was 14 I was raped.

All of my triggers from these are triggers you could imagine. I have one trigger though that is super random?! Whenever I am in a car and it starts to storm or if i am in a car with a driver who drives somewhat fast I immediately get triggered and break down into an episode. I have no idea why this happens? This trigger is bigger than all of my other ones too? 

Does anyone else ever go through something like this? I'm just always so confused over it."
My trauma isn’t bad enough to justify my symptoms,119,c40v88,26,"Does anyone else feel like your trauma isn’t serious or bad enough to justify the severity of your symptoms? I feel completely disabled by PTSD, but I don’t even think what I went through was /that bad/. It makes me worry that there’s more trauma there that I’m repressing. Or maybe I’m still in denial about the severity of what I’ve gone through? A large part of myself worries that I’m “faking it” for attention, even when I’m having panic attacks or flashbacks alone in my room."
"Anyone ever feel like being safe and loved scares you, cause it is so easy and simultaneously shocking to accept?",122,a8cwkw,19,"I realised this because of a phrase I wrote in a poem earlier to try to process...  It feels like I have been starving for so long and it is so overwhelming to be touched softly and to be pushed to excel and participate in life and they are understanding of it being overwhelming it is even more shocking

and I feel like I am just spending a lot of time being amazed that soft touches and kisses and people that understand exist but also terrified that I'll get used to it and then my abusers will somehow take them away from me, or my inherent lack of worthiness will drive them away.

I don't know if I am ranting, or just sharing but there ya go."
SHOCKED at how much better things have gotten...,117,mdfpuq,27,"I can’t go back in time and say this to myself, so I’ll say it here: PTSD does not have to destroy your life.  You aren’t broken forever, and you aren’t a burden to the people who love you.  Things have the potential to get, not just better, but truly GOOD again.  
I didn’t think I could ever be ok, much less happy, after what happened to me.  I thought I would always be frightened and angry and out of control.  
I am astounded to find that I was wrong.  
I’m not an optimistic person.  I am sardonic and sarcastic and I struggled with depression before I ever encountered trauma.  I tend to roll my eyes real damn hard when people start talking about hope and light and healing.  
But, you know.  There IS hope."
Does anyone else get triggered by anything they wrote around the time of the trauma?,117,joruit,16,Today I accidentally brought my maths book from last year to school instead of my maths book that I'm currently using.  I decided to just use it to avoid getting detention. I opened it up and I ended up getting triggered and getting an emotional flashback. How the hell does some algebra shit that I happened to do in October 2019 (The peak of the trauma) become triggering? What the fuck is wrong with me? Has anyone else got triggered by something they wrote around the time of the trauma?
Can you have PTSD and still be largely functional?,118,j73a9m,47,"I am functional; workout regularly, do my best at work, and I am able to keep up with part-time studies. I get stuff done for my new home and for any other matters in my life. I also lead a small community of women needing support. And meet up with friends regularly. The only difference now is that I stopped partaking in musical instruments as I used to because I don’t have that motivation anymore. And because I am  functioning “well”, I don’t know if PTSD is what I have. I don’t sleep well, have vivid or recurring nightmares/flashbacks. I feel a lot of fear and anxiety. And with that, functioning requires double or triple effort than before. 

Does anyone of you have PTSD but is still functioning or excelling in life?"
I blocked someone who causes me triggers and I feel better.,120,gkqsfs,13,"Man. I told this person to leave me alone. Why?

She was a callous idiot after my accident. She broke my heart, and made me feel  so miserable just 2 days after my accident.  I cried even more because of that and i really wanted to die in that moment. 

After that, i was an idiot. I tried to forget that and give her another chance. 

Let's just say that she took advantage of my affected mental state and made me into a person who did what she wanted for a little comfort from her. But anyway. Half year later, i realized what she was doing to me, and how she even physically hurt me. So, i left her. And I made it clear to her to leave me alone. Thanks to the quarantine, now i could be away in all ways from her. 

Almost. Tonight she started following me on Instagram. I had a little trigger about the accident when i sawed the notification. I wasn't in panic, but it felt bad. So i decided to block her. I don´t know. First i tough that i was been immature. But, now that i'm writing this, i just feel better. Like, in peace. I don't know...

  
I just wanted to vent myself writing this. I think it was the best decision. That person just makes me anxious and makes me fall into flashbacks. There is nothing good in that person. Did I make a good decision? I hope so..."
"I hate hearing ""you just need time""",121,fr7rgy,29,"I'm sure a lot of you can relate. It's all I can do to give this trauma time. I'm aware it will ebb and flow in the future. I'm frustrated about my CURRENT symptoms. I'm non functional right now! I get much more frustrated when I'm told that I ""just need some time"". Especially by my T (who's amazing regardless). 

How do y'all get over the frustration that comes with this? How do you deal with accepting that stuff needs time but feeling ""stuck"" even as it passes?"
"My PTSD is recent and medical related. This pandemic is incredibly damaging. Does anyone else feel functional during the day but once night hits, everything seems to get scary and terrible?",120,foatjr,82,"Cancer related two years of compounded traumas. PTSD has been hell. At night however, my hyper-vigilance kicks into high gear and I get scared. But I’m scared about nothing in particular. Once the sun goes down it seems like every symptom of PTSD gets magnified. I just texted my therapist asking this question but I would really like to hear from other people who have lived through this. I feel silly posting this. Thanks for reading. Stay healthy friends!"
Really cool how every romantic experience I have is retraumatizing on some level,119,cqpymy,17,"It doesn't matter how good the experience is, it doesn't matter who it's with, it's completely anxiety inducing and on some level retraumatizing.

Is it common that people around you think that you are lying about your trauma? (Mentioning suicide),118,cg3blo,34,"I get told that I can't have issues I have since apparently nothing bad ever happened to me. I told these people (my family) about it but they think I lied although I have no history of being a liar. Now I have to live with them thinking I would lie about such a thing to get attention. I deeply regret opening up to these people but I was going to commit suicide and it failed. I wanted them to know why I did it because I thought I was going to die. They just didn't believe anything and I survived my attempt.

Now I was diagnosed with PTSD. I am going to get therapy.

I deeply regret telling these people anything."
Does anyone else feel the “waiting”?,116,byhoo6,27,"Bear with me this might be hard to describe... but all my life I’ve always felt like I need to get “somewhere” I’m not sure where, when, what, how, or why but almost like I’m anxious to just skip ahead to tomorrow even though nothing is different about tomorrow, like there’s something I need to get to but it’s just a feeling. 

I’ve really sorted a lot of toxic crap out of my life and I finally recognize this feeling I’ve always felt since my traumas happened and I’m not sure if I’m just kookoo or if it’s a “PTSD thing”

Edit: it’s comforting to know it’s not just me that experiences this and it could be related to my PTSD and could potentially go away with my EMDR. Thanks for the suggestions of meditation, which I’m horrible at but I’ll definitely keep at it."
You're doing great.,118,aphh5d,14,"I was diagnosed with Cptsd a while ago and I'm not gonna swamp you with methods of how to better control your triggers or your anxiety or trust issues.

Today I stand up to my CEO,122,97rewh,17,"Update: Thank you SO MUCH for the insight, kindness, and support. I read a lot of encouraging comments right before I went in and again after I came out. I practiced what i was going to say over and over again that morning.  I didn't cry or lose my place and I stuck to facts only. One person in upper management in particular really had my back. After the meeting I cried a bunch and then went up and down several flights of stairs over and over until I was ready to go back to work.  I really do appreciate all of the kind words. I'll keep reading them to get myself through the next few weeks as well.

Original:


About 6 weeks ago my boss made a joke about sexual abuse of children. I didn't feel like I could do anything about it because he is the CEO. Shortly after that he made a joke about women in the workplace speaking up about sexual harassment. 

I wound up in partial hospitalization and diagnosed with PTSD related to several traumas including sexual assault I experienced as a child.

I asked for a meeting with all of upper management so that I can start back up at work with clear boundaries for what I won't accept anymore.

This will be a good thing in the end, but right now I feel like I'm going to throw up. Meeting is in 3 hours. Send good vibes please?"
Does anyone else ever feel their PTSD gets in the way of trying to have a relationship?,118,ll30b6,30,"I was raped by a female family member when I was 5 and she was 12. I have only recently regained all these repressed memories  and had a near complete breakdown. It has caused me trust issues that run so deep, the moment I meet someone I’m on guard and expect them to try and hurt me. I feel broken, like I’m too broken to ever have any kind of healthy relationship with another person let alone a partner. I feel like my PTSD is so exhausting to me that I’d never want to push it on another person and I can’t think of many reasons why someone would take the time to understand and listen. It’s too much and it hurts. I feel like any chance at normalcy in my life has been destroyed and I have no idea how to rebuild. It feels very lonely

Edit: Thank you all for your stories and advice. I just wanted to clear that I am in and have been in therapy for a while and it has been beneficial. I know I have a lot of trust issues to work out and hearing and reading everyone sharing and helping one another is the best thing I could’ve asked for."
Mother trying to move on after finding out 12 year out daughter was raped,118,kzg0s5,65,"Edit: WARNING. This horror has become so apart of my life now that I’m use to it. And I forget that it really fucks people up just hearing about it it’s so traumatic. So just to prepare it’s about aggravated sexual assault with young children.


Ok so I found out this summer that my daughter who is 12 now was raped when she was 7 multiple times by my best friends husband. She told me that it finally stopped when she went to her best friend, (my best friends daughter) and asked her to tell her dad to stop. And then it didn’t happen again after that. I called my best friend and told her what I just found out. She was shocked and had doubts but said she would ask her daughter if she remembers that. She called me back an hour later crying cuz her daughter admitted and admitted he’s been raping her too starting when she was 5. His own daughter. she kicked her husband out and we called the police and I’m very happy to say after a week of working with the fbi. my friend got him to confess to it all while the fbi was listening. He’s now in jail waiting trial. Finding this all out has devastated our whole family. My husband had to come home early from his deployment we were so devastated. Months have gone by. I signed My daughter up for trauma counseling and they said after two sessions she doesn’t need trauma counseling. That she has moved on from this and is not traumatized by it. I asked my daughter if that was true and she said yes she just wants to move on and be a normal family again. I tell her ok and say help is there for you if you need it. I know this is what she wants and she doesn’t want this to be our life. but I’m having a hard time moving on and I don’t want to upset her. I can’t stop thinking about it. It doesn’t make sense. How the fuck did I not see this.. how did my friend. not see this. Our family have been so close for the last ten years. We get together 3 times a week for ten years. He was so fucking normal. How did I not see this monster who raped his 3 biological daughters now we know, and my daughter was next to me this whole time. We are both stay at home moms. Our kids are our everything. And these kids were always happy. We never once saw them in pain or saw bloody underwear or saw her crying around him. And they had to have been and I can’t move on from my confusion. How was this massive absolute horror happening for years and no one had a clue. And the guilt. My job is to protect her and I failed. No matter what I do for the rest of her life I have failed as her mother. I don’t know how to not have this be my life. I’m never gonna not be devastated or confused or fulled with so much guilt. Everyone says I need therapy but I don’t see the point. On the outside I’m normal. I’m ok I’m not crying on the couch for days. I’m playing with my kids and my husband and I are great. We really leaned on each other. He agrees with my daughter and wants to move on. I feel like my family is moving forward and I can’t stop thinking about it. Lucky I have my best friend still. And she is the only one who understand what I’m going through. But it’s not the same. She understands that for about two years of my life all my photos are ruined. Every photo from the time she was 6-8 all I think about is was this when she was raped? Is she in pain in this photo and she pretending? My friend understands this because all the photos for the last 18 years are ruined for her. And she feels all this guilt and more. I can’t imagine what she is going though. She lost her husband who she thought they “we’re happy” but realizes it was all a lie. She lost her dream house(that she closed on three days before we found out)She lost 2/3 of her income. And she has the guilt of this happening to her three daughters. She knows what I’m going through more then anyone. But what I’m going through doesn’t even compare to what she’s going though. I don’t want to complain to her about my family going back to normal and happy and I’m just frozen with my thoughts. 

Ok so not I explained what I’m going though I was wondering if anyone has gone through something similar. And I’m wondering if me frozen with my horror in my head is just my normal and I need to except it."
"My abusive ex called me after 3,5 years of no contact and it triggered my ptsd",118,iwdm0n,17,"So my (23f) ex (22m) and I were in a relationship when I was 18. We were together for a year before I broke up with him because he was so abusive.
He used to hit me, gave me a black eye, choked me, told me I deserved all of it, isolated me and made me lose all of my friends and even had me write down rules he had for me.

He was my first bf and it broke me. A month after I broke up with him I met my current bf and we have been together for 3,5 years now, he is amazing. Has always been very patient with me and convinced me to get therapy. I was in therapy for ptsd for a year and it helped a lot. I'm still not where I want to be but I'm ALOT better.

Last night at 10.30 pm I was watching a tv show with my bf and an unknown number called me. I did recognize it from somewhere but I couldn't remember from where. My bf decided to call the number with his phone because he knows I hate being called by random people. A guy picked up and they had a short conversation where my bf asked him why he called me and who he was. The guy just said it didn't matter and hung up.

I recognized his voice immediatly and I had trouble breathing. My bf asked me if I was okay and if I wanted to call him myself. I did and when he picked up he said he called me by accident which I dont believe. I could only get an ""okay"" out of my mouth before he said goodbye and hung up. But I am still freaked out about it.

My boyfriend was really sweet after it happened and kept hugging me and telling me that I'm in good hands now. I just can't get it out of my head. I also had trouble sleeping.

I'm sorry this is so long, I don't even really know why I'm posting this but I just had to share it with someone. Any advice is welcome"
PTSD and jump scares,118,ivz8xu,22,"I'm a 22y/o with PTSD (mostly from a stalker/peeping tom about a year ago) and MDD. I'm feeling so weak today. This morning my friend/roommate jumped out from a closet to scare me (she thought it'd be funny), I screamed and literally fell to the floor and moments later was engulfed in a panic attack + one of the worst series of vivid flashbacks I've ever had. I've never had that happen so painfully in front of someone. She's someone who knows I have PTSD and knows a lot of what I've been through, so I guess I was even surprised she would think that would be funny, I don't blame her though, there's no way she could have known how that would affect me.

&#x200B;

I just feel so stupid and weak and embarrassed and guilty because she felt so bad for scaring me. What a day. I just needed to vent this somewhere. Deep breaths for the rest of the day, in and out."
Learned something new from OBGYN,118,isnyia,28,Backstory: had an ovarian cyst rupture the other day. I had to go for a pelvic exam to make sure it was draining properly and that there were not more cysts. Being that I just turned 21 I had not gotten an exam before. That being said when she was doing the exam she had hinted at the fact that I had pelvic floor problems. My muscles were too tight and as a result I had problems trying to hold a kegel. When I asked her if there was something I could do to train my body and why it happens she told me that it’s normal for women who have had sexual abuse. Sexual abuse is so common and I am so mad that we are not taught about the physical effects that stick with us! I’ve been in therapy for a while to address my complex PTSD yet no one has ever actually talked to me about the fact that pelvic floor disorders are common for sexual assault victims (with vaginas).
Not sure what to do about triggering neighbor and his friends who cat-call me.,120,hxpzz3,30,"I am 39/f sexual abuse survivor x2. I was sexually abused throughout my childhood twice. One included rape.

My neighbor is a construction worker. We do not get along well due to me reporting him for using loud equipment (log splitters, chainsaws) from 6am to midnight and throwing loud parties right outside my bedroom window. The loud parties include screaming, drunk men and are triggering even from inside my house.

He has a lot of construction friends around who like to shout at me. When I try to get the mail, they will scream ""slut"" and stare at me on my porch. I refuse to go outside at all anymore and when I have to go outside to leave it's an instant panic attack.

I went out jogging at 6am this morning (Saturday) thinking he would not be working or outside. One of his friends saw me while driving past and licked his lips while looking at me. I stopped jogging. I was in a heavy t-shirt and sweat pants that did not look revealing at all and still called attention.

It ruined my day and I feel dirty. What can I do?

Edit: I am not allowed to have dogs. I rent and it is in the lease."
oversharing,115,ha33fj,59,"first time posting here... i'm new to this sub. 

do you guys ever overshare? about your trauma specifically? sometimes i find that i can't help but talk about it. something mildly related will come up and i'll blurt out a ptsd joke or something (which usually falls flat, lol). it's always on my mind and i talk about it almost compulsively. i always feel really bad and sick afterward, because i honestly hate people knowing about it, and i'm sure they'll hate me now that i dumped something like that on them. but then i go and do the same thing a few days later. 

idk maybe this is just a me thing?? 

edit: okay so it's not just a me thing, lol. thank you guys so much for sharing. i was sure that there was something horribly wrong with me, because i mean, who the hell wants to talk about their trauma all the time??? but reading all of these responses is a huge relief."
I am hypervigilant all the time and it sucks,114,fxr1se,9,"I feel like i am hypervigilant all the day. I can not concentrate on anything probably, which makes me not be able to get in information when it comes to anything.

 When I am in class I can barely get what the teacher is saying. When I met up a friend in town to have a casual conversation. I don't know how to respond because my brain does not listen to what the other person says. Do you guys have any idé what I can do to better this? medication? coping methods? can one train the brain to become able to concentrate better?"
There is hope for PTSD,118,ezj0pd,14,"I have PTSD. I have experienced several tramas over my life. I witnessed horrific accidents as a young child, was sexually abused, and other events that I do not feel comfortable talking about, even in an anonymous setting. I used drugs and engaged in criminal behaviors in my teens and into my mid twenties. I was arrested 10 years ago and spent time in supervision. I violated my probation and got resentenced. I was ordered my the court to receive mental health treatment. I bounced around from therapist to therapist until I found one who cared about me. I opened up and can say that I have begun healing. I spent 20+ years in turmoil never realizing that PTSD was affecting me in so many ways. It always will affect me but now I have the power to understand it and work through it. You will not heal overnight, but if you truly open up to a therapist that you connect with there is hope."
"As a rape survivor, this whole Kavanaugh affair brings up a lot of unresolved bs",120,9i0btg,47,"Just reading the news makes me spiral. I know exactly how repressing works, and why it’s hard to be honest about your rape. It brings back so many emotions and images that I don’t want in my head, it drives me nuts..

I just wish people would start to take rape more seriously. For me, it completely changed my life and NOT for the better. I know I will probably never be the same person. To see that she has to go through all this ridiculing and threatening, after having been through such a tough and traumatic time, is absolutely heartbreaking to me.

Just wanted to bring that up, nothing more. Hope yall are good, and I love you 💕"
Nightmares You Can't Remember?,115,lqxy41,34,"Does anyone suffer from nightmares that wake them up in the middle of the night, but you cannot remember what they were about when you wake up?

My Lexapro already makes me have such vivid dreams, but I remember them well. But as of a week ago, I have been waking up several times a night in a panic from a nightmare and I don't remember any details.

Anyone else?"
Anyone else completely cut ties with their family because of the abuse?,118,k5h3va,40,"I feel like I don’t have anyone anymore. It’s such a specific pain, and I really need to talk about these decisions, and not feeling anchored to a family, or having roots. I feel so lost and alone. Can anyone relate?"
"An organization I loved posted right-wing propaganda today, and implied I was a pedophile for disagreeing",116,j7tnok,30,"CW:  Sexual assault talk, gaslighting

I've been following this organization for years, and I've loved the work they have done with kids who have trauma.  They host a camp every year that sounds like it has been wonderful.  Mostly they post inspirational quotes for trauma survivors.  They were the first organization I found when I started recognizing my ptsd.  Today, they posted an article about the Netflix/Cuties trial from a right-wing propaganda site with no explanation (now deleted).  I understand that there's a controversy around it.  I have not seen it myself because I worry about my own triggers, so I mostly stay out of those arguments, but I've kept myself informed on what the arguments are.

But I saw a ton of bias in the comments that were allowed versus those the organization deleted.  People who believed the creator's intent were called pedophiles for even having watched the movie.  But those weren't the comments that were deleted.  The ones deleted were the ones that questioned why this was posted in the first place, what the site's intent was, and whether the people posting conspiracy theories knew they were conspiracy theories.

When I confronted the organization about it, they claimed complete ignorance regarding controversy or conspiracy theories.  When I asked why critical comments were deleted, they told me it was because they were political.  When I asked why comments calling people who criticized the post pedophiles were left up, they ignored the question and said I was a pedophile if I didn't support them.

I'm so unbelievably saddened by all of this.  I'm in school to be a therapist so I can help queer kids - kids who are demonized by nearly half my country.  Unrelated, but adding to my stress, my partner made me gather documents to get a passport today because we are worried the US will become too dangerous for us.  This was an organization I had so much trust in, and it seems like they've been eaten up by the dangerous propaganda sweeping my country.   My life was finally coming together and now we're talking about whether we'll need to flee the country and a nonprofit implied I was a pedophile for disagreeing with them.  I'm just so sad, so upset, and I'm running out of coping skills for it all."
Any girls after abuse revert into being cutesy/girly/young etc?,116,iozbq9,50,"Any females who experienced abuse revert back into being timid/girly/or young? 

I used to love edgy/goofy/cool styles but slowly I converted to loving pink/cutesy things/girly/soft styles and just in general all things girly and frilly. 

I’m 27 and feel like I’m acting like a teenage girl again with my style. 
Idk if it’s okay to embrace that since it’s comforting or if it’s something I should be careful with. 

I even find myself acting that way in relationships now too? This is embarrassing but the whole baby girl thing/being protected is so appealing to me now. I don’t want to be a kid or act like one but I do tend to attract to taking on a super submissive or timid like role? Blah

Edit: To the person who DM’s asking if I wanted to be your baby girl.. How tasteless can you possibly be."
"I should have trigger warning stamped on my forehead - just a venting session, no actual triggers",117,i9hw0x,47,"Does anyone else feel like they been through sooo much that trauma or common triggers appear normal except for the fact that most things people learn about you shock them? Is it odd to be triggered by others reactions to your own life? 

For example, say someone asks me about my mom and I say “oh she passed”. Asking about my mom didn’t bother me but watching your jaw drop did. 

The weirdest thing is that I often feel the compulsion to share my traumas when I’m doing poorly but I’m too afraid to over share people into shock. It’s like I try to tell on myself to people I just met that “warning I’m messed up. Traumatized enough to trigger a whole blocks radius. Potential friends have been warned”.

It’s really hard to navigate this pandemic and trying to be active in my community feeling like my very existence is off limits because I have diarrhea of the mouth. Ya know... who does like an ADHD cherry on top."
"How should I proceed with this? Therapist said she doesn’t think I have PTSD, even though I am professionally diagnosed.",120,e9rn5j,44,"I was diagnosed with PTSD a few months ago by a licensed psychologist. I had to get a 2 hour psychological assessment in order for me to get disability accommodations at my university. It was a surprise, but made sense. I never bothered to look at the PTSD symptoms. I always thought I had extreme anxiety mixed with paranoia. 

I have been seeing my therapist for around 5 months now and to say she knows me is a lie. I have not even told her half of the stuff I’ve been through. Part of that is because I think I’m repressing some trauma, but some of it is vague enough to be remembered. 

Anyways, I told her about it and she doubted it and made this confused face. She even said everyone has trauma and basically made me feel invalidated? She even looked up the symptoms on her phone to “rediagnose me”. I really like her as an *eating disorder* therapist, she has helped me very much with my anorexia, but I dunno this made me feel very invalidated and shitty. 

What should I do about it? Does she have a right to doubt it?

Edit: thank you guys so much. I’ve been reading through all the comments and it really means so much to me that you all are supportive. I also appreciate you guys telling me some of your personal experiences. Thank you again ❤️"
Everyone in my life is over my illness,114,c34b7x,22,"I’ve been out of the hospital for 3 weeks. After you try to kill yourself, everyone that you didn’t want to bother before, that you were SURE would be better off without you, comes running. “ALWAYS come to me when you feel like this” they say. “I can’t imagine the world without you” they say. “WE are your family” they say. 

Then they have to get used to the reality that you’re sick and working through things. Trying to get better. They get tired of it. It’s now a bore. 3 weeks in and no one responds to my texts anymore. My friends that I live with...I’m 100% sure they regret having me here. I try to stay out of the way. I tried to be honest at first, because that’s what they said to do, but now I’m going back to keeping it all to myself and my therapist. They don’t actually want to know. And that’s fair tbh.

I don’t think I’ll be able to get better fast enough."
I Hate Male Attention,119,ao5tec,45,"I’ve been diagnosed with PTSD, and lately, I’m struggling with leaving the house due to getting a lot of male attention when I’m out. Last night was my first referee practice for roller derby, and a man i don’t know followed me to my car. This happens a lot. Men follow me and hit on me almost daily, and each time, it feels like nails on a chalkboard to my nerves. My heart races and I start to sweat. I always decline their advances. All in all, I just want to be out in public without being constantly in fear. What would you do?"
My mum called police because I was suicidal,116,mjyk2u,90,"And now I just want to die even more. She could have just sat down with me and talked but instead she got angry and threatened to call emergency if I didn’t stop being emotional. 

It’s 1:30am and I’ve taken valium because I can’t sleep but still all I can think of is the image of this massive hulk of a policeman standing in my bedroom doorway decked out like he’s ready to beat me up.

I already had ptsd. I feel like this is going to make it worse. I feel so humiliated."

Pro tip: wait till therapy to trudge thru your trauma,116,iqhqa9,23,"Like with removing a cast it needs to be professionally done. Don't make my mistakes and assume you feel well enough to process your trauma on your own.

I finally cried,119,gskn2k,16,"Y'all, I finally cried a couple of days ago. I've wept since my most recent trauma, but I hadn't cried yet. This was a HUGE step.

Trauma from starvation (and how it impacts one's relationship to food),116,f11z5b,20,"[CW: disordered eating behaviour/mentions of eating disorders]

Saw someone talk about how suffering from neglect/starvation as a kid fucked up their relationship with food, even long after they were an adult and had a steady income/had no reason to fear going hungry. 

I've heard *countless* stories of foster children having similarly fucked up relationships with food. Hoarding, overeating, constant endless snacking, sometimes ending in full-blown eating disorders. It is so, so, so common among foster children, and it can be extremely difficult for them to overcome. And whenever I see people talk about those stories, or see older people who clearly had/have similar issues, always, the people around me are baffled by it. 

""Why doesn't he just Stop snacking all the time if he's upset about weight gain?"" ""Why is she so obsessed with eating in private?? Why can't she just eat with the rest of us??"" ""That's disgusting, why would you want stockpiles of food in your room when there's plenty of food in the pantry?"" ""They have plenty of money and are in no danger of going hungry, why are they still anxious?""

Even when you explain it's from neglect/trauma/whatever, most people just blank out and get stuck on, ""ok that sucks but they should be fine now?? Just stop?"" and it's..... very sad,,, especially for kids still in the foster system. I've seen so many foster parents get SO FRUSTRATED and angry, they just don't understand, and try to Force the kid to give up their habits, rather than try to understand and slowly work through it with them.

I was never hungry as a kid, I never wanted for food growing up. But after my mom's sudden death when I was a teenager, I became homeless, and I starved. Sometimes because there was just no food around, but sometimes the places I would have to stay/the people who would shelter me would intentionally starve me or withhold food. Burning, gnawing hunger was my conatant background noise, and every day I woke up wondering if I would have anything at all to eat. 

After I finally had an apartment and a job, I ate literally constantly, always carrying a snack around to munch on, every minute of every day. I literally feared the feeling of hunger, it brought me back to those terrifying, uncertain days. I felt the intense, compulsive need to stash away piles of food in my room, feeling like any day I could wake up and the kitchen would be empty, my money would be gone, and I'd have to be afraid again.

I really wish people discussed trauma from starvation/food issues and how it affects people. I would say a huge portion of people who suffer from eating disorders developed those thought patterns and habits from traumatic experiences/associations with food as a kid. Maybe even the vast majority. And that's to say nothing of people who don't have EDs but do have a poor relationship with food."
"Does anyone have PTSD from two totally different traumatic events? TW: abuse, death",112,dodvm2,62,"I have had PTSD for about 5 years from losing someone in front of me, and a few months ago I was in a relationship where I was abused.

You are a warrior,115,d06boi,19,"So today I was at an extreme low again.the whole week got worse every day.

But when I was near giving up, I remembered what my ex told me some years ago.

I was struggling with psychosis and ptsd for around 2 years back then. I felt so weak for not overcoming my demons. I dated this incredible girl, battling with similar issues, so we shared our experiences a lot.

Then one day, she looked me dead serious in the eye and said ""you're a true warrior. You're the strongest person I've ever met.""

This was the most empowering thing anyone ever said to me. I wasn't weak, I was strong for still fighting and battling my demons, I will not give up. I AM a warrior.

You all are. You are the strongest people out there. Thank you for not giving up."

Cannabis use & PTSD Discussion: What strains help your pstd symptoms and what strains do you avoid?,116,k08hcd,85,"Hey folks!  There's lots of cannabis strains and I'm curious to know what some favourites are for curbing your ptsd symptoms.  There are some out there that could trigger symptoms and some that are fantastic.

I know for myself:

* Jack Herer helps clear my thoughts, great for daytime
* Strains with limonene also great for a clearer headspace for me
* any sort of Girl Scout Cookies variety makes me anxious and shaky/trembling, not a fan
* Romulan or a similar heavy hitter gets me to sleep on the toughest nights

What's your go to strain and why?

Human Trafficking Is Absolutely Terrifying!,116,injzu5,12,"The thing about intuition is that you can only sense it before it happens, but it doesn't tell you when or how it's going to happen, and it doesn't tell you how to protect yourself from the danger that gave you the feeling in the first place. I questioned what made this movie about human trafficking give me the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to me, yes, what happened in the movie can happen in real life, but I couldn't even imagine something like that happening to me, because I was fat. A year later, when I was in my twenties, I lost weight, and later, my life began to spiral, and that's when an older guy I met introduced me to cocaine. A few months later he said he is in love with me and asked how I felt about him, I told him he is a great guy, and a great friend, but I love him more like a brother, I apologized to him for not feeling the same, he said it’s okay, he understands, he’s cool with it and I don't have to be sorry. Nothing changed, we hung out twice and everything was okay and normal, on the third day I had such a terrible feeling but I didn't care because I needed cocaine to feel better, as I pulled into the parking lot to meet him, that feeling grew stronger so I asked him if he could come inside my car this time, but he said no because he had already taken it out of the bag and prepared it for me in his car. After I closed my window, I told myself to just relax, because today is no different from any other day, I didn't trust my words of reassurance, so I left my car doors unlocked and when I sat in his car I left the door open with my leg hanging out the door, he asked me to close the door, and I said I can’t because my car is unlocked, that I had to be able to attack whoever tried to steal it, he didn't ask me again, and that calmed me down. He waited until I was high off the cocaine to offer me the weed, I took a few hits and started choking, but he had a full bottle of water for me. As the drugs began to take effect, he started driving with my leg still hanging out the door, if I hadn't been so high, I would have thought to jump out of the car, but instead I shut the door. I have smoked weed before and I mixed it with cocaine, mixed drugs with other drugs and alcohol but none of them had an effect on me like this, something must have been in the water, I think I blacked out, when I opened my eyes we were on the highway, I asked where  are we were going, and then I fell asleep, I kept waking up and passing out. One of the times I woke up, I remember hearing him say that he sells woman and makes a lot of money, and then I fell back asleep, I slept the rest of the way, and when he woke me up, we were parked in someone's driveway. We walked into the house and there was a man standing there with a bottle of vodka, he ordered me to drink it, I said no, and then he and the guy who kidnapped me forced it down my throat. I remember the house, there was no furniture, and in the bedrooms there was a mattress in each room with a blanket and a pillow, but the mattress did not have a bed frame or any furniture. As the two guys spoke in the kitchen, I had the worst feeling I ever had in my life, the l human trafficking movie had crossed my mind, I thought I was never going see my family again, as high and intoxicated as I was, I had to try to find a way out of that house, because I didn't want to find out what might happen to me. I walked into one of the bedrooms to see if I could open the window just in case I needed to quickly escape, the curtain was dark, and the window was boarded up, I remembered when my kidnapper told me he loved me so I asked him if I could speak to him in private, I said it was really important because I can't keep this secret any longer than I have, he walked up to me and asked what is it? I said I lied when I told him I love him like a brother because I was afraid if I was honest with him, it would hurt me if I ever lost him. He asked if I was serious, I said yes and I hugged him tightly, he was totally shocked, excited, and then he told me he will be right back because he had to call off a deal he had made with his friend, I was standing in the empty living room when I heard a glass bottle shatter and I was afraid the friend of the guy who kidnapped me had killed him. When my kidnapper walked into the living room, unharmed, I felt so relieved, the other guy was also unharmed, as we were heading towards the door, I turned my head to the kitchen and saw the bottle of vodka shattered in pieces on the floor, and the guy seemed really angry, because he was silent when I said goodbye to him. On the car ride back to the Walmart where my car was parked, he told me that the deal he made with the guy was not his friend, it was his client, and the deal he made was to sell me, that man was going to buy me, with real money, buy me when I am a human being, not an object. He informed me that the house I had been taken to was the first stop, and I was going to be transported to another house somewhere else, I asked him which location and he said his client couldn't tell him because he knows me personally, it's a security thing to prevent him from coming back to pick me up if he changed his mind after I had been sold. He said he just wanted to be honest with me because he didn't want the beginning of our relationship to begin with a secret hidden from me, especially when it is a secret that involves me, I knew I had to watch what I say because my behavior and my actions were closely monitored, and I was petrified to be taken back to that house. I said, I forgive you baby, because I understand that some people just have to do whatever it takes to make money to support their families, I know that your father had passed away and you are trying to take care of your mother, I said this doesn't change my love for you, nothing ever will change that, he smiled and kissed me, he believed me, he held my hand, and I made sure I didn't let go while I was awake, I felt like it was the right time to close my eyes and sleep because I was still high and intoxicated, so I told him I was going to take a nap, he said, go ahead baby, I love you, and I said I love you too baby. When he woke me up, we were parked next to my car, still feeling petrified that he would take me back to that man's house, as he closely observed my reaction when I looked at my car, I had to keep playing it cool until I was safe, I said in a funny way, wow, nobody stole my car when the doors are all unlocked, he laughed, and then we hugged and kissed each other goodbye, I sat inside my car, acting like I was doing something as I was waiting for him to drive away, and after he drove off, I broke down in tears and thought of all the girls in the world who are victims of human trafficking, all the girls who are being held captive, my heart breaks for them and my heart goes out to them all. I know that I have no right to say that I know how it feels to be a victim of human trafficking, but I felt the terror that comes with it, the fear that I will never see my family again, and the end of my life as I knew it before. This was by far the scariest and most traumatic day I had ever experienced in my life, please do not tell me that I am lucky to have escaped, or that this makes me a brave person because I am not. I feel disgusted with myself and I feel so incredibly guilty for what I said to him, I hate myself for feeling so petrified that I had gone so far as to pretend to be okay with the fact that he sells innocent woman to make money, I wish I said screw my life and stood up for all the victims of human trafficking, I am so sorry. How to identify a human trafficking house? There are high security devices, non-transparent windows, boarded up windows, bars on windows, barbed wire and surveillance cameras in the work or living areas."
I need to talk about last night,117,g1iapf,17,"I've been volenteering as a firefighter even in the mists of COVID-19 outbreak . I know it's dangerous but we got to protect our neighbors and loved ones. About a month ago I was in Nashville when the tornadoes happened and saw first hand of the damage. I was there for 2 weeks after school helping . 

Last night I was driving off the clock and was right infront of a roll over crash . Girl ran a red light and guy had the right away. He flipped 3 times and watching it was like out of a movie. I ran up with a tryna kit I keep in the car and he was stuck in the truck. I had to break through his windshield to get him out . 

After 2 minutes I got in and pulled him out . He had glass in his face and blood was Everywhere. Looking at him I realized I went to school with him and he was my teachers kid. I layed him down and looked for DNR signs (do not resuscitate) and he didn't have any so I proceeded to begin CPR. He woke up to tell me to call his dad and as I called the EMT came in to get him.  .

He did not make it. The lady was under the influence. I feel so ashamed when I was in the class and the teacher wasn't there . I cried in class and feel guilty that I couldn't save him . Hunter I'm so sorry buddy. 

I have flashbacks to that night and I haven't been able to work since that night until I'm cleared. 

If you got this far thank you for listening.  I appreciate it."
I’m angry at the person at fault in my car accident for lying until he got caught,113,lqfg1x,21,"The bastard ran a red light, then lied and said I ran it. It is ok because he still got caught and is being held accountable! It’s the fact that he lied. He didn’t know if I was even alive in the car behind him and damn lied. Not a single fuck was given. I saw him today at the tow company and he looked THROUGH me. I thought he was looking at me, I looked him in the eye and it was like he didn’t see me. I’m so angry, I’m happy legal action is being taken and I’m also talking to lawyers, but thinking about his lack of remorse for the after math of his potentially deadly mistake makes me soooo mad. People keep talking me I’m lucky to be alive, first of all of I was that lucky I wouldn’t have gotten hit in the first place and second of all he’s lucky this little girl can’t take justice into her own hands cause I wanna drag his ass with no remorse like he did my car with my fucking body in it."

I don't know how to convince myself that not everyone hates me,114,gtkhrq,18,"Recently diagnosed with PTSD and I'm going down this rabbit hole of everything I've done my whole life I see in a new light because I'm no longer trying to deny my traumatic past, I'm not sure if that makes sense. My paranoia effects every relationship in my life from random people in public, to classmates, to professors, to my coworkers, and friends, family, and my boyfriend. I just can't believe that everyone doesn't hate me or want to use/abuse/or has some sort of ill intent towards me. My boyfriend is my strongest support and tries his best to help but it's so hard for me and I don't always want to go to him when I need reassurance because he's not my therapist and I don't want him to feel like he always has to fix things or I don't want to burden him or have him take on my stress (he's never called me a burden I just feel guilty sometimes for telling him) and I want to be strong on my own but right now it's so hard. Advice for grounding myself or believing people at face value?"
"How do you explain PTSD to friends/family when you don't have a ""traditional"" experience?",114,gsbia1,28,"I feel like many people associate PTSD with soldiers or sexual assault, and can have a hard time understanding it can stem from a lot of things. I was diagnosed with PTSD after being subject to medical malpractice and living with long term chronic pain and I have a hard time explaining it to people. It doesn't help that a family member is an Army Ranger with PTSD from his time in the Middle East.

What works for you? Or do you keep your experiences very private?"
I hate how PTSD is changing me and I don‘t like who I’m becoming.,118,ej536l,45,"I feel like every single aspect of my personality is affected by it. I have so many problems with regulating my emotions, which is affecting my personal relationships. I lost a lot of joy in things i usually loved doing. I am stressed and tired all the time and i get really snappy. I don‘t like myself like this. 
I plan to start with therapy soon and i hope i can work out some of my problems there, but i can‘t help but think, that some parts of myself are never going to go back to normal.
Before all of this i had finally started liking who i was or at least who i was becoming. It feels like i‘m back to square one.

Anyone else not able to work Anymore? PTSD/Anxiety Disorder,114,km7y4w,62,"I've been struggling with this almost 4 years now and finally applied for social security a week ago. I got fired from my last three jobs for attendance. I haven't worked in a year and struggle to even make a trip through Walmart. I don't even enjoy my only hobby anymore (Gaming) because anxiety always ruins it. It exhausts me even to the point that I have thrown up trying to force my self to keep playing and ignore it. Aside from that my anxiety is constant, usually worse at night and panic attacks are pretty much every other day. I'm not a war hero and my illness is from several traumatic events but I feel like my symptoms aren't normal for just PTSD. My question is does anyone else suffer this illness to the point they can't even go anywhere anymore? It started almost 4 years ago but this last year is when it became ""disabling"" especially after my Mom decided to leave this world, I don't wanna say it but you get the idea. Hope I didn't violate any rules, I'm new."
*Rant* I hate that got ptsd so much right now,113,geiv1n,26,"It's so annoying to have ptsd, because my intelligence has really gone out the bin. I started university with passing all classes, getting new friends, having fun. Then my ptsd started to emerge (i got raped last year) just as i am about to start my bachelor thesis and know it feels like i can't even use all the knowledge i have gained this past two years because the ptsd is blocking my ability to think logically. It's like i can understand what i am reading but i can't come up with new stuff to write. In all honestly i was so happy to finally finish university, but now it feels like i wont even do it, because of my ptsd hindering my brain to process knowledge."
Medical PTSD is resurfacing during this pandemic and I don’t know what to do.,113,fue84g,23,"6 years ago I had a pulmonary embolism and blood clots in my leg. I had open heart surgery, with an awful recovery. I went on to have three minor strokes, and a major stroke that required an 8 hour emergency surgery for which I was awake the whole time. I was in and out of the hospital for a whole year, not sure whether I was going to live or die. I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder that makes my blood clot.

I also have an anxiety disorder and was diagnosed with ptsd following that traumatic year. I have made good strides and most days don’t think about my disorder, and am actually able to walk into hospitals without having a panic attack.

Fast forward to now. I had a major panic attack on my exercise bike because I couldn’t catch my breath and all I could think about is if I get covid this is what it’s going to feel like. I’m now terrified to work out which was a major outlet for me.

After my heart surgery I woke up a bit too early and when I woke up I was intubated. It was the scariest thing I ever felt. You feel like you’re choking and there’s nothing you can do. I can’t get that image out of my head. I try to stay away from the news but I still like to browse reddit.  I just read a scary headline about the death rate of people who need ventilators. I’m terrified I’ll need a ventilator because one third of my lung never recovered from the embolism which means I’m often short of breath when doing physical activity.

Therapy is a no go for me right now, I haven’t got the funds. I just don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m living in hell.

I don’t know if anyone has any suggestions or similar experiences. I really just need something that will help me cope other than alcohol.

Thank you for listening."
Just got triggered by a coke bottle,115,dlma28,10,Grabbed a Coke Zero this morning and just now as I’m lying on the couch noticed it reads “share a coke with [abusers name]” ... now enjoying some fun flashbacks to spice up today’s bland old depression 🤷🏻‍♀️
"Family was narcissistic, contemptuous, abusive, manipulative, critical and showed no support. We're all older now and they want to be ""friends"" and get credit for being the ""parent.""",114,c6l3zo,39,"And I'm not so sure I have the juice to wade into that abyss of depraved need.   I get what Springsteen has said about our job is to honor our parents and not take their struggles and shortcomings further into the generations, but I good deal of that is internal acceptance and decisions about how you conduct yourself, and not necessarily letting the wolf you grew up with back onto the farm, just because you grew up with the wolf.

My therapist supports a respectful and detached distance between me and my family (of origin), which I tend to agree with.  I suppose you can only do what you can, and doing more than that can be harmful, especially after a life of taking on the responsibility of fixing, helping, and taking on the blame for things in other's lives.

Anyone else struggle with this?  So when you see the phone ring, some part of you says you can only be a ""good"" person if you take the call, the subtle, crafty abuse, and somehow agree to change what you're doing to make their life *at least* a little better.  Or don't take the call, and you're a bad person, family member and part of society."

I cannot stand to be touched,109,j62br7,39,"Does any of you experience being touched the slightest as a trigger?

I've had these periods of extreme discomfort when people touch me for many years. I've all along tried to adapt to the culture of hugging and other kinds of friendly touch like someone taking my hand or putting their hands on my shoulder.
My husband is the only one who can still touch me without me wanting to scream because my nervous system reacts so violently to this.

How is your experience with this trigger?
How did you overcome.
I'm starting to tell people close to me to keep a distance to my personal space and NOT touch me the slightest. I just need a break from trying to adjust to this culture.

But do I need to, at any time in the future, to accept that people need hugs and so on?

EDIT:
Thanks to all who shared your experience on this. It's of course terrible to read that we struggle with such a basic thing.
Your ways to handle the trigger inspires me, not only to do something about it, but accept along the way that I don't owe anyone hugs etc. It's a big deal to come to this conclusion for me. 
I have read all the comments, and I appreciate every one of them. Thanks for sharing and caring."
"I can’t accept what happened as trauma because other people have it worse, please help me understand",112,irdcau,29,"
I was exposed to domestic violence throughout my entire childhood, watching my dad beat up my brother (who was the only real friend I had, I was so alone as a child), starve him and he would always verbally abuse all of us. My mom would never say anything I think she also hated my brother. When I was 10, I accidentally realised he is actually my cousin and not my brother (no one ever cared to explain this to me), he then left us and eventhough I see him now, we never lived as a family again. 
eventhough I think these series of events is what gave me borderline personality disorder later in life and feelings of constant guilt; I have a hard time accepting this as a trauma that happened to me, because my brother suffered the most and also in general people who are traumatised have been through much worse. Please help me 
Is this trauma? 
How can I talk about this to my therapist? (The only time I told a therapist about this 2 years ago, it got worse and  I started having flashbacks) when I have flashbacks I beat myself so I feel less guilty and can experience what he did"

Seriously? I guess I can just get over this whole PTSD thing by forgetting about it and moving on.


EDIT: Thank you so much everyone for the advice. I never thought my mother might be narcissistic until you mentioned it and it all makes sense. I've decided not to let her sit in with me. She would use the session to manipulate it and try to defend herself. 

EDIT 2: I wanted to offer some more context. My mother has been very controlling all of my life. I recently started to set boundaries with her, which is something I've never done before 
. She thinks it's my wife's influence and says that she is turning her against me. None of this has anything to do with my my wife."

Started a new job and not even 2 weeks in and he found me.,110,ejhsbf,28,"This is gonna be a mess I’m still shaking so sorry for those that read it. His cousin seen me at work yesterday, I run a kitchen in a market downtown. I was so scared to start this new job as we use to hang out in this market all the time, he use to live a few blocks away. I thought he moved. I guess not. Anyways, his cousin was in line for food and I scooted to the back with what I thought was without him seeing me.  I guess not. First thing this morning he’s here with his cousin. There are two sides to my restaurant, a dessert and lunch side and then my restaurant so luckily we weren’t open yet but the other side was. He looked me dead in the eyes. I’m never going to get that image out of my mind. It’s been 5 years and I still see his face in my nightmares. If I close my eyes right now I can see it clear as day. I could draw it down to every detail. My staff are telling me to not think about. My fiancé says it’ll be okay. My mom says he can’t do anything. But they don’t understand. They don’t get the sheer panic I felt when I locked eyes with him. The strong instinct to run. And now the pure regret I didn’t go out there and lay him out flat. The anger is building and I can’t stop it. I’m shaking I’m still so full of adrenaline and this was over an hour ago. I’m currently hiding in the washroom trying to collect my thoughts before we get smoked over lunch or I’ll be a disaster and I need to lead my team through but right now I don’t want to be a leader. I want to go home, curl up on my sofa, play LOTR as loud as I can and hold my cats and cry.... then the anger comes back and how badly I wanna hide. Why? Why should I hide? Why am I so fucking scared after 5 years of being free! Then the image of his face. Then the panic. And then it loops.... and keeps looping... I feel powerless against mind."

Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream...,116,8gse7u,26,"I’ve been thinking of how to explain what PTSD is for me, and I thought I would share.

Having PTSD is like being afraid of ice cream. You LIKE ice cream. You WANT ice cream. Most of the time, when you think of ice cream, you have positive happy feelings. You look forward to it.

But because of PTSD, sometimes, you irrationally fear ice cream. Sometimes, when someone offers you ice cream, you become SO AFRAID and you don’t know why. So afraid that you can’t think. Sometimes ice cream makes you want to throw up. You want run away at the sight of ice cream. You want to CRY because that’s how scared you are. Your brain goes, what am I doing?! I like ice cream. I’ve been craving ice cream. And yet here I am, running out of the door when I see ice cream. Shoving it back in your face. Getting angry at you, because I’m convinced this ice cream is poisoned, even without proof, because it was once before. Blacking out if I try to eat it. Going completely numb.

Even when you’re experiencing it, it doesn’t make sense. It makes no more sense than fearing ice cream. It’s like there’s you, then there’s the ice cream, then there’s a third version of you which is PTSD, standing in your way. And it is a bummer, because you’re over here having panic attacks while other people are happily enjoying their ice cream. That is what PTSD is to me - liking ice cream, but also fearing ice cream, and never knowing which way you will feel."
Instant anger and anxiety when someone taps me,109,l6kxs5,41,"I have PTSD from a traumatic and abusive childhood. I don’t know if the PTSD  and anger at being repetitively touched are related, but I’m trying to find some answers or at least someone who experiences the same thing. 

When someone taps me repetitively, pats me, or touches me repetitively in any way I am INSTANTLY enraged and intensely anxious. My heart rate spikes, I have to consciously prevent myself from lashing out, and I want to cry. But if someone touches me once with firm pressure, I’m completely fine. It’s not that I hate being touched across the board. It’s just the repetitive touching.  

Does anyone else experience this?"
Does anyone else hear screaming in their head? I just need to know,109,jgceoc,49,"It doesn't feel like a hallucination, because it's my screaming and I know it's not real. Does that count as a hallucination? It feels like every scream I can't let out floats around inside me until my body forces it out."
PTSD from riots. Feeling so alienated,114,izyzod,27,"I live in a city where there was significant rioting at the end of May. I was present some nights of protesting and rioting, and live in the neighborhood where riots occurred. the area I live in is also low income, has a lot of homeless people and encampments that the cops keep sweeping. It's been pretty miserable and things are only getting worse. Ever since the riots I've been on edge waiting for there to be more protests around me.

I live near a hospital with a helipad and when the helicopters get too loud I freak out. Last night a shit ton of cop cars were lined up outside my house getting ready to arrest protesters. I could hear them joking around in their cars from my porch. I can see everyone around me on edge. At some point it hit me how fucking hard it is to live this way.

The protesters never made me feel unsafe. Even people rioting and looting didn't worry me that much. It was the fucking nazis running around and the cops tear gassing me and my friends and laughing while they bulldoze tents.

And I have to go about my life like everything is normal. I work as a college TA and I feel so disconnected from everyone. It feels like they've been living in a completely different city from me these last three months. I can't even give a fuck about COVID anymore. I feel like I couldn't even begin to tell most people everything that happened to me this summer. Like they wouldn't even believe me or if they did they'd be horrified.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the kind words and advice. I was hesitant to post because I know that the critics of these protests can be quite loud, but I'm very pleased that there were very few ass holes (one got deleted by a mod before I even saw it, thanks for that). I'm feeling much better than I did when I made this post, I was really shaken by all the cops outside my house and once I was able to be alone with my thoughts I lost it for a bit.

RE: Therapy I definitely have reservations about it for a number of reasons but I'll definitely be looking into some work I can do on my own and possibly EMDR since I've had it recommended before. I've said this to people before but as horrific as things have been I am still SO lucky to have a safe home to live in, stable income, and a very strong support network of close friends. I had a few IRL friends reach out to me because they could tell I was struggling.

I do hope that reading this gave some people who weren't close to any riots some perspective on how damaging the current state of affairs is. I am not the only one who feels this way. I'm white, I've only had to experience this kind of violence very recently, I can't imagine growing up with this level of fear."
I judge other people for being open about their PTSD because I’m ashamed,107,gddt0n,43,"I don’t like this about myself, but I’m very critical of other people sharing their experiences of PTSD in public or in broad social circles. My immediate family and closest friends know that I have it, but telling anyone else feels wrong and shameful. I feel like being open about it is admitting weakness because I can’t force my brain to cooperate. When people I know talk about having PTSD on Facebook or at dinner I can’t help thinking that they are admitting they are weak. I forced myself to get through high school and undergrad despite being constantly apathetic, angry, and suicidal. It was terrible and I wouldn’t want anyone else to attempt that, yet I think the people I know who are on disability for their PTSD are somehow unworthy. I know this is a huge reflection of my own insecurity and that it’s wrong. Has anyone else felt like this?"
Good guy Food Lion,112,c3iano,6,"I was just in Food Lion and they had a big sign near their fireworks. The sign stated ""Please be a good neighbor and be mindful that unannounced ignition near military veterans and some people and some pets may be traumatic""

As someone who personally abhors fireworks and becomes a complete mess on July 4th I really appreciated this sign! It spoke of multiple groups and brought some attention to PTSD that a normal person may not consider. 

Not a corporate shill, just pleasantly surprised."
FUCK.,112,bvlier,42,"Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck it that's all I can fucking say. FUCK. Do you know what I mean? Please fuck please if one fucking person could just know what I fucking mean for fucking once. No one fucking understands, and how could they.

I'm so fucking tired. I don't want awkward silence. I don't want fucking frowny emoji faces. I just want one person who understands.

Edit: Thank you all so much."
"To the guy on here that posted that anyone with non combat related ptsd are pansies and should stfu, you are wrong and here is why",109,41k64a,25,"(This is super long)

You know, I've never fully revealed on here why I have PTSD. I've just given the gist. But let me tell you my story, and why don't you tell me if I can ""Just get over it"" and ""my ptsd is not real ptsd""

My story starts with my high school sweetheart. Together since 16 and we married as soon as I turned 18. But when we got married, things started to change. Little things. He would become jealous when he wasn't previously a jealous person. He started to be controlling. Then he started to get angry. Then one day, I don't remember the reason, but it was when the physical violence started. He choked me until I passed out. I thought maybe this was a one time thing. But no. Stupid scared and naive 18yo me wanted to make a marriage work. His jealously became worse and he stared to hit me when we argued, over the most trivial things I might add (like who ate the last doughnut), he would hit me for that too. He'd grab my arm so hard there'd be bruises where his fingers were pressing. He constantly tried to convince me that we should kill ourselves together. 

Then, 3 months into our marriage, I had the worst experience of my life. He had gotten mad at me for spending too long over at a friends house and accused me of seeing another guy there. So he put me in ""the hole"". In our house, there was a loose board in the stairs that you could pry open, revealing the ground underneath the stairs. He put me in the hole and the other stair boards were nailed in, I was too short to reach the lose one. He left me in there for 3 days with no light. He would only open the board to throw water and granola bars at me, and occasionally try to urinate on me. I sat in that hole in the corner for 3 days and nights. I screamed but no one could hear. Finally, he pulls up the board and pulls me out. He tells me to get cleaned up and hurry, I have 10 minutes. It turns out, my parents had just called him and said they were coming to stay the weekend with us. I was too scared to tell them and I am ashamed of that. 

The night they left, I asked him if he would get off of the computer so I could use the phone to call my (gay) best friend (we had dialup). He then became angry. He flipped the computer table and it fell to the ground. He accused me of cheating on him with my gay friend, that he wasnt really gay and that we had been having an affair and playing him for a fool all along.

I had never seen him this angry, so I ran to the bathroom and locked myself in. Thankfully my cell phone was in there and I called my gay friend (who lived a block away) And i told him that it was bad and was scared and to get a friend (Brad) to come over and help me. Well husband broke down the bathroom door (he was 6'5 250lbs) and pulled me out to the living room. He told me to sit on the couch while he went to get something. I ran to my room but he caught me before I got there. He dragged me on the floor by my hair back to the living room. He had gotten a shotgun and he pointed it at me and he told me that he was going to kill me and then kill himself. At this moment, (I found out later that my gay friend and Brad had peeked through the window and saw husband with the gun) Brad opens the door really fast. Husband happened to be standing close enough to it that it hit him in the back and it knocked him over. Brad took me by the hand and we left. I have never seen my husband again.

So there is my story of why I have PTSD.  I want you to tell me now if my PTSD isn't ""real"" PTSD because I wasn't in combat.

To the guy who posted, you are a fool. Combat veterans arent the only people in the world that have PTSD. And for you to make a post suggesting that anyone with ""childhood trauma"" doesn't really have PTSD and should just deal with their problems like adults, you make me sick. "
Just got a message from the detective in charge of my case that my attacker is being brought in for a formal interview in the next few days and I'm triggered to shit,110,k64ycv,27,"I manage to push down all the memories and feelings between the times they contact me, but as soon as they do, everything comes flooding back and the enormity of the whole thing (the SA itself, the aftermath, the investigation, what I will go through in court), slaps me in the face. I become panicky, irritable, unable to think. 

I'm doing this completely alone and I've no one to talk to about it. I wish I couldn't remember anything at all"
Don't want physical affection after going through significant trauma unrelated to sexual abuse— is this normal?,111,jebpnp,38,"I recently spent about 3-4 weeks in the hospital. After being found unconscious in my apartment for 1.5 days, it was discovered I had Toxic Shock Syndrome, which caused multi-organ failure. After recovering from TSS and getting out of the hospital, I caught COVID & Pneumonia and had to spend another week or so in the hospital. 

I've been out of the hospital for several weeks now, but I'm dealing with losing my hair and my body is still recovering. 

Since this all happened, I haven't wanted to be physically affectionate. I'm currently home with my family & they all want to hug me and whatnot, but I just don't want to be touched. My mom asks me for hugs daily, and it's really starting to wear me down with guilt. I've explained I just don't want to be touched, but she then gets all sad about it. 

Also, I feel somewhat detached from myself & the moment during sex and general intimacy with my boyfriend. It's not a constant thing, but it seems to be more of the norm for me now.

I just would like to understand why I'm having this reaction."
I am starting to get angry at him,112,hdi262,23,"I was violently raped 20 yrs ago and pushed it away for nearly 20 yrs. I barely felt anything about it or about him. Even though I was in the grip of a roaring case of undiagnosed PTSD. Now I have gone through a 6 week inpatient trauma treatment.  Even after that I felt nothing but compassion for my abuser... I always thought that he  didn’t realize how badly he was harming me, even though there was blood, even though I was saying, stop, you are hurting me. Even though he was lifting my body up off the couch with every blow of his fist. 

Two days ago I was triggered and had to ride out some horrendous flashbacks.  And for the first time, as I felt myself back in the bathroom where I had gotten away from him, where I was trying to stop the slow of blood, I felt anger toward him. I realized: this man knew EXACTLY what he was doing. He knew he was being violent, he knew he was harming me. And I was probably not the only woman he raped so viciously. For the first time I wanted to kick down that bathroom door and come back at him... I wanted to kick him and pummel him and claw his face and scream until he heard me. I wanted to beat him bloody. For the first time I did not excuse him. 

I think I might have made an important step forward. 

Fuck that man."
I finished therapy today [SUCCESS POST],110,d340zf,13,"I finished my sessions with my therapist today because I don't feel like I need to go anymore. I've finally gotten to a point now where I realized that I can handle things that are thrown at me, that my emotions are real, and that even though I have PTSD it doesn't define the person that I am.

In spite of what happened to me, I've been able to move forward. I am strong, and resilient, and capable. I'm lucky to be alive. I've been able to take care of myself and build up my own stability.

The dissociations have lessened. I've let go of all the anger and pain that I held onto. While letting go has been terrifying, holding on was infinitely more damaging. I'm facing my problems head on, instead of avoiding them. I understand my emotions, even the hard ones and that they will pass. In a very real way, I am good enough and deserve love and kindness, especially from myself.

It's taken me a lot of work to get to this point. But I want you all to know it's doable. I love you all and hope that things get brighter for you, because they've gotten brighter for me. There's a life that is waiting for me to build it, so I'm going to go and get to work :)"
"Does anyone else struggle with black and white thinking? And if so, how have you worked through it?",110,cybtdx,24,"Title, essentially, but a bit more of an explanation below.

&#x200B;

I really struggle with black and white thinking when it comes to people. Either someone **hates** me, or they **love** me. I really struggle to see the shades of grey there, such as a friend being tired and snappy with me does not mean they suddenly hate me, but that is exactly how my brain keeps interpreting it. It's exhausting.

My boyfriend, who loves me to pieces, is hungover today. He is tired, and probably burnt out as I had major flashbacks last night as I too was very drunk (lesson learnt, cutting out alcohol). As you can imagine, he was a bit short with me, and a bit out of it, like anyone would be after experiencing all that. So, the man needs space, *which should be fine, acceptable, and reasonable.* What does my brain think? ""He's going to DUMP YOU, he doesn't love you anymore! You pushed him too hard!"" etc, etc... The truth? He. Needs. Space. He's tired! AHHHH.

And it's not only with him I'm like this, this is pretty much every single interaction I've had with every single person both on and offline. I'm constantly doubting, I'm worried they'll snap, that I'm one bad interaction away from something bad happening. I can only understand that people like me when I'm with them physically, and boy ain't the trusted ones my BEST FRIENDS FOR LIFE ^((pls keep me safe))...

&#x200B;

I can see where my black and white thinking is coming from, it's just exhausting that it's there, and I want to stop it. Any advice?"
I don’t know if anyone cares but my dad died 5 years ago today.,112,bd8r6h,16,"At 7:23pm my dad passed away five years ago today. I have been on edge all day. Sneaking off to the walking fridge to cry when I don’t have too many tickets in the window.

Sunday’s are always hard because of brunch. Staff and guests are always trying. I needed a moment and my boss told me to deal with it. 

I’m trying ok. I really am but there is a lot I didn’t get to say to him and a lot he didn’t get to do.

He was an amazing scientist. It’s part of what killed him. He wanted to do a lot more work and research into diseases and the blood/brain barrier. But his lab forced him to retire early and he took it personally. 

He made the test for AIDS/HIV, Hepatitis A,B, and C, West Nile, and Chagas’ disease. 

I just want to tell him I love him one last time..."
"Does anyone look at their own posts from the immediate past and think ""Who the fuck wrote these things?""",110,lz4b0l,15,"I'm in a sober, clearheaded state atm and I struggle with cringing at some of the stuff I said in a bad way, the ""fuck, I sounded like an asshole"" way.
I was never an angry person and I'm dealing with the fact my head compartmentalized things in such a way that when I observe myself now as a whole, I feel like I should recognize better when I feel angry and I'm doing things defensively. I tend to be oblivious of my faults at those times.
But on the other hand, if I focus on my faults I have a hard time speaking for myself because my head is 100% focused on ""I fucked up"", I can't place what the other person's done in perspective. I give up too much on myself. 

How do you guys reconcile this? I'm aware it's because I'm very co-dependent. 
In my head I believe that in a bad interaction in a relationship one bad thing does not justify another, within reasonableness. We all have to see our part and pull our own weight, but I feel so two-sided when it comes to this. I keep having the urge to go to past me and tell him to look at what he's typing, and to check his emotional state before he says anything."

Every 5 minutes of every day I forget that she is gone. I don’t sleep because if I do I wake up and it hurts. I do not sleep because every time I close my eyes I just see her staring at me crying as of that day when everything happened. I can’t bring myself to talk about it, not many people know, not even my parents know and no one believes me and What I saw hurts me and it really hurts me that no one can just believe me.

Feeling like I manipulate everyone,111,j6rmx9,35,"I have been gaslit many many times. It is not the source of my trauma but more like a byproduct of ignoring PTSD for many years. I feel now when I am honest,  or people sympathize for me I feel I manipulated them. If someone says im nice/cool/smart i think how did i trick them into that im so horrible. But really idk if Id even know how to even gaslight someone. Is this a common experience? Id like to not feel alone."
Came dangerously close to ending it last night,110,j2pdnj,33,"I didn't mean to. I'm a retired Army veteran with 6 combat deployments. I've struggled with suicide in the past related to my ptsd. I was medically retired in 2017 for a plethora of things including PTSD. This was after 17 years of service.
Last night, things were really dark for me... Feeling disproportionate anger and uncontrollable depression. My wife of 15 years and I were fighting. I don't have any guns as my wife doesn't want them around the kids (12 and 14 yrs old). I did have a razor sharp knife (a Karambit) and I was quick it moving from hand to hand, wrist to wrist, wondering how quickly the end would come for me.. before I talk sized it, I hit my wrist, slashing and stabbing into my skin just shy of my radial artery and vein. It didn't really hurt as I have nerve damage in my arm so I didn't feel the initial cut. I didn't really think about killing myself, it was more passive suicidal ideation. I was lucky I was wearing a rain jacket. It kept the blood pooled in the sleeve. It was about 6 to 8 oz. I was able to use direct pressure and used an alganate bandage to help stop bleeding... Didn't say anything to my wife about it. Just told her my jacket got dirty and I nicked my arm. No big deal.

Everything is so screwed up. I was doing so well in therapy.... Then things just fell apart..."
Made me laugh,110,gt6a3u,9,"Even though a lot of my PTSD symptoms are pretty well controlled, I still always thrash a lot in my sleep.

It happened to me again later in life but it was nowhere near as ""bad"" and just something a lot of women go through and since I was able to talk through the 10 year old thing I feel like I should be fixed now? But now my therapist told me about compounded trauma from multiple traumatic events? This is such bullshit, I thought if I could voice this whole memory and acknowledged it was to my past self and stop having flash backs of it then it would all go away.  There really isn't a point to this post but I'm just angry. If I didn't have multiple people hurt me in my life then this would be a lot easier to overcome and I thought I was done.

A 12 year old should not have to hear and see the things that i did.

It's left me with cPTSD and a couple other problems I've been dealing with for  a while.

These are things that alone, would be and were traumatizing, but in the grand scheme of my childhood weren't all that bad and can make people laugh so I don't mind talking about it. In fact, I went most of my life thinking these things were normal, and now that I know they definitely are not, I like to talk about them.

Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?,109,cpdzvg,24,"Anyone else get triggered and feel unsafe around unorganized/spontaneous people?

I am actually technically an ENFP so at my core, I can be pretty spontaneous, unpredictable, and disorganized myself. However, my manager part (Internal Family Systems Part) is very organized, impatient, efficient, logical and perfectionistic. My manager comes out frequently when I need to protect myself and take control of myself and surroundings. At this time in my life, I notice I feel triggered and unsafe around people and especially those who are supposed to take care of me when they are disorganized and unpredictable. I need to know they have my back and can catch me if I fall. I crave calm, logical, organized, and predictable people. I cannot stand when I am around people who are indecisive and make decisions in a flash based on their feelings. I notice I feel a lot of anxiety in relationships with people like this as it triggers my insecure attachment. 

I have learned that people with a traumatic background often benefit from structure and stability to assist in regulating emotions. Recently, I have had some bad experiences with my surgeon and therapist that makes me distrust their expertise. They both are laid back, unorganized and forgetful. When I notice these traits, my manager comes out and takes the role of being the organized person. I feel stressed and hypervigilant doing this as it is not even who I truly am at my best as an ENFP. I feel annoyed and impatient around them as they appear lazy and passive. I feel like I do not trust them to take care of me due to their qualities such as not calling me when they said they would. I know this is definitely related to my trauma background where my abusers were often unpredictable and you never knew what their next move would be so you had to be on edge and hypervigilant. I wonder if I should switch therapists because when I take on the manager role, it gets in the way of me doing EMDR because my exile has a hard time coming out when my manager is so present. 

I know no one is perfect and they have traits that very logical people lack such as gentleness and warmth. But I really think I thrive when people can balance me out and I feel safer when my doctors are more logical and organized. I also know once I heal more from my trauma,  I will be able to feel less triggered and unsafe around people with these qualities. 

 I really struggle with working with people like this! Does anyone else relate?"

College professor humiliated me,106,bdws89,25,"I got bullied really bad as a kid, and it was mostly humiliation. I tried to kill myself as a kid before, I dropped out of high school in freshman year but decided that I should man up, get my GED and go to college. I did that and now I'm in college, and I'm in this math class where the professor wants everyone to participate. So here is the thing, I'm not doing so well in this class because I'm forced to answer questions out loud in front of people, risking embarrassment, but guess what, my worst nightmare fucking happened yesterday.

My professor looks at me

""This problem is super easy, thats why I picked YOU""

Come on, we've all been worried about you, we know you can do it""  


""we believe in you, even George W Bush did, thats why he passed the no child left behind law, all for YOU""

He's saying all of that shit, and my ears end up ringing, and I just don't answer anything. I have no idea if the class laughed at me or not, but I was so fucking humiliated that I just wanted to fucking kill him right there. After class, I just go home and I started crying and punching everything, throwing everything. I can't fucking believe this is happening to me again, why the fuck do people do this to me?? I'm having a mental breakdown right now and I'm crying nonstop and I'm a grown fucking man. How do I stop this?

Realized my dreams are actually nightmares and now I'm rethinking what's normal,106,mbk1t4,20,"I was diagnosed with PTSD last week, which didn't surprise me - I'm a survivor of child sexual abuse and spent 25 years living in shame from that abuse. I went to a psychologist for an ADHD evaluation and instead got diagnosed with PTSD and depression. Since then, I've been thinking about something the psychologist pointed out.

He asked me if I have nightmares and my immediate reaction was no. But then I started thinking and remembered that sometimes, I wake up afraid and crying and can't remember the dream. And then there's also this weird thing about me and my dreams where I'm always being chased or hunted, but those aren't nightmares because I have them all the time and they don't make me afraid. Possibly because I never get caught. I just can never escape - I always have to keep running.

He called those nightmares. I talked to some friends last night and they agreed. And now I'm recalibrating what a nightmare is, because..... they're right. Which means that my ""dreams"" are mostly nightmares and have been for 20+ years and I never knew it. Because I didn't know what a nightmare was and thought these were normal.

Can't help but wonder what else is PTSD that's just been normal for me."

Less Talked About Symptom,106,d1sam3,31,Been doing lots of research to try to understand my diagnosis more and stumbled across a variety of academic journals that explained the prevalence and correlation of gastrointestinal issues and childhood sexual abuse. It’s not talked about much (because talking about bowel movements is not exactly the most fun thing to bring up in conversation) but it’s actually super common to develop chronic constipation/diarrhea/IBS that are not caused by any medical issue (i.e. no tumors or other medical cause). Just thought I’d mention it in here bc I’ve struggled with gastrointestinal issues since childhood and had no idea it was a symptom of PTSD.
Unworthy of a diagnosis,106,ce72sg,40,"Sometimes I can't help but feel like I don't deserve to be diagnosed with PTSD. I can't help but compare my situation with that of veterans, domestic violence survivors or rape survivors feel like I don't deserve to be as traumatized by what happened to me as I am.
I had a college classmate that I was becoming friendly with, come up behind me, grab me by my throat and drag me backwards, completely unprovoked. My college refused to protect me and tried to get him a private attorney to fight my charges against him in court.
It's hard being so young with a PTSD diagnosis because everyone, myself included, is inclined to dismiss me and say I'm too young to have gone through enough trauma to induce PTSD.
Does anyone have some advice for how to overcome this feeling?

Edit: Thank you so much for the gold! Seriously made a darker day brighter :)"
DAE hate the rape fantasies posted in this comments section of justiceporn type subreddits?,111,bgityi,18,"As a man who was raped, I find these comments super triggering. Additionally, someone can’t believe it’s never the victims fault while also believing that someone should be raped because of something they did. Rape isn’t an acceptable form of punishment. But, in a place where I should be able to celebrate justice, I get a bunch of rape fantasy comments. Does it bother anyone else?"
holy crap,107,b41hbs,17,"i haven’t had a serious suicidal thought for this whole week now!

I’m somewhere between shock, tears, or just plain old happiness. I never thought i’d get here but, i’m glad i am now. Even if i do relapse i’m gonna remember this week as a good one. :’3"
does anyone else find those *trigger warnings and safe spaces* somewhat damaging towards PTSD in that it wont be taken as seriously?,107,7h43js,22,"I feel like pc culture has done a wonder of good, for use of language, ideas of understanding and changing the world to help all people and no just one race or gender, to clarify my opinion//

but I feel like it also dismisses PTSD ALOT because of the use of PTSD language for general use, such as you are triggering me is a very very common phrase to express discomfort of something, but because the PTSD language is used so widely now, it wont be taken as seriously. 

Is all this sensitiveness dissmissing the people who purely are getting triggered from trauma, and have serve mental health issues.

My trauma and mental illness will be validated now more than ever, but I also feel that the seriousness of PTSD isn't in the same box as plain trigger culture and shouldn't be placed in that box because of how serious it is."
Anybody else listen to intense music to cope with their intense feelings of hate and anger and a feeling of being about to explode?,110,j8alnv,42,It’s like a release valve. I change it to be like one after. My favourite track so far is wild international by one day as a lion. It’s just got such straight direct energy and always seems to shift things along to something else less intense or more emotional and back to my flowing base introspective emotions after I’ve heard it. Anybody else have any favourite songs to go to? Or perhaps a playlist? Especially those that feel “violent” or like a measured sense of intensity that one can feel one is riding and surfing to have it bounce around inside one’s mind and walls as a result. My experience was a violent attack and this is what I have had to work through in the middle of the night to get it all out of myself.
Anyone else experience breathing difficulty with their PTSD?,106,j1hgr8,19,"For months now it’s felt like there’s this rock in my chest blocking airflow to my lungs. I have to breathe extra hard, or through my mouth to get the air around the “rock” and get a full, deep breath."
I cant relax until everyone in the house is asleep.,107,i70kmj,8,"I spent years listening to the abuse in my household. My father chose his battles carefully, but it got to a point where my stepmom would just scream so the whole house could hear what was going on. Im constantly hyper vigilant when people are awake and moving around in the house. The only time i feel completely comfortable is if i cheat with alcohol or be a night owl. Most nights its usually alcohol, but if not, i have to have weed or nicotine. However, my tolerance for both is very high, and my alcohol tolerance is getting back up there.

When you wake up from a nightmare and can't tolerate physical affection from the person you love,109,fjgqmc,7,"TW: Sexual assault reference

I woke up from a trauma-related nightmare and my partner was in bed next to me. He didn't know I had been having a nightmare and I didn't say anything about it. Within a very short time of me being awake, he put his mouth on me in a silly, affectionate way (I think he maybe pretended to bite my arm or something similar) and I cringed away from him SO HARD. It was like I could feel the ""other person's"" mouth on me and I just couldn't handle it. Then I felt like such a dick because my reaction hurt my partner's feelings since there was zero context and I wasn't in a space to be able to verbalize anything in that moment other than ""I don't like that right now."" Fucking stupid how visceral that shit can still be, even now."
Entering my room without permission,108,f8qp5q,17,"I live in student housing and today, whilst I was sleeping after an all nighter in the library, a man walked in my room in a baggy hoody and baggy trousers.

"I want to post a sign at my desk that says ""PTSD: Please Stop Throwing Things At Me.""",108,f53zqf,30,"I wear earbuds at work because we have an open office floor plan & the background noise is distracting. Twice last week guys I know & get along with threw things at me to get my attention instead of walking over, using the chat on our computers, or just rolling their chair over 4ft & tapping on my shoulder or desk. Both rank higher than I, but I don't report to either. This triggered me, especially the second time when I was struck in the back of the head. It didn't hurt, but both times it set off my symptoms & I had to hide it & carry on with what they wanted to discuss. 

I haven't reported my PTSD to HR under the ADA, because so far I haven't needed accommodations. But I almost flipped out into defensive ""fight"" mode both times this happened & would have definitely gotten in trouble for it if I had.

Thoughts on my sign idea?

Edit update: thank you so much everyone! I put a note saying ""Please don't throw stuff at me, I startle easily. Thanks!"" on my dry-erase board & the guys that were throwing stuff came over & proactively apologized. Now they just come tap on my desk in my field of view. After that, I also notified HR of my CPTSD & Generalized Anxiety Disorder & that was much easier & less scary than I thought it would be. Couldn't have done any of it without you folks!"
ny fiance almost died in my arms.,109,dkmo7o,18,"On Sunday morning Sept 8th, my fiance tried to climb out of our bedroom window and i found her hanging from it. I called our roomates screaming and yelling to help me hold her while I went to get help. I went to the second floor noone answered, went to the first noone answered so my only choice was to go to the backyard and hope to catch her or i don't really know. She slipped out of my roomates hands and fell on the concrete right in front of my eyes. I heard the skull crack and then she started bleeding out of her head, ears, nose, and mouth. I held her in my hands telling her ti stay with me and she did. She was breathing very faintly but she lived. She survived a 30 foot fall. She is a living miracle. I have ptsd and i wake up everyday hoping i dont get any flashbacks or hear the impact but it's inevitable. I have a daughter so i am back at our home now but she is at her mothers house. She hasn't  come back home. She fractured her skull, her ribs, and punctured her lung. She is now even jogging! Slowly but jogging and well everything else takes time. I feel angry, and scared and confused. After living in the hospital for weeks then at her moms for a week, i can't seem to go back to her moms. What do I do?"

"Didn't realize how much I was numbing and escaping emotions with alcohol, until I quit drinking. It's been 6 months and the process is hell but I've already started to regain my life",108,bv7f0j,8,"I suffer with schizoaffective disorder and PTSD. I quit drinking in December once I was able to get a glimpse of how unmanageable my life had become. 
I had no idea how much of the emotions and life i was running away from and numbing. 6 months later and the suffering is so much more manageable and tolerable, but the suffering of getting clean was a big part of life and all emotions coming back full definition. 

I had so many walls and blockers up from the numbing of the alcohol that the day would not pass by normally, I felt stuck in the day. My subconscious just keeps going it seems, just trying to process all the new.

But I have broke the habit. I can deal with my new emotions again, I just feel a little raw and feel like I'm carrying my hurt around, but with time and venting it will all get better.

I'm now on my way of getting my life out of apathy, neglect and numbness and under achieving into a clean slate with all the room and will and tools to achieve. There's more to sobriety than just not drinking I'm realizing and AA is helping me keep on a good path without alcohol while I uncover this new feeling life.

I really appreciate the space to vent, thank you"
"Wanted to cry from happiness and success, therapist didn’t invalidate me for request",106,bobzvk,6,"Whenever I talk about my trauma, I have the worst time standing in front of someone or sitting down because it reminds me of when I had to recount it in a college case manager’s office (university is the place of trauma and it left a rough mark on me,)

I found a new therapist and today I asked if it would be okay if I could talk laying down on the couch. Granted I felt like a fool and I had my feet hanging off of it. But I told her this was the only way I’d feel comfortable and how it wouldn’t remind me of the feeling of “being in trouble”.

Unlike my last therapist, she didn’t give me a weird look or try to question it. She just simply told me to lay back and I was able to open up a little bit more once I laid down and looked at the ceiling. One day at a time.

 I left feeling good because I didn’t feel like I’d been stared at the whole time and like I was having to list off my story to the hundredth person. I think that’s the only way I’ll be able to get through these sessions. It feels almost comical because I know the stereotype of a counselors office is laying in a chair haha."
"""Shut up. You don't have PTSD.""",103,bjj3sf,24,"\-- Is what my brother said to me about a year ago. I didn't know how to argue because 1. He spent a large chunk of my childhood in the same house as me and was unaware of how things were actually going for me, and 2. I wasn't actually diagnosed.  I knew that I couldn't argue it, or even know for sure that that's what I was struggling with, without a diagnosis. So, I quietly shamed myself for speaking out and moved on. 

&#x200B;

Welp. On Monday, I asked my therapist if she had diagnosed me with anything. She asked, ""Would you like to be diagnosed with something?"" and I told her that I just wanted to figure out why I feel so on-the-outside/different from other people. I've always called it, ""constantly feeling alone in a crowded room."" She calls it ""disassociation."" I've obviously heard this term before, but had no idea that was what I was referring to, makes sense now. I thought we would go through a few things to see what I may have, but she went straight to PTSD, which was a bit alarming for me. I instantly heard my brothers words in my head. ""Shut up. You don't have PTSD."" And as we went through the questions and discussion, I heard his words in my head again and again. When we finally finished, she informed me that I do, in fact, have PTSD. I was just kind of like... ""Oh. Okay."" and there came that emotional numbness I'm so fond of.

&#x200B;

It's nice to know, because it explains a lot. I understand where my anxiety, depression, night terrors, flash backs, hypervigilance, poor concentration and poor memory come from. I just thought I got dealt a shit hand or something! It's really nice to be able to say, NO, I am this way because of *this* and it **can** be dealt with/managed. I'm really happy to finally feel like I'm a part of a community and to be able to understand myself a bit more. I'm really happy to find this subreddit and read through all the tools & peoples stories. Glad to know I'm not alone."
Laughed at for jumpiness,106,ayilxm,22,"Anyone ever get laughed at for how easily startled you are? I jump at everything. It's really bad when I'm watching a movie...even if it's not scary, if there's any loud noise or tension, I'll jump. People think it's funny...we were watching a movie in one of my classes a couple weeks ago, and the guys behind me laughed when I jumped at something. It doesn't necessarily bother me because they don't know better, but sometimes I just want to tell people it's not a funny quirk, it's because I was abused and assaulted and am constantly on alert. (Honestly, I think even my ex - who was the one who assaulted me - laughed at it. And HE should have known better, because I explained my PTSD to him.)"

I feel like I don't know where I am for a brief moment. My surroundings appear strange, and I am shocked to be my current age. It's a feeling of ""why am I here and not back in time?"". It's hard to describe. I spoke to my therapist about it and it might have to do with parts of me still being stuck at the general age of traumatic events. So waking up here and now I feel like I don't know how I got here. It only lasts momentarily but it's definitely disturbing for that brief amount of time.

You can't ignore PTSD.,110,l4fjm6,46,"In our society, we tend to think that we are failures if life takes us off our planned path. But are we really failures? I’d like to make the argument that when life takes us off course, we can forge a new way forward.

When I was a firefighter, I pushed myself well beyond my mental abilities; thinking I could just shake off the traumatic events I witnessed and get back on the rig for the next call.

I suppose this myth I was telling my self worked for a while, or, so I had thought. Turns out, that I was not coping at all; I was, in fact, doing more and more damage.

Knowing your mental limits

When the time came that my mental strength was all but exhausted, I felt defeated; like I had failed. After all, none of my colleagues seem to be having this issue. On the day I resigned, I felt like a complete and utter failure. To add to this perceived failure, was this head to toe feeling of weakness and shame.

A DOUBLE WHAMMY

Who knew that pushing through my mental pain would be such a bad idea? I really wish I had known at the time; it may have saved the rest of my life from coming unravelled. However, my reality has been forged by the fact that I didn’t know.

Due to my decisions to keep fighting on with no regard for my mental health, I lost; my feelings of failure were compounded by the fact that I had recognized my illness too late. Perhaps its more accurate to say that I pushed it down and packed my trauma so tight that it finally snapped.

Whichever was the case, the mental pain my fire service days had leached into every facet of my life. This sad reality I faced would include my work life too.

Like what you are reading? Try Path To Mental Healing.

Making my living as a health care worker was not an easy one to say the least. I had witnessed some pretty traumatic incidents there too. While this was my was also my reality, the cornerstone for my PTSD without question, stemmed from the fire service.

Regardless, I had mentally bled out for far too long and before I knew it, my mistaken resilience crumbled under the weight of my mental illness. Only a few short years after calling it quits as a volunteer firefighter, I would find myself making an exit from my workplace as well; proving that you can’t ignore PTSD, it will indeed, get you in the end.

IS FAILURE SUCH A BAD THING?

While I thought for years after I left the service that I had failed at everything I loved; I’m happy to say that I was wrong. Failure is just a conduit for success so long as you keep moving forward. Doing what I have to do, has been slowly leading me down the road to mental wellness and as a result, I have discovered new passions along the way.

When every aspect of my life went off the rails, I turned to writing in a desperate attempt to sort out what was going on inside my head. Consequently, a new passion was ignited; a love for writing.

You can’t ignore PTSD, this is true but if you are manning up, shoving it down or in just plain old denial, please know that when PTSD becomes too much, there is life after the military or emergency services. Failure is an option as long as you understand this: PTSD or any mental illness is not something you choose to have and secondly; as humans, we are gifted with the ability to discover other passions. So in that regard, no matter what we go through in life, we can always find something that gives us our love for life back.

How do I (30m) support and live together with my gf (26f) with complex PTSD without burning myself out?,102,kgh4ci,31,"My girlfriend of 1 year has severe complex PTSD and mild dissociative disorder (DID) symptoms. She also had cancer as a kid, and now has rather severe energy issues and some other weird after-effects. She's lovely and she let me know right from the start, so I knew what I was stepping into. Things went quite well and we managed greatly, and she's even doing quite a bit better. However, things took a decline after we decided to move into a new house together.

So her PTSD originates from long-term abuse by a malicious partner when she was young. We're still not sure what exactly it is that he did, but brainwashing puts it pretty close. Currently it manifests in twitching and full-on panic attacks at temperature changes, loud noises, jump-scares, feelings of abandonment and lack of daily structures. When it's really bad, DID pops up and I get to see some of her alts (which isn't really that bad, it's quite fun, but it wears her out and I also cannot do anything else than be there with her at that time). Sex is a different cookie altogether, and it's basically only enjoyable for her if I take a completely dominant role. For me this is still pleasurable, but also exhausting, so I never actually relax during sex, so on top of these problems is that she wants it more than me and me not wanting it as much plays 100% into her abandonment anxiety / 'not being sexy' anxiety.

As a partner I'm now struggling and at the brink of burning out myself because I'm too busy with keeping her ticking over while at the same time also running the household since she can't really do *as* much due to her energy issues. We have had a BDSM power-exchange dynamic going on for a while, though this takes a lot of time and effort and it has gotten to a point where I don't necessarily feel the freedom to go do stuff just for myself anymore, since I feel that without guidance she will simply not do anything because of her anxiety - it makes me feel guilty for taking time for myself, even though she specifically tells me that I should first and foremost take care of myself. Again, she is lovely.

We both don't have a job and that's not going to change anytime soon, and I find my days filled with stress of figuring out how I can get her needs met (I am/was a very laid-back and ""oh we'll see and maybe we do nothing thats also fine"" person, borderline lazy), and I can't seem to meet my own without feeling guilty about 'dropping' her. I also can't see myself doing this forever, which is problematic. 

We now have almost daily heavy talks that are burning us both out, about things that are bothering us, how she lacks structure, how I'm perceived lazy, how the lack of sex and BDSM play is affecting her (or rather, the not knowing when the next time we'll play will be), while I don't really want to a-priori plan those things. The result is that she crashes and burns on the lack of those before I felt like I wanted to do them out of my own motivation/urge/will, and after that happens the next time we do something then by definition feels like a 'fix for her PTSD', a must-do chore. This plays into her anxiety that I'm just doing it for her and don't actually like it myself, and I never get to prove that I do like it myself but just not that often. We can't seem to get out of that cycle. 

Also at this point my libido has hit a low due to the stress, so there's a nice feedback loop going on.

I was hoping to get some advice here on how you guys deal with partners with PTSD, especially the cases that require a decent amount of caregiving from the partners side. How do you deal with meeting their needs, but also upholding your own? And how do you deal with it if upholding your own means their needs are not met?

Are there any resources someone could point me to that help partners of someone with PTSD?

Thanks, and sorry for the long story."
The sad reason why I don't watch TV or movies,104,jwk86o,43,"I don't own a tv. I never have and never will. I don't watch movies (a select few) I hate watching movies with friends and find every excuse not too.
They think I'm just a boring person they don't get how I survive without these in my life.
I never tell them it's because I live with a lifetime of ptsd depression flashbacks and my life is like a seesaw an art of balancing to stop triggers flying up.
Most things I watch hurt me. I feel so stupid not been able to break the two apart. 
I feel so stupid not been able to explain to people

20 Fast interventions for panic and dissociation.,103,ih0b7f,16,"**Body**

1. **Choose a particular group of muscles and try to maintain awareness of them despite the panic or dissociation. Tense them as tightly as you can and then force them to relax. Stay with the experience of the muscle group trying to relax.** 
2. **Choose a food with a strong flavor like mint, chocolate, cheese, or a pickle. Hold the food on your tongue and stay mindfully aware of the sensation of taste. Notice how different parts of your tongue taste different flavors.**
3. **Find something with a strong texture, like a soft blanket or a cool stone. Feel the item and be mindful of the experience. Try and pull yourself back into the world around you through the connection.** 
4. **Smell a strongly scented item, like peppermint oil or a scented candle. If possible choose a scent that reminds you of a pleasant place or memory. Try and reconnect with your senses and your environment by experiencing the strong smell. Notice what the smell makes you think about or feel in your body.**
5. **Laying under an “anxiety” blanket or weighted blanket can be a stimulating somatic experience. If you don't have one, try lying under several heavy blankets to slow your heart rate and calm down.** 
6. **Rub a mentholated lotion around the neck and chest when you notice panic starting. There are many brands like Blue Stop ™ that are marketed for arthritis and muscle pain. The cooling sensation can help you reconnect with your body and slow your heart rate.** 
7. **Wrap a frozen bag of peas in a towel and put it across your forehead and eyes. This will activate the body’s natural “dive response”.  When the head becomes colder than the rest of the body, your body thinks it is diving into deep water and will slow your heart rate and relax muscles to save oxygen.**

# Mind

1. **Make a mantra about the fear, negative belief, or trigger for your panic or dissociation. This should be something that reminds you that you are ok and that the belief about the trauma is not true right now. Eg. “I am safe, I am free” or “my past is not my future” or “I am loving, I am loved”. Repeat the mantra to yourself when you notice the distressing belief taking hold.** 
2. **Break down what you are currently doing into a series of steps, and repeat back to yourself the steps of what you are doing in a deconstructed way. Remember that you are competent and that these are easy things to do. Eg. “I am turning on my blinker at the intersection” or “I am putting peanut butter on the bread”.**
3. **Go through your phone or a mental calendar of future events and realize that this moment is just one part of the rest of your life. Go through your schedule and realize that right now is just one minute of the next hour of the next day of the next week of the next year. Think about things that you are excited to do in the future. Think of ways you can prepare for them.** 
4. **Try and put your finger on the exact emotions that you are feeling. “Overwhelmed” or “freaked out” are not emotions. Try and specifically describe your experience. Ask yourself if your current reality necessitates this experience. Try and discover if you are feeling scared, vulnerable or angry in this moment. If so, try and figure out who or what you are directing these emotions toward.**  
5. **The “stuck memory” of the trauma remembers the muscle groups that were tightened during the trauma. It remembers the way that you wanted to move your body's posture to protect yourself. Most importantly it remembers the way that you felt about yourself during the trauma. you may have wanted to curl up into a ball or stand up and fight. You may have thought that you were dirty, weak, small, or foolish. remind yourself that the traumatic belief you had about yourself during the trauma is not true. Also, try and move your posture into the opposite position the trauma belief makes it want to move into. Relax all muscle groups that want to tighten.**

# Soul 

1. **Think of an object or a place that you find beautiful. Look up a picture on your phone if you have access to one. Think about what you find beautiful about this object or place. Notice all of the things that you appreciate about the beauty of this place or object. Eg. pictures of the beach or a famous painting or sculpture** 
2. **Think about someone you love and feel safe with.  Think about what it is that you love about them. Think about this person and try and cultivate compassion for them. Feel yourself move from isolation to connection, and fear to compassion. If a word or phrase jumps out at you that represents this relationship to you, then repeat it to yourself in your head. Eg. Trust, kindness, safety**
3. **Think of your whole life like a giant web. Imagine yourself at the center and the strands of the web as your connections to others. Think of all the people that you love. Imagine where they are right now and when you will see them again. Imagine that the strings of the web run out from you to where your loved ones are in the world..** 
4. **Creativity requires us to get outside our own immediate experiences and reconnect with our resilient self. Draw a picture with anything you have, pen and napkin or toe in the dirt. Think about how you want to feel and try and express that feeling however you can. Hum a tune or sing a song if that is more appealing to you. When you feel that you are out of the immediate experience of the panic or dissociation, do a more complex creative activity that you find healing. Bake a cake, paint pictures, write a short poem, or make yourself do a small home improvement project. Reconnecting with our creative image and spatial processing part of the brain allows us to draw new connections and create new learned experience that helps us process trauma.** 
5. **Go to a space that you find calming, spiritual, or that feeds you in a personal way. Walk in the woods, sit by a lake, bird watch, attend a religious service, watch a theater piece, or go for a scenic drive. Find a space where you feel like you are calm, safe, and can start to be yourself again.**  
6. **Try to find your center or mindful self during the experience of the panic or dissociation. Think about the essence, psyche, or soul of yourself as a person. Feel how this anxiety, panic and dissociative episode is holding you back from being present like you would like to be. Ask yourself, what in me do I need to leave behind so the rest of me can become what I want to be? Ask yourself, what enlarges what I am, and what restricts who I am? Visualize yourself taking off or moving away from the anxiety experience. Realize that it is hurting you and not helping you right now.

I GOT A PHONE CALL TODAY AND IM GETTING A CALL TO SORT OUT A COUNSELLOR,106,htxln3,7,"Im so happy man.

I was kinda a dumb teenager who figured I could “do it myself” but now as a adult I know I can’t do that so I’m super excited to be getting help.

AHHHHHH"
Anyone else have trauma resulting from inpatient mental hospital stays?,108,gwkzpz,64,"Mental hospitals are fucking abhorrent environments, even in the 21st century. They cause far more harm than good toward most of their patients. I had the misfortune of being sent to two of them in 2018, and the second time was far worse (not that the first one was a picnic, mind you).

In August of that year I suffered a crippling nervous breakdown that was triggered by a myriad of factors, a breakdown that a now-ex-friend called a ""manic episode"". This resulted in me being cruelly misdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder ""wItH pSyChOtIc FeAtUrEs"", which is a fucking crock of shit if ever I've heard one. I don't run around the streets naked screaming ""I'm God"", I don't smear my own shit on the walls, and I've never fucking hallucinated in my life. Yet still I am officially branded a psychopath. The only delusion I was under during this period was that I thought I actually *was* going insane. I went along with my torture because I was too weakened to advocate for myself.

If you want a detailed account of just what made my sentence in a nuthouse so abhorrent, look for a post I made entitled ""My trial by fire at Backwoods"" on the subreddit r/psychwardchronicles. I don't care to revisit all the gory details, you can see them for yourself on that post.

I will say right off the bat that these fucking cancerous institutions are committing a human rights violation by confiscating their patients' phones and music players. I know that sounds hyperbolic and whiny, but blasting music has always been a way to silence (or at least muffle) all the screams in my head. I mainly gravitate toward extreme metal because it screams for me when I can't scream myself. To deprive me of that in my most vulnerable and fragile moments is like breaking someone's legs and then kicking their crutches out from under them.

Oh, and not to mention witnessing daily brawls between patients, being surrounded by whackjobs who were way further off the deep end than myself, being forced to take zombifying doses of so-called ""anti-psychotic"" meds as a condition of your release, and patients getting forcibly injected in the asshole with Halidol. Those things weren't exactly pleasant. 

I still get frequent PTSD flashbacks to that Godforsaken shithole. I would like to go back there with my boyfriend though, just once, to take a piss on the grounds and smoke a joint and blow smoke in the useless amateur piece of shit p-doc's face. I think that would give me closure.

I don't believe in inpatient care. Only if a person is a credible threat to themself or another, and all other means of outpatient treatment have been exhausted, should sending a person to one of those places even be considered. 

I vow that I will never let myself be sent to another one of those ghettos of the soul for the rest of my life. 

Does anyone else have any similar experiences and insights they can offer? Thanks for reading,  and take care of yourselves during this extraordinary era."
Ex left because of my PTSD,103,givdcp,20,"Over quarantine my ex and I were going strong of 3 years. He texts me saying he can't deal with my issues anymore and that I don't seem to be changing.  I broke down and just immediately felt all these triggering feelings of abandonment, worthlessness, unloved, used. Even though he never said any of these or implied it just knowing that my issues have broken a long term relationship especially since we have been through many other trials and have been fine. I just don't know what to do and it's so triggering.

Edit: I more than appreciate all of your kind words, it's been real rough"
DAE get to that point of disassociation where you can’t even look in the mirror. bc you don’t recognise yourself. Like everything just feels wrong?,108,f04mzb,11,
Validation for everyone who needs it,105,euf4ol,17,"You doubt your feelings regarding a certain event because when it happend you remembered it as maybe it wasn’t that traumatic, maybe it didn’t affect you so much, you feel like you handled it just fine but then in the present you suddenly get overwhelmed with pain, grief and fear and you try to stuff it down because no iT wAsN‘t ThAt BaD and you keep convincing yourself you’re overreacting because you keep thinking it wasn’t that bad and it didn’t even matter. 

When it happened it could be that you were still really young or directly faced with the danger or you were in an unsafe environment where you couldn’t freely express yourself but the thing is it didn’t hurt so bad then because you were unable to both feel that amount of pain and survive. Children’s bodies are not capable of withstanding traumatic amount of pain and survivng. That pain is repressed and dissociated until you‘re strong enough and able to survive it. You can’t allow yourself to feel pain and fear that would make you extremely vulnerable and therefore less likely to survive. So the body settles on dissociation and represses the feelings until you’re strong and safe enough to process them properly. 

Only reason it „didn’t feel so bad“ is that your body saved you. The amount of pain, terror and anger you’re feeling now is exactly how bad it was and how badly you were hurt. You’re not overreacting or making a big deal out of it you were unable to feel how bad it was before. Your reactions are not wrong, your feelings are not wrong, it really was that bad but you’re strong enough to get through this now! 

Every „episode“ you have is one step closer to healing, because each time you feel a bit of your repressed feelings but only as much as you can bear and the amount of pain will be less and less the more you process it. It’s a long way but you got this!"
Diagnosed with complex PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder today after a few weeks of assessment. Was told that my score was Severe for both. I'm not doing okay.,104,degtyl,38,"I have been having a rough few months and I feel very unsafe and vulnerable lately. Hearing the news today made me question how I'm feeling and I don't think I'm okay. I wasn't expecting to be told that my symptoms and such were that severe. I feel normal but sad and anxious alot. And I have nightmares and intrusive thoughts but I am still coping okay. I have been dealing with this for a long time though, so this must have just been my new normal. 

Does anyone have any experience with complex PTSD? I don't know a lot about it."
An annoying thing about PTSD and recovery...,104,capbqk,42,"Recovering from PTSD is a pain in the ass. And like a basket of enraged 400 lb primates throwing shit everywhere there’s some elements about it I was surprised to discover.

One of them is how annoyed you’ll feel dealing with bullshit that wasn’t yours to begin with.

You’re just a normal person bebopping through life like a bunny in a green field of fresh grasses when along comes some flaming fuckhead shitshow and rains on your parade.

Wonderful. Just fucking wonder-fucking-ful. You didn’t ask for this and now you got all this extra work *on top* of just trying to live your life. Fuck.

So now you’re juggling weapons grade resentment and the justified anger while working really hard to fake your happiness and not get fired from your job because bills don’t give a shit about your mental health.

Ya feel?

Look. It’s normal that you feel that way. It’s cool. You’re not the only angry bastard pissed off at how unfair it all is.

So give voice to that shit in a safe place: your journal, here, your therapist, that life sized rubber duck you bought because the inanimate object will listen to you and the other rubber thing is too fuckin’ weird and you just want to get through life without getting triggered. Scream at the goddamn duck.

Be angry. Connect with your feels. Give a middle finger to toxic masculinity and pour your rage into lifting weights or whatever helps you burn off all that hypergolic fuel so you can function and get one small step closer to that normal life you know you deserve.

Give voice to the injustice. Your anger and rage is justified. It’s ok. Connecting to your emotions is work. 

Just like recovery is just work.

You got this."
"DAE have episodes when they blank out/emotionally flatline? I call these ""grey outs"".",107,c24p5c,40,"I've been getting these for a while. Now almost every day I have issues with dissociation type episodes and I'm not sure what's causing them. Mindfulness sometimes helps break me out of it.

I have periods when my mind completely blanks out. This is on a spectrum. I've had many times when I just freeze and become an empty statue for some unknown amount of time. I can't respond to people. I don't know what's going on. I'm not even thinking anything. Just a statue.

Less severe episodes will have my emotions blank out and it's like I feel nothing at all. I become very stupid and make a lot of idiotic mistakes or break things accidentally. It's really frustrating and this lesser severe type episode happens almost daily. It's really ruining my life... :/

I've had difficulty finding counselors who are willing to treat my PTSD. Dx 2010. A lot of the counselors I've seen said I'm not ready to go over my various traumas, just day-to-day stuff.

I've been on lots of meds, but none seem to do much. Some made me worse actually. I'm on lamotrigine (for possible bipolar, they're not sure I have it), and olanzapine for sleep/nightmares. Anxiety meds don't do anything. :/ (at least not clonopin, vistaril, gabapentin).

I can only find CBT therapists, but DBT is apparently generally the best for PTSD."

My mentally handicapped brother ate his guinea pig alive,106,a5vs5q,17,"So, some of you may have seen my post from /r/advice end up on the front page. I never really took PTSD seriously before, other than obvious cases like war vets coming home, parents with dead kids, etc.   


Boy, was I ignorant. Some quick background if you didn't see my original post in /r/advice:  

I am the 30 year old brother of a 22 year old man who has the functionality/mental capacity of an 8 year old. He has seizure disorder, autism, and a plethora of other issues due to oxygen deprivation at birth. This past sunday I witnessed him eat part of his pet guinea pig alive. I ended up calling 911, and he is currently in 72 hour observation at a mental health facility.    


At first I thought it was awful but something I could easily get past. I've seen some messed up stuff online, but this was a new horror.   
 

Things are happening to me now that I don't really understand and I'm concerned it's stress related or PTSD. I woke up last night with cold sweats and was having extremely vivid nightmares. I had what a think was a panic attack this morning after looking at facebook and seeing my parents house. Just the sight of the house itself and it was like I was reliving the whole ordeal. I took work off for next couple days while I recuperate but I'm not sure what to think. Is it too soon for PTSD? Am I just being dramatic?  

Just looking for some help."
Telling my Psychologist about my childhood trauma,106,mayqbe,28,"Friday I I have a session booked with my psychologist..

"DAE have the most gruesome, horrifying, gory nightmares with precise detail?",104,j239hi,59,"I've had ptsd for over 5 years, and only in the past few months I have progressed to nightmares I never thought anyone could experience. If I could describe them, it would be like they are traumatizing - doubt it, but that's how it feels during the dream.

Usually they involve someone(s) trying to murder me. They hunt down and murder other people and then progress to me, and its a very long torturous dream and the way they murder people is extremely creative in gore. I think the storyline is linked to someone in real life who was going to murder me at one point, on a daily basis, and I spent most of my life trying to escape and convince this person not to kill me, so I can see the link. What I don't get is why recently they are now extraordinarily, shockingly gory and detailed. Its like the bloody, creative deaths you'd see in some artsy horror film, and I rarely ever have watched horror films, and get turned off by gore. I have no interest in thinking up creative gore scenes where people are tortured and murdered slowly and horribly, but that is what my dreams are now about. I have seen shit you would never think someone could dream up or imagine. I have never seen a film with shit like this in it. \*\*I don't know where my brain gets these ideas from\*\*.

Before they got extreme, they were still horrifying, same kind of storyline, trying not to get killed, being tortured, but not so vivid, not so gory, not gory x 1000. I wake up from these dreams and cry. I never want to go back to sleep. They do not happen every night. I can't figure out if something in my life triggered this. I have no idea why I get them this bad now. The dreams themselves feel traumatizing, because I believe it is happening during them, I believe my life is in danger. 

Does anyone else connect with this? Do you have an idea why my nightmares have changed and gotten so much worse? Why I have gore in them to a level unimaginable when I don't even watch gore, and nothing specifically bloody gory I witnessed before....horrifying shit I've seen, but not gore. Definitely threats of gory things happening to me and people I loved, but it didn't happen.....shit guys I didn't even think it was possible to have dreams like these."
How to deal with embarrassment after having a flashback in front of other people?,103,iof851,36,"A few nights ago I was in a car, drunk, when the driver (my friend) got pulled over. That immediately triggered me and I started to hyperventilate. It took over two hours for me to calm down (after uncontrollable sobbing and multiple panic attacks). I definitely ruined the mood for the night. I even got me and some of my friends kicked out of the place we were supposed to be staying at, simply due to the fact that I was making the host uncomfortable. 

Everything is a blur, but according to some of my friends, I pissed off a lot of people that night. I’m absolutely humiliated- in front of a group of 12ish people, some of whom I barely know, I broke down and had one of the worst flashbacks of my life. Many of the people dislike me now, and I don’t know what to do. 

This is effecting me a lot more than I would like to admit.  The memories, the triggers, and above all, the pure humiliation just from thinking about it is absolutely energy draining. Flashbacks are already really hard to deal with, but on top of that the negative social aspect of it all really took a toll on me. 

How do I move on? And how do I apologize? I feel so bad for killing everyone’s vibe."
"My girlfriend experiences PTSD flashbacks from sex, how can we overcome this?",108,g8mzdf,43,"Throwaway account for anonymity. My girlfriend (20) experienced a frightening amount of sexual abuse as a child, and now cannot achieve orgasm without experiencing a traumatic flashback. 

This isn't about my personal want for sex. I'm willing to be as patient as I need, and I want her to be able to live a normal life without her having to avoid sex. As it stands, we're early in the relationship and are still building trust. I'm still discovering her triggers and I want to be able to help her cope with them so that she can enjoy sex. Her previous relationships with guys have all ended poorly and she told me this has been a factor. 

I've been doing some research on PTSD and I was hoping that you all could point me towards some resources for this specific issue. If anyone has experienced the same thing, I'd like to know how you've been able or unable to cope with the triggers and avoid traumatic flashbacks. 

I apologize in advance for my ignorance on the subject. Thank you."
Can a traumatic childhood past lead to issues with intimacy and sexual orientation perception as an adult?,108,f5r4eg,41,"Hi! I'm new to this sub but was looking for some insight. 

I (22F) grew up in a household where my sister, mother, and I suffered frequent verbal, emotional, psychological, and physical abuse at the hands of my narcissitic/manipulative father. On top of this, our mother enabled our father's behavior, and when my older sister finally cut ties with them as an adult, they  stalked her and called her crazy for asking them to attend counseling with her for the abuse she had endured. Now that I'm essentially the age she was then, and I have taken the steps to cut ties with my parents, my sister and I are finally able to have a real relationship after years of our abusers keeping us apart and basically divide and conquering us.

So there's my backstory and here's the gist of what I wanted to ask. I pretty much pushed my traumatic past under the rug and didn't validate it for what it was for all of college because I went to college where I grew up and felt it was too hard to realize my past in the same place my parents lived. It wasn't until last fall when my long term boyfriend (23M) and I moved to a city to start our post grad lives. I was finally out of my hometown and away from my parents physically. Then all of a sudden I was hit with immense feelings of isolation, depression, OCD fears, relationship anxieties, and general sadness. It was like all of my childhood trauma resurfaced at once and I was just drowning in it. I had panic attacks after speaking on the phone with my mother, got on SSRI, even took myself to a mental health crisis center at one point. One of my low points to say the least. So I knew I had to go to therapy, and I started therapy for my trauma. I did and it has been somewhat helpful but obviously digging up trauma can mess with your mind a lot. It's very difficult.

My problem now is that since last fall when all this began, I haven't been able to see intimacy the same. Nowadays, I dissociate multiple times a week (something I did on and off growing up), and I feel like I don't know how to be a sexual being anymore. It tears me down because I love my partner a d never had these issues with intimacy with him early on in our relationship,  and now I feel like a stranger in bed. It makes me doubt our connection and whether I am really in love because of that wall that comes up. 

I wondered if anyone knew insights about how childhood trauma affects ones ability to be sexually intimate ( I was not sexually abused as a child, but I was physically). 

I mentioned sexual orientation in the post title because I have identified as bisexual since before entering I to my current relationship. When I wasn't actively dealing with my trauma, I was for all intents and purposes confident about my sexual orientation identity, and I never questioned its validity or whether I really was attracted to my partner. Now, however, I have constant obsessive thoughts that I am not attracted to the opposit sex, and therefore, not really attracted to my partner. These thoughts arise mainly when I'm trying to be intimate and hit that wall of disconnection, but they have also trickled out into everyday thought. So I guess my other question is, does anyone have thoughts as to whether childhood trauma can also affect ones perception of sexual orientation? Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this!

tldr: I was psychologically,  physically, verbally,  emotionally abused growing up. Could this be affecting my ability to be sexually intimate as an adult? Could it be affecting my perception of my sexual orientation?"
Did anyone else lose friends because of what happened to them?,106,ccaew4,27,"So what happened to me was when I was a kid maybe 3 or 4. I kept it to myself for almost 12 years because I didn't want to think or talk about it. I ended up leaving some longtime friends because I started feeling uncomfortable for some reason. Maybe because of this ""secret"" I had and no one I could talk to that would understand? I don't really know. Well, last night I was feeling horrible and decided to message one of them and told him that I really needed a friend at that moment. He read the message and never replied. I'm trying not to take it personally but it really hurts. :'("
Accepting that you didn't have a childhood,106,asg47u,19,did anyone else repress their sexual/emotional abuse until they got older and now have to gradually accept that they're never going to have a childhood? it's fucking exhausting.
I (24M) was a hooker when I was a teenager,106,mcfm05,24,"It's just something that got brought up at one point in my therapy and it's been bothering me ever since. I remembered that, of course, i just chose not to think about it, almost as if in denial. 

I might've been like 14 or 15 at the time. I'm not even sure if it counts as abuse since I chose to do that. And the reason I did it was that I needed money. And attention. And apparently hypersexuality is a symptom of repressed trauma.


Now, I don't mean to be disrespectful to sex workers. But all I associate when I think about being one is my disgust with myself. And feeling so dirty. But hey, I can't blame anyone but myself and I know that. I wish I knew it at the time but the things I used the money for: those ballet lessons and the food that made me bulimic, they really weren't worth it. And I really wish I could turn back time because it just makes me feel like I'm broken beyond repair."
PTSD is literally kicking my ass,103,m53bru,22,I don’t know what else to say
Anyone else have nightmares unrelated to their PTSD?,105,m1msyh,66,"For many years I had regular nightmares of being chased and just generally fighting for survival. Nowadays, I've made a ton of progress on my PTSD but I have the most random and fucked up nightmares sometimes. I have nightmares way less frequently but instead of being chased it's usually something really fucked up. Last night I had a nightmare where I watched someone get shredded alive slowly in some time of meat grinder type thing, intentionally from a bad guy. Flesh bits were flying everywhere and the screaming was horrific. That dream was followed by me being tortured and I only woke up because I was in so much pain. None of those are related to any of my actual trauma but it messes me up. I had to take the day off work and get my mind right. Does this happen to anyone else?"
hypervigilance,101,l4qqir,31,"When I was at college, I was attacked on the street by a random man. He came up to me and choked me and then threw me into the street. This was a couple months ago and I’m really struggling with leaving my house now. How do you get over hypervigilance? Everytime I leave my house I’m constantly looking over my shoulder, and I panic anytime I see a man on the street. Any advice? This has made my life unbelievably hard."
Feeling inferior because my traumas have affected my success,106,jiuzx6,7,"I am almost 30 years old and I don't have much to show for it. I can't drive (I have a beginners license but no car), I am not married, I don't have kids, I don't own a house, I don't have a career, I haven't completed college (drop out), I don't have a significant other, and it's difficult for me to keep friends. I am frequently door slamming or ghosting people who get close to me because eventually they can trigger me and it makes me question my entire relationship with them.

I was in foster care and I have multiple sexual traumas throughout my entire life. None of these traumas have much closure, they just... are. They are just there, like the rape in my past that got reported and the police never made an arrest due to lack of evidence. He also raped a teenage girl who also reported years later, just like me, and neither of us got justice. I watch news stories about R Kelly, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby and it makes perfect sense to me that the women come out with their truth 20 years after the fact. It makes sense to me because I know that when it's a ""he said, she said"" it's not as credible as ""he said, THEY said"". It breaks my heart everytime some ignorant person in the comment section of some article asks why the women ""waited"" so long to come forward. 

I keep wondering if justice will ever even come for my rapist. My life has been put on hold waiting for justice to happen. It's as if I can't really cope with a reality where there is no justice for rape. Without any justice I just feel hypervigilant. 

When I know that:
1. only a very low % of rapists actually go to prison
2. the MAJORITY of rapists are known to their victims and have some kind of relationship with them (for example: an abusive partner, an ex, a friend, a neighbour, a coworker, etc) 
3. rapists can have cognitive dissonance and not consider themselves to be rapists even though they admit to doing sexuel acts that meet the definition of rape. So rapists can actually advertise themselves as feminists or activists and they can genuinely believe their own shit. 
4. Rapists can even be victims of sexual violence themselves (like my rapist). My rapist asked me once if I was ever raped before. I told him no and then he told me he had been raped when he was a child by a woman. Later in our relationship he ended up raping me because I triggered him and he wanted to punish me. He violently assaulted me and then he posted it on social media to humiliate me. Then later he told his guy friends that he ""made up"" being raped as a child. He told his friends he lies to women about being raped in order to get ""sympathy sex"" from girls. 

So I'll never really know his motives for attacking me? I don't know if he was really raped as a kid and sexually abused me due to untreated trauma... or if he was a psychopath who just lied about being traumatized because he just wants to abuse others? 

.... 

I moved to a new city to try to start over in life. When I knew that going to the police has a low probability of sending him to prison, I just wanted to be in a new city away from him because once I ran into him at a corner store in my hometown. It was so frightening. My world felt so small. 


So I moved to a new city and I thought I actually could just ""start over"". It looked so easy in my mind. I just imagined I could get a job, get a boyfriend, get married, have a family. It would be like nothing ever happened? 

I didn't even worry about ""processing my primary trauma"". I also didn't anticipate receiving secondary or tertiary traumas. I thought I just had to keep staying positive and things would be okay. But it's like I attract abusive men or something? 

When my police report didn't result in an arrest for my rapist, I was emotionally distraught but it wasn't an outcome I was surprised by. I well prepared for the expectation that the justice system is not adequately prepared to deliver justice to rape victims. I knew that when I reported. I read all about it when I was debating reporting. The thing that convinced me to report was when I found out he also assaulted a 15 year old girl, who also reported when she was an adult and her case didn't result in an arrest or court either (lack of evidence, just like me). The police officers told me that reporting could help build a criminal profile on him and could help ""the next girl"". So I reported, but it was devastating to my mental health. 

Before you report, there is this comfort in not reporting. As if you still have the ""option"" if you so chose to when ""the time is right"". It seems like a last resort sort of thing and in your mind you can fantasize that a report would result in some kind of legal response. In your daydream the cops take care of the bad guy. But in reality it's harsh. It's not like that. The police ask you what you were wearing, they ask you how it could be rape in his eyes if you didn't say ""no"" or physically fight back. You feel blamed and invalidated and that's it. That's the extent they do for you. They investigate your case for a short while, for me it was like a month or two of pure suspense. Then I got a call back saying there isn't enough evidence to go to court. 

..... 

Since then I've tried to ""move on"" and I am losing my mind? 

I tried to have sex. I wanted to have sex ""like everybody else"". Everyone else seemed to be into hookup culture except for me and I thought it was because my trauma was holding me back - preventing me from having fun like everyone else. I just wanted to have sex with some guy. I needed to prove to myself that not all guys are rapists, abusers, predators, etc. I can say ""not all men are rapists"". I can say that phrase but it means nothing if that doesn't reflect my life experiences. So I wanted to have lots of proof that this statement was true? So yeah I tried very hard to be hypersexual... and it didn't go very well. 

The first guy I met off an app like tinder was a guy who ended up telling me in person that his ""crazy ex"" accused him of rape and it went to court and he almost got ten years in prison. Well I knew from MY experiences with reporting rape that if it went to court, they had some evidence on him. So I was terrified that I met up with what I considered a rapist that also avoided prison (just like my rapist did). 

.... 

After that I was being sexually harassed at work. I made the mistake of telling my male coworker about the traumatic things happening in my life and he thought it was hilarious. He called me sexy and said I advertised my body with the skinny jeans and long sleeve form fitting shirts I wear. He tried to encourage another male coworker to touch my ass? The other guy didn't want to and was trying to tell him to stop then the guy tried to touch my ass himself and I freaked out and told my boss. My boss fired me and not him. My boss laughed when I cried. I had no proof it happened. I also figured that even if it was illegal for him to fire me over this, it doesn't matter because if they wouldn't give me justice for rape why would I get justice for something less traumatizing/severe? 

.... 
I tried to get a ptsd diagnosis. I thought I needed some time off to process everything that was happening. I was depressed and constantly crying. I drank a lot. I showered too much. My roommates complained that I was showering too much. The hot water started to peel the paint off the ceiling, that's how often I used the shower to cope. I was dissociation a lot and losing time. When I got a psychological evaluation the psychiatrist did not diagnose me with ptsd they instead diagnosed me with anxiety and depression and I was given a prescription for antidepressants/SSRIs. When I cried because they didn't diagnose me with ptsd. It felt so invalidating, like they were saying rape isn't traumatic... and I was asking for so little. I didn't even get legal justice, the least they could do is just acknowledge my emotional pain. The Dr asked me ""why do you care? The prescription is the same anyways""

.... 

Then I got a job at a coffee shop. It was located near a courthouse. I had cops as customers daily. Seeing them reminded me of my rape report. It made me so sad. I was told by my doctor that the antidepressants they put me on take a few months to become effective. Then my boss fired me. He told me it was because I looked ""too depressed"". I told him I literally had a clinical depression diagnosis (and it's illegal to fire someone over that) he said sorry but continued to fire me anyways. 
I never pursued legal action bc at that point I just figured nobody would care. 
.... 


Then I got a job at a Macdonald's. I have two seperate traumas here. One of my coworkers from this mcdonald's gave me his contact info after quitting. I initially liked him but I had this weird feeling about him? I thought he was funny, charming and smart... but he made my stomach hurt and I didn't really know why? I thought maybe I was just nervous because I had a crush on him? I figured that it also may be anxiety from my trauma. I tried to give him a chance because I thought it would be healing for me to either make a guy friend... or if something romantic developed. 

Well when I hung out with him he told me his ex was raped by 3 different guys and started laughing about it. Then he wanted to know if I had any trauma, and I told him I did and he wanted to know every detail. I was very uncomfortable and I didn't want to tell him about my rape but he kept pressuring me and pressuring me to tell him. He acted like it was a fun game and said things like ""pretty please"". He eventually gave up but then he tried to pressure me to take molly. He lied about what molly was. I asked him ""isn't that similar to ecstasy?"" and he said it wasn't but I googled it and molly is actually a more potent form of ecstasy. He joked about putting the molly in my drink when I was googling. I didn't know if he actually did it or not. I threw out my drink. He continued to joke about rape several times and said a lot of disturbing things about rape. He started to defend male celebrities accused of sexual abuse for instance. And he also said things like men are biologically wired to rape and that men ""love the chase"" and then he used his ex girlfriend as an example. He said initially she rejected him and he pursued her until ""he won"" (this is the same ex who was sexually abused by multiple men). 

That guy really fucked with my head and I could have an entire separate thread on my relationship with him and the manipulative person he is. But ultimately that was another situation for me where a guy is explicitly sexually abusive yet when I tried to reach out and tell people, people dismissed and minimized my concerns. Several people took his side knowing what he did. My own best friend broke off contact with me to remain friends with him. 

It's the most potent recent trauma I've had. My best friend, the one who sided with him also told me she had a history of sexual abuse just like me. She was a person I could go to if I needed to talk about sexual trauma and she ""got it"". What really made no sense to me was her betrayal. She had told me she has ptsd from rape and it affected her a lot like she doesn't even know if she's a lesbian or if she is just traumatized due to rape. She told me her mom didn't believe her when she told her that the mom's bf raped her. She would share with me examples of people in her life not understanding her ptsd and enabling abusive men who sexually harassed her. 

So it was shocking to me that she knew how painful it was to have loved ones support a sexual predator but then she went out of her way to defend a guy who was being sexually abusive towards me. 

.... 

Then my boss....
So my boss at the Mcdonalds I worked at started hitting on me. It was really awkward. I couldn't tell if he was joking or not at the beginning. I knew he was married so it was just awkward because he would ask me questions like if I found him attractive or if I would go on a date with him and I would be like ""uhhh aren't you married?"" and he replied laughing and saying ""a little bit"". But then he started touching me. He would pretend to offer me a high five but then squeeze my hands and manipulate my body into a hug. He would hold my hands? He kept asking me on dates... over and over again. And he kept offering me rides home (which I declined because I lived in walking distance from work).

I remembered the time I got fired for reporting sexual harassment so this time I decided I would record my boss harassing me so I at least have proof. So when he started asking me on a date when we were alone in the staff room when I was on break - I recorded it on my phone.

I showed a manager I trusted the video and she showed his boss and she had a meeting with me. She told me she watched the video and she was angry at his behaviour. She said they ""just had"" a meeting on sexual harassment in the workplace and that he should ""know better"" and that he's also married! So it was so shocking to her. She is also friends with him and the wife outside of work. She said the wife would be devestated if she knew and they could even get divorced. She said she wasn't going to fire him because of how it would ruin her friends marriage. She also told me that he isn't a citizen, he's here on a work visa or something so if he loses his job, he loses his citizenship or whatever it is and could get kicked out of the country? And she tried to make me agree with her decision? As if it was like ""so you see we can't punish him because it would mean he would have consequences to his actions""? It was infuriating.

She tried to make a deal with me where I could keep my job, he could keep his job and they just wouldn't schedule us together? But she lied and one day I came into work and he was there. She told me she didn't tell me he would be there because multiple people called in sick and they were severely under staffed. She said if she told me he would be there I wouldn't have shown up to work. I was so angry I walked off my shift.

Then I never felt safe returning to that place for work. The situation ended up escalating to her boss and her final solution was to just transfer me to a different mcdonald's location.

.... 

So that's what has been going on in my life. I've left out some other significant traumas. Like foster care and... biological family traumas.

But ultimately I don't even know what to do with myself anymore? I feel so stupid moving to this city and thinking it could be any different than my home town? As if it would be less traumatic for me to live here, as if traumas stop occurring to you if you only start over in a new city?

I don't know how to process a lifetime of traumas? It's one thing entirely to process the trauma of my rape. It's one thing to process that one event or the psyche of one abusive man's twisted thought process... but how am I supposed to deal with all of these things happening with no signs of it slowing or stopping?

I keep trying to get help and support. I have gotten a lot more comfortable talking about my trauma with others and actually asking for support... I think the #metoo movement helped with that... but it feels like society regression with my most recent trauma. The ex coworker who tried to spike my drink... a lot of the women who defended him were victims of sexual abuse themselves and some also claimed to be feminists as well? So now I'm just like... words don't even have meaning anymore. People have so much cognitive dissonance they can't really accept that their friend is a sexual predator.

One of his friends contacted me and started sending me malicious messages. She wanted me to get into legal trouble for ""ruining"" his image by telling people what he did. She acted like she was proud of herself for tricking me because initially she pretended that she just wanted to hear ""my side of the story"" before later revealing to me that she succeeded in gaining the ""evidence"" she was looking for (whatever that meant?). It was obvious from the beginning that she had a bias towards her friend.

So now I don't know. I feel so alone. I was betrayed by my friend who sided with the guy who tried to spike my drink. My friend did this to me knowing I was raped in the past and have ptsd as a result. All these people are defending him and I don't really have anyone defending me? Nobody is protecting me, in fact... the more vocal and outspoken I am about the injustice of rape/sexual violence/abuse/harassment and it's mental toll on the survivor... the more abusive men I seem to attract? They say they are just trolls or immature or stupid... but regardless..
what do you even do in my shoes?

I am so unsatisfied with my life right now. I might even say I feel entitled to some success or some peace in my life but the fact that I'm a loser and unsuccessful in EVERY aspect of my life from my career to my social life leaves me wondering why I'm even here and what my ultimate purpose is?

(I'm sorry I wrote so much... I just needed to vent. I don't care if people reply or not. I'm not looking for advice. I just want to be heard. Maybe someone has been through something similar and I'm helping someone feel understood via similar experiences.)"
Don't yell at me,107,dguhlf,35,"This is mostly a vent and sorry for that. 

It is not that hard not to yell at me. Yelling at me will not solve anything and it will trigger me PTSD. 

I live with roommates because I am poor and one admits that she lacks self control (but god help her if she got therapy for that). She ""emotionally responds before thinking"" (which is either immaturity or you need therapy at 38). 

And apparently that includes yelling at me when it's ""just an emotional response.""

I can't deal with it. 

I am honestly thinking about breaking the lease, sucking up the cost, and just getting a studio in a shitty neighborhood. I can't deal with being yelled at."
"I’m getting flashbacks for the first time in my life, at 27 years old. The memories are so clear and current reality is so, so foggy. I’m scared.",106,cvs2m8,21,"This is more CPTSD but I wanted to cross-post here. 

Childhood trauma caused by an addict, bi-polar mother and a mostly absent father. Most of my life I could recognize that my childhood was rough, but that it’s over and it’s fine. Years ago in therapy I remember talking about my childhood, and the therapist saying “that must’ve been so hard.” “Mm, not really,” I replied. I guess I was stuffing it down, minimizing it. 

Recently, I was in an intense outpatient therapy program for severe depression and anxiety. My childhood kept being asked about, and in class, we discussed how childhood trauma can impact a person. I thought about a few crap memories and shrugged. 

Now, the therapy program ended a week ago, and the flashbacks (I think they’re flashbacks) have started.

I’m doing something and all of the sudden I see the flash of a memory. The colors are bright and accurate, I can remember the air and the weather, I can feel what I felt in that moment. I can clearly hear her voice, yelling. I snap back to reality quickly but reality is foggy and the memories are clear as day. Are these flashbacks? What is happening?

More and more every day I can feel this scared little girl inside of me, and feel less of my current reality. I blink and I see it and feel it as clearly as I did then.

Her constantly yelling, name calling, empty liquor bottles, the birthdays she forgot, the trips to the pharmacy in the middle of the night because she ran out of her pills, how scared I was getting into a car with her when she was high, or drunk, or manic, or whatever she was that day. I can hear her saying “you think you’re so much better than me, but you’re sicker than the rest of us.”

I feel guilty because I know many children had it much worse than I did. I feel guilty because my mom is better now, she is loving and amazing, and I want to cherish that, but even that feels like a ticking time bomb. 

I feel mad because she doesn’t remember. I feel mad because my brothers don’t remember, and almost act like I’m making it up. I’m mad because the weight of these memories only weighs on me.  Why does my mom get to be better? Why do I have to feel progressively worse and worse? I was taking her mom role since I was six years old, doing the dishes and the laundry and feeding my little brother. I’m mad that I was so hurt, and I don’t know what advice or comfort I would have given younger me. I wish I could tell her that it’s okay, but it’s not, because 20 years later I’m still reliving it. I’m so mad for younger me. She was too scared to be mad, but she had every right to be mad. 

I just had to get this out. I’ve never felt so scared, and never realized how scared little-me was. I’m worried the flashes will get worse. I never ever thought I’d have to relive those things."
Bf's voice suddenly becomes rapist's voice on the phone,104,cl3t2p,47,"I was away from home for ten days and was feeling depressed. My so was comforting me on the phone. Starting to feel better, we joke around, he says something like ""you're barely tolerable"" as a very obvious joke, I immediately go back into a negative spiral thinking he's going to leave me because I'm worthless etc and go quiet. He says something else and now suddenly his voice sounds like my rapist. One part of me knows that it's still him, while another part is completely freaking out. I tell him I'm not ok and ask him his name. He tells me his name. It doesn't help. I get off the phone, do my anti-dissociation routine, feeling better get back on the phone, he sounds normal again and everything is alright (except I'm pretty shaken obviously). 

Has anyone experienced something similar? I dissociate pretty regularly but this incident was different and I worry it might be something else like a psychosis."
"NSFW, possible trigger; My patient slit his throat last night right in front of me and I keep replaying it in my mind. How can I get past this properly?",105,c0x54m,31,"
I'm an ER nurse, there was a pt last night who came with admitted coke use, was anxious and paranoid, but wasn't yet a baker act. A knife was confiscated from pt on arrival. It took 5 staff to hold him down to give IM geodon and some other med ( I was floating, not his primary). Charge nurse called police to assist but shots were already given by the time they arrived. Pt seemed to be kind of calming down. Our security guard was near pts door. One of the officers left after we changed pt into our paper scrubs and he even willingly took out his tongue piercing. Again, not yet a baker act but precautionary d/t pts agitated state.

Out of the corner of my eye I saw pt lunge at security guard. A scuffle ensued. Officer entered room and joined in. I put on gloves and went in to help. They were on the floor struggling. Officers radio fell on floor. They were all 3 on the floor. There was a metal knife with a 6 inch serrated blade in pts right hand. He took the knife and slit his throat right in front of me and I was powerless to stop it. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I thought ""oh my god this pt is killing himself right in front of me"".

(When pt lunged at guard, he took knife from guard who wasn't supposed to be carrying a knife. That's how he got the knife.) So guard already had cuts to his hand from the knife and pts neck was bleeding but he didn't go deep enough to hit a carotid thank god. But we were still struggling to get control of the knife. By this time I had yelled a few things and other staff were alerted to the situation. Another nurse got in there and got her hand on his right hand. I also had my hands on both his hands. Despite there being 4 of us on the floor trying to get control of the knife, the pt was still able to manipulate the knife that was about 12 inches from me and the other nurse. I truly believed I was going to get stabbed Or that she was going to get stabbed.

We were on the floor struggling with him for 8 minutes before we got the knife from him. The police officer instructed bystanding staff to call for backup on his radio during the struggle. No one but us 4 could get in there bc pt was in a corner and there wasn't space. Then I had to help turn pt over so officer could cuff him.

I was overcome and started to cry. They took him to the trauma room to evaluate his airway, had to intubate. He's gonna be just fine.

Other nurse hurt her hand and thumb from grip on knife. I hurt my entire arm and back. I've been a nurse for 11 years and never had a workplace injury.

But worst of all for me personally is that I keep replaying it over and over in my head, which I think is normal. I had to continue working the rest of my shift so I had 9 more hours of hell and none of us got breaks. It was balls to the wall all night. It was all I could do to keep from crying.

Later we had a difficult patient and I thought I heard staff yelling my name so I ran over to help...but they were saying something else. I was panicked for no reason.

Are there others with similar experiences? How did you cope? I want to get past this in a healthy way.

(And please, I'd really rather not hear how we could've done something different. Security and an actual police officer were there and involved immediately. Of course the guard will probably get fired for having a knife on him, but this crazy mfer could have taken my pen and gone apeshit)

I hate getting triggered by films or television,105,ap986c,30,"I really fucking hate it. I might try watching a new movie or documentary, and I have to turn it off because a triggering scene comes on. Some movies I've seen in the past I just can't watch again, because they are triggers for me.

So I change the channel or pick a different film. It feels pretty pathetic though. Other people aren't bothered by these things. They don't experience intense dread and have panic attacks. It makes me feel weak and broken."

Does activity taking place behind your back trigger you?,102,lzh799,32,"My boss triggers me at work. In the office, there is a narrow walking space behind our desks. And my boss will pace back and forth right there. Whenever he does, I can hear his footsteps right behind me, over and over, back and forth, back and forth. \*clop, clop, clop, clop, clop....clop, clop, clop, clop, clop....clop, clop, clop, clop, clop\* And every time he passes I can feel the air rush past me. And it just...drives me crazy. I have to resist the urge to turn around and ask him: ""Can you go do that somewhere else please?"" 

I swear it just drives me nuts. I'm hesitant to say anything because it's my boss, and I know he's not intentionally trying to trigger me. I think I'm going to start doing my work somewhere else besides at my desk if I can. I'm sorry I'm not trying to complain, but I wanted to vent and share this, and wondered if anyone else has this issue?"

Survival story. NSFW.,101,iq3pn8,20,"I know most don’t care but I just felt like getting it out there. Fair warning graphic violence, blood.

I live in California and there’s a lot of gang activity and violence and sadly I got mixed in it at a young age. I was in a city up north not quite the Bay Area but close. I had stepped away from the gangs for a while so I figured I was okay. 

My friend had left something he needed for work in my car and the sun had just set but as far as I knew there were no gangs where he lived. I made the drive there parked my car around the corner and went to give him his thing. 

When I was walking back I noticed a guy that seemed to be working on his car all seemed fine so I kept walking and that’s when it happened. I remember hearing ringing in my ears and I suddenly felt extremely hot. No pain just hot. I dropped to the floor and it hit me that I had just been shot. 

Somehow I managed to reach in my pocket get my phone and dial 911. I remember looking down and just seeing a pool of blood forming around me. Again it didn’t hurt it just felt hot. I thought “this is how I go huh, on a street corner bleeding out”. I admit I’m ashamed of this thought, I had been battling depression and suicidal thoughts and one though that popped up was “This isn’t too bad atleast I get to leave without being in pain”

It just felt like I was extremely tired and sedated and closing my eyes felt so good. I remember bits of police showing up then all of sudden there 5 cops. Next the EMT’s are there. I remember hearing the ambulance and equipment moving as they took me to the hospital. 

I woke up in the hospital and by some Miracle I survived, I was shot 3 times and left with nerve damage but overall nothing major. That is my story and I am lucky to be alive."
Every time I tell someone I have PTSD the first thing they do is thank me for my service.,107,i89cp2,19,I have complex PTSD from repeated childhood trauma and I no longer even try to meet new people or make friends. I am tired of explaining that I was never in the service which leads to more questions. Those answers are no one's business and it always leads to a negative conversation. so currently having no friends at all is much easier than trying to start again after my best and only friend passed away several years ago. #lonelytothemax
I’ve been waiting my whole life,100,hsxnkg,10,About to be a senior in high school. Told my parents my brother abused me my sophomore year. Long story short I’m pretty sure my psychiatrist doesn’t believe me and neither do my parents. CPS couldn’t do anything. My parents keep making excuses of why he can’t move out even though he’s 25. I’ve been waiting my whole life to escape. I’ve been spending all this time just waiting. Waiting to not have to do dance. Waiting to be done with high school. Waiting to not be forced to be around him. Waiting to be able to see a therapist and not be constantly interrogated about it by my parents. Waiting to leave this boring small town. Waiting to be able to express myself physically. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting to not be trapped. I really do be trying to have the best time I have while I’m young but I’m really just waiting. PTSD sucks
I still hide in the closet when I get scared. (TW Emotional/physical abuse),104,hqrz55,10,"My mom used to scream and scream and scream. She'd say the MEANEST shit and pull my hair and cross so many lines. I learned if I hid and she couldn't find me I was safe. So to this day if someone makes me feel small or overwhelmed or scared, the room suddenly feels TOO big and I have to find a small dark room to sit in until I come back to my senses. I feel so... raw when this happens. I'm tired. And currently in an closet. I scared my cat by accident too."
"Who else feels that they are very hurt and have a grudge and is poisoned and become vengeful, but the one who is getting hurt is only you, so you sort of become your own worst enemy?",103,hgqkxa,8,"The one I got trauma from is probably my father since I'm very scared of him. But for some reason I feel like I'm not angry at him, and instead I'm angry at my mother. It's not that I'm not afraid of my mother, but not that much as my father to the point that sometimes I just can't stand next to him, or stand him standing next to me, that I just want to yell because I get very irritated and nervous. And I feel like I'm trying to do everything to exact revenge on them (but not really executing), or trying so that they won't get what they want, but at the end the one who is getting hurt is me. I don't act absolutely on my emotions, I can't say that I'm absolutely subdue to this feeling like a kid, like, a hot-headed, but there is just so many emotions, so much unsatisfied, not said, that sometimes it reminds of its existence, if not always, but I can't act on it, like a kid, so I keep it cool and under control.

Family does not accept diagnosis?,100,h7q451,29,"So, I’m 17. I have been diagnosed with PTSD for a few years now, due to events I won’t disclose. My mother tells me I have never experienced trauma, and my father began to yell at the psychiatrist when he was told of my diagnoses, as he is in the marines. I have displayed these symptoms for years, and I suffer from extreme night terrors. I take Prazosin for it, and I go to a therapist who specializes in the treatment. My parents are part of the reason of my diagnoses, but are they living in denial? Am I going crazy?! Is this my fault???"
"I screamed at my fiancé because he scared me. He said it’s not a big deal, I’m dramatic. Considering ending it. Help",102,gyl2ck,53,"I am 28F and my fiancé is 34M. We have been living together for a year and a half and overall our relationship is pretty good. 

A little background on me, I have anxiety and PTSD. I am in therapy and on medication for both. I can be extremely reactive and jumpy at times because my fight or flight gets triggered very easily. At times my roommate (who has lived here for 2 years) will enter a room and it still startles me. We just laugh. My office at work has a sharp corner and if someone is walking too fast and says my name, it startles me. I’ve literally dropped my coffee on myself in front of my boss but we always laugh it off. 

Sometimes if my fiancé enters the room and I don’t notice it startles me. I’ll try to laugh and he will say “I’ve lived here for a year...” He doesn’t find any humor. He will fake laugh but then show me examples of how loudly he was walking, how I should have heard him, etc. It literally offends him that I get startled. He makes me feel like I’m not allowed to get startled because it annoys or inconveniences him. I also believe he thinks I am being dramatic (which I am guilty of, but never in this situation. This is a genuine reaction.)

So the scenario in question:

I was in the kitchen filling up my large cup with water. I had my back turned to the whole kitchen for a while and the water is pretty loud.  I turned off the water, turned around, and my fiancé was literally 6 inches from my face. He is 6”6 so he is a huge person compared to me. I almost dropped my water I was so frightened, and I let out a horror movie type shriek. I instantly started laughing because I thought it was funny. I said “Dude! Oh my god. I thought you were in the other room, you scared the shit out of me haha.” I’m laughing pretty hard. 

Fiancé is pretending to laugh but has an annoyed look on his face. He said multiple times “Well I know you could hear me talking. Did you think I just magically teleported into another room? Did you forget that I lived here? I walk really loudly...” Then he proceeds to show me an example of him stomping around (how he walks loudly.) I stop laughing and ask why he is so angry. I have never been more confused in my life. He continues to fake a laugh and say “I dunno you’re treating me like I’m Michael Myers. Like I’m going to murder you. I’m your fiancé.”

I was utterly perplexed. I tried to explain that me shrieking was a genuine reaction that I could not help, and even provided examples of how I have screamed when I was scared before. He said “Well you could have just let out a small gasp” (and did an example of him clenching his chest with a tiny gasp) “instead of that piercing scream you did in my ear. Now our roommate probably thinks I did something.”

I said loudly over and over “You scared me!” While laughing directly after it happened. I’m pretty sure our roommate heard that part. My fiancé and I have had arguments in the past but never has our roommate gotten involved, nor does he give a shit about our relationship. I told him I felt like he cared more about how he was perceived than the situation itself. If he would have just laughed at it like I did, it wouldn’t have been a big deal.

I also tried to explain that I can’t help that I sometimes scream when I’m startled. He said he’s never seen me do that, he thinks I’m being a bit dramatic. I am furious with him. I’m really happy he is gone for the weekend and I don’t plan on speaking to him until he addresses his behavior.

We have spoken since. I have sent him links and YouTube videos. He said he hasn’t watched them because it’s not a big deal and he doesn’t understand why we have been arguing over this for 24 hours. 

I am literally so furious with him and his arrogance that I am considering ending our relationship. We called an emergency meeting with our therapist but I refuse to speak to him until it’s supervised. Any advice?

He is constantly minimizing my feelings.

**Edit** So I told him that we needed to speak to our couples therapist ASAP. he agreed with hesitation. Our therapist told him he was being insensitive and suggested we have a second session this week. He says he feels guilty and genuinely wants to make things better. He said he looks forward to understanding this more. I hope it’s true."

I just don’t know how to handle any of this."
Nightmares,103,fpmfqd,25,"Does anyone else get nightmares that aren't necessarily about the trauma(s) they went through, but invoke the same feelings?


I've been having a lot of nightmares again but they're never about the actual traumatic events I've experienced. I wake up in fear and crying, and they invoke the exact same feelings I have associated with my trauma, but they're about things that have never happened. 


Was just wondering if anyone's experienced the same."
Hypervigilance sucks,102,eer2s5,23,"December is a massive trigger for me. Christmas is so horrible and it makes me feel baseless feelings of actual, apocalyptic doom.

Y'all. I think I made it.,106,a6j4k9,19,"My trauma was 10 years ago this month. I've had PTSD for my entire adult life. I still do. But after all this time, I think I finally managed to get to a place where I can work full time!

College took two more years than it should have, and it almost killed me. The jobs I had to work while in college didn't help either. And it took several different jobs, because I was always having breakdowns and finding myself unable to work. But after college, I finally got the desk job I've always dreamed of. No forced emotional labor. No abusive customers. No sexually harassing coworkers. I just spend all day making excel charts and listening to music. 

It's been several months, and I keep waiting for ""my real self"" to come back. But I think this is it! I think I found an environment that doesn't trigger me, which has allowed me to put in a full 40 hours (and often more than that) *sustainably*, with a bare minimum of meltdowns. 

People don't seem to get it when I tell them how excited I am that **I can work** at this job. They don't know what it's like to be trapped inside a mind and body that limits you like that. But after so many years, things finally got better. I think I made it."
do you consider your ptsd a disability?,103,miwp7l,81,"i consider mine to be, as i struggle to function as a person my age should be able to. i have depression and adhd but i feel im less mature and cant function as well as someone my age because of my trauma (its an adhd thing too but still).. well i've asked some other people with ptsd and 2 people said they considered theirs to be"
My heart physically hurts when i get flashbacks or think about what happened to me.,102,m8d1vd,14,"It is absolutely horrible. I have had every test done, heart is perfectly fine as are my arteries.. I am 24. Every time i get a flashback or think about my trauma, it feels like my heart breaks into pieces and i have a huge pit in my stomach that won’t leave for days. It’s like my heart physically hurts from sadness. 

I try to avoid thinking about it, but it happens sometimes and i need to recover for days. My muscles are sore, my head hurts, i feel like i have the flu. No one understands this and i feel like i’m a whiny child. I wish i could just suck it up but i just can’t do it anymore, i am so tired and still getting pushed by authorities to work, go to a million sessions, phonecalls, meet ups while breaking apart further and further mentally and physically but it doesn’t matter to them. If i skip something, there will be consequences i can not take and are probably even worse than my life right now.

I am completely broken, physically and mentally, but they are still pushing me to do all these things because “its good for you” and it will “make you feel better”. I wish. 

I hate my life. I have no control over it because i have no money and have PTSD. I pray i will die peacefully in my sleep so i don’t have to live like this anymore."
Is doubting own trauma common? TW: Abuse,104,m3ejl4,26,"I need advice from objective people (tldr at bottom). 

Years ago I (M) said no to someone (F) who wanted to have sex with me. She asked and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She asked again and I said I didn't want to. We were sitting down at the time. She got on top of me and I froze as she had sex with me. I didn't push her off. She tried to kiss me and I tried to turn away but was unable to. The whole thing was very brief. I didnt think too much about it for years after (i had the mindset of 'I am male so it isn't the same' ) and I have been on good terms with her since. 

I went for therapy a couple years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD. My therapist at the time focused a lot on why she acted she did at the time and in the years I've known this person I've learned she was sexually assaulted by guys before I knew her. Likewise I was sexually assaulted by an older boy when i was very young. I gradually began to understand why she acted the way she did and also why I froze (i was beaten up a lot as a kid too and i would always freeze then as well). To that end I hold no anger towards her, as she was a product of her suffering. It helped me move on for a time. She's changed. I've changed. We've grown and now we are supportive of each other. I have forgiven my other attackers as well as part of my own journey. 

The problem I have is that sometimes I doubt the whole thing and now I blame myself. Its like 'i hold no anger, i understand why she was like that' but now I question whether I was raped at all. 

**Tl:DR: **  I guess I'm just looking for a more objective outsider opinion: Given that I said I didnt want sex twice and then didnt fight back, I was still raped, right? Being on good terms now and understanding why that happened doesnt invalidate my experience does it? Is my self doubt just a part of the PTSD?

Advice appreciated."
This effects more than just veterans!,101,j8kym0,22,"Sorry. 

Ive had PTSD diagnosis for 15 years. I am not a military veteran. I am a gay trans man who grew up in an abusive religious environment and was repeatedly sexually assaulted. 

There’s a thing going around my social media feeds that starts with “PTSD- sad but true” about spreading awareness of PTSD and then the rest of it is about suicide statistics for military veterans in the USA. 

Don’t get me wrong. The way we treat our veterans is down right shameful (especially our homeless veterans). And our endless wars of the past twenty years have caused PTSD in many out of military personnel - and their victims. 

But I hate this stereotype that the only real PTSD is military PTSD. It’s a harmful stereotype that prevents people from getting care and support."
Fetishization of PTSD,103,hdfas5,96,"I’ve seen it before, widely common in the art community for me. Or around the Internet actually, of mental illness in general. Have you ever been fetishized for your illness or encountered someone who does?"
i just don't want to eat anymore,103,gfehad,16,"i do not have anywhere else to put this, but i have been struggling so much with my relationship to food recently. it's like i am almost never hungry or have an appetite, and the times i do feel like eating it immediately ruins me. i feel disgusted with myself and very tired, i do not enjoy eating anymore and the sensation of feeling full is triggering in and of itself. i have a complex built around it due to trauma. i can't go to therapy for 2 more years and haven't been in it since my mother died, and my disordered eating has only worsened. i feel hopeless and wish i didn't have to eat whatsoever, it feels like a chore at this point and i am constantly forgetting to eat due to my lack of hunger. i feel alone and i want everything to end.

EDIT: thank you all so, so much for your support. i unfortunately do not have the emotional energy to personally thank and respond to everyone individually, but your kind words mean the world to me. i will try and look into ensure because they gave me it the last time i was hospitalized when i confessed i had an eating disorder, and it helped a lot. i am endlessly grateful for everyone on this subreddit, thank you. ♡"
How can she bring him back into our lives?,105,ewi1g4,29,"Help. Please help me. I can't do this. My sister is dating her kids dad. She didn't tell me. She just posted about it on Facebook. It's been 13 years, but I will never, ever be over the night I had to watch him try to murder her and her 2 girls. I will never forget being in the bedroom and hearing her scream. Going out to see what was the matter and being told to mind my own business. Hearing it again and going out to see him throwing her on the floor and kicking her. I will never forget him knocking me down and hitting me as I ran to get the babies. I locked them in a closet while they screamed. They were 8 and 18 months old. He smashed all of the phones so I couldn't call for help. I couldn't leave the house because I couldn't leave the babies. I watched him break my sisters ribs. I watched her blood fly everywhere. My parents were gone and I couldn't get a hold of them. I was 13 and I was all alone. I watched him smash her head on the floor. Stomp on her. Throw her around. I cradled my sister when he heard the sirens and he ran away. I thought she was dying. I watched her tell the police that nothing happened even though the evidence was all around the house. I picked up the phone in the garage an hour later when he broke into somebody's house and called me to tell me that I would be next if I didn't keep my mouth shut. I cleaned her blood. I picked up all of the pieces of broken everything around the house, because I was all alone. I watched my nieces be dragged from foster home to foster home for years afterwards. I waited more than 18 hours for my parents to get home and tell them what happened. I didn't leave my house for months. I couldn't sleep alone. My mom couldn't leave me. It ruined my life. I tried to kill myself when I was 14. And 15. And 16. It wasn't the first time I watched him beat her up, but it was the worst one. It completely changed who I was as a person. It took me 12 years to get out of the horrible state that night put me in. And tonight it's like I'm 13 again... Pushing a dresser against the bedroom door of the room I had the babies in the closet in, sitting against the dresser with my hands over my ears, shaking, trying to drown out the screams of my sister and of the babies after I accepted there was nothing I could do but wait. I couldn't help her or he'd kill me too. I really thought when the screams stopped that I would go out to find my sisters dead body. I've been doing so good... I've been managing. But tonight I'm 13 years old again. Right now I'm sitting on the floor against my bed just trying to breathe. I didn't know where to turn. My husband is on night shift, and honestly, I don't have any friends. My baby is asleep, thankfully, so he doesn't have to see me like this, and I'm alone. Just like I was alone then. I can't do this. I went to therapy for years. Was put in the psych ward at the hospital. Diagnosed with severe PTSD. My sister says I'm not allowed to have PTSD because she doesn't. I don't know how she can't. How she can let him around her kids. I tried to forgive him once. I tried. And I wouldn't let him see my niece who I had custody of and he told me he wishes he'd murdered us all that night. But my sister doesn't care. And tonight I feel like I've lost her all over again. Because I will never be in the same room as that man. I will not welcome them into my home. And because of this I'm going to lose access to my niece and my nephew who she has custody of again. I feel crushed. I feel defeated. I feel scared. And I'm so sorry if you had to read all of this... I needed somebody, anybody, to hear me tonight.... I know she has her own trauma that she's dealing with that's lead to this. I know she probably sees it as family preservation. I know there's so much that goes into it. But I worked for so many years to get past this, and tonight it's like that 13 year old girl is back. That night took a piece of me away that I will never be able to fix."
Just a vent on my disassociative behavior,102,coocbj,16,"Does anybody else constantly feel so far removed from their own experiences that they feel like they're just a casual backseat driver in their own life? 

I struggle to stay present and be in the moment for happenings or social events to the point where I'm left wondering how other people can socialize and communicate effectively as if it's some entirely foreign phenomenon to me..... and I know it can get better, but it doesn't feel like it oftentimes"
"""Please, someone sedate me""",99,kniuzj,13,"I had a strange moment happen while I was in the middle of s*x where my brain legitimately couldn't figure out in that very moment if I was safe or in danger (hint: I wasnt). The activity ended and I've been crying uncontrollably ever since. The person tried comforting me but it was like he was trying to speak to me behind a thick glass. None of it got through to me.

I can't stop crying. It feels like my brain is a trap and I will never be able to accurately judge whether something/someone is safe or not."
Sick of toxic people who think they are best thing to ever walk this earth and they know everything even if they haven't dealt with it.,99,hz6p9p,22,I'm tired of people acting/telling me that what I'm dealing with isn't a big deal and I need to stop looking at it from such a downer perspective when they aren't even the ones going throught it...
"Happy Birthday to me, I suppose.",102,hnmwuw,39,"Today is my birthday, I turned 27. Once again spending the day alone. No friends, no family. Just me alone in bed depressed. The 27 club sounds real tempting about now."
I’m scared of going to the bathroom,101,hmw824,32,"Hi I don't know if this is actually PTSD so I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask my question. I am just looking for help cus I'm so scared of going to the bathroom, well ever since I was really little. When I was little he used to come into the bathroom when I was in there and hurt me, almost every day. Ever since I’m so scared to the bathroom. I get infections all the time cus I hate going in the bathroom, how do I get over this? I can only go to the bathroom if I lock the door then check if anybody is in the shower then I have to put something up against the door. It's ruining my life. I'm always embarrassed cus I pee myself at random times and my mom gets mad at me for ruining my clothes. I feel so gross all the time. I'm sorry if this is gross I'm just looking for advice cus I don't know how to stop holding it so much. Thankyou"

I just want to know if this goes through anyone else’s mind when they see a Dad and daughter or brother and sister in public (or really any two family members together). I think bc my family has a history of incestual sexual abuse, I just can’t help but wonder how common it really is..."
Anyone else feel like they cant be in a relationship?,97,c08nhr,37,"I (23F) was just recently diagnosed with PTSD. I’m still coming to terms with my diagnosis. I think it’s been equal parts empowering and painful. 

One of the things I’m starting to realize is that I become immensely hypervigillant in romantic relationships. I am constantly afraid of making mistakes and having to suffer irrational consequences. 

Things like worrying that if I buy the wrong brand of toilet paper my SO will leave me or abuse me even though there is no history of abuse and the relationship is stable. 

On top of that, I experience a lot of disassociation making my partners feel insecure Because they can’t tell what I’m thinking or feeling. 

Does anyone else feel like their PTSD symptoms make romantic relationships  difficult/impossible?"

Big first step! going to therapy,99,m5ujax,16,"My first session is tomorrow. I've messaged my therapist to give her some more info about me and she told me I have more than one trauma, which is interesting to me because I just lumped them all together. Other than depression and anxiety, I depersonalize and also have issues with brain fog and impaired memory. I look forward to learning more and finally getting better so I can function better and be happier. I've been trying to heal on my own but I feel so stuck and unsupported and I need professional help"
Does anyone else have a problem with noises?,100,ip6eyi,28,"For a while i've noticed that I've been having trouble sleeping due to hypersensitivity to certain sounds. I have to sleep with headphones in or else I would be awake all night. These sounds (like my cat drinking water, my cat licking himself, someone chewing loudly) make me irrationally angry. I've been searching as a reason why for a while and I recently learned that I may have Misophonia which is often connected with PTSD. I was wondering if anyone else struggles with this and if so what do you do to deal with it? If anyone knows any more information on this subject I'm willing to be educated."
She Was Drowning But Nobody Saw Her Struggle...,102,hsmmem,19,"Those who have not personally experienced the true depths of depression, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, or whatever it may be, really do not have a way to know how it feels. It feels like your whole body is consumed by the waters, as your own body weight pushes you down, deeper and deeper, until you no longer have any more strength. Like a funnel, twirling round and round, sucking away your emotions, your thoughts, until you just can't take any more. And so you allow it to take control over your thoughts, you allow it to take over your mind. You are trying so hard to scream, so loud, but you can not make a sound. Nobody sees you, nobody hears you, and you feel alone. Is it thoughtlessness or is it really that hard for people to detect whether someone is okay if they are not crying? I don't cry, I withdraw, I disconnect, I disassociate, and I isolate myself pretty much all day, every day."
I finally get why I’ve been so tired for so long.,98,h02kmm,8,"  Ive always self identified as being the happy go lucky, bubbly personality kind of person. Ever since I was a kid. I love to laugh and to make people laugh. I’m a huge empath. 

I was recently diagnosed with anxiety, ptsd and severe depression. Not too long ago my therapist asked me on a scale of 1-10, how depressed do I feel. I couldn’t answer. I couldn’t answer her because I couldn’t even remember what a baseline felt like. Up to this point I just haven’t even thought of myself as a person who’s depressed. Just a happy person, who has bad days and life can be tough for everyone, right? 

But today when my doctor was done with her assessment and I had answered all of her questions she looked at me and said ‘You’ve been through a lot, and you’re severely depressed.’ It all clicked then. As her words faded into the background and my thoughts amplified in my mind I realized that I’ve been so tired for so long because I’ve exhausted so much energy into faking that generalized happiness and bubbly personality for everyone around me. And it all comes crashing down when I’m alone. 

I’m not sure if this is a step forward or a step backwards, but I can’t help but to feel excited to find that baseline again. I’m hopeful that someday in the future, I’ll wake up without the fog that I never even realized was looming over my life. I hope to feel joy again."

I'm playing a game with my friend, but everything he says is immediately irritating me. I'm not sure if it's because I know this month is generally very bad for me and my ptsd is heightened or what, I know I feel horrible for feeling this way when my friend hasn't done anything wrong....."

I would like to say thank you to everyone here.,100,eccrp7,18,"Hello r/ptsd. I've posted here a few times this week since my episodes have been getting worse and I would like to say a massive thank you to everyone. It's so nice to see caring comments of people trying to help other people, it's something you don't see everyday. You are the kindest people I've met on the internet.

"TW: found a video of me two years ago a few weeks before my trauma, i can’t stop watching it",102,e5v6ro,18,"the event that led to my ptsd (and a few other traumatic events) occurred almost two years ago. i was scrolling through my post history and found the first post i’d ever made on this subreddit. it was a year ago and it was the first time i’d ever typed it out and really acknowledged that something bad happened. i suffer from memory loss so i can forget how truly bad it was, ive been feeling like a fraud and re-reading it and realizing the state i was at kind of validated me into realizing that holy shit that wasn’t okay and wow i wish i could go back in time and give myself a hug. i’m better now, i can talk about it. before i couldn’t talk about it and only told my therapist through notes i had written. i’ll cry every time i talk about it but it’s progress. i went on snapchat and got a “memory” from two years ago and it’s just a video of me sneezing. i guess i was going to record myself speaking but sneezed instead. it’s really cute. i look like a baby. i was a baby. i can’t believe someone would hurt that person. it’s so weird looking at the person i was before all of this happened. i’ve changed so much in so many ways. i wish i could feel like that person again. not be afraid of trivial everyday things. idk. i just want a little support now. i’m thinking about telling one of my closest friends what happened because no one around me knows. i know this is post is pointless and long and i’m sorry and i’m sorry if this isn’t allowed but if you could just send some love and a hug my way id appreciate it a lot. thank you."

i just registered for classes today,100,ctpph7,19,"start school late September, majoring in psychology and counseling with a focus on addiction and trauma. also taking music appreciation.

this comes from the examination of my behavior going off on someone about my experiences with being abused. i took some time to think about it and i realize the lashing out came from being infuriated at the idea that someone else would be forced to experience what i did. i figured if i got into a career where i directly helped these people it would be a lot more productive than treating people the way i myself hated being treated.

I'm also taking music courses since playing my viol instruments is how i manage my anxiety.

Parents intentionally trigger me and they get joy from it.,100,ccvkb8,144,"Does anybody elses parents intentionally try to hurt them/trigger you and then laugh about you getting upset or try to belittle/degrade you for it? Its sick. Its fucked up.

My family has done this for years. They also had kicked me out for being lesbian in the past. They hurt me and when I cry they insult me until I am upset. If i show anger or any emotion they harass and laugh and smile. They also insult and nitpick me over EVERY thing. 

I got free italian bread from work. I did not eat anything today except a piece of that bread with some cream cheese on it, and a yogurt. I also ran 3 miles. My mother looks at me and yells ""WHAT ARE YOU EATING?"" Then she judges my food intake. Says I eat too much or too little when I eat normally. I am jacked and athletic and everything I do is judged. I get told im too fat or too thin and I have stayed the same weight 118-120 lbs for years. I keep to myself and dont interact with them because of what they did to me but sadly I have to live with them. 

Family that tries to trigger you and abuse you even when they know you are struggling hurts. They are sick people.

"i think something happened to me as a child, but i cannot remember?",98,ju2li9,17,"Okay so basically, when i was 4 years old i was completely toilet trained and had just stopped bed wetting. my family went on a holiday to south africa where my parents had parties with many random strangers and drugs involved. i know that one night, there was a blackout and my mum told me she can’t remember what happened because she was on acid and so was my dad. i came back from this trip and began bed wetting and wetting my pants every single day. this went on for years because i simply didn’t have any ‘sensation’ when i needed to go to the bathroom, it just came when it wanted. this resulted in me being bullied for most of my primary school years making me isolate myself from the rest of the world. at this point, all i could remember from that trip to south africa was these blue bedsheets and how dark it was, but i never questioned that until now. also, growing up i struggled with very sexual intrusive thoughts that i thought were normal at the time, but i have come to learn since that it isn’t normal for a 6 year old to be having fantasies about being sexually assaulted as how would a child even know what that is? i believe in my heart that something happened to me on that trip, but i feel like i can’t tell anyone because they won’t believe me as i can’t exactly remember. as i’ve gotten older, more memories have surfaced of shadow figures and someone standing over me, but i’m unsure if it’s just my mind playing tricks on me or if what i’m remembering is real. i’m writing this to let this out as i’ve held onto this for so long and have nobody in my life who i feel will believe me if i tell them

A small PTSD LPT...,96,hrc6k8,5,"Pretty basic LPT, but I only thought of this today and thought I'd share. If you're like me and you have a workspace with your back to a door, take an old/cheap make-up powder mirror out of it's case and stick it on your monitor or another object; angled so you can see the door. Drugstore powder cases are cheaper than  specific mirrors designed for monitors."
Does anyone here also experience depersonalization or sleep paralysis? Is that an effect of PTSD?,98,g8y4jf,24,"I have PTSD from sexual abuse in the past. I have gone through therapy and have decreased symptoms but I often experience depersonalization.

I often don't feel like life is real or that my brain is foggy. I always feel like I look at the world through a lens or a screen. I often question my own existence. Sometimes I look at the mirror and don't really recognize myself or forget that I look a certain way. Often asking myself if life is a dream and also finding difficulty to differentiate my real life and my dreams when I wake up. I have also recently experienced the worst sleep paralysis making my depersonalization worst I guess.

Does this correlate to PTSD? Does anyone relate with this? How do you cope with it?"
Does anyone else have pretty bad mood swings?,99,dvibq0,18,"It’s almost like a switch for me. Like I’ll be happy one second, then when I get a flashback I’ll start crying or I’ll get a panic attack then I’ll get depressed afterwards. Does anyone else’s flashbacks give them constant mood swings? Is there a way you guys handle your mood swings or can help your mental state when getting them? I just don’t know how to work on them and it’s stressing me out."
I realized that I'm addicted to danger and chaos as a way to justify my PTSD.,96,brjc85,30,"After getting myself elbow deep in yet another f\*\*\*ed up situation, I sat down and cried. Actually I punch the wall and screamed, and then I cried. I asked myself why these things keep happening to me, and why I have such profoundly bad luck. Then it kind of dawned on me that its not luck.

Its because I keep choosing dangerous, unstable, risky, and chaotic situations, jobs, and people in my life as a way to have something to overcome. 

Its like I want something so overwhelming and undefinable bad that I can say to myself, ""okay, these situations are the problem, not my past abuse, or the way it affected me."" I keep re-traumatizing myself as a way make create something emotionally significant enough to eclipse my past trauma as a way to minimize it. 

This practice is literally going to get me killed on day. I'm not saying that I'm ever going to be able to live a healthy life, but it sure would be a lot better if I stopped doing this to myself. I guess I wanted to share this because maybe someone else out there will read it, and find that it resonates with them. Maybe people like us can find less personally destructive ways to be broken, since therapy is basically like putting a band-aid on hemorrhage."
"I'm tired of pretending I'm okay all the time, because I'm not okay.",96,am0eat,14,"I'm exhausted of pretending nothing is wrong. I'm tired of constantly making myself less comfortable, just to accommodate everyone else. Why should I be uncomfortable? Why is it never their turn to be uncomfortable? Why cant they pretend all is normal, allowing me to be free and expressive.

After all, I am this way for a reason. I am supposed to be this way if all things are considered, regardless of not deserving what caused it. Bad things happened, and it resulted with a natural human reaction... PTSD. 

I'm not an aggressive person or a threat to anyone. I should be allowed to feel outwardly rather than bottle up... and without instantly being treated like some kind of bomb disguised as a human. All I ever want is just some compassion or an attempt at understanding, the same way they treat each other when they exchange frustrations and emotions. I never asked to be different, and with my whole being jesus christ I wish I was normal. We all deserve to be treated normal... and with respect. I cant help it. I'm still a person. Why dont they see me? "

Reminders of trauma causing sleep crying and sleep talking?,99,mh5ugx,25,"I’ve had a few traumatic events in my life and over the past year. This week has been hard because I’ve had to address and speak about a lot of them. I feel like I am managing fine but my partner has told me that I have been crying in my sleep and talking a lot. I have no recollection of the dreams or crying or talking in my sleep but am exhausted at the end of the day and wake up very tired. 

I don’t usually talk in my sleep or cry and have had one occurrence of me hysterically laughing myself awake and one occurrence of me getting up and standing at the side of my bed while I was asleep. These are rare and happen in clusters and then disappear for months. 

Does anyone else who have experienced trauma and/or other mood disorders (I am also bipolar) experience sleep disturbances after a traumatic event or when they are reminded of these events?"
I need guidance from people who have healed. I feel like a shell- idk how to socialize as well as consider yourself a worthy and valid human. I’m crying rn avoiding people in my apartment because I don’t know how to people anymore besides at work or with select friends from early childhood,99,m9kdfq,41,"Hello. 25f, probably unwell due to childhood abuse and sexual abuse/assault from a previous relationship.

Empty and with people I don’t know or friends of people I know I can’t speak words and I am quiet and can’t make eye contact and can’t stop the anxious thoughts saying I shouldn’t be there. My parents were (father- physically/sexually abusive/neglective/anger issues) (mom- narcissist/emotionally abusive/neglective/bpd+) very controlling and inconsistent growing up. I think with the emotional abuse/bullying from my mother, the lack of consistent positive interactions, my abusive father, and the sibling relationships that mirrored how our parents treated us I just never learned positive or correct social behaviors and I might have even been purposely not diagnosed for some type of autism (I can’t tell but people are hard and I know I do things out of the norm or too practical or formal and I don’t know if it’s learned behavior from acting to stay alive/safe or I just am not programmed the same?) and it took a while after hs to come to terms with the fact that I wasn’t ok and my shyness was a product of abuse/ptsd but also some ‘symptoms’ seem like autistic tendencies and I just don’t know how to learn how to talk to people or maintain friendships or not run away from people (both irl sometimes and avoiding them for months bc depression/anxiety?) sometimes. Like sometimes I feel ‘normal’ like I can put on the face I used to in hs ams be outgoing and other times I dissociate for weeks and I am empty and quiet and even when I open my mouth sound doesn’t come out (sometimes someone will call it out -usually it’s not brought up- and usually I am made fun of for being too practical or shy or not reacting as much as other people) and I don’t even know what to say even if I could be louder. People used to tell me I was well liked and “popular” when I was younger and now in good situations I seem ‘cool’ and etc bc it seems like I am laid back but really I just feel terrified to be there and can’t make eye contact or feel bad looking in peoples directions bc idk so I will watch the tv for two hours in silence while people talk around me. I don’t know if I’m just afraid of interacting with people and how they will treat me/dislike me bc of what I do or if this is how I am and therapy (for about 4-5 years now) hasn’t really helped with the learning to be human again and looking at my body and perceiving it as real and what happens when I stop dissociating or having extreme paranoia and after leveling off my constant flight/fight Mode as my therapist called it- like how do I enjoy being human and being in this body and living. How do I talk to people and know what to talk about and interact in groups without immediately wanting to leave bc I feel like I don’t belong to begin with. Like I am in my own house right now hiding upstairs bc I tried to sit w/ my boyfriend and his friends - and sometimes I can talk to them as I have seen more of them but rn (me and him are in a rough patch and might break up?-He is not acting like that is the case though all week and even in front of them now is being nice and sweet) even though he is being super nice and asking me to join I left a few times to go back upstairs without saying anything about it bcI am too shy to announce what I’m doing I can’t help feeling like I am coming off as rude. I also am constantly nervous I’m just not welcome and they know and talked about me and I know it’s in my head but I sat there and couldn’t even look at them or join a convo and how do I just practice or get used to it without wanting to cry in front of people just for sitting there"
I realized how disconnected I am.,100,m3ycxh,18,"Someone came over today that I used to be close with... But having them over made me realize how disconnected I am from people. How poorly I tried to keep communicating with them... I realized how disconnected I am from people like my partner and even my own child... That I feel nothing at all for them.
 I realized that when you spend every day trying to go day by day... That when you spend so long just trying to survive that you lose touch of things that are key parts of normal society. Things like just talking with friends become so distant in your mind when you have to focus all of your energy on trying to seem normal to everyone else when in reality you are far from."
I'm so scared being a woman.,100,m2b03w,16,"I'm currently being treated for PTSD after an assault earlier this year. Last week I managed to go further than the corner shop across the road by myself (in daylight) for the first time in months. I really felt like I was making progress. 

These past few days the Sarah Everard case has been so triggering, but I feel like I can't look away. I'm absolutely terrified. I feel like I will never ever be safe and there's nothing I can do to keep safe. Even in my own home I'm scared, I live in flat share and last week my flatmate brought a stranger home who assaulted her. When does this end? It just feels like I'm in hell. 

Every time I think I'm making progress something happens and my fears are confirmed. I'm so frightened not just for myself but for all women. I just want it to stop."

Thought I was PTSD free... A trigger brought back my symptoms. I notice it's not as debilitating as it was in the past but it's hard to function in this headspace today. Does this ever go away?,100,hl4yc4,20,"Trying to live without PTSD over here.  Live in peace.  Live my best life.  I thought it was gone.  The symptoms were dormant and I was practicing a lot of mindfulness dealing with potential triggers.  

Yesterday I was caught off guard.  I crossed paths with a person I shouldn't even see.  We live hundreds of miles away from one another.  I don't go many places... I have my regular spots I do not feel anxious at and take the same routes to those places.  I have created a safe bubble for myself.  All sorts of things could have changed my route yesterday and I wouldn't have crossed paths with the person... I wouldn't have been triggered.  I would still be in my happy little safe bubble.

But that all changed in an instant yesterday.  And it was so close to home.  And now I feel like it's all coming back.  At the time I kinda shook it off.  My friend helped me through it.  We had a plan and were living our best lives.  Later that evening I had to drive solo for a few hours for work and I felt the anxiety as strong as ever.  Eyes were sharp and watching every potential threat.  Spent a few hours in my head reminiscing and having all the emotions.

I slept tense... All my joints and muscles ache from curling my arms and legs in all night.  I smoke enough weed that I don't dream luckily.  I can feel my mood today is tense and sharp. I also have BPD so just gotta keep that in check.  I feel like crawling under the sheets and hiding away... But I'm not going to.

The weather is lovely.  Dishes are done.  Radio is on.  Gonna live my best life and try to shake it off.  Like a stubbed toe.  Worth a shot.  I expect it to be a rough couple days, but I will keep my house clean and keep busy putzing around the house.  I have some uplifting friends to go visit tomorrow afternoon and I might take the dogs out to the lake on Monday.  

Thanks for listening.

Tl;dr - Thought PTSD was gone but was unexpectedly triggered.   Bitch can't kill my vibe."
Quarantined with boyfriend who yells at video games,98,fuwzof,18,"I'm under quarantine with my boyfriend, who is normally extremely sweet and understanding of my triggers and does his best to avoid them. However, we've been running into a problem lately. He plays a lot of video games (not a problem at all) and he tends to yell loudly when things are not going in his favor. Due to years of being screamed at/beat for hours on end, the yelling scares the hell out of me and causes me to panic. I went to him sobbing amd freaking out the other night, begging him to stop, and for a day things were better. But he has started getting louder and louder again and I don't know how to handle this.

Don’t you guys hate it when people use PTSD as a joke?,99,i0r8ps,29,"It’s one of the worst things someone can endure and no one can even try to understand what it’s like. It’s not just PTSD.

I have an ungodly amount of anger and don’t know what to do.,98,ha95px,34,"I’m just an angry person. It doesn’t come out onto other people that often but the emotions are controlling me some days. I get so angry at things related to my traumas. People having and remembering their innocence during childhood. I’m angry at depressed people due to watching several family members struggle with it by age 13 (it’s ironic and I know because I’m posting it in a mental health related subreddit. As my present self, I know this is an issue). I constantly have to hold myself back from saying or doing something bad and remember that it’s my anger that’s making me think this. If I even let my guard down in a triggering situation, my anger really comes out and I end up treating people like shit. 

I’m confused, bitter, angry, and feel like it’s about to come out in an unhealthy way if I don’t help it soon. I don’t want to be this angry anymore. I’m in therapy but the anger has been very controlling to me lately that I don’t know what to do."
Feeling more comfortable with kid's stuff and acting younger than you are to cope with bad things?,96,gomnqw,31,"And also when you're upset, you react a way very similar to a young child? 

I just wondered if this is a normal thing to do? I'm not sure if this makes much sense. But like when I'm extremely overwhelmed and upset, I don't do this, but my brain says/instinct is very much to throw a tantrum like a child. I'm extremely embarrassed by this reaction. I've explained calmly and like an adult to my boyfriend that this is how my brain is when I'm pushed beyond my means and he's very understanding about it but I just want to know why and if other people have a similar experience? 

I also still very much enjoy cartoons and cute things and toys and stuffed animals like children do. I'm an art student and have ""nerdy"" interests so most people don't really think twice about my interests. I'm just really decorated and colorful and have stuff all over my bags, car, room etc. I just find it so much safer and I don't really have much of an interest in most traditionally adult things.

FINALLY making some progress with my PTSD!!,95,dz4m9b,7,"Alright so...

I have very severe PTSD. It's so bad that it severely impedes my functioning and ability to work. I have basically 24/7 dissociation, constant looping flashbacks etc.

In the past, I did EMDR therapy which didn't really help that much (well, I guess maybe it helped a little ... again my case is severe). I also tried mental grounding exercises which weren't very effective.

I started seeing a new therapist who has started me on **physical** grounding exercises and it has helped a ton. One exercises that helps a lot is putting your hands against a wall and pushing when you feel like you're dissociating. Another one is wiggling your toes etc...

This type of grounding has by far been the most effective. I guess everyone is different and different things work for different people. Just thought I'd share."
"Anyone else feel ashamed and guilty when you appreciate your beauty or personality and want attention from others, too?",97,dh3wjs,8,"Anyone else feel ashamed and guilty when you appreciate your beauty or personality and want attention from others, too?

My abuser (sexually abusive father) always used to tell me I was so into myself and I was a narcissist for looking at myself in the mirror to see if I looked good or for taking pictures. He was awful. He used to fluctuate between telling me I needed to wear makeup because I looked bad without it. Then when I put effort into it, he said I was so into myself and narcissistic. Totally his way of destroying my self esteem to control and put his anger on me.

While I have been in recovery from the abuse over the last several years, I haven’t been putting much effort in my looks. Recently I have been putting effort into gaining weight and doing my hair and I’ve caught myself thinking I look beautiful. Or I will list the positive personality qualities I have as well as my appearance. 
Every time I do it, I feel guilty and ashamed. Then I’m like is this a narcissistic flea I picked up? I especially worry when I do this because when I was younger, I used to be shallow/Insecure and would be judgmental of myself and others’ looks. So I get worried because I don’t want to go back into that egocentric pattern of thinking I look pretty one moment and then wanting others’ attention and recognition of my beauty or personality qualities. I have to remind myself that I am not the same woman I was in college and I’ve grown and become less judgmental as I’ve healed from trauma.

I know there is nothing wrong with appreciating who you are as long as you do not think you are better than others. I think what I am doing with complimenting myself here and there is a good thing as I try to raise my self esteem with self love and compassion. Since I do not have any consistent support system or partner, I know it’s normal for me to crave attention since I’m not getting it. However, I just can’t shake this guilt, embarrassment and fear that I am being self absorbed, self centered, and narcissistic for doing so. My abusers taught me that focusing on my needed and giving myself love was selfish and made me a bad person.

Just want to know how it relates to PTSD and why, and if there are any tips to managing it.  


Some background: I was an angry teenager but seemed to just outgrow it, but seems like it came back almost overnight. I actually have c-ptsd from various forms of abuse from an addict mother."
I let my friend touch my back!!!!! <tw physical abuse>,100,da0js5,17,"I was physically abused as a child a lot, and a lot of it involved unprompted blows to the back of the head/back, over half a year ago i had a ""teacher"" that i didnt know during my ap saturday touch my back and then yell ""now everyone say, 'Mr marx, we will not use our phones """" to the whole class, even though it was a saturday study session... and there was no mention of phone usage, and this event made me spiral into the worst ptsd events of my life, to the point that i had to take over a week off of school because every time i walked in the hallways they would morph into the hallways i was beaten in, and i would hear my 8 year old self screaming ""Please stop, NO!"" Over and over, and any form of unexpected physical contact would cause flashbacks.

But over the summer i cut my abusers out of my life, and did a lot of meditation, and when i went to college, i reconnected with one of my friends from orientation, he is a really sweet guy, but he does the back pats and pokes to let you know he is there or he is leaving, but i let him do it without a warning... and didnt have any flashbacks!!!! 

This is probably a really minor thing, but it is a big change for me."

Anyone else burnt out and not ready to invest in relationships?,95,ca8lrk,21,"Anyone else burnt out and not ready to invest in relationships?

I know community and social support is healing and important. However, I am accepting I am not ready to fully invest in relationships as I am working hard on my self healing and my relationship with myself. I can’t really fully give in a relationship right now which isn’t fair to the other person. That also means I cannot be the social justice, nurturing, helper, enfp/infp woman I am in my heart. I have to use those skills on healing myself now. It was hard for me to quit my social service job to work in a job I barely help others and that I have no passion for. Thankfully, it is such a low stress job that I am able to focus on my healing. Taking this time to focus on my self care is not selfish. I need this time. I can’t give what I don’t have. I am burnt out by people. I am irritated by people. I fear people. I need this time to heal myself and then my relationships with others. I have learned what a healthy relationships with boundaries looks like. Now I am super cautious who I let into my life as I am watchful of red flags and am aware of the toxic people I tend to attract due to traumatic bonding. I am also aware of the toxic behaviors I am healing and working on so I have to be very mindful of how I am with others, too. It is exhausting and it feels good to have a lot of alone time.

Anyone else relate?"
"For so long, I thought I was psychotic (even tho my doc told me I wasn’t but I didn’t believe him), but a few weeks ago I found out that all my hallucinations and paranoia and mild delusions are actually caused by ptsd, not psychosis, and things are finally starting to make sense.",98,by5ucs,37,"I know other people with ptsd, and some of them experience hallucinations due to hyper vigilance or a rare occasions a hallucination related to their trauma, but I’ve never met anyone who has hallucinations both congruent and non-congruent (but mostly non-congruent) with their trauma. Although, my psychiatrist told  me about some of his other patients who experience similar things that I do who have ptsd. Before I got ptsd evaluation, i never knew ptsd could cause non-congruent hallucinations, and it’s hard to find good research on it.

I was wondering if any of you have experience with hallucinating due to your ptsd (besides hyper vigilance), and what are yours like? Do any of you have non-trauma congruent hallucinations (like I do)?"

Witnessed a death. Need help.,97,av963b,20,"A few days ago, I watched a pedestrian get killed by a car. I was the ""first responder"" in the sense that I pulled over, called 911, and approached the person. He was very obviously dead, body was ripped open, guts spilling out. Nevertheless I felt for a pulse and there wasn't one. Waited in the middle of the road for cops/FD to arrive, waving cars by. I think maybe I was in shock that night because it didn't seem to affect me. But that night I got home and completely lost it. And ever since I've keep getting flash backs to the sight of this person's body, and it leads to all kinds of dark places. I'm not a crier, but I will break into hot tears in the middle of the most banal routine thing. Not sure what to do or if I just need time. I don't have a therapist and will probably reach out to find one, but needed to get this out somehow sooner than later as I'm melting down a bit.

EDIT: I very much appreciate all of these responses.  I have learned a lot about resources in these posts that I didn't know existed and it's a relief. My wife is helping me contact a therapist. Also I realize that I was misusing the term PTSD and that's not really what I'm dealing with. Apologies to any of you who are actually dealing with PTSD, it was simple ignorance on my part. Again thank you all for your support and advice. It is a relief to hear validation that my delayed response and struggle with this isn't atypical."

It was over two decades ago when he experienced this.  He told me he never saw armed combat.  He told me he never fired his gun.  And yet I learned not to come up to him quietly while he was asleep, lest he startle awake and try to choke me before realizing who I am.

Wanders off but keeps coming back to me, like I am a port in the storm.  His anchor.  ""What am I supposed to be doing?""  he asks, as simply as my 6 year old son might.  


""You're supposed to be sitting on the couch and resting.""  I tell him, and wall away trying not to cry.


Edit:  Thank you everyone for your kinds words of advice and support.  What a great little sub to stumble into!  I wrote this in a moment of despair when I had nowhere else to turn, so thank you kind internet strangers for your compassion.   Next week I will look into getting myself back into therapy, to help process my own second hand trauma, and to keep myself healthy so that we can rebuild after we get through this.  "
"I'm going to take his ass down today even if it kills me. I'm not ready to face him, but he needs to be in jail. Now. (TW: rape, suicidal thoughts)",96,a7n08x,17,"I have to call my rapist today with the detective (and my friend for support) and try to get him to confess to something so that the police can arrest him. I cant sleep. I'm so tense. Ive been smoking dabs since i got off of work at 3 am. I'm a nervous, chain smoking, wreck of a human being right now and the only thingkeeping me from killing myself is my new puppy, Odin. You know, I named him that because he is a god. The God and guardian of the wars in my head. He's going ro be a great therapy/SD. Any ways, I feel.. Numb, almost. Like, there's just too many emotions that they all cancel each other out. I'm not ready to talk to him. I dont want to hear what excuses he has to say. I dont want to know what his psychotic mind thinks and how he justifies anally raping me. I have wondered often, was it because I'm such a defiant little shit that he did it? He didn't get any reaction when he was choking me until I passed out although I stared directly into his eyes. I could see how much he liked having control over how I breathe or didn't. Didn't was better, i guess. I didn't scream or cry when he raped me. I just.. Tried to talk to him reasonably to get him off of me. I couldn't move. He had me pinned. I had never felt so small and powerless as I did then. I couldn't get him off of me. And I remember my way to the hospital for a suicide watch that i told Travis, I cant do this. That girls like *me* Don't get raped. As if that fucking means anything. 

I can't sleep.
I'm not ready to face him, but I refuse to let him be on the streets tp hurt any other women. And he bragged to me already that he had made another girl have convulsions she was so traumatized by him. So, he really fucking needs to go."
abuse robbed me of my childhood and ptsd is robbing me of my young adulthood.,97,a4rfpj,14,"I wont go into to much detail about my abuse but it was 4 years (14/17) of physical and mental abuse. 

I have issues with guys getting to close to me I can't touch guys without panicking, and during bad ptsd attacks I have hit my head over and over on a wall giving myself one megga bruise (lol) 

I worry when someone takes food from me without asking, and I worry when people don't understand me and my struggles. 

I hate having to tell guy friends it's not there fault when I flinch when they go to hug me.

I wish my ptsd would vanish so I could be happy.  "
"I’m freshly diagnosed and I’m absolutely so tired of hearing “...What do you mean, you have PTSD? You weren’t in the war...” Anyone else?",95,7k5ib3,49,
I read PTSD effects the speech area in the brain. but I want to know more about this.,94,lnbwgq,43,"It is difficult to talk about trauma. but in my case trauma effects my speaking skills in general. Even finding the right words to have a normal conversation was difficult. I’m not sure if this is connected to my depression or what.
There are times when I literally freezed in the middle of a conversation. good thing people finds a way to end it in my behalf lol"
has anyone else found that marijuana helps to reduce/stop nightmares?,95,ht6g0c,57,"i’m a 17 y/o male, i was the victim of a sexual assault, and have found the nightmares to be absolutely debilitating. i’ve been using marijuana because i found that when i use it, i sleep well, don’t wake up several times during the night drenched in sweat, and don’t have any nightmares. my parents eventually found out, and i tried explaining this to them, but they wanted me to try some pharmaceuticals. i’ve already given prazosin a try, and i find it to be semi-effective but the side effects are something that i strongly dislike. i find myself to be very dizzy and groggy when i wake up, and i never feel like i got a good nights sleep, no matter how early i take it. i talked with my psychiatrist today and he said there isn’t any other medicine he can give me for the nightmares, and he decided to take me off of the Prazosin and increase my dosage of Lexapro (antidepressant) from 10mg to 15mg and told me it should help with the nightmares. my mother told me she wanted me to try one more pharmaceutical and if it doesn’t work then we can talk with my father and stepmother about me getting my medical marijuana card because that is the only thing that i’ve found stops my nightmares, and also helps me during times that i have severe triggers/flashbacks during the day. my only issue is that my father and stepmother refuse to admit that medical marijuana is a viable treatment for anyone at all, let alone my PTSD. they say that it’s just lazy people who just wanna get high legally. 

tl;dr: has anyone else found that marijuana helps with their nightmares/symptoms of PTSD? how do i bring up the conversation with evidence and logic to my father and stepmother to prove that it’s actually helping me, and i don’t just wanna be allowed to get stoned?

update: today is my second day taking 15mg of Lexapro, no Prazosin, and no Cannabis. Last night i woke up 3 different times, drenched in sweat, and I found it quite difficult to fall back asleep each
time. over the past 3 days i’ve been listening to the audiobook “The Body Keeps the Score: Brain, Mind, and Body in the Healing of Trauma” by Bessel Van Der Kolk MD. which i think has so far been a very beneficial read. but i’ve seen no decrease in nightmares but some decrease in flashbacks during the day. i’m not sure how long i can take the nightmares before i go back to using the medication that i know will work. i also woke up the night before 4 different times covered in sweat just the same as usual."
"Thinking ""Why did nobody notice something was wrong?!""",93,fap803,19,"I feel so awful because I love my parents dearly but I don't get how they never noticed there was something so deeply wrong. From like age 4-7 I was openly masturbating to the idea of abuse and death, I'd even outright say these things of wanting to be humilated and hurt, WHEN I WAS A CHILD. All I remember them saying is that touching myself is something that shouldn't be done in public (I would basically do it everywhere)
Then I used my unsupervised internet time to look at stuff like happy tree friends and it all started getting worse from there.

I also would do very extreme things for attention (I was later diagnosed with HPD and BPD too), like swallowing shampoo to throw up, trying to pee myself, trying to hurt myself..."
Use this to help others that can't possibly understand what we are going through.,96,f7w6mq,28,"No one understands how ptsd sadly affects everything in our life. I try to tell people imagine a car or tree terrifies you cause something traumatic happened to you involving a car or tree. Now imagine having to live and function with all the trees or cars around you, that terrify you. Even walking outside or watching tv would be incredibly difficult. Sadly a lot of people don't understand this but maybe if you explain it to them like this they can know even slightly how hard ptsd is. This is how I, you, and anyone suffering with ptsd feels. That we fight every moment of everyday to survive"
I fucking hate this illness,99,f4r03j,13,"I've identified only a few triggers of mine as I've been through so much idk what is triggering which aspect of my past. However, I know that one of my triggers is people banging on my door/ window due to the past and a recent situation with a crazy ex boyfriend. I'm also living in a house with my bedroom being at the front door. I don't mind regular knocking but these two shithead kids just decided to slam their fists on my door and run off and now I'm most likely going to have a panic attack at least since my anxiety is bad today. I just wish I didn't have mental health problems so I could live my life normally but no. I'm gonna spend my afternoon being a non-functional mess because of those little shits."
All This Healing is Causing Me to Hate Myself,95,f3meug,9,"So I have been working really really hard in therapy the last year or so. I have grown a lot. I am able to assert myself when needed, I am able to bounce back from big emotions, I’m even able to enjoy moments of my life. I think my depression is lifting.

I don’t know who I am when I’m not in crisis. I’m suffering less, but I don’t feel that I deserve peace in life. I’m not as weak anymore, so I now suddenly question if I am arrogant and overbearing. 

The people in my life have been there for me during all my tough times. Do they only pity me? When I am better they are going to leave. Right?

Who am I now that I am gaining my strength back? I can’t get rid of the feeling that I’ll heal and only find out that I actually “hate myself”."
I'm one of you now.,95,ega9gb,29,"I was diagnosed by a psychiatrist last week. It's a double edged sword, y'know.  

On one hand I thought, 'great, another thing I'm going to have to struggle with'. On the other, extremely relieved because I finally got a diagnosis for this long running disability.

I thought I was just depressed, lol. It's not a cure, but it has opened up new horizons.

Cheers, Happy Holidays!"
"Had a meltdown at work, just mental overload trying to fight my way through a panic attack/ flashback and they can feel so real sometimes and my boss was understanding for the most part but now I feel so horrible about myself, they all know I’ve had a bad childhood but I feel so out in the open",93,dgiayv,12,
I am losing. And I feel like everyone is just watching it happen.,96,dbdr4s,20,"I've never posted here.. I'm 37. I grew up in a volatile, addiction riddled household and have always had trouble with things like loud noises, conflict, looking people in the eye, etc. Despite that I was able to build a somewhat successful life. I was married, no substance issues, good career, owned a home, had plenty of ""friends"". However, in 2012 I lost my mother traumatically. My father followed 8 months later, and his death was even worse. I don't want to get into details but I will say that I was witness to the aftermath and was never really the same after. The smell never leaves you. I was raised to be a tough guy, but month by month little things would start popping up with me. Fear, guilt, anger, shame. I tried to put on a brave face for the sake of my wife, but it was obvious I was degrading. No violence or outbursts, but I became withdrawn and had a hard time getting out of bed. The carefully manicured ""normal guy"" image I tried to cultivate was wearing off. I went through several diagnoses (major depressive disorder, mood disorder, borderline) before they finally settled on PTSD. 

My ex and I did not survive it. The comfort she provided me went out the window after our son was born in 2015 (even though she assured me her support of my condition would remain unflinching after his birth). She would make casually degrading remarks like ""I don't understand why you can't just get over it"" and ""You're a kind man but you're just too troubled for me now"". If she saw me begin to tear up, she would quietly get up and leave the room. She didn't sign up for this shit. The worst, however, came when we split. I told her the thought of waking up and not seeing my boy in the morning anymore was making me want to jump on the train tracks. I needed help to make this transition easier. For the first time since his birth, she was comforting. Assured me we could make it easy on the two of us. She didn't hate me and I wasn't sick or broken. I woke up the next morning hopeful that this drastic change in my life would be overcome.

After I left for work she took my son out of daycare and fled the state to go stay with her mother. She said ""I don't know what people with your condition are capable of."" She finally came back 6 days later with him but still, to this day, insists she regrets nothing. The person I had put all my faith in had accused me of being capable of harming her and my son and deemed me a danger. This sort of treatment would continue with longtime friends. As I sit here, I can't help but notice that everyone I've disclosed my diagnosis to is gone. People I did a lot for, back when I had money and status. They don't have time for me now, or in a few cases just hit me with ""toughen up and get over it, bitch"" and move on. The last person I confessed my struggles to said ""Nobody's gonna hold your fucking hand through this dude. Get your shit together."" I feel so fucking alone, and I don't want to fight this shit alone. 

I don't want to be an eternal victim. But I've withdrawn completely due to my harsh treatment when I disclosed my diagnosis and symptoms. I have no more distress tolerance left. Anything which requires adversity defeats me instantly. Most of my efforts to live a sustainable life are being shot down. I feel like a loser. And sometimes I look back at photos of when my life was much cleaner, and all the people who loved me so much and wonder where they are now that they're needed. 

Stay safe out there. I hope you're all winning your fights."
Has anyone here read the book The Body Keeps the Score?,96,bvru20,44,I like it so far. I was wondering what experience others have had during or after reading this book.  Do you feel that it helped you?
Do you get hyper activated when you know people are coming to your house?,94,b334op,38,"I have two nurses heading to my house to do a check up for my baby son. I can feel myself getting nervous and hyper.

I need to tidy my house. Part of me wants to run round like a chicken with its head chopped off.

Stopped myself and decided to write to you all instead. Was really helpful last time.

Here’s what I want to do: I’m going to breath. I’m going focus on each task and be mindful of the feel, sounds and how good it feels to get things tidy.

Wish me luck.

I really need help,96,lk0s0e,40,"Hey guys, I'm a 19 year old from Syria.

I was born and raised in Damascus and when I was young I had a lot of close calls with bombs and missiles.

I remember one time a bomb went off on my way to school, its kind of hazy but one thing I remember clearly is how terrified I was, my teacher fainting on the bus, my friend screaming ""I don't want to die"", all the smoke and car horns going off.

Another close call I had was when I was running to my dad's car to grab something for him and a missile fell one street behind, it was so loud and I completely froze up until my dad came and picked me up and took me back inside.

The reason I'm posting is because my friend recently told me I might have PTSD. Mental health is a myth in Syria, I don't want to say anything controversial but people here still believe that being LGBT is a mental disorder so I can't seek professional help because I feel like these ""professionals"" don't  know what the hell they're doing and even if I could It's going to be really expensive.

My problem is that whenever I hear a loud noise (Door slam, Power generator turning on, etc..) I get cold, very cold, my feet and hands especially, my stomach starts to hurt, I panic instantly and get the urge to close my ears and sit down in a corner, it lasts a good hour until after I know I'm safe, it's extremely bad when Israel bombs Syria, my friends try to calm me down by saying that we're safe and they aren't targeting civillians but it doesn't help at all, it actually just happened and I completely lost my shit, I'm still shaking.

I was talking to my friend and she said that she's pretty sure it's PTSD, she's no expert though (we're both english majors) so I was hoping I could get confirmation and maybe some advice on what to do.

I'm really sorry if its not PTSD, I really don't want to offend anyone, I just want some help."
I feel embarrassed because my ptsd was triggered at work,95,iijliu,40,"I was handling the situation just fine until all of a sudden I get this urge to run away. I started having a full blown panic attack and started crying. I didn’t want my coworkers to know it’s because of PTSD that I did that. Luckily the customer just left when I did that. 

I was improving so much until I had to return to working retail. I just want to get better again.

EDIT: Thank you all for the support you’ve given me!!! Thank you for sharing your experiences! You all have made me feel a lot better about the situation. The next time I go to work I’m going to give it my all and not feel bad because I was triggered. I wish you all the best of luck with your healing."
Job searching in the pandemic with ptsd,93,icn3ed,17,"Wondering if anyone else is struggling returning to work since the pandemic. I’ve noticed since the shut down I’m more easily burnt out and agitated. I’m having a hard time finding a job that allows for a flexible schedule to accommodate days when I have heavy flare ups or triggers, that also pays enough to pay my bills. The masks make it even worse with my anxiety."
Learning to trust after being repeatedly betrayed and abused,95,huhn0r,11,"For as long as I can remember, my father was physically and emotionally abusive. When I was little, I didn't understand that that was an issue, so I still loved him and trusted him. Most of his abuse was not directed at me, but towards my brother who has autism (punched repeatedly over a board game, given first degree burns over dominos, etc). However, I was still treated poorly (was slapped and yelled at for insisting I wanted to watch a movie). Later in my life, I realized how much of a monster he was and now want nothing to do with him. I learned that he was a sociopath and had PTSD himself because of his own abusive father. What hurt my trust for him when I was little was when he told us that he would never hurt us because he knows what that was like.

While this was going on, there was another abuser, a sexual abuser at that. This time a family friend, specifically someone *I* had considered a friend. The abuse with him started when I was 9 and continued until I was 13, he was 16 when it started and 20 when it ended. He also had autism, but it was a milder case. He was a great listener when it came to literally every other context. When it started, I was confused and scared, I told him to stop and he did only for that day. When my mother came to pick my brother and I up, I told her about it, almost crying because I felt gross. At the time, I had trusted my mom more than anyone else I had ever known. She brushed it off like it was nothing. I was crushed. If the person who I trusted the most didn't care, why would anyone else? From then on, it only progressively got worse, the actions becoming more disgusting and violating by the week. I practically begged him to stop, told him I just wanted to be friends and nothing more. I did this for 2 years until I had lost hope of it ever ending. I forced myself to accept that this would now be a constant in my life, that there was no escaping this. I was terrified at the start of every single Wednesday, not knowing how far he'd go that day. Because of how gross and scared I felt, I went along with whatever he wanted, only initiating contact when he forced me to. There was nothing I could do- I already tired telling an adult, confronting him myself, physically avoiding him, writing him notes begging him to stop- it was too much for me as a child. 

In 6th grade (the peak of the sexual abuse), I decided to tell my 'friends' what was going on. They made a joke out of it, laughing at the situation. But, because I was so scared of being alone, I laughed with them. I had lost so many friends and people who I thought had cared, that I was desperate to be even remotely listened to for once in my life.

When it ended, my mother and his mother decided that they shouldn't report it to the police because of his disability. His mother had actually come over to our house in hysterics, saying that he didn't mean to do any of what he did. Instead of a police report, they decided the best course of action would be therapy for both of us. This never happened. At the time, I felt horrible and thought that I was ruining his life for 'blowing it out of proportion'. 

Towards the end of 7th grade, I had a girlfriend. I was wary at first because of how often  I had been thrown away, but I slowly realized that she was different. I didn't know how to react to someone treating my like a normal human, despite them knowing a vague idea of what had happened to me. It was frightening at first, but it slowly melted away because of how patient and caring she was. She actually cared. For the first time in my life, I truly felt loved.

I still have a very difficult time trusting people and opening up, but people like her helped, even if it was just slightly. We're still friends and she's extremely supportive of me. I still struggle greatly with my trauma, there are days where I just want to give up all together. But, I'm slowly learning that not everyone is going to fuck me over at every turn, albeit extremely slowly."
Today I was diagnosed with PTSD.,95,hnub4q,13,"TW for brief abuse/addiction/death mention


Psychiatrist was asking all these questions and they didn’t seem to make sense and I even said “why is this being asked?” He said “it’ll make sense just answer honestly.” So I did.. apparently I’ve just had an entire life of traumas. So much trauma just compounded.

Childhood neglect, an abusive relationship, watching my mother become a drug addict, my stepdad going missing/being found deceased, and then my mother passing away.

I KNEW that there was something more going on than just an anxiety disorder but I didn’t think it was PTSD. But now it all makes sense. The hyper-vigilance, the nightmares and sweats, the lack of motivation and the GUILT. Oh the fucking guilt.

Here’s to some new hope I’ll get the treatment I need and DESERVE. Upping my Paxil, starting Prazosin and going back to therapy. Woo!"
I live in the house where I was abused.,93,fj6m5x,28,"I feel so uncomfortable living here. Even though nothing has happened for years, I can't shake this anxious feeling I always get. I can't stop seeing it happen when I walk into the living room or my bedroom. I keep having nightmares of it happening again or dreams of being tortured and killed.

I can't leave because I have no where else to go. Being here can be sort of nice sometimes, since my parents are kinder to me now than they were before. But it's mostly draining on me in every way."
My dad filmed me showering when I was a young teenager,94,ef3ahm,18,"I’m (19F) back home for the holidays, and a lot of memories are coming up that I haven’t thought about in years. 
 
Like the title says, I recently remembered finding a hidden camera facing my shower when I was a teenager. I looked directly into it. The next time I went to shower, it was gone. 
 
I’m very disturbed and disgusted right now. I have memory problems because of other traumas, so I have no idea if I even trust this memory (mostly because evidence has yet to conclusively support repressed memory). I see it so vividly in my mind’s eye, but how did I just brush something like this off my shoulders? My own father watched me shower. I don’t even know what to do or why I’m writing this. I can’t even think straight.
 
Any advice would help right now, because I have to wait until Thursday to talk to my therapist. Does anyone else randomly remember traumas like this?"
"I’ve had ptsd for over 10 years now, with on going traumas in the last few years. Been in therapy and groups, but realize money talks when you want real help and therapy.",98,d1al36,28,"I wish I could see my therapist more than once every 2 months. I’ve had ptsd for a long time and very sick of it. I’ve had therapy and group therapy for years. I studied neuropsychology in school, even. ( when I was healthy enough to go.) I found a ketamine place within 50miles from me, but looking at the pricing is wayyy out of my or my parents reach. I feel so.. defeated.  I’ve emailed the people who are in charged of MDMA assisted therapy and no luck getting in. (I’ve been trying the last 3 years, I only got a screened call and no more).


I want to make changes to my life. If only my chronic illnesses and ptsd could be helped. I miss having school and a job. I miss getting to leave my room and the only reason I get to leave home, is if I go to a doctor appointment. I tried going out this week to a comedy show and it was terribly painful sitting there, I don’t know what happened because I kept bending over pain.


I’m so frustrated. God damn it, who’s dick do I have to suck to get my therapy paid for. I want to get better. I want to have more power over my own brain and body. Why must everything be so expensive and out of reach?! It’s about 5k for therapy and that’s only in 2-3 weeks of ketamine therapy. I wish I could go to a retreat center where I get therapy often and get to stay there for a month working on me. Why isn’t there a contest to win that sort of prize? 


I think some people just have to live a certain life and make the best of it... like, this is my life and I guess I’ll have to find little ways to get through life, and understands this is my life. Find some happiness in hell. I’m guessing this may be it. I’m definitely signing a ‘Do not resuscitate’ form at my doctor’s office, this month."
Please don't amuse yourself by startling me!,96,8whb3p,23,
i have no one to talk to,95,l3fo26,20,"I was raped by my brother when I was five years old and I didn't tell my parents about it. I was so scared of disappointing them. That time, we we're already having financial problems and I don't wanna become a burden. My siblings don't care about me and pushed me out every time. I've had anger management issues growing up. I have never had any idea how I could control my emotions. Everyone at school hated me. I had no friends. I kept it all in.

Nightmares are the worst. Everytime I remember how it happened, I feel it. It's like I'm back at that moment over and over again. There's no escape.

I tried doing my best in school and had honors for years that I don't even know if I deserve. I'm now at my senior year and I can't do online scholing anymore. I'm not learning anything. Being stuck in this house with that rapist. I attempted suicide a couple of times and I'd probably do it again when I turn 18. But I can't hurt my mom.

I don't know what's worse, having your daughter get raped or having a rapist son. 

I don't know if it'll get better."
About not wanting to call the police,94,i57feg,16,"There was another post on the front page that touched on an issue I've sometimes seen in communities like this and I really think it needs addressing in general, not just in the comments section there.

Many abuse survivors and trauma survivors *do not* want to call the police. I want to say up front that this post isn't intended to advise people not to call the police but rather to explain why others may not want to.

If you grew up in a position where to you, the police were trustworthy and helpful, this might seem absolutely crazy to you. If you didn't, you already know what I'm talking about here. To summarize in an overly simple way: police, especially within the United States, are often not friends to abuse victims.

Let me give you two examples from places where I lived with generally well-regarded police forces. Warning: mentions of rape, physical violence, emotional abuse, and police misconduct aka what many people observe as ""normal police conduct.""

Example 1: When I was raped, I didn't report it right away. There were multiple eyewitnesses. Then he continued to sexually assault others, again with eyewitnesses, and the police were called. All of the eyewitnesses told the police what they had seen. Multiple victims testified to the police. We got a temporary no contact order, but the police flat out told us that it wouldn't go anywhere in court and it wasn't worth reporting because nobody would believe us (the people he'd raped and sexually assaulted).

Example 2: I moved to a different town. I then started experiencing extreme abuse at the hands of another man who I'd previously considered a friend. His girlfriend was the main target of his exceptional violence and emotional abuse, but his abuse affected me as well, including multiple death threats, threats of using his position of power to make sure I could never be employed if I ever told anyone, and even a knife drawn and used to threaten me into a corner. I called the non-emergency line because I didn't know what else to do and the police arranged for me to work as an informant for them and call 911 and record the next instances of abuse. So, the next time he dragged his girlfriend off to beat her black and blue, I did so. The police arrived, told the abuser that I was the one who called the police, called me hysterical even with evidence of physical abuse (they just said ""oh they were getting kinky""), and told me that if I didn't like it, I had to move out immediately. Had to move across the country after this one within a week; spent that week at a friend's place and left a lot of my most important belongings behind as a result.

Both of those were interactions with ""good"" police forces. Last time I interacted with a ""bad"" police force, they marched me out in front of an entire high school as an ""example"" because I was a perfectly behaved kid and they could do this to me anyways. No, I hadn't violated any laws and never have been convicted of a crime; they made up charges to arrest me and do that stuff to me and then dropped them the same day.

It's very reasonable to not want to interact with police in many cases. If you're white, cis, straight, middle class or higher, live in a good neighborhood, etc, police might be your friends, but it's still a gamble. If you're missing more than one of those categories, well... you're really rolling the dice if you call American cops for help. You've seen how innocent people who are good upstanding citizens can be killed by cops with no recourse in the US; Breonna Taylor is a good example.

Even if you're in a situation where you know the cops will help you and you know you're not in danger, you may still have reason not to call the cops. Most people here who have survived abuse know the psychological effect that can have on a person. You might justify it to yourself or believe that your abuser doesn't deserve to go to jail. That's not a healthy thing to think, but it's also not a sign that the person is making up their abuse. Heck, I was literally raped in front of eyewitnesses and I wanted to make sure that my rapist didn't as much as lose his job as a result. Of course people said I was making it up because of that, but I sure as hell wasn't, and you can ask the people who watched it happen and didn't feel safe enough to intervene.

Anyways, I just really felt that this needed addressing. I don't talk here much because I don't really feel like I have a lot of people I can relate to in most PTSD communities and seeing something like that on the front page of the subreddit really doesn't help in that regard. I'm just hoping this gives some context to why trauma survivors don't always want to call the police."
Has anyone’s PTSD got significantly better after getting a dog?,93,emw904,44,"I got a dog a week ago and my PTSD has been under control so much lately. I have had nightmares still but I feel so much happier and I can move on quicker and calm down when I have instructive thoughts. 

Also, I’m so preoccupied thinking about her that I don’t have as much time to ruminate and feel scared. 

I love her and I’m so grateful for her! She makes my house a home and I feel safer with her here."
Why do I get such a strong urge to view things that I know will trigger me?,96,crtfww,25,"Things such as my ex boyfriend and his new girlfriend being cute together. 

Or even worse, videos of teenagers being abused. A couple of years ago, there was a video of a mom shaving a teen girl’s head because she allegedly ‘bullied a cancer patient’. I watched the video and it was really distressing because the girl was freaking out. It made me feel all weird and anxious and disgusted for ages afterwards, and I still feel it now when I remember it. However, *I’m really tempted to watch it again*. It’s a strong urge but I know it’ll just disgust and horrify me. 

Why am I like this? Why do I want to watch something that I *know* is horrible?"
Was anyone else sick of Hollywood's take a mental illness?,92,cdq2s0,22,"I was just watching one of these superhero shows, the main character faced a traumatic situation and was having some pretty severe panic attacks after. The main villain found out about this and used it to try to defeat the hero. Hero instead of crumbling through sheer willpower overcame their mental illness and defeated the bad guy.  


Is it just me or is it exhausting seeing these constant cultural confirmations that suggests that somehow our illness is related to our lack of effort? That somehow our willpower can cure us of all mental illness? Like if I just punched the person that used to abuse me all my problems would be solved? 

Sorry, I know this is a bit of a rant, but I figured this would be a good place for it."
I hate the dentist,93,c5su1u,22,"Lying down, totally helpless, while two people have complete control over you and are making you feel pain... Nope. Hell no. Not a fucking fan of that.

But I survived. Im a bit freaked out. Im about to go to PT now where I will also be touched, then I go to work. Just not my day today.

I really want to make it through today. Wish me luck, yall."
I realized I don’t feel helpless when triggered; I feel like a freak. The unlovable abnormal kid that deserved to be abused by biological/foster/adoptive family and partners. Bullied by everyone with no friends growing up. I don’t mind feeling helpless. I just want to feel normal.,96,b7r8hw,13,"I started talking about how other guys tend to be really pushy (rough housing) and how much it affects me. People asked me why I just don’t tell them to stop and I realized I don’t want them to stop I just want to be ok with it. They do it to everyone, why stick out and ask them to treat me differently? Why am I defective? 


I’ve always been like this. I was brought home at three years old after severe abuse by biological and first foster family, and eventually when my adoptive mother suffered from a mental illness I was abused by her. Pretty badly as well, to the point that my friends hate her more than anyone else even tho they’ve been raped or abused themselves. 


They brought me home and my sister tried to hug her new sibling but I bit her. Then I screamed for days. Nothing they did could get me to sleep or stop screaming. I didn’t talk much either. They thought I would actually be intellectually disabled but I ended up being pretty smart, so I grew up as one of those gifted kids that didn’t live up to their potential lol. I caught up really quickly in terms of speaking and reading, academics. Never socially though. 


Every single day I was bullied by kids. Every day I was lonely. And at the end of the day I would come home to be bullied by my mom and have her tell me that people were mean to me because I was wierd. And I was gonna be crazy like my biological parents and no one will love me because of it. 


She would punish me for a large list of things. she used to dig through the trash to see evidence of eating something you weren’t supposed to. Or deleting texts because she was supposed to be able to read them all. She smashed my adult brothers computer with a hammer because he didn’t give her the password even tho *he bought the laptop*. She’d punish me at first by not giving me clean clothes but eventually by putting them in the washer not dryer so I’d have to wear them wet. Put dieting pills in my food is probably the worst one. I am very proud of myself for moving out early and living totally independently from someone who controlled every thing I ate, wore, did, even couldn’t shower without her approval. It was hell. Once in third grade I drank water and held it til I cried and the teacher asked why I didn’t just ask to the use the restroom and I said because it’s my fault for drinking water...


I would go home after being treated badly and over analyze everything about the day, the way I was positioned in space, every single word I said. Sometimes I would memorize books on body language to try and position myself correctly and understand what people were saying to me. So, of course, when someone showed even the slightest interest in me in eighth grade, I thought that person loved me. I thought he was a saint for putting up with me. Then when he raped me, I thought he had to do it. If I were normal I’d want to have sex, so he wouldn’t have to force it. I was in this horribly abusive “relationship” for nine months. I went to the doctor for a checkup and they saw injuries/anal tearing. They had to report this. they reported it to the police which were his friends. These police asked if I liked it rough, if I was into BDSM, if I orgasmed. They asked me if I said no and concluded that he must not have heard me (because I was suffocating and it was hard to speak). I had injuries and any evidence you could need but all he had to say was that it was consensual bdsm. Then he tried to drown me as punishment for talking to the police. I moved states with my family and starting over at that point people kind of liked me in high school. I did really well in school,  then I went to college. Got into another relationship where we both had less than healthy behaviors. 

This entire time I have kept thinking that I struggle in relationships simply because I was raped by someone. People who are raped struggle with relationships so it was easy to say all my problems were from him. Of course, he was a lot of the problem. But I was lying to myself when I said he was the cause of my intimacy issues when since the day I was brought home I lashed out at people trying to touch me. I was also lying to myself, but to a lesser degree, when I said my adoptive mom caused the  issue by causing me to date my abuser. 

It’s not that simple. This goes back to the day I was born into a shitty family and abused to the point of being socially behind.Layers of issues peeled back. It’s honestly at the core of who I am. I don’t know if that’s fixable to be honest 

If you read my novella I appreciate you. "
"Today, I realized something very important...",94,ly1s4m,10,"I realized that I can't make everyone love me, no matter how hard I try. No matter how much effort I put in not everyone will care for me. I realized that after standing there, staring at my boyfriend who was too busy playing video games to give me a proper hello after just returned from being hospitalized due to be suicidal. Then, watching him barely talk to me the rest of the day and mumble a ""I love you"" just to appease me. Part of my PTSD comes from being abandoned after being severely abused by a parental figure. So, I always have strived to try and make sure people love and care about me... Yet, today made me realize that I can't."
Is it normal to have really bad drifting / startle responses with ptsd?,91,lllsny,21,"It happens to me a lot where I'll start feeling myself disconnecting... And when my now fiance touches me to get my attention, I jerk so bad, and get an adrenaline rush, and feel almost like I've got whiplash from being pulled back, if that makes sense?    Like tonight, I was crocheting and just felt myself drifting away. I was still crocheting, but I was on autopilot, not hearing what my fiance was saying, not hearing our cats meowing, nothing. Felt like I wasn't there.   But then he got worried and put a hand on my thigh to get my attention and I straight up threw my project and whipped toward him all tensed up.    I'm just wondering if this sort of disconnected, drifting, extremely startled thing is something other people are experiencing, too... And also any advice on how to keep myself from slipping into that state would also be appreciated, because none of the professionally suggested methods seem to work??"
But what if I'm just faking it??,93,kile64,25,"I'm not diagnosed and I'm having a hard time opening up to my mom about what happened to get some help. Mainly, because I'm afraid to be called overreacting again and I know I'm gonna be in a deeper hole if she doesn't believe that I suffered this much from her actions. I've been planning to tell her, but now my thoughts are all over the place.

Right now, I feel like I just make up everything. I feel like my struggles aren't real. Like I'm just faking my reactions. Like the flashbacks, the anxiety, the fears, etc. are just something that I control. I want to get help. I know I've been suffering from all these. I already got out of the situation months ago and then my mind just decided to explode on me, but what if I'm just faking it unconsciously?? I can't even talk about it verbally because I feel so much shame. This sounds dumb, but how do I know if what I'm feeling and experiencing is real?"
How do I ‘professionally’ address my PTSD to employers and really anybody?,93,j6kp07,41,"This is my first post here and I constantly feel like I don’t have the “right” to claim PTSD, because I put myself into the situations that gave me trauma, but I am diagnosed and go to therapy, meds, etc., and figured I’d seek some advice. Most of my trauma stems from being a shithead kid, which led to getting into trouble with the law; robberies, car theft, dealing= prison. More than I’m comfortable sharing on my main account. Im 21 and I struggle with physical symptoms every single day, the main being what I call hurtful anxiety, that feeling like adrenaline rushing to and leaving your body, like when a cop flashes his lights behind you. It’s debilitating, lasts all day long sometimes, and I’ve come to realize there’s a long road ahead of me. So my question is how do I approach this, if necessary in a professional way? For example, my boss is pretty understanding of my GI issues and anxiety, and today I felt like he deserved to know why I needed a few days off, and I sat there for 30 seconds before saying “I’m having a fucking mental breakdown dude.” He asked what he could do to help, and of course I said it’s something that I’ve got to deal with, but it’s had me thinking all day that, even with women and friends who come into my life, who I feel deserve to know why I behave some ways some times: I have no idea how to say these things and I’m frankly ruining the relationships I have and new ones aren’t even possible. Any help would be appreciated, even to tell me I’m not alone in my physical symptoms!😭 To end on a high note, I’m around 9 months sober from a horrible Xanax addiction🎉. I have to get back to working, looking forward to any replies, if nothing but to let me know I’m not alone. Peace"
what is your biggest pet peeve? personally i hate it when people ask “what happened”,94,hy3anu,128,
"Relationships feel ""invasive"" after trauma",89,he26tx,11,"Not sure if anyone can understand or relate, but after my trauma, I like the idea of relationships more than the actual thing. They feel invasive to me, as invasive as my trauma. The irony is that I care a lot about people and deep down I enjoy moments with them, but anything too serious makes me question their loyalty, undoubtedly thinking ""they can't be trusted, and friendship isn't a real thing, they'll betray you in the end, and if you tell them the truth, all they'll see is the PTSD. You bring nothing into their lives but pain, so remain distant."" I tell myself. It's not like I can't be social, it's not like I don't care about people, but I always default to the person who keeps people at arm's length. Sometimes it feels lonely, other times it feels like the only right way to be, and it feels safe and empowering. Trusting people before has ended badly, and even with the ones that it didn't end badly with, I'm not sure, relationships just don't feel right, no matter what. It always feels like pressure, like I'm putting on an act. But I'm not the person I was before ""it"", and now, I don't know who that person is, or if I care much, I just go about my business. Parts of me crave it when I see how loving friendships can be, but the moment I have that it feels yucky and just invasive. Fake, mistrusting."
HAE had to deal with this “misery poker” in the trauma community?,93,gcwyeq,45,"I think the title kind of explains the question, other than that does anyone have any advice has to how to diffuse it. One person suffering more doesn’t make me suffer any less, and there is so much more to complexity to PTSD than comparing a traumatic event to another. I’m not trying to make the other person uncomfortable either, I‘m just kind of sick of it."
My trauma isn’t bad enough (tw?),96,f8a48a,33,"I was emotionally and psychologically abused and bullied for like 4-5 years, and I know that sounds like a lot but part of me wishes that the abuse would’ve been worse or would’ve lasted longer because I feel like my case wasn’t “bad enough” and my parents don’t even take it seriously (even though I am diagnosed) and continuously talk to me about my abusers. I just feel,,, off? I see a lot of people suffered from s*xual or physical ab*se but I don’t see many cases like mine and I hate feeling like a snowflake"
Hi! I’m an artist with PTSD. I want to connect people with various kinds of trauma and empower us through images and text.,94,cek9ao,26,"So I’m aware this app isn’t really supporting images, but I’m a visual artist looking to find a community I belong in. I realized pretty recently that I have complex PTSD from a variety of experiences, and that it does color all my work significantly.

I’ve always been artistic since I can remember, but it’s as if my art just got darker with age due to all the stuff I’ve lived through, as well as perhaps more tender thanks to all the truly deep connections these hard experiences I’ve had have resulted in.

Anyway, cutting to the chase; I’m posting here because I’m interested in two things:

1) Sharing my body of work with people who might feel less alone when they see the type of visual content I create.

2) Whether any of you yourselves are, or know of other visual artist who produce art related to mental illness, trauma and recovery from such. I would love to hear if anyone has similar artists I can follow myself.

My instagram is at Danica_Lundin. I’m also working on a professional website that I will share as soon as its ready.
We’ll see, I don’t even know how much attention this post is going to catch.

Edit: Someone suggested I make a discord server where we can hang out and share stuff! I think it’s an excellent idea:

https://discord.gg/BGXfu9V

You’re all welcome.

Either way, I hope you all are taking care and that you’re on the way to recovery. I know it is possible, because I’ve felt and seen it. Relapse isn’t failure, and neither is not feeling well at all. Life is a tough tit and that shit happens. X"
Has anyone else found they are somewhat sexually apathetic due to sexual abuse at a young age?,95,b0s7md,37,"Just curious, my therapist told me she has noticed people who go through sexual trauma for their first sexual experience tend to not be as sexually expressionistic or motivated later in life. I was wondering if this was true?

I have found I am not as sexually motivated as most men. I still love sex even though it can be hard for me to express myself in that aspect. I tend to be attracted to the opposite sex because of emotional reasons, connections, rather than physical. It makes conversation with other males extremely difficult about the opposite sex, and I tend to just avoid it altogether.


My therapist says this is a blessing in disguise. Even though I wish I could express myself sexually easier, I don't view anyone as sexual objects and I tend to value conversation more and a persons personality. Not that being sexually abused at a young age is the only way to obtain that, but it's what I got from it. 

I never find myself motivated by sex, it's more of something I have to do, and it makes me feel alienated in society. Can anyone relate?

After 17 years of silence my first attacker reached out to me. Tomorrow is five years since my third and last attacker laid a hand on me. I cannot begin to describe how intense this trigger is this morning. I need some advice please.,89,md6l40,18,"Diagnosed with BPD and C-PTSD.  I've managed my BPD well after years of intense therapy and stability in life.  Three time domestic violence survivor.  Relationship with mother tarnished along the way.

First attacker was my highschool through college boyfriend.  We were pretty serious for 3 years before the attack.  He cheated on me then attacked me when we fought about it.  Married her and had two girls. We broke up shortly after my parents began their divorce after 28 years of marriage.  Just a really shitty time in my life.  Pretty traumatizing and that whole year kinda spiraled into 15 years of self destructive instability.

This morning I woke up to a message on FB from him.  He clearly wants to apologize.  I look at the calendar and tomorrow marks 5 years from my last and most traumatizing life altering attack.  I've struggled a lot and almost took my life in these past 5 years.  Until this message from the first I hadn't even had the date in my mind or on my radar.  I was managing pretty well.  Today it all fucked up.

I haven't slept well lately either.  My neighbours are abusing their dogs and I am working with the Humane Society to correct the situation. So I woke up to the sound of two dogs yelping in pain from bark suppression devices.  I have two dogs that I was snuggling with and it was incredibly difficult to hear that they believe my initial complaint was a noise complaint and have chosen to further torture their dogs because I called the Humane Society.

And after four months working with the same 6 people I've now been reassigned and am floating from worksite to worksite.  So my life has kind of upended and my regular comfortable supports and distractions have now been taken from me.

I'm so shook up.  All the flashbacks.  It was suppressed pretty good for the past 6 months?  And we all know I won't be able to shut them off.

I also have to decide whether to respond or not.  Because that is going to weigh on me.  A basketball has been tossed to me and I gotta decide if I'm gonna play or if I'm going to decline the challenge and walk away.  I want and deserve an apology but he will never deserve forgiveness.  I wonder if it's completely self serving now that his kids are dating age and he knows what he did was fucking awful.  And those memories fucking flood back.  I can't forget it.  I wish I could have a lobotomy.  Forget my past completely.

Fuck PTSD.  I'm so sick and tired of living with this.  Fuck all the ones that contributed to my trauma.  Fuck em all.

Edit: For clarity this was his message to me this morning
>Hi stranger.. how have you been? Thought to say something but I haven't had the courage to put myself forward and initiate contact.
Anyways, felt I should attempt."
Not sure how to handle the waves of “this isn’t fucking fair”,92,m5mp5h,17,"In the beginning of this year I discovered my partner was lying about their sobriety (3 months clean from heroin is what I was told). I watched them slowly spiral out until I threw their shit out in the hall and that was the last of it.
The situation sucked but really is nothing compared to my initial trauma. But I still feel so angry and unsafe that it feels identical to the domestic violence situation I was in years ago. 
I find myself randomly angry crying and screaming. I want too move on so bad. This shouldn’t fucking matter so much. I’ve been through so much worse, why can’t I handle this?"
PTSD is ruining me,91,kjr4xk,57,"I can't stop drinking. I have horrible dreams, sometimes related to trauma, but often times just really really terrible and dark and gory. I get sleep paralysis and sometimes lay awake with all my lights on until the sun comes up so I can finally sleep. I've ruined my closest relationships because of it. I don't trust myself to become close to people anymore because I am ashamed when they see me having PTSD attacks. I lash out and am angry and mean. I'm only 28. I can't even use my degree because my triggers are in the field. It feels like everything I do is to avoid remembering. I've been in therapy for so long and it isn't helping. I don't know what to do."
Do you think that the suicide of a close relative at a young age counts as a traumatic experience?,96,j0h2gq,32,im trying to recall chunks of my past atm and its a bit difficult so instead im trying to think of what my brain is trying to block out and i keep circling back to this?
I feel like I turned into my abusers to survive,90,hzd8vf,26,I am so ashamed of the person I had to be to get through that dark dangerous place.  I feel like a hypocrite realizing how much I became like my abusers.  I have such an identity crisis and want to destroy everything under shaped me into.
Are you afraid of having an official job?,92,hf3md9,47,"I once worked officially. I mean had an interview, sort of, had a probation and eventually got the job. But the job was scary from the start because of the task and it was human related (I had to consult, answer people's questions, know the answer when I didn't know it). I, obviously, was panicking right from the beginning. Eventually after two months of working, there was so much fear built up, that I couldn't face customers anymore. I literally was running away from them. So I quit. And now, just like before, if I think of getting a job, I would get so terrified, that this intense fear would make me fall on my knees and make me throw up or something. Basically I'm gonna be shaking and shitless scared. The fear would be just crushing me. 

Now I do have a job (or rather responsibility) but since it's not official (they didn't actually hire me, I'm not registered at the job as employee (my father is, and I'm just there while he's at another job), so I don't feel myself that much responsible, or accountable, but still this job really stresses me out.

I also can't go to a gym. That's always been something ""nope, never"" thing for me, too.

Really can't get over it. Don't really know what's the reason, only that when the profession (job) implies that I have to know answer and I don't, that really scares me.

So, yeah, the job could be top-1 trigger.

Honestly, no matter how much I tried this last 7-6 years to heal myself, to get rid of this and my social anxiety, it didn't work and my condition only became worse. Basically, almost nothing changed and my disorders are on the same level as they were, if not worse.

Basically, if you're afraid of the job just like me, say so in the comments. I would like to know some people like me who has the same trauma."
I'm Tired of Being Brave,94,gu4rko,9,"
I'm tired of 'being brave'
Every choice I make 
Between life and death
Or the road to life 
Or of life
vs. The road toward death.
So easy to travel toward death.
But the only way I'm ever going to feel happy is to take the road to life,
Very shiny,
and brightness hurts my eyes,
And there are people out there,
That is such a drag,
So, I need to be brave,
And I'm tired of being brave."
Living my best life but also feeling guilty.,93,g6ecal,24,"I know I sound horrible for this but I don't want isolation to end. I'm not stressed out, I'm doing the things I've been putting off for months and my dog is happier. Does anyone else feel the same?"
First round of EMDR was good,93,f3zan6,14,"Hi! I had my first round of EMDR this past Weds after being in crisis for 48 hours straight. We only did positives/rescue scenarios because of my crisis-ness.

After 2 days of crisis-level panic, i was able to come down almost completely in a 1 hour session. No, i didn't leave with a smile on my face. I wasn't feeling *good;* it was the most exhausting work i've done. But the next day I felt a lot better.  And today is the best emotional day i've had in *weeks*. I feel almost normal! 

EMDR and trauma therapy in general leaves us feeling like a live wire, or an exposed nerve. It's hard- so fucking hard to rip those wounds open and sew them back up again. But it's better. I feel *better* in a wholistic way, down to my core. Not the temporary ""better"" i get when i'm drunk or high. I feel like i took steps in the right direction, and I'm happy about that."
"TRIGGER WARNING ⚠️ I write poetry to help me with ptsd from my sexual assault. Here’s one I wrote after a particularly bad flashback. For those of you hurting, you can hurt with me instead of alone. It helps.",93,eqteaa,9,"You come to me

With big glass eyes 

But I see right through them

I see into your head full of schemes

Your soul full of malice 

Your self absorption 

I can’t listen to certain songs now

I can’t watch that episode 

Of a children’s show

Not because you broke my heart 

But because you broke me

Because that’s when you

Took everything I was

And turned me into

Something tarnished and touched and torn 

I was just a child

You were grown already 

You knew

You

Knew 

I was little

So little

Small

Weak

I could not push you off

And still yet 

You wouldn’t take no for an answer

You pressed on

You damaged me

Or at least 

I thought I was damaged

I was so ashamed for so long

Of the bruises up my thighs 

And the throbbing in my body

The heat in my soul

Eating away at my mind

You were burrowed into my brain

Then you had the audacity 

To tell me

That I was asking for it

My skirt was short

I must have wanted it

It was over in minutes 

Maybe even seconds

But it will forever be

Part of my life

My past

My baggage

My inner demons

I didn’t know 

Someone could groom me

I thought I was so mature

But I was tricked

I was deceived

You deserve to be behind bars

But now you walk around

With a daughter of your own

And I fear every single day

What fate has in store for her

Will she end up another girl

On your bed

Waiting for it to be over

Or maybe

If we’re lucky enough

She will be your constant reminder

That it could have been her"
I started trauma therapy and this week has been awful,90,dhe4hw,42,"I started a strand of trauma therapy called reliving and rescripting, where you relive the event/s as though its on a theatre stage, and listen ti the recording over and over, then change something in the memory so that it doesnt happen and listen to that tape over and over. 

I started the first part on tuesday, and i’m too scared to listen to the tape. i know its for my own good and it’s going to help me loads etc, but i cant bring myself to do it. 

since that therapy session, the days this week have been awful. i wake up crying hysterically, i get angry over the smallest of things, i find socialising an incredibly difficult chore, and im constantly on the verge of tears (spending the whole of today just crying over nothing). 

Im sure this is totally normal, but it’s all getting in the way, and i cant exactly tell everyone in my life why im behaving/feeling this way. If anyone has any words of encouragement or advice or anything i would greatly appreciate it, i feel so isolated and alone (and need to listen to the f****** tape but cant)."

I’m finally deleting WhatsApp because it’s triggering my ptsd,88,cq39t6,25,"A couple of months ago I signed up on WhatsApp and I thought it be real cool to get clear videos. Although some videos were funny, people that I thought were my friends started sending me videos of horrible motorcycle accidents. It kicked up my PTSD and I started having flashbacks a couple of times a day of my accident. I Know that this sounds crazy, but my Trumatic motorcycle accident was 24 years ago. I lost my leg and I was awake during the whole process. So seeing videos on WhatsApp that showcase horrible motorcycle accidents only kicks up my PTSD. So what I decided to do is Simply delete WhatsApp."
Who else just hates being sober? I don't like being in my own head and will avoid it at all costs,94,bt58th,34,"It doesn't matter what I'm drinking, or if I'm smoking. In the past it would be binge eating instead. I just hate not having some kind of crutch, because being in my own head sucks so much."
i had a particularly rough day in therapy,89,b1n1or,25,"I work with a therapist who specializes in working with trauma. He’s a great dude and has really helped me with having been sexually abused as a child. Sometimes he has some methods where I’m not sure where we’re going, but end up being really profound. Today was a day like that. I usually cry in therapy, but today I CRIED. He had me walk through my nightmares and “finish” them. So, I always wake up from a nightmare right before the worst thing happens. So, he made me walk through the dream, add whatever was necessary to help me escape, and then escape. It was incredible. I felt really good about it. 

Here’s where the rough part comes in. As we were talking he said, “Why did you just let it (the sexual abuse) happen?” and without batting an eye, I gave an answer. He just stopped and said, “We need to get you to a point where you’re offended by me saying you let it happen. You did not let it happen. You were a child.” And we just kinda left that at that. It really hit me just how much guilt I’ve been carrying around for years and how I’ve been blaming myself instead of a man who was 11 years older than me. 

I don’t really know why I’m posting this. I was diagnosed with PTSD less than a month ago. I had never talked about sexual abuse in therapy. This is the first time I’ve opened up about it with a professional. I guess I’m pretty proud of myself for how far I’ve come. My therapist thinks I’m making a lot of progress. I don’t know. It was a difficult session, but I feel better. Wednesday, I was pretty sure I was going to kill myself. Now, I think I’ll stay around a little longer. "
"Learning to say ""Voldemort""",90,8nn63n,23,"“Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.”
**Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore**
*Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* (p. 335)

Here's a homebaked metaphor. This is only a reflection of my personal views, and is not designed to reflect anybody else's experience.

-----

Just as witches and wizards in the novels avoid mentioning Voldemort's name, those who have experienced a trauma tend to avoid remembering it, thinking about it, speaking about it, anything that triggers the awful feelings and sensations which a traumatic event conditions us to associate with it. We go to great lengths to avoid doing or saying anything which will activate the trauma. When anybody else triggers it for us, we have an involuntary reaction of great discomfort and horror.

*""Malfoy's dad must have told him,"" said Harry, ignoring Ron. ""He was right in Voldemort's inner circle --""
""Say You-Know-Who, will you?"" interjected Ron angrily.*

Harry Potter was an exception to this fear. He had not been conditioned to avoid the word, and it triggered little discomfort in him. Harry is the neurotypical. Trauma survivors are the rest of the wizarding world, who associate the word ""Voldemort"" with years of hiding and uncertainty, not knowing who to trust, seeing no end to the terror that was their reality. This trauma had been taught and modelled to their children and written explicitly in their books (which helps explain poor Hermione, who experiences books as others experience reality).

Through the books, we see differences in behaviour between those who avoid Voldemort and those who seek to overcome him. Harry ignorantly (and sometimes unkindly) models an exposure therapy process to his friends with repeated use, and eventually we see Hermione be the first to begin this process for herself in Order of the Phoenix. She stammers it out after years of avoidance when there is something greater at stake.

*""Harry,"" she said timidly, ""don't you see? This...this is exactly why we need you....We need to know what it's r-really like...facing him...facing V-Voldemort."" It was the first time she had ever said Voldemort's name and it was this, more than anything else, that calmed Harry.*

If you are attempting to overcome trauma, you are learning to call Voldemort by his name. Not some ambiguous term which helps you avoid a trigger. You're doing something extremely scary in the service of freedom, self-compassion and independence. You're demonstrating a willingness to put your own functionality and happiness above avoidance of discomfort. Even Ron comes to use Voldemort's name in The Deathly Hallows, giving hope that even the most fearful can learn to make room for their anxieties in the service of something far greater...even if it takes seven years to do so."
"Do all the ""triggered"" jokes bother anyone else?",92,5ps76k,42,"I understand it's making fun of people who overuse the word but still, I doubt many of the people making the jokes have actually ever been triggered. The ramifications of being triggered are serious (panic attacks etc.) and I think it's nothing to joke about."
Adult Misdiagnosed with Mental Illness as a Child,91,ksdhco,17,"[please delete if not the right place to post]

At 13, I was diagnosed with bipolar type two after only a few days of seeing a psychiatrist inpatient. I was from an abusive household so I was under extreme stress and had a mental breakdown after my parents divorce (it made things worse) and I remember that the diagnosis was based on my reaction to an antidepressant over a few days (literally) but probably really my stress at the aftermath of hospitalization. It was based on that and my parent telling the doctor that my grandparent was diagnosed bipolar, and that my other parent was almost definitely bipolar.

I’m 29 now and I’ve been on almost least a dozen medications. I thought I was “treatment resistant” and “high functioning bipolar” but now it’s becoming clear I never had bipolar (working with a mental health team) and I’m trying to go off my meds but I’m still afraid I’ll “go crazy” and that I’m “better on the meds” as my parent used to tell everyone including me. I recently found out my grandparent and my other parent don’t have bipolar, which I’ve told to every doctor they did confusing my own medical history to them and me (I was told not to talk about it with the grandparent or other parent when I was young).

I think the intervening parent enjoyed the attention they got from my “disorder”. They used to call people and tell them exaggerated stories about my bad behavior while sitting at a table outside my bedroom window. They started fights with me when stressed. I won’t go into much. It was torture. They told me that I didn’t have PTSD or past trauma and that I would have been crazy no matter what happened. Even THIS year, they told me that I was the way I was because of bipolar disorder, nothing else.

They’re the only parent I have left, but I’m scared of them. I don’t know if I want to have a relationship as close as I did before I realized how deep the lies and manipulation had gone.

I feel stupid that I didn’t go off meds sooner, I’ve had years of painful physical side effects that have greatly impacted my life and ability to function and created a number of health issues. I’ve had multiple doctors question my diagnosis but I was convinced after so many years of abuse that the diagnosis was not only correct but my identity-that’s why I was abused, called psycho, an embarrassment. 

And now I can see that I’ve been the elephant chained to the tiny stake, and I’m still afraid to go off these meds after 16 years. I was trained to think I only have a chance at survival if I take prescription medication and it scares me.

I will slowly go off, but I have a feeling I have a few years of recovery ahead (at least).

I genuinely hope no one can relate, but if you can, I’d love to hear your story"
"i’ve convinced myself i’m faking it for attention, i keep going through stages of denial :/",91,krr6r7,18,but as soon as i open up to people about my problems they say that it’s not normal and i should be getting help but yet i STILL feel like i am faking it.
I feel guilty for opening up about my trauma,91,jzb4k7,28,"I finally told a good friend about my trauma today. I was having one of those really bad days where its really hard to function because you can’t stop thinking about the trauma. I thought telling her would be freeing, since she is extremely supportive, but it just made me feel a ton of guilt. Has this happened to anyone else?"
Spicy memories go brrr (TW r-pe mention),90,hxhtne,16,"We got triggered by a graphic r-pe scene in a fanfic and spicy memories went brrr

I hide how much that bullet really hurt me,89,htuvs0,17,"Don’t read this if you are easily triggered by violence or weapons, I’m writing this because I’m hoping to relieve some of the weight on my shoulders. I’m known as a positive Person by those around me and unable to be honest with everyone about the inner struggle I face daily due to multiple incidents... the most notable being shot with a hollow tip 9mm round.
I was in a truck with one of my best friends at the time, I was looking down  noticed some movement in my peripheral then all of the sudden I felt an impact like a punch to face. I could feel my blood leaving my bodily heavily and my jaw hanging loose. I opened the door and started to walk a short difference before falling. I was fully conscious at this point, I thought I had been shot in the neck and was experiencing my last moments. I remember holding pressure on my wound until I passed out. To my surprise I woke up 5 days later in the hospital after being airlifted. Another big surprise was when I was informed that my “friend” told the police I randomly grabbed his gun and shot myself. (Later an investigation revealed the truth) he didn’t think I would survive to tell the true story. The bullet hit the left side of my jaw exited out the right side and struck me in the chest. That was 2017, I’ve had multiple reconstructions over the years since and look amazing given my injury. Last year I also made 98k gross so you would think I’m living great...However I’m still battling what I believe to be PTSD and it’s interfering with my life. I overwork myself to try to keep my mind off of the endless loop of replaying the situation in my mind and feeling the emotions boil up. When I talk to people I shove it too the back of my mind but it’s still there. I doubt anybody suspects that When I’m home alone I spend my free time listening to music slumped on the couch depressed. I feel spaced out often and sometimes it’s hard to feel genuine emotions other than anger. Sometimes I get over whelmed by the emotions to where my hands start shaking. Sometimes I feel violent, sometimes I feel like crying. Everywhere I go I’m on edge and constantly feeling as if someone is going to try to hurt me. I have a 5 year old son who probably doesn’t know his dads having bloody memories of a gunshot  running through his head while we’re playing. In my mind I’ve been shot and died a 10000 times. apparently I hide this struggle very well but lately I’ve been thinking  it may be time to look for help, I forgot what it feels like to be a human without this violent baggage with me."
Deep depression after a positive session reprocessing trauma - is this normal?,92,ggkojm,40,"Hi guys. I have depression, anxiety and panic. I’m on Vensir and have been going to CBT for about 10 months. My therapist and I started focusing on trauma. We released that I have PTSD. 

We did a series of reliving and reprocessing exercises. I had a positive realisation during my last session and feel like I am starting to really overcome and rewrite the end of this memory. However since that session I have become deeply depressed. 

Is this common? Is it common to have depression/anxiety flare after trauma work? Why do I feel so depressed when I’ve actually had a very positive trauma therapy session? Sorry if these questions are stupid, I’ve never worked on my trauma before and I’m feeling so depressed. 

Thanks."
"New Hope! A ""Largely Unexplored"" Brain Region Shows Link of Chronic Stress to Physical Symptoms for the First Time",91,fhmn7e,7,"I just saw this write-up and thought ""this is the most hopeful thing we and those with other chronic stress disorders have in neuro treatments."" The is hope for us to stay on top of our skills and in routines, but it is a lot of work for what are brain changes that do things to us that we just can't do much except treat ourselves as if we are sick for. So reading something like this for me - especially after a few weeks of being on the lesser-functioning side - was truly uplifting.

the below was taken from ""Inverse;"" study published in the extremely highly-regarded ""Science"":

In this study, Nakamura and his team tried to answer a basic question about our fight-or-flight response. Where do these physical symptoms of stress come from in the brain? And can they be controlled?

To do this, the team injected rats with a tracer that would allow them to see which areas of their brains activated in response to social stress. For rats, that means that they were exposed to chronic social defeat (essentially rat-bullying, which stresses them out).

After sustained social rejection, neurons in two specific regions of the rats' brains caught the team's attention: the dorsal peduncular cortex and the dorsal tenia tecta. The latter is largely ""unexplored,"" the researchers say.

When rats are continuously rejected by their peers, they also exhibit physical responses, including increases in blood pressure, or heart rate. But when the team injected the rats with a drug that stopped the neurons from firing, heart rate decreased by 53 percent and blood pressure plummeted by 77 percent.

The dorsal tenia tecta ""has not been focused by research so far,"" so how these neurons function was ""totally unknown,"" Nakamura says. Importantly, these changes don't appear to affect the body's heart beat or temperature overall, which suggests this circuit is solely responsible for the physical toll of stress."
Is PTSD considered a severe mental illness?,94,fd2sty,20,"In an Instagram story today I talked about my experience with accessing healthcare with a mental illness and called it severe. And now I'm wondering if that was the wrong word to use. The reason why I define it that way is that it has significantly interfered with my daily life. I dropped out of school twice.    I've struggled to hold down jobs. I was scared of social interaction and isolated myself. I attempted an overdose three times. I was in the psych hospital twice within a year. I went to two different treatment facilities that same year. I'm on three different psych meds. I should note I don't have psychosis or mania. I've been diagnosed with Anxiety, MDD, Panic Disorder, and PTSD. Is this enough to be considered severe?"
"Anyone else feel special/unique when being abused because it felt like love, attention and flattering that he was so comfortable to express his feelings/disrespect with you?",92,evxde6,14,"

Anyone else feel special/unique when being abused because it felt like love, attention and flattering that he was so comfortable to express his feelings/disrespect with you?

Yeah, it’s messed up.. traumatic bonding will make you feel special to experience their abuse. I felt flattered that my abusers felt comfortable and safe enough around me to show their true feelings and use me as a punching bag. I felt flattered they “wanted me so badly” that they became jealous and angry with me for talking to other guys and/or setting boundaries. I felt good about being a passive and submissive because it made me feel feminine (I’ve been really insecure about being masculine). I felt like I deserved the abuse. It felt like love. Relationships were not true love if they didn’t put me down, make fun of me, make me feel dumb, belittle me, disrespect or verbally abuse me. I had to protect their fragile egos and “save/fix them”—codependency! Their feelings/needs came first. Then when they would abuse me, I felt sorry for them because I saw their inner child hurting and wanted to take care of them. The abuse aroused me sexually and I became excited (traumatic bonding addiction).

But that wasn’t love. True love is free, uplifting and does not hurt. So sad how we become brainwashed in traumatic abusive relationships."
EMDR HELPED,91,eo5yd5,70,"That’s a fact.
It helped me a lot on my first session"
Last night I watched my brother try to kill himself with a box cutter.,91,edq2vy,32,"This is a true story that happened on December 20, 2019 between 4 am and 6 am. I don't know who to tell, besides of course who already knows which is close family. I’m so scared of him trying it again when he gets out. I plan to talk to his doctor and psychiatrist asap on Monday. Since my girlfriend and I have dropped of clothes, toiletry items, and some crossword puzzles and such. I also left him a short note telling him I loved him and if he wants to, to call me. If anybody has any advice at all, prayers/positive thoughts, please do so. 

I am going to try and put this out here but my explaining of the night may be all over the place so I am sorry in advance. 

 I (26m) was at walmart with my girlfriend christmas shopping around 3 am when I got a text from my brothers friend telling me my brother(22) has been sending weird texts. (Just to explain, my brother has never shown signs of being psychotic and has always seemed normal)  ""I know my phone is tapped and everyone can read this right now, but I want you all to know that I love you all"" I immediately called him and he read me all of their messages. From the sounds of it he was on drugs and also had intentions of committing suicide. I immediately knew he was in a dark place from his texts, his head seemed very warped. (My sister (25) was diagnosed with schizophrenia at around the same age but seemed very normal before had a psychotic break) so I believed something similar may be happening. I told my girlfriend we had to go and we rushed to his house. He lives with his and my mom. The entire time I was alternating calls and texts to both of their phones. They were around 50 minutes away from where we were at. About 30 minutes into the drive my brother texts me back. He says ""Donald Trump better appreciate what im workin with here. Love all ya guys"" I sent 4 texts trying to get him to keep talking to me. He started texting me more and more. Saying things like ""I want to use a gun but cant even do that"" I tried to keep him texting me. I asked him if he wanted me to come over, as I was only 10 minutes from the house. He said "" nah love you guys"" then I started to panick and I got there as fast as I could and opened the door it was unlocked. Mom was sleeping on the couch started to wake up from us coming in. I rushed to the back room where he was. I tried opening the door but the door was blocked off with a bunch of stuff so I forced it open and a chair and bunch of things propped up against the door fell over. I saw him looking at me just staring. I said his name a few times. Trying to act calm. I told him I'm so sorry for barging in but that I was so scared he was going to hurt himself I felt like I had to. He just kept looking at me. He was laying on his bed. My girlfriend was trying to talk to him very nicely and concernedly.  I sat down beside his bed trying to get him to talk to, but  not overly where he may snap. He looked like he may snap any second. He just kept looking at me with an emotionless face. Eventually he started talking. He wasnt making any sense with what he was saying though. Talking about very random stuff, all very paranoid things. Then he snapped at my girlfriend and I asked my brother if he wanted her to leave the room and just let us talk. He said yes and she left the room. As she was leaving I asked him if we could put some light on so we turned the bathroom light on. I immediately started looking for weapons and drugs. I only saw a weed bowl. Him and I talked for about an hour. He had told me he smoked meth and had been up for about 3 days. He sounded like he was better. He seemed like he was coming to his senses, well, as much as he could at that moment. We agreed on a gameplan for him and that he needed to try and get some sleep. I believed him, I dont know why I did, but I just really did. He was very convincing. But he was not actually better. As I was about to leave my mom and girlfriend were out in the living room and my mom kept telling me he cant be left here he will kill himself. Its all hes talked about for the last month. I told her I thought he was OK and him and I had a gameplan. She told me he needed to go get treated, he was going to kill himself. We sat in there talking for about 4 or 5 minutes and something hit me like a brick in the gut. I knew he must be in the room listening to us talk and must be thinking we are talking about him, and man I rushed up and went back there so quick, he was back there crying and said "" so this is how \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (sisters name) feels about how everyone gossips about her"" and I told him I had a feeling he was thinking that but we were only talking about him and our concern. Then I asked him if he would please come out and talk with us and that im sorry I didnt do that in the first place. He agreed and jumped out of his bed and came in and sat with us. We talked about driving him to a treatment facility. He didnt want to go. I tried not to pressure him into going to hard but instead explain to him how it may help him. He agreed to go. Then he said he wanted to wait for a few days. And I told him to please let us take him and it would be best for him. Then he agreed happily. I told him thank you. Told my girlfriend to make room in the car. Told my brother we would help him pack. I told him I was getting a bag for him and he said he was going to go ahead and get some stuff ready. This is getting harder and harder to type. So as  I was looking for a big bag and asking my mom if she had one I turned to check on my brother real quick and I noticed his bedroom door was closed. I went back there gave a quick knock and slowly started opening the door. He was fumbling around in a bag or something I couldnt see well it was still a little dark. I turned the light on and he stood up and stood against the wall farthest from. He had one hand in his pocket but didnt think anything of it. I told him Im glad he decided to go and it was a good choice and started explaining why. I started walking a little closer, I think to maybe hug him or help him get started packing, I cant remember clearly. As I started walking he shouted ""STAY THE FUCK BACK JUST STAY THE FUCK BACK"" and then I saw his hand. He was holding a box cutter with the razor extended out. I put my hands up and backed up. I told him that he has my attention and I am not going to jolt at him or anything. I asked him to just talk to me. That this isnt what he should do. He told me why isnt it. This is what everybody wants. I told him that isnt true. That everyone loves him and cares for him. I told him to think about our sister who looks up to him. I asked him to put the blade down on the bed please so we can talk without that. My girlfriend started to come towards the room telling us she has the car ready. I told her to stay out we were talking and shut the door with my foot, trying not to move or take my eyes off of him. I told him not to worry that it was just him and I. His face was just complete emotionless, eyes dilated to the fullest. I was so scared for him. I tried to keep him talking. He wouldnt talk. He got silent. Then he said ""I've got to do this"" and put the razor to his wrist and sliced all the way up his forearm. Blood was pouring. I flew across the room and was screaming his name and screaming no as loud as I could as I started getting closer he looked like he was going to keep going. I simultaneously grabbed his wrist that had the box cutter and pushed him as fast and as hard as I could into the wall. I dug my shoulder into his chest and used both hands to pry out the box cutter and at miraculous timing my girlfriend was rushing in and i closed the blade and gave it to her while still holding him off. Told her to get rid of it and to call an ambulance as I glanced at his gash on his arm. I noticed there was not blood spewing out so I knew immediately that was a good sign that he missed his major artery. He just stood there still, frozen. I think he had believed he had killed himself. I checked his pockets and found a single bullet. I tossed it across the room to try and remove it from the situation. I knew he had guns accessible in the room, I just didnt know where. I told him to sit down in the bathroom. We began wrapping his wrist up, held it above his head and squeezed it, waiting for the ambulance. He said ""you guys really do love me"" but in a very twisted tone. It felt, not genuine. maybe it was and I was just in shock from everything. But I told him I love him more than he knows and my girlfriend told him too. We sat there for a few minutes. Suddenly out of nowhere he tries to burst up and with all my might in my body I slammed him into the wall and screamed the loudest ive ever screamed at him to sit down and that he was not going to kill himself if i can help it. I knew he was going to go for a gun he had in his room. I was very scared because my brother is bigger than I am and I felt that there may be a chance he could overtake me. So the strength that came to me was none other than I've ever experienced in my life and I am so grateful that I could hold him down in that moment. I tried to keep him talking when we heard the sirens arrive. He said it was the police and I told him that is was just the ambulance to make sure hes not going to die from his gash. Although he was right, it was the police that came in first. Then when he came into the bathroom I was so relieved. The cop tried talking to my brother while we worked together to put temporary bandages until the first responders arrived. My brother, again, became aggressive and started to attack the cop. I knew immediately he was trying to get the cop to shoot him. As soon as he began attacking the cop I launched onto my brother and began choking him. I was in such fear the cop would shoot him. I was hoping in that split second the cop would see we had control over him and he did as we took him to the ground together then cuffed him. I kept my arms around his neck. He was fighting us hard. I told him I am so sorry and that I am only doing this because I love him and do not want him to die. The first responders got there and then gave him a shot to knock him out. He was taken to the hospital shortly after he was declared by court order to go to a rehab facility for 72 hours."
How do I really let my bf know that having sex is truly not enjoyable for me and just triggers my PTSD?,89,e8q1bm,21,"So without fully getting into the back story, I'm gay and as a child I was sexually abused for years and a year ago, I was raped in a hotel room on vacation. Sex has never been that enjoyable for me. I've had a lot of different partners over the years but they were all pretty spaced out. I've had some boyfriends, most only lasted a few months and one other one that was serious fell apart because of my sexual issues. I just really am not into sex unless it's totally under my terms and me wanting it. I get massively turned off if I'm not in the mood and someone is hitting on me which makes it so hard to hold a relationship. 

The thing is though, most of the time I'm having sex whether it be a random hookup or SO, while it's happening I just want it to be over. The events leading up to sex have always turned me on way more than actual sex which is why I've had so many different partners I think. As far as intemacy goes, I feel more intiment hanging out or cuddling with someone. Sex just grosses me out mostly.

Ever since I was raped though, I haven't had much sex. This is my first relationship after I was raped and it's really hard. My boyfriend just wants sex but whenever he's flirting with me or we actually are having sex, I just get pissed off and stressed and then depressed after. While it's happening, I just get those feelings I felt when I got raped. And it's not like he's doing anything wrong really, but I can't help it. And the fact that I feel this way and have to go forward with it makes me juat hate sex so much more. 

I have let him know about my past and he understands and he tries to be considerate but I don't think he truly knows the gravity of the situation and my feeling towards sex. I want to let him know without it coming off that I'm pissed at him and he's doing anything wrong. For someone who hasn't gone through what I have then I can understand not knowing what it feels like and I want to let him know I'm not mad at him, but I just really cannot have sex that often and when I want to, it's just gotta be when I want it which does happen occasionally. 

It really sucks, I don't want to be like this and just want to have a normal relationship with my partner but it's so fucken hard when you just get sent into massive depressions because of sex."
“They won’t be like my grandchildren.”,92,e76m2o,17,"I was just on the phone with my dad and I was talking about my aspirations to foster children and potentially adopt an infant and an older child for certain. 

I said to him:

“Yeah you have to get a license here to be a foster parent, which makes sense, but it will be worth it because I probably will adopt one or two into my family since I won’t be having any natal kids of my own.”

He just blurted out. “It won’t be the same.”

“WHAT DO YOU MEAN?” I demanded.

“It won’t be the same as (Sibling #1, Sibling #2, Sibling #3)’s children.”

“FUCKING HOW SO?”

“They won’t be like my grandchildren.”

I am infertile, I became infertile when I was a teenager for a medical condition I’d rather not speak about at the moment, but my father and family know all of this and have always blamed me and resented me for it, and has seriously pressured my siblings who can have biological children but don’t personally want them to have kids so that the “family name doesn’t die”.

I’ve heard many comments like this over the years and my anger just finally boiled over, I said, “If you ever say that to my children in any way I will kick your ass to the curb so fast your head is going to spin, keep you shit to yourself.”

I’m so frustrated! Who says that? Why can’t I just have a father who is mentally well? Fuck him."
DEA feel like a failure for getting PTSD?,94,ck0ivw,37,"I know I struggle with this from time to time. I hate when people talk about how not everyone gets traumatized from a traumatic event, some even get post traumatic growth. I find it hard when I hear that not to feel like I somehow failed or did trauma wrong. That others are even better and stronger after a trauma where as I got PTSD.

I think trauma is largely about feeling like your not enough. Not strong enough, not safe enough, now careful enough, and on and on it goes. 

It’s hard not to connect my worthiness with how I was affected by the traumatic event. I wondered how many others struggle with this too."
Is anyone else pissed off at media narrative that falsely conflates mental illness and violence?,88,81jlyy,45,"I hear both left and right wing media leave unquestioned the assumption that we the mentally ill are somehow more dangerous.

Keith and I have been together for 13 years. We have had experiences with inpatient and four intensive outpatient programs, thousand of counseling hours, medication trials, Ketamine infusions, multiple disorders, multiple job losses, two separations, a jail incident and more.  

Today, we are happily married despite living these daily struggles. It's not perfect. But it's progress. He sought treatment and I educated myself on his mental illness/conditions.

I promise, the struggle is worth it. It's not going to be easy. But it can be worth it. I told him, ""As long as you don't give up on yourself, I won't give up on you ever.""

You CAN have a successful & thriving relationship despite mental illness. Stay the course, get professional help, get plugged into a support network & stay educated with your SO.

Love,

Erin Ramachandran"
A couple victories after sexual violation,91,hjitn6,6,"As I sure many of you understand, after a sexual violation a few months ago, my own body sensations can be triggering. Have to sleep in different positions, can’t do a lot of yoga positions, etc, bc it’s triggering. 

But two things happened last week: I had a sexual encounter for the first time since that violation with someone who was very kind, very thoughtful and communicative about consent, and very sexy. I got scared and had to pause a few times (and cried one time bc I got so scared and he held me and was really sweet) but the thing I thought would be the worst - penetration - was easy and pleasurable. So I guess I can have sex again. I’m sure I’ll keep getting scared at times during it but this isn’t my first rodeo with recovery from abusive men and I can handle it.

Second victory - I’ve found the sensation of thongs too triggering since my violation experience. But since my positive sexual encounter last week, I can wear thongs again without being triggered the sensation. I was wearing a thong the last time I had a violating encounter so sometimes looking at one or picking it up is triggering, but the sensation is okay again. 

Thanks for letting me share. ❤️ can’t talk to anyone IRL about it."
Left abusive relationship 3 years ago and tried to start a healthier relationship only to find out I’ve invested another 2+ years to find out this 2nd man used my abuse information to make money & exploit me & then turn his back on me. Am I better off staying away from men all together?,92,gycxqo,49,"Long story as short as I can make it.  I was married to an extremely abusive man who tried to murder me.  Once I fled, I never looked back.  I moved on by myself for a year trying to heal.  I started therapy and started trying to rebuild my life.  I met a man who seemed kind, all of his friends said he was a good man, but now a little over 2 years later, I’m finding out he used my story of abuse to make money, to exploit me, and when I asked & called him out on it, he now refuses to see me or talk to me.
I feel like I’m just SOOOOOOOO DONE WITH MEN!!!! I don’t want to be that woman who hates men, but I just don’t remember ever meeting a single man in my entire 36 years of life who wasn’t just a complete ASSHOLE!!!  Even my old man was an abusive SHIT who did everything he could to shove my mom into an early grave.  Should I give up on men???"
Really is just the worse during bedtime can’t sleep. Can’t think for the next day. Can’t imagine it. Can’t do anything with it. As a result. Stiff and shivering. Wanting to scream inside but do it muffled. Really is awful at night for me. Anyone relate?,92,f2hrvb,20,

Was screaming during panic attack tonight brought on by a trigger from a tv show- one the top 3 worst panic attacks I’ve ever had- I’m really scared and startled right now,92,caxe49,38,"I was watching an episode of it’s always sunny in Philadelphia and randomly out of nowhere a re-enactment of almost my *exact* trauma happened. 

The series of events:
- see the bit on the tv show
- within 3 seconds begin to process it’s the exact same thing as my trauma
- start to panic and say aloud to my gf “please don’t get triggered, please don’t get triggered”
- Then by the 30 second mark I’m starting to cry
- my gf is running to grab my Valium 
- start hyperventilating 

And within 60 seconds...

It begins:
A 20 minute episode which ended in me dissociating and displaying (my rare my but not unheard of DID symptoms) where an alter fronted and I was dissociated 

The reason I am writing through is because I am *so disturbed* at the velocity of the whole thing that I was screaming in the first place. While the screaming was happening she was in the next room because I eventually had to ask her to leave the room mid episode. Today is a life changing (and I do no say that lightly) day for her and we were celebrating and then this happened and I didn’t want her to see anymore
of the 5? 10? minute episode that must have already gone on . I said “I am stifling this I need you to go”

So when she left to the bedroom close by, it just flew out of control. I was crying  hysterically and hyperventilating and then the hyperventilating that I could hear from a dissociated point of view had turned to screams. Screams of terror. Screams of fear. I’m surprised nobody called 911, but this is NYC, so I’m not surprised. 

I’ve never done that. Screamed. My trauma event anniversary will be 4 years in September and no sounds like that have ever happened and I’ve had horrific panic attacks and dissociative episodes. I eventually had to call her back in because I was scaring myself. 
She’s asleep next to me right now so I can’t talk to her about it and frankly I’m embarrassed- blood curdling screams from the living room... what a pleasant talk- I’m scared to hear what that sounded like. I don’t know why I’m so ashamed or scared but I’m really shaken. It’s 3:03 am, the episode began at 10:37pm and ended close to 11pm. 
      Also- to top it off I feel like I ruined her special, special day and a wonderful dinner. Her historical day will be tainted with the sound of my screams despite what she’s already said- which is that I haven’t ruined anything and she had a great day. 

Sincerely,
Shaken and Scared."
Stress makes me a bumbling idiot.,93,caln1m,13,"Diagnosed with PTSD last year after a lifetime of denial.

I was trying to figure out what's wrong with my wife's car this morning. Remote start won't work, yadda yadda.

I got so mad all I could think about was how mad I was. I'm sitting in my living room waiting on the tow truck full of anxiety and adrenaline.

PTSD sucks ass. I really don't know how I made it this far lol."
Dumb Victory I'm Proud Of,88,a1e05a,12,"I got a 100% on an essay I wrote while I was dissociating. It was a formalist essay comparing the language use in Kafka and Marquez. It took me 3 hours to write 3 pages, but I did it, and I did it well. Feeling proud and vainly wanted to share."
How come he gets to be happy?,87,9w9r6r,19,"I just want the entire world to know what he did to me. To believe me. To hurt for me. To not choose to remain his friend after finding out how he hurt me and walked away unscathed.

How come he gets to have a girlfriend, to be in plays and musicals, to go to MY FAVORITE OPEN MIC place, have friends including friends who left me for him, and to be able to worm his way out of every accusation as if he didn't sexually assault me in my own bedroom Jan. 1 2016. 

It's been years but I still feel unclean. It's been years but my days are still riddled with fears involving him. It's been years but it still hurts to even try loving myself or my body. I was only 15. I feel like I'm 60 years old and like I never got to be a teenager, never had the trust to have friends in person, never had fun and explored and ventured out because this incident put so much fear in me I couldn't even look at myself in the mirror without crying for a year, and I still have my days.

Sometimes I wonder who I'd be if it never happened, or if I'd even recognize her. I'll never know if I'm just a shell of who I could've been because I never got to be her."
Anyone else have a problem with their back to doors?,92,9szswz,31,I just have severe anxiety anytime I'm anywhere if I'm trying to just sit and relax if there's a door behind me.
Why I Didn't Report,89,9iebq1,11,"I've been having a hard time with everything that's been going on the news lately and although I mostly lurk here I thought that this might be a good time to post. I thought I'd share something I wrote tonight.

Why I Didn't Report

When I was a child I didn't yet have the language for what was done to me.

When I was a child I did not have loving, present parents who comforted me. I was ignored or told to stay quiet. I was afraid of what my parents would do to me if I told them what was done to me.

When I was a child, violence and boundary violations were such a normal thing that I accepted it as the norm from everyone.

When I was a teenager, he told me he would kill me if I told.

When I was a teenager, I still had no loving, comforting parents to tell. 

When I was a teenager, a different he told me I was so fat and ugly that no one would believe me.

When I was in my twenties, he said don't worry you will like it. You asked for it.

When I was in my twenties and went to the doctor the morning after, they suggested I call the police but I had watched too many Law and Order SVU episodes and knew I would have no Olivia Benson and the process would take forever. I just took the prescriptions and went home.

When I did start to tell people, it took time, so much time, and trust, so much trust, and it had to be the right people. 

When I first started to tell, sometimes I trusted the ""wrong"" people, and they didn't believe me because I hadn't reported.

When I finally told someone who believed me, I learned who to trust, and I learned that sadly, I was not alone. 

When someone is brave enough to tell you what happened to them, listen, just listen.

When I was in my thirties, I started to heal, and I helped other women heal."
"Tip: If you are in denial, try recording yourself telling someone about your trauma.",91,97dsth,13,"Denial has been my biggest obstacle - denying that certain events even happened, denying that the abuser is who he is, and most of all denying how it's affected me. Even in therapy, it's made me want to quit at times. I told myself I was probably fine, I was just being dramatic, and I almost quit therapy at the beginning of summer. Thankfully I didn't.

I've being doing video journals, just for fun, and I recently did one where I practiced telling a close friend about my background (because I've been nervous about opening up to a certain person in my life). I've never watched myself talk about it before, and when I watched the video back, it actually helped me to move past denial towards having so much compassion for myself. I realized how I would feel towards anyone else going through this - compassionate, rather than critical or suspicious. I actually started crying watching the video because it helped me to see myself - and to see how I've been affected, how real my pain is but also how much I've been determined to power through. I felt sorry for myself but in a loving way - not looking down on myself, but rather feeling sorry that I had endured pain, the way you would genuinely feel sorry for a close friend.

I'm not sure if denial is an issue for everyone here, but if you've had an abusive family member or been in situations where you were manipulated to feel like your emotions were invalid - I really encourage you to try the same exercise. It's easy to deny the pain when it's just your own voice in your head, but watching it back on video helped me to take a step back and view myself from a more realistic (and compassionate) place. I recommend it if anyone is struggling similarly with denial. Just thought I would share! <3 "
Any other survivors of extended childhood trauma?,89,6tqpr9,48,"I see that military-related ptsd is popular here and I absolutely love that military personnel have a safe place to share their experiences and connect with other similarly-minded survivors, but I have no experience with that kind of thing. I'm just a young woman in recovery from a lifetime of abuse and neglect. 

I just started therapy about four months ago and I'm only just now starting to see all the ways in which I am molded by my traumas. I don't really have a purpose for making this post, I guess I'm just seeing if there are any other survivors of childhood trauma in this sub? I would love to join this community and get to know some people like myself. "
Lacking in experience on dating and relationships due to PTSD/CPTSD,87,jqd0gz,24,"So I’ve been mentally and physically abused/ bullied for 11 years in my youth from when I was 7 till I was 18 years old including emotional neglect and abuse from my narcissistic father and it resulted in me having PTSD/CPTSD & abandonment trauma and more.
Main symptoms I got were social anxiety, chronic stress, panic attacks. flashbacks, dissociation, palpitations, depression etcetera.
One of the most difficult things was that through the years I had much trouble connecting with others on a deeper level because often I would go in freeze mode when people tried to come close to me.
This resulted in intense loneliness..
I miss love and intimacy very much.
Is this common for people with PTSD/CPTSD?"
My wife has PTSD. It's messing me up.,90,jpq652,71,"I have know my wife for 7 years. She got diagnosed with PTSD 4 years ago. Since then she has given me glimpses at her trauma during random times. She has a flashback and then she tells me what it's about. Since it's random, I'm not in the head space to recieve it and it's disturbing to hear. All of it is pretty fucked up. It messes me up for about a week or two. The first week in angry all the time and then I go cry it out for a few hours. My wife told me last night, ""It gets worse"". I'm not like ""WTF, how does it get worse?"". Anyways sent me into an anxiety frenzy and I had to drink to take the edge off. I have a therapist that I talk to but can anyone relate? Any advice? Is there any subreddits or support groupsi should know about? TIA"
Happiness makes me miserable?,89,jp4xav,16,"Does anyone else feel upset when things are going well, because it seems too good to be true and you know it will end and bad times will return, so can't trust it? I've realized I get super upset when things are going well and I should be happy, but I can't be happy at all.. Instead I'm pretty miserable because I know it won't last and don't trust it. It's like when things are going good I'm on edge the whole time just waiting for that inevitable fall, and the better things are going (The higher and better the view)the more upset I feel while waiting for that inevitable fall ( as it will be a more painful fall because it's a longer way down now). I actually seem to function best when things are not going well because it just seems ""normal"". Anyone else feel this way or notice this in themselves? I feel like I'm incapable of being happy or trusting happiness.. It just feels like a sadistic trap or something."
PTSD creeps up to me in quiet moments,90,jb36uj,6,"I had a good day and a productive week. I completed an assignment today and submitted it. I had house errands done for my new home. And my boyfriend meets up with me almost everyday and helps out with the house. He even made a lovely spread for lunch today after I got off work. I am also ready for a potential job interview tomorrow. 

Everything is seemingly good. Im ready for bed tonight. But the flashbacks, painful memories and the negative self talk is creeping up on me. I try to force out a cry because usually crying relieves me. But I feel choked inside and I feel anxious. I tried to reach out for my earphones to listen to some music but I got scared of music. I worry words may come in lyrics that would trigger more flashbacks. 

I hate how with all the good things going on, I still have to face this darkness."
Dancing for sexual assault ptsd recovery,90,j5r9q3,15,"Hi all! I've posted in this sub before and everyone has been really supportive so I wanted to share something I discovered recently!

I'm not a good dancer by any measure but I've found that dancing for a few minutes every day (sometimes it's just 10 or sometimes it's an hour) has really helped me fight some of the long effects of sexual assault ptsd. For the first time in nearly ten years, I feel like my body is my own, like it's ok to feel sexy, that it's not wrong at all, and like I don't have to hide my body. I think part of what's so damaging about sexual assault is the sudden reality that your body is not your own anymore and that it can easily be taken over and controlled. Dancing for me has helped bring that into the light and made me feel so much more confident.

I hope this makes sense and can maybe help other people here who have been so helpful and supportive to me. Have a great day guys!

&#x200B;

Update/edit: Ok after some googling it turns out movement therapy is a thing and dancing is actually a form of ptsd treatment! So interesting and makes a lot of sense. Anyway, the comments here make me very very happy that so many other people have found dancing makes them feel better :)"
Why do we get traumatized by some things and not others?,89,iqep52,22,"Some stuff I really don't get. This is all really new to me, even though I've been in therapy for 3 years now (for panic attacks and depression). We've been doing some CBT exercises and it basically put me into a full blown meltdown flashback panic attack hysteria followed by dissociating to hell and back lol. 
Turns out some childhood events really did traumatize me. Thing is, I feel like much worse things happened to me that didn't leave a burning mark, dictating my social interactions like that. I just feel silly. I've seen a bloody motorcycle crash. I've been sexually assaulted. It left me shaken but I got over it. 
And yet... I wasn't even physically or sexually abused as a kid. It was all psychological. My therapist explained that to a child a threat of being discarded, tossed away, of losing a parent can register in the childs mind as a threat of the childs actual death. So that would make sense. But it still feels silly to me. I still feel silly."
I’m so fuckin tired of just waiting for the next emergency in the back of my head.,89,hnklpn,8,I see the dog lying down and I need to watch to make sure they’re breathing. I hear a noise I don’t expect at night and I’m in fight or flight mode for ten minutes and frozen in bed to afraid to see if my worst fears were true. I get worried sick when I see my mother do anything mildly intensive physically because I’m afraid she’s gonna get herself killed. I’m just so fuckin scared all the time and I just hide in video games where I can reset if shit goes wrong and I can pretend like I’m alright. I’ve had *just* enough of my pets and one of my loved ones taken from me in ways that I could never have guessed and it’s left me permanently on high alert. I hate it.

Not all traumas are PTSD,90,e5gnja,87,"Just a quick vent on how some people online have this idea that anyone going through a traumatic situation in life, a movie, show or whatever, has PTSD. The real grievance is with the YouTuber CinemaWins who keeps saying that ""x character is great because it's a great and layered representation of PTSD"". He keeps throwing around the term like it can be applied to any fictional character going through trauma and I wouldnt mind it if he wasnt spreading this misinformation to hundreds of thousands of viewers. 

It just really reduces the weight that comes with the condition and makes me feel like more people will not take it very seriously. Spreading misinformation about an already severely misunderstood condition just sucks...

Just a quick vent. Keep going all of you, we got this."
I cried in front of my college students,89,dwlypa,18,"I (26 F) am a graduate student studying microbiology. I teach the non-majors lab.

I have been told that I cried and explained to my students that I have PTSD and wanted to work through that moment and teach. I stepped out of the lab, and came back about 10 mins later “completely fine.” I have almost no memory of the entire two hours."
PTSD and memory problems,93,dqk3o2,29,"Hi,

I was diagnosed with PTSD around ten years ago and then cPTSD recently after spending some time with a specialist.

Since the initial traumatic period (lasting five years) I’ve had trouble with memory recall, long term memory and concentration. But recently I’ve had problems with my short term memory as well. 

I’m wondering if anyone else on this board has had memory problems since their trauma and how it has impacted your lives? I’m worried about how this will affect my work and personal life.

Had a real bad day today,90,bxpzbg,16,"I woke up, pour yesterday's coffee down the drain and it came flooding out the bottom of the sink. The drain had been eaten away by rust. I go to work, and am totally swamped with work. Driving home from work, I hit a deer. Get home, and an 18-wheeler has ripped down my utility wires to my house. What a day! 

4 years ago, I would have had a mental breakdown. 2 years ago, I would have gotten black out drunk. 

Tonight, I'm just going to have one beer, make a pizza, and watch a movie off my laptop. 

I come here often to try to remind everyone that it can get better. And it does get better. It takes some time, and you need to do some work. But you can recover.

"I think I’m beginning to experience PTSD, and I need help.",88,hx92zi,35,"*on mobile, sorry for the format and grammar.

I am a cop, or was a cop, I quit after this incident. Because of how it was handled, but I’m really struggling getting past it. I was almost shot and killed, the guy had me dead to rights and the only reason I’m alive is because he forgot to take the safety off.

He was connected and a friend of the sheriff and wasn’t charged. During the week after the incident I had started developing some fear and anxiety. A week after the incident I was forced to meet the guy, and relive the incident.

They had several meetings with me after the incident trying to tell me that I handled the situation wrong (political bullshit) and forcing me to recount it over and over again.

I explained to them over and over again that I wasn’t in the mental state to talk to them or be in the meeting with the guy, yet I was forced to.

It’s been a month now, and I’m still dreaming about it, having palpitations, random sweats and fast heart rates, and I can’t get the image of him closing his eye and pulling the trigger with the gun pointed at my head, out of my head. I’ve noticed I’m distancing myself from my wife, and I’m constantly on edge.

I quit my job because of how they forced me into unnecessary situations that harmed my mental health and the lack of support offered. (I had another non law enforcement job lined up).

I loved my job as a cop, but I’m scared to death that I’m going to get killed now, and I can’t do anything that reminds me of what happened without having a mini panic attack.

It’s affecting my marriage, and my wellbeing. I don’t know what I’m looking for here. I feel weak, and like I should be stronger because of the title that hold/held. Thanks for letting me vent.

Edit: Thanks for the support, I’m going to reach out and try to get help before this really takes hold. I really do appreciate the support. My wife has been supportive, but I’ve still felt alone."
"I have C-PTSD, depression, social anxiety, ADHD (ADD) and no will to live",88,gmbhr0,19,"I am 22 (male), I had to financially support my family since I was **12** because of my fathers debts, my mother has been emotionally abusing me my whole life (she is a teacher...), I have no friends, I don't meet ANY people and can't do anything I like (or anything I „don't hate"") just because my mother thinks I should study ALL THE TIME.

I should have been „put"" into mental hospital years ago, but instead my mother insists that I have to keep studying law at the „best""/hardest university in my country. I actually dropped out of there 2 times already and I am about to drop out for the 3rd time.

In my entrance exams I was easily 98th percentile (top 2 % of all applicants), but I can't focus on reading ANYTHING. Even when I buy a book that „interests"" me, I still can't focus on reading a single page of it. My brain just zones out and my depression „kicks in"". I can't read a single sentence of something that doesn't „interest me at the moment"".

My mental situation is so bad that I can't even go to the university courses anymore. Mainly because of my social anxiety. Even when I go to the university building, I just „hide"" at the toilet because even the idea of entering the room full of other people makes me feel sick.

I studied 3 universities at once for a few months (programming, law, economics) just because I am not interested in anything and I hoped that I would atleast „not hate"" one of those topics. But I simply hate all of them. I need to do totally different thing like every minute (or every few seconds), how could I possibly study the same subject for YEARS?

I am afraid I won't even be able to go to work when I stop studying because of all my mental illnesses. I would just lie in bed depressed all day until I finally die (as I do it already).

I used to like computer games, but nowadays I don't enjoy even that. When I am rarely in the mood that playing a game would help me/have a „therapeutic effect"" for a moment, then my mom tells me „Are you really playing games like a little child?""

The only thing that helps me is music, but I usually have to change the song like every 10 seconds to „keep my brain entertained"", otherwise it becames depressed instantly. I also need very fast (high BPM) music.

I am so desperate that I am writing Reddit post even though I know that there is a high possibility that nobody is going to read it/help me. I don't even know if there is any help form me. I doubt it. I am having panic attack right now. I almost can't breathe. Thinking about my situation makes it even worse... I can't even go to a psychiatrist/psychologist because of my social anxiety.

I can't even contact anyone. I am afraid to even open my e-mail. It seems to me that because of my mental state/depression I can't remember anything. It just feels like most of my brain simply disappeared during all those years of trauma....

I wanted to kill myself since I can remember. I don't even remember „not feeling depressed"". I don't remember almost everything from my childhood. I didn't kill myself (yet) just because it would cost a lot of money to arrange a funeral (and my family doesn't have any)... Is there any help? Any hope?

My mother thinks I am just a „good boy"" (introverted) who is too lazy to study. She basically doesn't believe in psychology. When she sees my „symptoms"" she just says phrases like „you are sad because of the weather"", „you have to get more sunlight to have more energy"", „everyone has depressions sometimes"" (LOL), etc..."
"PTSD and physical disability... When everyone asks ""what happened to you?""",86,ewb5bb,53,"I am so sick of being asked what happened to me or what's wrong with me by random people I've never met, and it being the first thing people say to me before they even know my name. I know having a hidden disability sucks as well in a different way... But I just for once want to get on the bus without being asked personal questions.  It is a trigger for me, brings up the trauma as that is linked to the disabilities.

I couldn't count the number of times I've been targeted by evangelical healers, too. Today I was on my way home and a guy on the bus wouldn't get the hint that I didn't want to talk about it, even when I said explicitly I don't want to talk about it. He started saying he was a Christian minister and would heal me and had I heard about Jesus. I am not against Christians here I try to respect all faiths but its kind of insulting for so many reasons... As if anyone who is disabled is some kind of heathen and it's their fault for not turning to Jesus.  He said he was healed of a spine problem by God and I asked how come he was sitting in the priority Disabled seat on the bus, then. Then I put in my headphones and tried to ignore him smiling at me the whole way like some Enlightened One.

Sometimes in response to people asking about my health I ask them for their medical history in return. It's just not something people generally ask each other on first meeting. Because it's, ya know.... PERSONAL.

I should be used to this by now. When I'm in a good mood I tell them a crazy story and see how far I can take it before they realise I'm taking the piss out of them. Usually ends with me saying I got rescued by goats or operated on by aliens before they get annoyed and realise I'm leading them on 😂😂  at least it takes my mind off the memories."

"[M,24] Does anyone else feel permanently ""out of place""? I keep feeling like I'm not supposed to be here",89,e8jddu,14,"My trauma was parental abuse for many years, from my father. Then that was compounded recently when a toxic relationship I was in came to a head. I refused to take anyone's emotional abuse anymore, my father's or my FWB's. Last March (2019) it got so terrible that I had to leave my house, live with my grandma for months. Then I was told by my former FWB that he wasn't going to treat me better because I was a shitty person and I deserved to be treated that way. I had to cut ties with him.

I lived at Grandma's for months playing video games, getting high, sleeping in a bed that wasn't mine, in a house that wasn't my home, and trying hard to resist the urge to lay my head on the railroad tracks. I came so damn close so many times. I started scalding myself in the bathroom sink just to 'snap myself out of it"". Then I get into nursing school, settle into a routine after having gone through some heavy therapy and new medications. Then I get word that my father has died. Around that time I tried and miserably failed to patch things up with my FWB.

My worst abuser is no longer with us, and my FWB isn't in my life anymore. I'm getting great grades in school. I haven't been actively suicidal in months. My worst symptoms are passed. I should be happy; certainly not that my father is dead, but just at the fact that he can't possibly hurt me ever again.

Yet I can't shake the constant nagging feeling that...this is all wrong, that I'm here. Like I was supposed to die when all that shit went south. ""It was too horrible, nobody should be capable of going through that and living."" How can I be living my life comfortably and keep working hard to do something with it after the person who was supposed to love me more than anything on this earth, hurt me so bad I would rather die than go on? How am I supposed to ever be happy again when  the one person I found who did make me happy, thought I was the scum of this earth who deserved to be called names in public and constantly scolded and talked down to.

What's wrong with me? :( Why can't I shake this feeling that I'm not ""supposed"" to be here right now, or that I don't belong anywhere? No matter what I do with my life from now on, nothing will ever change the fact that my own father did those things to me, and that the person I depended on as a support and escape from that abuse, hurt me even worse. How am I supposed to be a regular person ever again after that? Does this feeling ever go away?"

When you’re trying to have fun in a crowd but your PTSD makes you think you’re about to be attacked RIGHT NOW,89,8z7wdj,15,Can anyone relate to this feeling? I can’t enjoy myself at things like concerts anymore. I’m not fully present because I have to try so hard to curb feelings of anxiety and hyper-vigilance. When anyone gets too close to me or accidentally touches me I freak out. Tonight I went to a concert and I was so self-conscious and distracted by the fear that I was going to be assaulted that it was difficult to focus on the actual show.

They made a joke when a volunteer fire department siren was going off (thankfully one of my triggers is a different type of siren) but I lost it and explained in detail exactly how it feels.
The jokes have become less frequent but now I'm  afraid that people won't take my triggers seriously when I tell them.
I was just wondering if this has happened to anyone else or if I just have shitty friends :/

My ex best friend of two years was drunk one night and raped me in my sleep. He had tried to have sex while we were falling asleep and I said no, and I woke up to him on top of me penetrating me while I was laying on my stomach. He came and I asked him why he did it and he said because he was horny. 

I had this memory repressed and shoved down as far as possible for almost a year. The other day it came back to me and today I told him not to message me again and that I no longer want to be friends with him because of what I remembered. I told him he raped me. 

I wish there was something I could do to help?? Help what?? You raping me? 

Judging by this weird response I don’t think I ever knew him. This sounds like something a sociopath would say. 

It sounds like he’s not acknowledging what he did, like it’s just some off-hand robotic message. Fake sympathy for somebody you don’t know. I’m appalled and disgusted even more in him."

PTSD rage and “Fawn and Freeze” turned to all consuming “FIGHT”,88,fqzjr1,31,"Rage. How to tunnel through?

I was involved in the worst most horrifying “casual” relationship you can probably imagine. Rape and emotional abuse and lies and manipulation and gaslighting to the point I barely knew my own name. To add insult to injury, he discarded me for someone new whom he gives everything to that I wanted... everything he denied me and would stonewall me when I tried to bring it up...  so I’d try to break up with him and he’d not accept my no and push forward anyway because he thought my no didn’t mean no and because I loved him and was attracted to him I didn’t know how to make sense of what was happening.

There is so. Much. Rage. And violence in me. I get that trauma is stored in the body. But that doesn’t change that I want to do violence and destruction and fight back in all the ways I didn’t before. I don’t want to do physical harm to anyone.  But there are other destructive things I want to do. I could do them. I just would probably get caught and the stupid fucking law would protect him like it protects all the other intelligent abusive assholes who aggressively wield it against the women they drive insane. 

Denying the wants HURTS. The rage HURTS. The all consuming hate I have for his lying gaslighting manipulative sociopathic rapist ass HURTS.  It hurts that I was NEVER like this before. I was sweet and kind and forgiving and I feel so ruined and powerless and I HSTE it and I can’t keep dealing with this. I have to DO something.

How do I do this? How do I heal from this? Being the better person isn’t going to work. I did all that before I met him. I was all about turning the other cheek and assuming the best intentions and choosing the angels of our better nature and he fucking raped me and kept pulling me into his horrific idea of “casual intimacy” where there were so many secrets and lies and other women and so much exposure to STI’s and omg the lies. So. Many. Lies. And his contempt towards me that he’d let out every so often... but then alternate with love and affection and approval.

I can’t do this. The Prosecutor I talked to about my DV police report said they believed me but that they wouldn’t press charges because they couldn’t win at trial because I had been a jealous ex and I hadn’t reported the rapes until after the break up (I didn’t report because I didn’t know that telling someone to stop and they keep going because you are turned on is rape).

How do I tunnel through? How do I handle this - it keeps coming back up. Grounding doesn’t help. Breathing doesn’t help. Yoga doesn’t help. Valium helps but I fucking hate taking it."

Study finds potential new treatment for preventing PTSD - will we have a blood test to confirm PTSD soon?,88,eol025,29,"> Research led by the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation points to a groundbreaking discovery about a new potential treatment and prevention for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

> ""The discovery of the Glucocorticoid Receptor-FKBP51 protein complex provides a new understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD,"" said Dr. Liu. ""We believe this protein complex normally increases after severe stress, but in most cases, levels soon go back to baseline levels. ***However, in those who develop PTSD, the protein complex remains persistently elevated, and so this could be a blood-based biomarker for PTSD as well as being a target for pharmacological treatment.*** In addition, the peptide we developed could be given after a traumatic event, and could possibly prevent the patient from developing PTSD. This is a completely new approach to PTSD and for psychiatric disorders in general.""

"DAE just feel completely robotic, dead inside?",89,ba17ks,10,"Whenever I talk to people it just feels empty. It feels like I'm running a script and I don't actually engage with them as a human any more. I feel like I'm sitting on a massive iceberg of terrible experiences I can't talk about (including recent ones, because I'm not very happy most of the time) and nobody wants to know the truth, so all I can do it just output the required material, which has nothing to do with me.   


Sometimes this goes along with feeling like I'm dead, like I'm a ghost who died years ago and is just wandering around. Or that other people are more ""real"" somehow than I am, like they're living in the real world where having careers and kids and supportive parents and contentment happens, and I still have one foot in some horrible experience from years ago that's in a dimension of its own and never changes."

Told my family tonight that I have PTSD :(,89,efbgfq,10,"My family gets together once a year on Christmas Eve.  I was already feeling horrible, I was triggered this evening and I cried before i walked into the get together because I was beyond anxious and already overwhelmed. 

One of my cousins brought up that she wants to know more about the person I've been seeing. I told them a little, not much, but I asked my aunts if my mother has told them what was going on with me earlier this year. 

I tried so hard not to cry, but I sat there and told everyone I was diagnosed with PTSD and that I was suicidal over the summer. It was really quiet. One of my aunts said, 'Oh I already knew that'. The other one asked if I was feeling better. I said the past few weeks have been a little better. And then that was that and everyone went about their conversations. 

And I cant help but feel so bad right now. I feel like I needed more to be said or maybe a hug, I was feeling so anxious and I feel physically tired now. I know that there isnt much to say, but it felt awkward and I feel disconnected. But it is just me, I did have a bad evening anyways."
My husband finally said the thing I’ve been dreading,88,dywl9h,20,"He finally, after 3 years of marriage he is unhappy with our sex life. Perhaps I shouldn’t say *finally*, he’s been unhappy but supportive of my journey to healing and never said a word until now.

We had a wonderful heart to heart tonight where he opened up and said he just feels depressed, he knows it’s not my fault but it’s hard for him. I felt so bad, because the thing I hate most isn’t how my trauma effects me, but how it effects those around me.

I got pregnant with our son and my libido dropped off the map, my anxiety sky rocketed and the idea of being touched sexually made me feel physically ill. So it’s been going on 11 months since we’ve had sex and I can’t say I blame him for being unhappy with this. 

The hardest part is, it’s not like he knew he was signing up for this. I didn’t know I had PTSD when we got married, I didn’t know my sexual capabilities were just a mask I’d created and would fall away once sharing a close space with him. We’ve been figuring this out together and my biggest anxiety driven fear has always been: when is he going to have had enough. Sure someone who loves you doesn’t just leave, but it’s also not fair to ask someone to give it their needs, and their mental health for you, all the time and I hate knowing that even with therapy, it’s been 3 years and I’m no better with sex. 

I’m going to start EMDR soon, and I just want it to work so bad so I can try to have a semi normal sexual relationship with my husband. I just wish he understood how much anxiety the lead up to it gives me. That even in the moment when I’m completely enjoying myself, thoughts of my molestation will just invade. That some nights what turns me on will instead trigger me and I never know which is which. 

It just feels so unfair, for us both. I want to give him a wife, not a broken woman trying her best and he never EVER complains, he never makes me feel bad for it or guilty but I do anyway because I want him to have the best of me, not this.


Edit: I’d just like to add due to some responses. My husband is not in the wrong here, he’s not a bad guy or unsupportive for having his own needs. He’s been there with me through 7 years of friendship, 4 years of marriage, two children and a whole slew of mental health shit. He has been my biggest supporter. However that doesn’t erase the fact that he has a certain need that I can’t fulfill and am scared I will never be able to fulfill. My fear isn’t that he’s not hearing my side because he absolutely is, but it’s more that when it comes down to basic physical needs we don’t match up and it will create friction in our marriage. Also please don’t try to tell me why I have no sex drive, because I do have the ability to get “in the mood” if you will, just a fear of that due to PTSD. I’ve been to doctors and therapists and I know exactly what’s going on but it’s a matter of not being able to magically fix it."
Publicly funded mental health is terrible.,86,cscy3l,29,"I just need to vent a little here,

I just completed my first round of publicly-funded group therapy, it was so basic I didn't get a thing out of it, it was just a review of everything that wasn't working. The people running the therapy group or so out of date it was laughable. 

My second round starts tomorrow, and I found out after that I have I'm not allowed to take any more for 6 months. I asked if there was anything I could do in between, they said they would give me 6 therapy sessions a year. Six sessions a year.......

For five years I've had family support for my psychology, and I'm only now finding out how bad publicly-funded services are. You just see the jackass politician putting these limitations on, thinking that treating 12 patients at the same time as some kind of cost savings. 

Last night I started yelling for help during a nightmare and it turns out I was actually yelling and it was so loud I actually woke myself up. 

It's funny how some dreams are so easy to interpret."
Anyone else find sex to be dirty/shameful and have no sex drive?,84,ck7ki2,24,"
Anyone else find sex to be dirty/shameful and have no sex drive?

I am in my late 20s and a female virgin. I was sexualized starting as a child. I experienced covert sexual abuse and emotional incest until my early 20’s. I was assaulted at 18 which made me scared to have sex or get a pelvic exam. Instead of having sex like most teenagers, I thought sex was gross and was scared of the pain of sex. While In college, I was very flirty and hypersexual and attempted to have sex many times but was too scared to.

Now I am less scared of sex and have been able to do a pelvic exam as long as I put the device inside. However, I am not dating now and I know I can’t have sex unless I am intimate with someone which is very hard for me to do due to my disorganized attachment style. Also, when I would kiss guys in college and do other stuff (not sex), I often felt shameful and dirty after. I think it’s because I was sexually abused growing up and also was taught by my parents that sex/sexuality was wrong and slutty. I also think vaginas are gross and don’t like the way mine looks and worry about being judged. Also, once I recently came to the realization my dad covertly sexually abused, I now have no sex drive. I used to be attracted to aggressive and abusive sex/sexuality where men did not take no for an answer. Through therapy, I realized I was traumatically bonded and once’s I processed my trauma history and see where this attraction was coming from, I am no longer drawn to that type of sexuality. Now I have no sex drive at all and cannot let myself orgasm or see myself do anything sexual. I am concerned! 


 I will be doing MDMA assisted therapy soon and I really hope that helps.

When it happened to me he said the injuries were from consensual bdsm and the cops were his friends and believed him. The doctor was mandated reporter, but still the cops asked me if I liked it rough, if I orgasmed, they asked if I said no and in response to “It was hard to talk he was choking me” they said “well he must not have heard you.” It was so terrifying what happened. For the first time I experienced real death anxiety because I thought I was going to suffocate to death. There was tearing from anal rape, which is what the doctor reported.

The Most Terrifying but Useful Advice Someone Told Me,85,aelmwi,25,"Quick background; I have a history of sexual, emotional, and psychological abuse from several previous partners. Any number of simple reminders of the past, particularly memory-linked smells, send me into an unstoppable dead-on-the-floor panic attack.

I talked a while ago with someone I trusted about my problems, who had suffered and recently went into remission of warzone ptsd, and the advice he game me seemed really brash at first.

""Find your nuke, the one end-of-the-world option you never want to use, even if it will work.

Put your nuke in your back pocket, and *refuse* to be afraid.""

(For context, the nuke is a metaphorical solution. Please don't carry around weapons)

I, having nothing left, tried it. My nuke was being able to post a detailed list of who my abusers were and what they did to me to a public forum, and know that the publication of that information would either put them in jail, or ostrizise them from the (queer) community.

And knowing I had that list, ready to send at any day I choose to do so, I tried to stop being afraid. Just refuse to be afraid of my past, of my triggers, of my abusers, of my reactions.

It is not easy. At all. It makes so sense. I had anxiety for weeks because I didn't feel ''prepared''. And then, the fear went away. I had a solution to my abusers. Not a good one, but a guaranteed one. And that meant I was *always* prepared, even if it didn't feel like it.

The triggers still happen, the panic attacks still come. But now I don't worry about when its going to happen next. I don't feel awful after it happens, I get up, get some chocolate milk, and move on with my life.

Life is still work. But I finally feel like I'm not waiting for the next terrible thing to happen to me. I don't know how weird this is, but I post it hoping that I can help someone else."

As I sat and discussed it, it became less distant and more real. I knew I pushed it away to avoid all that comes from resurfacing. The anger, shock, sadness, shame, more anger.

I’m tired of these resurfacing, the nightmares, the panic attacks, the anxiety, the flashbacks. I just want to move on. Move away from it. 
Even though I know pushing it back into my mind and ignoring it isn’t recommended, but most times it’s easier than therapy. 
Anyone have any advice, comforting words, or just common experiences? I need to hear outside experiences, please. "
"A quote from ""The PTSD Workbook""",83,9gyp1n,17,"Prior to the occurrence of traumatic events, there are generally certain basic assumptions that guide your life. You probably believe that the world is kind, that there is meaning to your life, and that things make sense. You believe that you are good and worthy of having good things happen to you. Then trauma strikes. It seems as though you are no longer in control of what has happened around you. You're vulnerable and your world is no longer safe and secure. Furthermore, you can't make sense of what is left over. The meaning of life that you recognized just a short time before is gone. Now life is no longer fair and just.

I think I don't believe I was raped because I was drunk and it felt good when it was happening. I'm more comfortable with saying that I was blacked out drunk and he took advantage of me. 

If I don't think it was rape then why the diagnosis?  Why am I suicidal? Why have I been having nightmares for 3 years straight? Why can't I sleep? Why can't I get over it?

PTSD lessened by COVID social distancing?,88,g6w8d1,14,"I tend to have major panic attacks in large groups, on public transport, in enclosed rooms, etc - and since social distancing has come into place I’ve noticed I’m having about 1 panic attack a week rather than 2-3 a day - has anyone else found this?
I feel really guilty that such a horrific occurrence for the world is affecting me ‘positively’, but I can’t ignore that this is the best I’ve felt in YEARS.
I’m also worried about this, since I’m terrified that I’ll get used to not having near constant anxiety then when all of this ends my panic will come back 10X worse... 
Is anyone else feeling this too?"
Does anyone else feel like their ptsd gets worse after being sick at home for a couple days?,84,dvb8vn,17,I’ve been sick/ stuck at home for the past couple days and had a lot of time to just sit with my thoughts.

"Anyone else ever slip back into blocking/repressing the trauma, or at least the emotions of it?",84,d6hsi6,21,"I told my therapist I’m emotionally constipated 😂

All jokes aside, this sucks. I’m blocked again. It’s stuffed again. I don’t know why, I don’t want it to be, but it is. I hate how heavy this feeling is, like I’m walking around in chains. I’m depressed when I’m blocking. I don’t want to be blocking.

What are some reasons we re-block/repress, and any advice as to how I can feel and release some of these deeper emotions again? I felt so free when I could be sad and could cry and grieve the trauma. Now I just feel depressed and resentful and can’t feel anything else. 

Please help me unblock."
I'm never going to get better am i?,82,cv8ffr,38,"i have been reading up on trauma bonds from several sources. i always knew that trauma rewires the brain, but i never knew the physiology behind it. 

from source https://postmalesyndrome.com/trauma-bonding/ ""trauma wounds don't heal with time, because trauma had no sense of time"" and it says something along the lines of trauma is stored in the memory with no time stamp which is why we lose our sense of time with the trauma. it goes on to talk about how it affects the body's fight or flight sense by suspending us in what's called the freeze stage, we are unable to get past that to process and review the trauma for the sake of learning from the experience.

and we will always feel the danger whether or not it's there, we will always seek out the source so we can move on to the end stage and work past it.

in freaked out because i check off everything in this list:

*The following are some signs of trauma bonding, which I’ve adapted from Carnes:*

*When you continue to be fixated on people who hurt you and who are no longer in your life.
When you crave contact with someone who has hurt you and who you know will cause you more pain.*

*When you continue to revolve around people who you know are taking advantage of you or exploiting you.*

*When you are committed to remaining loyal to someone who has betrayed you, even though their actions indicate few signs of change.*

*When you are desperate to be understood, validated, or needed by those who have indicated they do not care about you.*

*When you go to great lengths to continue to help, caretake, or consider people who have been destructive to you.*

my abuser died and I still suffer (I want my hobby back...),84,l1fimt,26,"This is my first post and I hope it's ok and the right reddit. I'm very sorry if not.

My father abused me for years. I don't want to say how exactly... but one of the worst things he did to me is forbidding me to draw, something that always gave me joy. He always took my money I made with art, yelled he will kill me for it, say it's a waste of time and even get physical. He said the sound of my pen touching my tablet is annoying and when I moved to different rooms it was wrong too.

He died last year. On my birthday. (It's fitting for him, really.)

I was sad, I was off work a long time. But things are normal again. As normal as they can be, at least.

Just that I feel no joy for art still... I hate everything I draw. No matter how much I practice and change, how much I study art I like. I usually can't even say why I don't like it, I just do. People give me critique and advice and it still does nothing or makes it even worse. I feel like my brain is damaged too, it hurts my head, I don't understand the simplest concepts for art and it's so exhausting. Frustrating too.
I wish I could create. I dreamed of art being a side career a few years ago. 

I don't know what to do. I feel no joy for anything I do. I miss it! I want to be happy and create again...

I'm looking into therapy but I'm scared, my last therapist told me just to take pills and swallow what he and overs do to me. She never listened to my relationship with art and only made it worse I think.

I don't know if this is the right place but I'm desperate... he's gone and I feel like I suffer even more than before."
Anyone else feel like they cant have normal friendships?,84,jk39di,14,"I don’t want to go into great detail and possibly trigger someone else but because of my past I feel like I cant just be friends with someone. I seemingly flirt with anyone and everyone without meaning to and accidentally lead people on when Im genuinely not even interested. Up until recently I thought it was weird that all of past friendships would end when they’d try to date me or sleep with me, especially because I thought I was vocal on not being interested. I didn’t realize that Im actually the issue until I met someone new. He’s seemingly a good friend, he doesnt flirt or hit on me, and even when I make dirty jokes he moves right past them. I don’t know whats wrong with me but Im so curious on him sexually while also being so confused on why I cant simply let things be. I haven’t talked to him about my realization but in the past my therapist has outright told me I have a sex addiction so Im not sure if its just that or if Im so used to people only being around or interested in me for sex that it’s what I fall back on. I wasn’t sure if anyone else here had similar issues forming normal relationships with people?"

Muscle spasms from PTSD?,81,fyaoyd,45,"Hi, everyone. I’m new to this subreddit, but I wanted to pop by and ask if anyone has experienced this.

Usually I just shake my head really fast, but it’s involuntary and I can’t tell when it’s coming really.

Anyone tired of constantly second guessing whether your feelings towards others/situations are intuitive or a traumatic response?,81,djeqwz,12,"Anyone tired of constantly second guessing whether your feelings towards others/situations are intuitive or a traumatic response?

It feels like I am gaslighting and second guessing myself frequently trying to figure out if I should trust my feelings and thoughts. I am frequently wondering if I should trust my feeling of feeling this person is unsafe due to intuition or is it my trauma/disorganized attachment talking.
I started seeing a new therapist and when I first met her, I was like I trust her and think it’s a good fit. But the next time I saw her, I started protecting myself and closed up and felt hesitant to trust her. I told her it felt like she didn’t trust me and she hinted towards questioning whether my interpretations are accurate of her feelings. She said she wondered if I was projecting my feelings towards her at me but she also told me to trust my feelings and listen to my body. I told her I agreed. The issue is, do I trust my feelings of a person not being safe when I feel that way about most people? 

Ahh, this is tough.
I’ve been gaslit by whole life by narcs so I want to make sure i don’t gaslight myself. I want to trust my feelings and intuition.. but I also know my interpretations are not always accurate because I may see things a certain way due to  PTSD triggers. Often I’ll check the facts but I am very intuitive and the facts don’t always have the full answers.

Ahh, it’s exhausting. Anyone relate? How do you cope?"
"mis/overuse of ""trauma"" in regular convo",85,d9sngr,22,"What are other people's thoughts on folks using ""trauma"" to refer to their bad hair day, or any emotional pain, or an unpleasant experience? Same for ""trigger"" meaning literally any negative stimulus.

I think it's coming from a broader ignorance in our culture of what trauma and PTSD are. Some awareness has seeped into mainstream understanding, but just enough to be annoying. Frankly, it's invalidating and pretty insulting to equate a trauma experience with a bad day, and I would love to address this in my own sphere of people.

I've been seeing this a lot in conversations with friends, and also in the social internet. I do take their pain seriously, and calling them out usually doesn't feel appropriate when they're, like, crying about said pain. Does anyone have good tactics for kindly engaging friends/loved ones on this?"
fuck this disorder.,87,d7ayh5,7,"i spent this evening at a party, and i was feeling really nervous about it because i typically do much better socially in a small group or 1 on 1. surprisingly though it started off well? had good banter with friends and was feeling really confident.

then in conversation someone mentioned birthdays, which is one of my triggers, and immediately i felt the confidence drain from me. i excused myself and ran to the bathroom, locked the door and had a panic attack on the floor. after i was done crying/hyperventilating/throwing up i just kinda lay there on the floor spiralling... eventually i got up because someone knocked on the door.

i went back out to the party. my circle of friends asked if something happened (a lot of time had passed, and my eyes were puffy and i smelt of vomit), i don't remember what i said bc i was massively dissociating but it made everything really awkward because i was making people worry. i felt bad so i just went home, lay down again and cried/cut myself along to music.

im okay now i guess but im just so frustrated. im so angry at this fucking disorder. i can't enjoy myself anymore. i can't feel at ease anymore. i can't feel connected to anyone anymore. alienation and emptiness is all there is for me."

Do you ever feel like your mind doesn't WANT you to be happy?,85,bshmqk,20,"I don't have much to complain about.

Yet it seems like my mind latches onto something to keep me in a state of hyper vigilance. I'm seeing a therapist right now who asked me, ""What does your body benefit from holding in all this anxiety?"" 

Last night, our oscillating fan sounded like an airplane and I freaked out, imagining bombings happening in the city. I just feel scared to be on my own and terrified of abandonment for who I am.

I finally feel safe to share my story,83,lyjlep,12,"Warning: Some miscarriage stuff is graphic so please don't read if it is fresh with you.

This is somewhat long, so if no one reads it that's fine. I just want to say that I have reached a point in my life where PTSD no longer owns my life anymore. I think part of my PTSD wasn't just the actual incidents, but how people around me handled it. I couldn't discuss bits and pieces for a long time, and now I can. 

Step back a few years ago. It seems like yesterday, my timeline is blurry because unbeknownst to me, I smudged everything together. If you lose track of events because you're in a fog you'll understand the constant messing up dates and years. I used to ride motorcycles. A man made an illegal left turn into my bike. I broke 7 bones, including my pelvis (which will matter later). The first hospital not on my insurance but the closest was going to do surgery on my shattered left arm and pelvis as it was an open book fracture. When I was transferred to my HMO hospital they decided I didn't need it. As a result my left arm fused together incorrectly and I lost partial feeling in it. I was depressed in a wheelchair. They gave me two PT sessions. One was just sitting up in bed, one was transferring from my bed to the wheelchair. After that my insurance provider decided I was good. I had to figure out how to do everything else on my own. I was dating someone during this accident. During my depression I latched on to him. I was forming a horrible codependent relationship and didn't realize it. Because I couldn't have sex at first I told him we could open the relationship up. I would have done anything to keep him in it. My self esteem was blown. He started seeing someone else. Our rules were he had to use protection and remain emotionally monogamous with me. He agreed. 

Every week I couldn't work my boss would call me up and ask me if I was available to walk. They weren't wheelchair accessible. At this point I wasn't even wiping my own feces. Thank god for my sister. She lived in the apartment with me. She had never seen me naked and now she would have to wipe my butt. It was degrading. I couldn't work, but my boss's urgency that I come back to work made me worried she was going to fire me. I was determined to get an early release. I called an Uber. I waited 10 minutes for the Uber driver to come just to have her tell me she that my collapsible wheelchair didn't fit in her car. Next Uber driver with the same model car fit my wheelchair in without trouble. Again, feeling like I was a worthless burden on society. I went to the hospital to get my doctor to let me work early. He refused initially as it was clear I couldn't walk well if at any. In the following month I eventually managed to get a note sooner once I was able to walk in tiny bits with my cane. I was in bed for so long that I ran out of breath easily, and the pain walking was like a knife in my pelvis. But, I needed to pay rent so I went back to work. 

A few months out, my pelvis was still fractured, but healing, I stupidly started having sex again. I felt like I was losing him to the other woman. I hadn't got my period and my boyfriend suggested I couldn't get pregnant. He didn't want to use protection. Keep in mind we both were graduate students in biology-related fields but also we were both idiots. I have never had unprotected sex thus never having a serious pregnancy scare. I guess my mind set was I wanted to keep him and I could support a baby as I made decent money. Tbh I was so depressed I had no idea what I was doing.  He said he didn't want children unless it was with the right person. I didn't even love him. I don't know why I thought this was a good idea. Of course, as one might have guessed, I got pregnant almost right away. I bled heavily after testing positive. The initial doctor told me I miscarried but to come back in a few days to make sure my HCG levels went down. I went through that emotion. I was crying, and my boyfriend at the time was out in another country. I chose not to tell him until he came back because I stupidly didn't want to ruin his trip. I had to cry in silence. I went back to get my HCG tested and it doubled in two days. I was still pregnant. As it turns out, I had a condition with subchoronic bleeding. Having a still fractured pelvis and being pregnant led to a high risk pregnancy. I had to see a perinatologist. I couldn't have sex until the bleeding stops which was very seldom. Boyfriend had sex more and more at other woman's house. It did slow down when I hit my second trimester and that was the best I got. 

Cue back to boyfriend. I told him about the pregnancy and he wanted to know if I was getting an abortion. Children weren't in his future. Instead of asking me how I was etc, he kept talking about how stupid it was of him to have unprotected sex. He didn't care about the baby. I instantly fell in love with this baby. He grew, was healthy, and the NIPT test and 4D ultrasound showed him to be in good shape. Right after my 2nd trimester I felt pain in my vagina. I went to get tested but they didn't call me with any results so I assumed I was good. Later on I would find my white blood count was out of spec high, and no one contacted me. The doctor who was supposed to read that test and notify me stopped contact and put me in touch with his partner after what happened next. One morning I woke up and my water broke. I just knew what it was. I panicked and went to the ER. The baby was fine but the amniotic fluid was gone. They told me I had an infection that caused the sac to pop. I had to abort the baby or it could be deadly. I couldn't do it. I read about some mothers successfully delivering with low amniotic fluids and I was determined to keep him. My baby was the only thing keeping me going. 

I stayed in bed drinking lots of fluids and on antibiotics. I was still with my boyfriend but he was more often at the other woman's house at this point. He assured me she meant nothing more than sex to him. One night I was laying in bed and I just felt something shift. I could feel pressure on my vaginal canal. I actually didn't have contractions which would be ignored by the doctor and almost lead to a deadly outcome. I called my boyfriend to take me to the hospital. My sister does not have her driver's license because she's almost blind. He said he was getting high with said woman and asked if I could take an Uber. I was bleeding heavily at this time. I insisted and he finally came over. He brought me to the hospital. I wasn't far along enough for them to bring me to L&D. I had to at least be 22 weeks, so they made me push him out in the ER. He came out sleeping of course. I took pictures with my phone because he was perfect. I'm still working up to looking at these pictures, I put them on my google drive so I wouldn't see them. I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to see him, and my boyfriend said those kind of things grossed him out. The nurse took my son and put him in a hazardous waste bag. That was the last time I ever saw him. Unfortunately, the placenta retained in my uterus. 

They did an emergency D&C to get the placenta out while I was under. During that time I bled out because I did not contract. They had to do two blood transfusions to keep me alive. The doctor would later tell me that I should have came in sooner to do the D&C (abortion) and this wouldn't have happened. He said he was close to performing a hysterectomy. I have no children, nor had no children other than the son I had just lost. That would have been devastating. While I was recovering in the hospital bed, boyfriend came and visited me. He said he was sorry to see me suffering too much and decided the relationship was much more intense than he wanted. He didn't want children, and when I got pregnant that ruined the great relationship we used to have. 

I was desperate. I asked him what I could do to make him stay. He said he wanted to try swinging with people. He had already contacted a couple and they wanted to meet the following week. I wasn't supposed to have sex until after my doctor approved. I wanted so badly to keep my boyfriend that I did it. The 2nd day upon returning to work, my co-workers knowing what happened, greeted me by asking me what I would get for my baby shower since her friend is having one. I just broke down crying right there at work. Milk was coming in my breasts and they hurt. I remember my co-worker telling me not to cry because I could have another one. The other co-worker who was a mom said 'at least you didn't have to give birth to a full sized baby. Mine was painful.'

So what happened. I went a couple weeks like this and started drinking heavily, using pot. One day I woke up on a weekday when I should have been working and I just couldn't do it. I couldn't move out of bed. I called in sick that day. The next day and the next was the same. I called in sick over and over again. I couldn't get out of bed other than to get something to drink. A close friend of mine in the same state but another city contacted me. Thank god for her. She truly has saved me. She urged me to come stay with her. I stayed with her because I didn't see my life improving. She did meditations with me, and did some therapeutic  work that she was taught. We really spoke a lot about what I wanted to do. We did a proper ceremony for my son so I could get closure. I've been wanting to move out of CA, out of my crappy toxic job, and the boyfriend was a narcissist. I made a plan to pack up everything I could, my sister who lived with me would get the apartment (she could afford it by herself), and I would pursue a new life because I just wasn't happy anymore. 

The problem was I hadn't dealt with a lot of the trauma of what happened. I went to stay at my parents in the middle of the country while I looked for jobs in my dream state. The first of what would be many panic attacks would occur. Triggers of baby commercials coming on, and remembering everything everybody did to me to make things worse. I refused to sleep because I felt like if I went to sleep I would die. My body would constantly feel like it was going to die and give up on me. I contemplated every second all the things that could kill me at any second. Driving became a nightmare. I had cut off contact with boyfriend, but the woman he was sleeping with and wouldn't ever date, he started to date. This psycho started contacting me with no provocation asking me if I was still around. It started off with did I call her. I had her number from before I left the state because she wanted to hang out with me as we were ""sharing"" my boyfriend. The whole thing was weird but I went with it. She starting sending me fake call logs saying I called her and to contact her. When I didn't respond she became more aggressive. She told me I had tried to trap boyfriend with a baby, and he wouldn't have been with me otherwise. I blocked her but I'm pretty sure she used phishing numbers as I received random text messages pertaining to stuff she would say. Of course this triggered me every single time. (I've changed numbers since). After the last bad trigger, I started seeking therapy 3x a week. 

At first I didn't notice a change. One by one I was able to talk and peel apart more about what happened that last year. There were things about my accident I ignored because I was focused on my pregnancy. I never mourned the loss of a lot of things. I never got angry with how my boyfriend treated me. I let my self-esteem plummet. For months I couldn't drive without having to pull over the side of the road. One day I went 30 minutes without panicking while I drove. I actually relaxed and listened to the music without feeling my body go numb. That's easy for most people, but for people with flight or fright responses it can be scary. After so much intensive therapy I that was the first thing I noticed as an improvement. 

I met my future husband while staying with my parents. It took me awhile to find a job again out of state. Fast forward, I'm married to someone who loves me and treats me well. I have my dream job with colleagues that treat me human. I still get panic attacks, and I'm still in therapy. But this is one of the first times I can tell my full story without crying. I'm not 100% completely healed but I'm getting there.  I feel like I was fortunate enough to have things turned around in a matter of a few years. I know some are still struggling on here, but I hope that everyone finds a point in which they realize that something as small as a car drive for a few minutes is improvement."
Why I love King Of The Hill.,82,lhwfq9,14,"I'm a big King of The Hill fan. But, recently, while rewatching it, I've realized that it's a huge comfort beneath the comedy of a propane salesman and his life. King of The Hill has given me a lot of insight, especially when my PTSD gets bad.

I rewatched the episode with the Vietnam veterans and the WWII vets and for some reason, when they corner Cotton, what he says hits different... Hank is disappointed that he didn't get Cotton away from the band of angry, triggered Vietnam vets and Cotton tells him: ""You can do everything right and still lose. It's not your fault. You did your best.""

The whole episode is pretty good but that last line always makes me feel better. I tried my best, and what happened happened. It's not my fault. It never was."
Sometimes my rage scares me,81,j9rvpv,11,"Pardon my melodrama, but sometimes my rage frightens me 

I'm always angry. Under the surface. That's not to say I can't laugh, or smile, or have a great time. It doesn't mean I don't love, or get sad, or scared, or whatever... but I'm always angry, somewhere, deep down. Sometimes it feels like I'm a pinprick away from self-destructing. I've been in the middle of laughter, only for a door to slam or a loud noise to go off behind me, and I snap my head back and cast my eyes at whoever did it with hatred. Pure. It only lasts a second, but it's there. 

I had a boyfriend a few months back who flew into tantrums whenever we argued. He paced, and screamed, and threw his hands around. This scared me; not because I thought he could hurt me - because I thought I'd hurt him. Every part of me sees any kind of hostility as life-threatening. Everything in me tells me to react. The moment someone raises their voice at me, or gestures in a way I perceive as threatening, I want to hurt them. I want to get them before they can get me. And it frightens me because it feels like the ***right*** thing to do. My brain tells me to grab a chair, a rock, a dumbbell, a knife, whatever is handy, and to go at them until they're no longer a threat. If someone walks too close to me on a dark road, I put my keys between my fingers. I think to go for the eyes. The throat. My instinct isn't just to put up a fight, but to come out alive, whatever the cost.

I'm honestly scared one day, in the midst of fight or flight, I'm going to lose myself to it. I'm scared someone will put their hand on me and I won't be able to restrain myself. And what's even worse, I'm scared it might actually feel good... or at least a relief, to let that out.

Again, sorry for the theatrics. I just needed to express this. It's not exactly something I freely admit often."

they’re afraid he would violate the order to try to kill me, if i ruined his life like that. everyone who knows him is saying it - that he has an illegal firearm, he is violent. he is unstable. if i ruined his life with a sexual assault charge, he would break the order to destroy my life.

A tale of 2 people,86,dxmsvg,34,"I am a 20 year veteran police officer, and I am suffering horribly with PTSD. I am writing this from my hospital bed in a mental health facility in Saskatchewan, Canada. 
Why am I in a mental health facility? Because I tried to hang myself to finally be rid of all the pain and suffering. 

For many years in my role as a police officer I have taken countless numbers of troubled people to this very same facility with never a thought that one day I myself would be in there. Yet here I am. 

I could go on for many many more lines about all the horrible suffering I have endured, but I want to make this short. I feel like my entire being has been ripped into a  million little pieces, and a large team of mental health professionals, my family and myself have tried to put all the pieces back together again, but the pieces will never fit the way they are supposed to. I will never be put back together the way I was before. 

For many many years I helped everyone I could, and now I need help. It is the hardest thing in the world to have helped others for so long, and to now feel helpless.

My story is a tale of two people. The person I was, and the person I have become.

As I said, my story is long, but I will stick with this for today."
Any other Child Sexual Abuse survivors feel guilt and shame for when being sensual and sexual?,85,di1bvg,23,"
Any other Child Sexual Abuse survivors feel guilt and shame for when being sensual and sexual?

I (28/F) can express sexuality similar to Marilyn Monroe where she acts sexy and childlike at the same time. I think it is because I was abused as a child just like her where my child part of me is dissociated. Or I wonder if it’s mainly because of my ENFP/bubbly/flirty personality. For example, I’ve noticed when I really appreciate what someone says or am enjoying good food, without realizing it, I’ll make passionate and sensual body movements and sex noises while saying mmhm and mmm. I have begun to notice I’ll sometimes adjust my energy/flirting with a man in a way that appeals to him as a way of people pleasing in order to get what I want, feel safe, or to survive from their anger. I learned as a young girl how to change myself to appeal to my abusers in order to survive and get what I want. I still have a core belief inside that the only way a man is going to care about me or being nice is he finds me attractive or if I flatter him by flirting.

Now that I’m an adult, I still have this issue of “flirting on accident” when I’m with men. And then I close off and hide my personality because I get scared they might start liking me and that I’ll get abused. I feel shame like it was my fault I attracted men’s sexual attention. I have been sexualized my whole life and so then when I behave in a sexual way, I think it’s my fault for attracting sexual harassment.

Anyone else relate?"
Repressed memories coming back and I dont know what's real or fake. I'm tired of my broken ass brain,85,bb6zos,10,"I was diagnosed with PTSD in 2014 after leaving an abusive relationship but to be honest I've had so much traumatic shit happen to me in my life I couldn't tell you the real culprit of my trauma. I was sexually abused by 2 of my cousins over the years, grew up watching my parents do drugs, beat the shit out of each other and beat me, was abused in a group home, abused by a doctor, found kiddy porn on my ex fiance's computer, watched my ex kill live animals to fuck with me, lost a baby... etc my life feels like a fucking horror movie looking back.. and now I'm having even more repressed memories or what I'm assuming is repressed memories resurface and I'm not even sure if they're real.. I just dont feel like so much different terrible events could happen to one person..  I feel insane. I know I have a lot of my life blocked out, childhood and parts of my life as an adult as well...and a lot of it I still remember that j wish I didn't. My PTSD symptoms died down a lot over the last couple years but my depression is resurfacing with a vengeance, I'm off my medication and dont have a therapist so now my PTSD symptoms are reviving. I haven't talked to literally anyone about it and have no way to see a professional anytime soon so its freaking me out. I refuse to bring these things up to friends and family because it's just too heavy and every time I do I break down and it's not pretty. I just dont want my mental health to ruin my life again. I've been trying not to think about it too hard but I can only ignore it for so long. I'm starting to have night terrors again and I'm becoming reclusive again. Certain things are bringing me intense anxiety all over again that I've gotten past before. 
I was at my girlfriend's house and she was doing dishes... and just the act of her doing dishes triggered me and that hasn't  happened in years. I had to go to the bathroom and calm down. I didn't have the heart to tell her anything. I didn't want her to feel like she did something wrong because she didn't and she doesnt know it's a trigger or even why. She doesnt know a lot of details. I dont even want to talk to her about all this stuff because her mental health is extremely vulnerable at the moment and I dont want to burden her with all this. But she really is my only form of support at the moment. I guess that's why I'm posting here. Maybe some random person will care enough to read this and give me some solid wise words. Maybe I just need to vent. I dont know what is even inspiring me to post this. But here it is and thanks for reading my long ass rant."
Being triggered by the media/opinions around this Kavanaugh appointment,83,9j8dqn,50,"Is anyone else who has PTSD as a result of sexual assault extremely triggered/anxious/angry about the media blitz around these Kavanaugh allegations? I think what is really upsetting me is the number of people who haven’t experienced it questioning the accusers, and essentially speaking on something they have zero experience or knowledge of. I’m not talking about political lines, or what specifically happened with Kavanaugh, but more so the discourse about accusations coming out this late and the whole “she’s lying, why now?”. 

For me, it’s really triggering. I didn’t speak about my sexual abuse for years, and self harmed as an outlet. When I finally did confide in an ex boyfriend, he confronted my abuser (my relative and his friend at the time) who then denied and continued to deny anything. That denial has revictimized me again and every time I hear people questioning these accusers for not speaking their truth sooner, I am enraged. 

Is anyone else experiencing this? It just makes me so angry that people try to comment on things they can’t possibly understand. "
"Does anyone else get the ""rollercoaster feeling"" in your stomach when someone gets to close to you?",86,9bw9t4,12,"Ever since being sexually assaulted I hate being touched or having strangers in my space. I noticed this morning while waiting in line at the grocery store a man behind me got in my personal space and I immediately got that feeling you get in your stomach when you're on a rollercoaster. It was intense enough to make me nauseous, and my anxiety spiked enough I had to leave the line and go to another one to get away from this guy.
There wasn't anything particularly menecing about him, he was  just a regular looking guy who didn't remind me of anyone responsible for my assault or PTSD, at worst he was just slightly annoying with his clear disrespect for personal space. "

ptsd from sexual traumas rules my life (TW),80,kmkynz,28,"hey all. this is my first time posting in here. with this, i'm attempting to see if anyone else can relate to what i have gone through and continue to experience.

to sum it up, i've been raped twice. the first incident was while i was in college, 2016. the last incident was from a romantic partner (whom i no longer have contact with), and it happened in 2018. i know it was a long time ago, but holy moly. i'm still so damaged...

PTSD has taken over me: i don't sleep well. i'm insecure beyond belief in my current romantic relationship. i'm insecure when it comes to friendships, or anything for that matter. i have nightmares. i have to remind myself that i'm safe. i can't be in dimly lit rooms, specifically with a TV on. i can't do certain sexual things because it induces intense flashbacks. speaking of flashbacks, i have them. all. the. time. it's like my mind is constantly hitting ""replay"" on these incidents. these are just some of the things i experience while living with these traumas.

is there anyone at all out there who has been through sexual assaults/etc and lives with similar symptoms? i just don't want to feel so alone anymore..."

"My Grandpa's story, Why I dislike July 4th",81,hlab2j,15,"My grandpa died from agent orange poisoning later in his life. Before that in VietnAm he was forced to take pills that stopped your bowel movements, urination, and appetite to not leave trails behind for the vietkong to track them. He said he didnt eat food for 2 months and swears he doesnt know how that can work. Anyway, He was a Lieutenant. He lost his left ear (therefore def in that ear) and he let me touch the prosthetic ear when i was little. I didnt understand. After he passed I found the letters he sent to my grandma. He LOVED her. And he was the nicest man.

One July 4th, my family had a barbaque. I think i was 8. When the fireworks went off, i looked at my grandfather. He was frozen staring at the ground. Then suddenly he got up, stood straight with arms at his side and BELLOWED...... *take cover!* and he moved through everyone and into the house. My mom told me later when I was older, that she found him fetal position, quietly crying. My mom asked him if he was ok. He looked staright in her eyes, tears in his, and said ""Jacqueline.....they're in the trees (the Vietcong) honey please hide"". He reached for her. And she did took his handcx . She hid closet with him and gave him earplugs. She said that she told him they can stay together until morning. She locked the door and told no one to come in. He was 60 at the time. He was active during his 30s. My mom said every firework that night, my gpa screamed a little but he forced himself to cover his mouth when doing so. And my mom said alll she could think to say was ""tomorrow the sun will come. And everything will be ok."" She said he was in and out of being ""back there"" and ""back here"". She staid until the sun shown through the window. From there on my gpa wore earplugs when he was alone. 

I know today is a special day for our country. But it is a personal hell for some veterens. Also for those with mental illness. My biggest suprise was how amazing of a man he was, even from what he went through. He came back with some demons. 

Imo? Signing up for war is a ticket to mental illness, lost limbs, and terror. Your brave to choose yes. But naive to not say no. Im not gonna sit here praising veterens without mentioning that they have fought for you, for the country. And they come back. Feeling like being in twighlight zone. Everything looks the same. But does not feel the same. the fact that people act like nothing happened because they are to uncomfortble to touch a subject they cant handle with them is neglect. Loved ones might feel like they are still there, so they treat them like they're here.  This is not helpful. You dont have to talk about it. Just sit, and stare at something pretty."
Who else has noticed more creeps/predators preying on your vulnerabilities due to trauma,84,hgu3m2,19,"

Who else has noticed more creeps/predators preying on your vulnerabilities due to trauma?

Before I processed my trauma and realized I had PTSD, I would always put on a fake face and be really confident, positive and social around others in college (I was in my higher self a lot). I remember feeling like a lot of men respected me and it scared away many creeps and predators looking for an easier target. I mean yes, I still experienced creepiness but I also felt many were scared away because I was popular.


But after college, then i started facing the reality of my trauma and now 8 years later, I am allowing myself to ""go crazy."" Like I am not being fake with anyone. I allow myself to feel my different emotions in public, like being sad or angry at work. I've told people I have PTSD. I avoid people, eye contact, self isolating, 
am not as confident and secure. One thing I have especially been noticing is I have been being creeped on more and I think it is because these predators can sense my vulnerabilities now more. They choose me because I am an easy target where they can get away with abusing me because no one will believe me since they think I am crazy.

I was harassed at a support group several months ago and I can't stop thinking about what happened. I was stuck in a room with men  who sexualized me by getting boners, stared, leered at my legs and butt, then one stared at my legs, ran out of the room then creepily waiting for me while I was alone to walk me to my car and ask where I lived. At parties, men would touch my body at parties because they couldn't ""help it."" The last two times I was in the ER, the health care providers unnecessarily flicked my breasts while they put a strap on my arms for an EKG. The doctor sexually looked my body and legs. A male nurse leered at my body as I walked to and from the bathroom. While I was in school internships, I was sexually harassed by two leaders. One stalked me, leered at me, controlled me, intimidated me, wouldn't take no for an answer, and was angry whenever I spoke to men. The other one followed me around, became aroused around me, and told me I remind him of his wife and if he had another son, he would have him marry me. This creepiness from men has been happening all my life starting with my dad and I am tired of it. I don't even do my hair anymore, lost weight, wear baggy clothes and avoid men so I can avoid potential sexualization and creeps.

 I spend most of my days dissociating and replaying traumatic memories. It has taken over my life.  I feel so stuck and I am struggling to get out. I also think because I am so stuck in my trauma, my vibration is low and my victim mentality is attracting these predators.

Who else relates and has noticed more creeps have been coming out due to your vulnerabilities related to trauma?"
"jealousy triggers - relating to ""normal"" people",82,h7hb61,29,"Hi all,

i often get triggered by the ignorance and nature of ""normal people"" who havent suffered trauma / addictions.  How people can be quite dismissive of peoples struggles ( at a 1-2-1 level and against society) and how issues that i would feel fortunate to have as problems are protrayed dramatically (while i quietly dont share my struggle - given the shame).

My specific example is yesterday where someone was showing off how impressive he is and how much he is achieved without regard for the priviledge and support he has had.  

Anyway, its a bit of a ramble, not sure if i made my point but thought i would see if others can relate.

thanks and stay well"

Why Nobody Talks About Dissociation,83,e8sfnk,15,"Dissociation is not just a survival mechanism.  It is a powerful way that people can control others, especially children.  If someone tells your conscious mind to do something, you have a choice.  You might say yes or you might say no.  But if someone traumatizes you enough to dissociate you and they tell you to do something, you don’t have much of a choice.  You now have an unconscious inner part who is programmed to do what they want.  And until you discover it, they can get you to do it anytime by activating that part.  People are purposefully using this concept in abusive families, cults, organizations and even governments.  And they certainly don’t want you to know about it.  So dissociative amnesia will be continually discredited, not because it’s fake, but because it is being used for horrible reasons.  People will lose power if it is known by the mainstream population.  Before you write this off as extreme, think about it.  Why are you writing if off?

I finally found some relief...,83,di8ali,38,"I’ve tried Celexa, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft with no luck due to how hard I was hit by the side effects.

Your trauma is valid,81,cu850e,18,"We need to hear this and not just once. So often we hear the opposite and frequently it’s us invalidating our own trauma by comparing it with others.

I believe validating trauma says that compassion and understanding is also a valid response to that person. That it is worthy of treatment and a journey towards healing however that may look. 

I hope this reaches one person that has been questioning the validity of their trauma:
Your trauma is valid and don’t let anyone tell you any different!"
"Last night, my wife was triggered badly and had an angry outburst in public. I refused to get in the car until she agreed to not yell at me or be physically aggressive. Today, I was hoping she’d be apologetic, but she blames me for exposing her to the trigger.",81,bymlfb,90,"Driving by a certain hotel chain is a trigger for my wife. Late last night, we were driving home and I stopped for an emergency pee, not realizing the Denny’s she directed me to was located right next to one of those hotels. I parked, ran in to pee, and came out to her in the drivers seat even though she’d been drinking and I was the DD. She screamed at me to “get in the fucking car” and said “fuck you” over and over. I told her I needed to drive or I’m not leaving. She got physically aggressive and knocked my phone out of my hands. I stayed calm, took the keys, and went into the Denny’s to stay safe by being in public. She followed me in and she continued to rage and started to pick up the table I was at but then stopped herself and stormed out. She was angry because she wanted to leave and I wouldn’t give her the keys. I insisted on her agreeing to not yell at me or be physically aggressive before I would drive us home. Finally she agreed and we went home without further incident. 

I was hoping she would be apologetic today, but she’s angry and doesn’t want to talk. This morning, she was shocked that I have complaints from last night. I’m guessing she’s angry because I prevented her from leaving the triggering place by refusing to ride with her if she were driving. She agreed to talk to me later tonight. 

Being cursed at like that is very painful to me and physical intimidation is totally unacceptable no matter what the circumstances. She has told me in the past not to try to shield her from her triggers, but it’s really hard because my choices (for example what tv show I pick) will impact whether she’s triggered. Any mention of sexual assault, for example any #metoo references, are triggering. I’ve essentially given up all media at this point unless I’m alone and it’s in my headphones. We just moved so we don’t have therapists set up yet; I realize this is a next step. She won’t discuss her trauma in therapy, but she does go to a therapist regularly at my insistence. I am not supposed to acknowledge her ptsd unless totally necessary. Most of the time it isn’t an issue. I think the stress of moving is bringing out her symptoms more. 

What do you guys think about all this? What should I do? I want her to know I am a safe person who loves her, but I also know my zero-tolerance for physical aggression is necessary to stay safe. How do I maintain boundaries while still being there for her when she is melting down and needs me? Do you suggest any books or resources that could guide me?"

"How do you deal with ""gross"" triggers that must be accomplished? Such as showers, brushing teeth, etc?",83,bpdisg,31,"[Possible TW, but I'll try my best to keep it PG]

From ages 2-5, I was subjected to very harsh physical, emotional, and sexual abuse. This abuse especially occurred in areas around showers, dealt with objects being put in my mouth that made me feel sick, and other very sickening ways to treat a child.

Most of the abuse was repressed until recently when my brain decided it was time for it ALL to come out into the open. I've started having more flashbacks and worsening avoidance symptoms, and other not-very-nice PTSD symptoms.

But one area I have tremendous difficulty with is taking care of myself. I like feeling clean. All the abuse left me feeling dirty and used. In the past, I'd take showers daily. But now, it's lucky if I can take a shower once a week. When I do try to shower, I'll have these flashbacks and intrusive thoughts and overwhelming feelings of unsafety to the extent of overwhelming self-harm urges.

Brushing my teeth has similar results, but I can kind of dissociate (zone out and think of thoughts to distract myself) until the deed is done. It's still difficult and overwhelming (I'll have to take a 15min break afterwards just to calm down), but I can still manage to brush my teeth once a day.

I was wondering if anyone could relate? Or offer advice? Meds don't work for me and I've temporarily given up on therapy (13 therapists and 9 hospital stays in 8 years but nothing seems to help). I don't like feeling this way. Honestly I really would like to shower, but I'm so overwhelmingly afraid of my brain having a bad reaction that I'm afraid to go do so. 

Thanks for reading/responding."
"Wife is dissociated from reality, has been for 6 months",82,apuunn,19,"My wife has PTSD. She was diagnosed \~8 years ago, went through CBT,  seemed to 'recover', but we appear to be dealing with a relapse now. I believe it's been happening since September 2018.

&#x200B;

She spends every moment of the day she can on the internet talking with a new group of friends she found on Twitter (none of whom know her in real life). She's built up this persona of herself that is effectively what she would be like if she were healthy, and interacts with people through this persona. She is so removed from reality that she's just completely unaware of her own emotions, body sensations, or literally anything going on around her.

&#x200B;

I have no idea how to help her. She sees a therapist, but I have no idea if she's told him she's having a relapse (this is a new therapist, she's only been seeing him for about 8 months). She won't make an appointment with her doctor for some anti-anxiety medication, the mere mention of it sends her into a panic attack that lasts hours. She doesn't leave the house unless she 100% cannot avoid it. Groceries are the exact same groceries every few days, she only buys enough to last for 2-3 days, and gets the exact same things. Self-care is going down the drain, her sleep is disturbed, and she can't even verbalize what is going on around her or inside her at any given moment. I have compassion for her wanting to escape feeling bad all the time, but by doing this she's making it worse because she's never coming down from panic attacks, she's just dissociated constantly.

I don't even know where to start. I'm the only one that works, we have a child, and I'm going through my own trauma therapy right now, and it's all I can do to hold life together as is. Help?"
"12 years after my trauma, my sister made me realize why my PTSD is to blame for more than I realize",86,9q7qe6,16,"TW: gun violence, death

My sister and I were having a conversation yesterday about how I feel a crippling shame because I cannot work. I've had probably 15 different jobs over the past 10 years with several months off in between. Full time jobs were always very short lived and my mental wellbeing would suffer to the point that it wasn't safe for me to stay. I've had better luck with part time jobs, but I always reach a point where I need to quit so I can focus more on myself. 

I honestly thought that was all it was; I simply was unable to improve myself while having a job. I also was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder a few years ago, and I've read that it's also common for people with BPD to struggle with maintaining a job. My sister told me that she had a different interpretation of this cycle. She believes it's not so much about me not being able to work because i need ""me time"", and instead is me needing to be in a safe space because of my PTSD. 

My most life altering trauma happened while I was at work. I was 16 when I got my first job at a small, family owned convenience store across the street from the local police station in a safe, wealthy town. Only a few months passed before there was a shooting in the store, during my shift. I became a witness to a murder/suicide. I returned to work only 2 days after the incident and continued to work there off and on for 6 years. 

I'm not sure why it had never crossed my mind, but something in my head clicked when my sister said ""Your first job was in a very safe place, until it became a very not safe place. You feel safe at home now, and that's the only place you have where you get that sense of security, so it seems logical that it's not so much the work that you can't handle, as it is spending too much time away from your safe space.""

Y'all, I bawled my eyes out. She's absolutely right. I need to have a lot of time at home every week in order to stay stable, and it's not just work that ruins that, it's also time spent with friends and family, or running errands, or going to appointments. Any time that I have to leave my home, I feel intense dread and anxiety about it. It's been 12 years, and I somehow never made the connection until yesterday. 

I'm hoping that being aware of this issue will help me to overcome it eventually, but I know it will take some time just to come to terms with it. Until then, all I can do is hope that I am able to stop being so hard on myself about what I can no longer do, and try to remember all the things I can do again. 


TLDR; witnessed a shooting at work, which has made me unable to work or do much of anything outside of my house because of a need to feel safe. "
"Are you afraid to ""feel too much,"" even positive emotions?",82,960uv4,28,"Do you sometimes feel as if you feel too much, and so you pre-emptively shut down emotions, even positive ones? I can't remember if I was this way before my trauma, but I frequently am afraid of feeling too much. Does anyone else experience this?"
Benefits of Living Through PTSD,82,8i9ahy,29,"Most of this community is about connecting with people who are going though similar struggles, which is amazingly helpful in coping and feeling less alone. However, I’m trying to find that silver lining. Outside of the pain and struggles, have you found any benefits to living with PTSD? I’ll start:

1) I’m extremely and abnormally patient. Because the fears I experience are so intense when triggered, it is hard to set me off otherwise. It is hard to get me mad, to intimidate me or to throw me off course (excluding my triggers of course).

2) I’ve become more daring since PTSD in certain aspects of life, for example my career. I have perspective that other people don’t have, so I don’t view public speaking or meeting a VP as the “scariest thing ever.” I can also numb myself out to experiences which would feel frightening - I don’t get visibly nervous, stammer, etc.

3) I’ve become more artistic since PTSD. This is good and bad... I was a STEM major before and probably would have had a challenging and high paid career by now, had my life taken a different course. However, post PTSD, I found myself extremely connected with the arts. I have intense emotional reactions to aesthetic experiences, and I think that’s largely responsible for the fact that I now work in a creative industry. I experience aesthetics in a unique way that I’m not sure resonates with the typical non-affected individual.

4) I’ve had non-traditional relationships, which has given me a unique perspective on life. Because I haven’t been able to commit long term (fears I’m working on in therapy), I’ve never been tied down to a relationship or a single person. I’ve also been more open-minded approaching relationships, which has brought me close to interesting people that I may have never known otherwise.

5) I was a very conventional, by-the-books person before. With PTSD, it’s impossible to be. My open-mindedness in life has led me to develop friendships and embrace opportunities that I might not have in my prior state of mind.

6) I have a lot of empathy and compassion. I see everyone as another version of myself. I am aware of the unknown struggles that could be going on under the surface, and I never presume to know anyone fully right away.

7) If an experience feels safe and non-triggering, I can be incredibly focused and obsessive about it. It is easy for me to focus on one goal and shut everything else out. I can gear my obsession towards positive things, like healthy habits and working out, for example, that leads me to succeed at those endeavors.

Does anyone else have benefits they can think of? I like to believe that good can come from even the worst of circumstances. "
Does anyone else freeze and say everything's fine right up until the point of a total meltdown?,80,89zfwh,12,"I noticed when trying to explain how I work to my relatively new boyfriend that I basically get very stiff, dissociate and if someone asks I say ""I'm fine.""

During the beginning of the BLM protests this year my mom put the fear of god in me over a misunderstanding and i cant get over it,81,it0h22,26,"When the protests began, my brother (17) didnt fully understand because he doesnt watch the news often. He read something about police allegedly burning something and blaming it on the protestors. Him, knowing i kept up more with the news, asked me about it. I said that thats whats allegedly happening. I didnt agree or disagree with it. My family is very conservative so i have to be very careful about what i say so i dont get in trouble.

2 days later, a protest began in our city. Since me and mu family live near government buildings in our city, our mom decided to take us all out to stay with our aunt until the protests stopped. 

While we were at the table discussing it, my brother said ""Opppy said cops were burning stuff down and blaming it on protestors!"" 

My mom went off. She called every family member, even the family members that were cops, and told them what ""I said."" I got messages saying i was an idiot and a dumbass. She then proceeded to scream at me for 2 hours about how ""i will not be spouting such rhetoric in this house!"" And how my ""way of thinking"" is going to get my family murdered. I do support the BLM movement but she doesnt know that. I of course start bawling. I felt so awful and horrible. I kept sobbing and pleading with her that that wasnt what i said. This was all in the car. My cat was upset because she was in her carrier, my dog was confused and scared, and i ended up peeing myself from the panic. I felt so awful.

She didnt listen to me for 2 hours. When she finally got in the mood to listen she asked my brother what i really said and he repeated what i originally said. I never got an apology. She told my family about the miscommunication but by then it felt too late. 

Now whenever the subject of the protests get brought up i tense and try to get away. I feel like im being a bad supporter by not being open about it but if i be open i dont know what will happen next. 

My friend said that this classifies as traumatic, and im starting to think so too. Thoughts?..."
Today I was the strong one,79,f8f286,5,"I visited my parents yesterday because I missed them and my dad was a little snappy with me. He gets like this sometimes so I'm pretty used to it and I can point out to him to be nicer and he's fine. Well, my dad called me a bit ago to apologize for it yesterday and let me know he's having kind of a hard time. A good friend of his passed away a few weeks ago and it's really getting to him. He's also really upset that my husband and I might be moving further away in the next year, even though all my siblings are within minutes of him and my mom. My dad doesn't really talk about this type of stuff with anyone but me. And today I got to be the strong one, advise him to seek a counselor and just talk to someone, start meditation again, and take a break from smoking weed. 

Just because you and I have PTSD, doesn't mean we're not strong. It means we're continually learning how to be stronger and how to pass our knowledge onto others."
Is bullying a 'valid trauma'?,83,ei6ihp,38,"TW: pretty damn severe bullying, teeny bit of emotional/verbal abuse(?)

Okay, this sounds stupid, but I get super hung up on it. I don't remember most of my life, even recently I have difficulty remembering much. But I do remember some snatches from my childhood. My mum screaming at me a couple of times over stupid things that every child does, or calling me names. Forget that, that's not the point, my main point is bullying.

I got bullied the literal minute I started school, cause I'm autistic and apparently kids can pick up on that easily. Again, don't remember much, but I do remember someone stabbing my foot with a chair leg (probably one of the worst incidents), and in my new school one of the first playtimes we were playing It and I got caught, and tied to the mast of the model boat they had in the playground. For so long I thought it was just a game, but years later I realised that no one else who had gotten caught was tied up there. None of the teachers helped. I just stood there, unable to move any part of my body, for fifteen minutes until another kid from my 'team' untied me. And I let them do it, because I thought it was just a game.

I'm getting anxiety just typing about it. I've been able to remember more and more minor incidents of teasing as time went on, like that time someone asked me a question to make fun of me, and as a result I ended up having to finish eating cereal with an odd number of bits of cereal (not quite sure how that happened).

I'm getting distracted, sorry. My point is, is bullying a valid trauma? It's caused me trust issues and mental problems that I'm pretty sure I'd have less of without the bullying. Is it my fault for letting them do it?"
There’s screaming inside my head,81,ed6xkv,31,"I can’t make it stop. How do I make it stop? I’m crying as i write this and I’ve been ugly crying and fucking wailing on and off today and I want it to stop but I can’t stop the feelings or the internal animalistic anguish and nobody seems to fucking get how bad this is. 

My ex was really sexually abusive. He raped me - kind a lot. He was sure my no’s and my discomfort didn’t mean no, and because I loved him and was attracted to him and never like bit and clawed or tried to run away I just came to believe him that he was right. And he’d dump me and then rope back in then dump then rope me back in on a off x4... and then he finally dumped me for someone else and he treats her with so much respect and I was just a fuck buddy or FWB or poly relationship - the label kept fucking changing. I felt like my souls fractured and there is this creature inside me that is screaming and won’t fucking stop screaming until I start screaming... I can’t make it go away and it hurts so much wtf do I do guys? I don’t want to die and I don’t want to hurt others but holy fuck I want to crawl out of my skin and self destruct. And to he worst pat to is I can’t show anyone what I get like when I get like this because it’s too intense for them and they get scared. Fuckkkkk fuckkk rapists and rapey dudes who think it’s ok to keep pushing for sexual even though the girl is uncomfortable or wants to leave or says she doesn’t want to get involved."
My mother tells me to get over what happened to me(not said in title to avoid triggers),83,ebv7px,31,"I was at a friends house for a sleepover when I was 13.  I don't really remember what happened but I remember that it was late and I was tired.  Eventully my friend told me to lie down.  I thought this was slightly odd but did lie down.  Then he walked over to me and before I knew what was happening, he took off his ants and started rubbing his genitals over me.  My face, my eyes, my hair and other parts of me that I don't want to write about.  My mother told me to get over it and was saying how other people had it much worse.  Eventully I devoloped PTSD.  My mother doesn't believe it and whenever I bring it up she says that people like holocaust survivors had a worse experience than I did.  I'm not saying that I had a worse experience, just that I want her to understand what happened to me and why i'm the way I am now.  I wanted to know if people thought I should stop trying to get through to her and just cut ties with her altogether.

Edit: Thankyou to everyone who replied.  I am still not entirely sure what to think entirely, but your words have reassured me about my course of action.  And yes I have gone through therapy."
Ballistic Missile Threat in Hawaii (possible tw),81,dtgnf4,49,"I was living in Hawaii when we received the alert. I remember it super clearly. 

“Ballistic Missile Threat Inbound To Hawaii. Seek Immediate Shelter. This is not a drill.”

I still feel panic right now re-reading that. The alarm blared loudly from my phone and I looked around at the other few people on the gym with me that Saturday morning. Everyone’s eyes widened while reading the alert. A few people immediately ran to their cars. I went down to the basement of the gym with the employees because I didn’t have anyone I knew closely enough in Hawaii to worry about getting home to. People called their loved ones and cried saying goodbye to them. That whole day was a blur. I remember looking out at the highway and people were doing 100+ mph, people were running red lights. 

I considered trying to kill  myself in that moment because I knew I was far enough away from Honolulu that I would probably not die from initial blast impact and would have to suffer through radiation and a slow death. 

Then about 40 minutes later it was over. It took that long for the mayor to respond and say it was a mistake. People on the mainland barely blinked about it... I remember people being like “duh, why would you believe a tweet that a bomb was coming?” 

It wasn’t a tweet. It was an official alert warning from the government. 

I just don’t get how no one else seemed to be affected by this. Everyone else went along as usual for the rest of the day and the days following. No one I knew seemed to think it was a big deal. My family on the mainland didn’t give it a second thought. 

Am I literally the only person on Oahu who was affected by this? I don’t understand how NO one talks about it and NO one takes it seriously?? 

Was anyone else affected by this? I feel completely alone and stupid."
"How Trauma Shapes my perception of the world (men, children, “what’s normal” etc).",81,d8nf4o,36,"My trauma involves rape, assault, child abuse and domestic abuse as an adult. It feels like everyday on reddit I read about a new pedophile ring exposed, a new public figure abusing kids etc. And then in my own life it feels like every woman I meet has been abused in some way or another (whether as an adult or as a child). 

I know in my logical brain that men are abused as well, that women CAN be abusers (my mom was one), and that not all men are inherently abusive. The following is my thoughts that I’m having a hard time reality checking and they’re really upsetting me: 


I’m beginning to feel more and more that sexually abusing children is “normal” and “happens to everyone” and that maybe all men are inherently/secretly abusive? I fear that secretly all men are attracted to young women/teens/pre teens and that the only thing stopping most men is that they know it’s illegal? In so many cultures around the world, child marriage used to be the norm, and very young women and girls were sought for marriage etc. 

I feel like my worldview is very small because I only have one friend and she was abused as a child too. My worldview is DEFINITELY being influenced by my trauma and I’m looking for places online that I can read about normal and healthy childhoods. Do they exist?? Did anyone really grow up without ANY abuse or unhealthy behaviors? It’s hard for me to believe, I don’t really “buy it”. 

There are so many subreddits for people to talk about their experiences being raised by abusers etc and I really wish I could find a subreddit about normal healthy experiences so I can reassure myself that healthy normal men ACTUALLY exist. I KNOW in my smart brain that not all men are abusive! But my trauma is always whispering “maybe they are abusers” 

Again, I know in my logical brain that non-abusive men exist, and this is my trauma speaking. I would love to hear from men and woman about this, if anyone has had similar experiences as me in how their trauma shapes their perception."
it can be both,81,bkq2uz,12,"I had to deliver a cake to the hospital that i’ve spent almost 2 years at, added up, for psychosis that I developed after a very traumatic childhood. I got to walk out of the doors afterwards. No one stopped me, no armed guards holding me down because I tried to escape during a psychotic fit. I just left. I got in my car. Like normal. I’m mourning the loss of two years, i’m mourning the childhood that was taken from me, and the teenager that I am trying to learn how to be without so much illness. I’m mourning that parts of me that trauma took. But still, no one stopped me when I left. I got in my car. I’m ecstatic about how far i’ve come. I’m devastated at how much I’ve lost. It can be both. the good and the bad coexist and neither makes the other go away. 

for me it really helps to think of the world like this. if you want to or you think it would help you too, how is your life “both” right now?"
I want to thank all of you guys.,83,a8j6it,6,"I can't really think of a proper way to express this so I'll just put it out here: 

The people of this subreddit are, by far, the kindest and most supportive people I've had the pleasure of talking with. I want you all to know that. I've only been here for a few weeks and already I feel ""at home"" here. I've looked through a ton of posts by now and there's always a common theme: everyone wants everyone to get better. We all know how much this affects each of us and despite how different everyone's stories are, there's always another person who has dealt with something similar and they want to help. And whether that's giving advice, support, or just listening, it's always there.

I know that's the whole point of this sub. I'm probably just stating the obvious by now. Probably because there's not much to say. Just ""thank you"". This community has helped me feel normal, and no amount of prescriptions or relaxation has been able to do that for me.

It's 1 am here, so I'll finish this before I start rambling too much. Keep doing what you're doing. Every little bit is worth it."
Just stopped myself from going into a full blown panic attack and he didn’t even notice.,82,96th0v,13,I was sitting at the kitchen table and my husband was standing over me trying to give me a high-five… He thrust his hand out so quickly at me I got triggered and started to tear up and breathe very heavily. Now normally this is when I would either get really angry and defensive or I would break down into hysterics and not be able to control my emotions and not be able to explain what was going on with me and why I got triggered. But I actually stopped it this time from getting worse… I told him that I got triggered and then I just needed him to slowly back away and give me some time to breathe. I’ve been with him for six years and he didn’t even notice... I asked him just now how he felt about me not spiraling into a panic attack and being able to calm myself down this time all he said was “ that was nice.” I needed to share with you guys because I have no one else in this world. For a moment I was really proud of myself.

How possible is it that talking about childhood trauma in therapy reopened the psychological wound?,83,kprbqg,37,"Hi r/ptsd. I have an appointment with my therapist tomorrow and I just want to walk in with some knowledge. Last week, toward the latter half of our session, I opened up about some stuff that had happened as a kid (I'm like 27 now). Ever since then, I've really been struggling. But I don't know if my symptoms are necessarily related to the disclosing of the trauma. I would love to get some opinions/anecdotes from other users if it's possible that talking about a long-buried trauma from childhood can kinda lead to regression or the reverse of progress in healing. Specifically, I've noticed that my depressive and anxious symptoms have worsened. 

**Reasons for thinking that disclosing my trauma led to the worsening of these symptoms**

* I've never opened up about this to someone before. When I first tried to open up about it 2-3 months ago, I couldn't speak properly and my therapist had to help ground me. 
* My therapist had repeatedly said before knowing this latest revelation that my childhood was traumatic and adverse. I still don't know if I believe that because I can't help but feel like maybe I'm exaggerating or being overdramatic. But maybe this latest revelation was the straw that broke the camel's back?
* My appetite/mood/happiness/energy have overall decreased this week. My irritability/fatigue/head-fog have increased this week.

**Reasons against thinking that disclosing my trauma led to the worsening of these symptoms**

* Before this last session, I had been struggling to deal with winter break from school and my therapist noticed that I had a history of struggling with too much free time. Maybe this is just a continuation of that adjustment 
* I'm behind on my school work and that's weighing on me pretty heavily since I feel guilty/ashamed about that. When I've been behind in school, it's caused similar symptoms.
* I also don't want to discount the environment: we're still in a pandemic, my first year of medical school is officially going to be remote which sucks, and the winter sucks. 

Given this list, I'm not sure what to think. Have people before experienced a similar phenomenon? Or am I over-thinking it and it's perhaps just a continuation of previously existing issues? 

Thanks for your help!"
So Beyond Angry Right Now,82,fc334l,11,"TW: Sexual Assault, politics, Kavanaugh. 

So, I just need to vent. I have been off Facebook for years but over the past year have gotten back on Facebook to see what my family is up to. During my time off Facebook I think being on Reddit has made me a bit bolder to speak up and say what's on my mind. 

Anyway, somebody shared an article about Kavanaugh that makes a very large leap to claim that all the accusers are lying. I realize there is very little evidence either way but this article was making very unfounded claims. So I started debating with the article sharer. 

However, someone unrelated who's cover photo was a picture of text that says ""I have PTSD - Pretty Tired of Stupid Democrats"" took it upon themselves to call me a stupid liberal and say I need a normal life and common sense. 

I think that cover photo might be one of the singularly most offensive things I've ever seen. Not to mention, my chance at a normal life was taken from me when I was raped, and have since had to struggle with PTSD. 

I just can't even express the rage it makes me feel right now. I have since removed myself from that conversation so that I can cool down, but how can people be so crass and mean? I guess I know how, people are terrible. But it just kills my already small faith in humanity. 

I guess I just needed to vent. What makes people think it's ok to turn an actual mental illness into a joke to attack people they disagree with?? Has anyone else seen this stupid picture before? Sexual Assault PTSD aside, I used to know a veteran with PTSD who was a Democrat. It's just that cover photo was so brazenly insensitive. 

I guess I just need a place to express my anger that isn't on that post."
Iraq 2003 and Iran 2020,82,elnjq0,22,"The news of the attack this evening is overwhelming me with depression and anxiety. I was in Baghdad back in 03 and i was lucky to get out of the Army with only one tour. Diagnosed with depression a year out and PTSD four years later.

Its been 17 years since we drove from Kuwait to Baghdad, but this attack by Iran has all of my senses heightened. I see the shrinks at VA and its helped me understand what threats are worth being concerned about and which one's arent while being state side. I am so worried that the last 11 weeks of my visits with the VA shrink will have been all for nothing. I am so tired of being so overly aware and cautious of things most people dont give a 2nd thought to. Its no way to live."
I think I’m incapable of trusting other people,77,e3qzef,26,"I’ve been abused in the past by people who were nice to me to manipulate me and it’s still painful and confusing to remember both the happy memories and the abuse that took place.

Reporting him today (tw sexual assault),83,dvyetr,19,"I was sexually assaulted about 2 years ago and I finally told my school counselor. We discussed it and I'm going to report the guy who assaulted me. The protocol now is to go through sunflower house at least in kansas city. I've heard good things about it but I'm really nervous. It's basically a recorded interview. Anyway, I just wanted some support, I'm doing this thing in an hour. It's very good because I'm finally holding him accountable and letting myself heal. For a long time I was just stuck, I couldn't heal, it felt like unfinished business. And guys, as soon as I made the decision to report, I immediately made progress with my healing. That part is good. But with the good theres always bad, how is he going to react. what will he say when they interview him. Will he try to fight back? This is important and I'm doing it. But im nervous. Wanted some support, feedback, kind words. :)

"I woke up from a nightmare screaming ""Please help me""",80,civiw0,15,"TW Violence.
Vent. As the title suggests.

I was asleep on the bed, planning on just taking a simple nap.

When I woke up I was in a dream, but my legs wouldn't move. I was alone in a foreign room, on the ground. I was a kid. Something sinister happened, I don't remember what, but I needed to get out of that room. Immediately.

I couldn't use my legs, so I used my nails on the carpeted floor and I crawled.

I fucking crawled.

When I got to the carpeted living room, there was a red sofa on which my grandmother was sitting on. She was oblivious to my screams for help, as she sat and watched TV. Loved ones came out of the doors leading into the living room and each of them hurt me. Physically. Continuously. I escaped and crawled to the kitchen.

A loved one, a person I trusted dearly in childhood was cutting up lettuce. I raised my arms at her, screaming for help. She turned to me, and stepped on me. As hard as she could, she stomped on me, making me throw up. It hurt. It hurt so much.

The last memories of the dream include me raising my arms at her, still believing she would help me. And screaming.

I was screaming ""Please help me"".

In real life, my boyfriend had approached me, and woke me up. I started, apparently screaming ""Please help me"" in a high pitched voice. He asked if I was okay. I couldn't answer.

I took a shower to wake up, and while I was there, I kept seeing solid hallucinations. The tiles. They were filthy. They continued being filthy no matter how many times I scrubbed them with my feet and poured water over them. I left the shower feeling more awake, but shaken.

Someone, anyone, please talk to me. I think I really need help."
Everyone understands 9/11,79,cf78il,11,"I suppose I am speaking to Americans on this one but every country probably has a major tragedy that most the country witnessed in some way or another. We become hypersensitive around the anniversary. We don’t make jokes about it in mixed company, or any company. There is a respect and reverence. Should someone say they are a survivor of the attacks, our hearts soften for them. Anyone who made fun of a survivor would be labeled anything from asshole to pure evil. 

Why is abuse and rape treated so differently? If everyone has a grasp on what even the slightest PTSD feels and looks like, where is the disconnect? Why is it funny to trigger a Vietnam solider but not a NYC firefighter?"

I almost shit myself in a McDonald’s and threw up as well on my way home. The last time this happened, a man had gotten too close to me and I almost threw up in my car on the way home.

Does anyone else feel this way? Like there is no way this stuff happened and you’re just a crazy person who is making it all up way after the fact?? "
I hate going to therapy,79,a76ve3,21,"But goddamn if it doesn’t help me so so SO much. 

I literally hate going into that office, sitting down, using the tappers, visiting my trauma. I hate shaking after, I hate the nightmares induced. But wow. I am already so much more than who I was when I started 2 months ago. 

Things are just.... healing. I don’t know how to explain it. But I am so SO proud of myself for doing this. I can feel myself loving my spouse more, loving strangers more, loving myself more. 

If you haven’t yet been honest with yourself and admit you have a problem, if you haven’t yet sought out diagnosis, if you haven’t yet started therapy, you should. It’s the hardest and greatest thing you could ever do for yourself and those who love you.

My Job is Saving My Life,79,a3i30i,5,"I'm a dog walker/pet carer.

I woke up this afternoon defeated. I had a pretty severe breakdown last night that kept my up until 2am. I missed a class that only meets 9 times and felt crushed, ashamed, worthless. I'm in danger of missing a deadline I've already gotten an extension on. My apartment is in shambles. I slept on top of orange peels and a stained sheet. I barely woke up in time for my 3:25 shift.

&#x200B;

This job gets me out of the apartment. This job gets me in touch with a wonderful boss who is so considerate and funny. This job gets me in touch with a coworker who calls me to give me tips and talk about her day.

A walk in the woods...... a big achievement for me and had to share. :),80,elhfks,7,"In 2019, around October, I began to shut down and isolate... It got worse as the anniversaries of both my parents were soon approaching(I held them both while they died) then I was minding my own business watching a movie when the movie took a turn for the worse and there was a horrible rape scene in it, and I related to it a little too much, after the movie I couldn't get the scenes out of my damn head.. took forever for me to get over it sometimes..... So I fell even more into the trenches of hell. 

Anyways, I'm happy today, and just wanted to share that I took my first walk in the woods by myself since last year. It was a  glorious day (I live in Texas, so it what nice and cool outside).

They're all scared, they're all alone, they're all distrustful, they're all sad, and they're all so bitter. 22 years old and my road is so full of potholes.

I'm empty, but I'm full of fear. I'm alone, but my demons live with me. I'm at peace with my surroundings, but there's a war in my mind. I scream into the void, but it screams right back. I'm broken, but I try to fix others. I'm something and I'm nothing. I'm full of contradictions, yet I'm very consistent.

There's a part of a song that really resonates with me: ""I'm scared to get close, but I hate being alone. I long for the feeling to not feel at all. The higher I get, the lower I sink. I can't drown my demons, they know how to swim"". But not feeling at all brings its own pain. But it's true. No matter how hard I try, my demons always float back to the surface. The happier I am, the harder it all comes crashing down around me.

I break so easily. I'm quick to anger. I'm quick to sorrow. I'm quick to fear. I'm quick to self doubt and self loathing. Forgive me for my rant, for my nonsensical ravings. I'm just so tired."
Last week I found out my rapist is dead.,80,d6oyvy,17,"He died of an overdose a month ago. I predicted this would happen. My therapist said it wouldn’t do much for my healing or emotions, but she was wrong. Since finding out, my PTSD has dramatically decreased in intensity. It feel like the weight of his literal bodied was lifted from my shoulders. I feel safe again. This is the best feeling."
"Today, I 'graduated' from cognitive processing therapy",82,cz9mnh,7,"Hey everyone,

Long story short-- traumatic event happened 9 years ago (series of events). After surviving it, I was treated for 8 years on sertraline for ""OCD and excessive worry"" (confirmed by two therapists in the past 8 years), but it was only this summer that, after a massive trigger, I sought a therapist, who ended up treating it as PTSD. Then, this summer, we worked on it via cognitive processing therapy.

It wasn't easy, and it wasn't always pleasant, but I feel better, and I am processing/thinking about the experience better.

&#x200B;

Thank you to my therapist! I want to just post this as a post of encouragement for all of you on this sub.. I still have some stuff to work out, but I am finally at peace with certain aspects of the trauma, and its effects are much milder.

Keep at it!"
how do I keep myself from yelling at mormons on the street,79,chvhn3,33,"a lot of my childhood trauma stems from being raised in a heavily mormon household. I had to watch my mother be subject to a lot of abuse at the hands of my dad, and she reached out for help several times from church leaders and family and was repeatedly told to Try And Make It Work, that divorce wasn't an option and her family wouldn't get into heaven if she split from him. 
at the same time I was being sexually abused by my father and when having church interviews about chastity I was further taken advantage of.
in sunday school/young women's lessons it was instilled in me that being lgbtq+ was wrong and sinful and I should push that shit down
even after leaving the church, my mums family still remains very active and regularly tries to talk my mum into coming back, and tried to make her choose between her girlfriend and her family 

this is really the tip of the iceberg, but among the general knowledge that Mormonism is entirely based on the bullshit of a scam artist and rapist, I harbour a lot of animosity towards the whole faith.

the other day I almost got stopped on the street by a pair of mormon missionaries but immediately snapped ""do one you jammy cunts"" and quickly got the hell out of there. I know that wasn't the smartest thing I've ever done, I was in public, children could have heard me, and they could have easily called the police. and they're probably just brainwashed kids like I was. But it was my gut reaction, I was so angry and I still am - the second I see their shitting badges it's like a switch goes off in my brain.

any tips for how to manage this? I'm really working on anger stuff within myself in therapy but I wasnt expecting this to be a trigger, and it's so inherently public by nature??? I dont want to be that asshole in the street and I know it's likely they truly believe they're in the right and are doing gods work or whatever but. I dont know."
How do you get people to believe PTSD is real?,77,bh1qbw,32,"I have a 10-year-old with PTSD because she was attacked by a fellow student.  I constantly get comments questioning whether her (rather severe) mental problems are due to the attack, and not do to other possible trauma.  I talk about her elevated heart rate, about her flashbacks, about her night terrors, about her sweat, and it doesn't seem to register.  They can't understand how she can still be suffering from an attack that occurred over a year ago by a 9 year-old.  I try to talk about ""being stuck"" and how she thinks about him every day, multiple times a day.  Nada.  
So then I talk about how in movies you can see Vietnam vets have flashbacks 20 years later to see how trauma can persist for a long time.  For younger people, they don't get the references.

I'm very frustrated by this.  So what is your go-to method for getting them to understand without punching them in the face and screaming ""PTSD is a real thing!""?"
You ever bottomed so hard that...,83,9pubav,16,"you sat in your car after work and just cried there while things that were said to you echo in your head? And no matter what you did you freaking couldn't calm down or bring yourself out of it? 

That was me yesterday morning. i felt it coming too.I felt the emotions suddenly drop into a void and everything started swirling. the next thing i knew was i was rushing home and didn't even make it out of my car before i freaking broke into a million pieces and watched as freaking memories decided to run rampant. 

it kind of came out of no where with seemingly no trigger. i don't even know what the heck happen but it happened. i haven't fully recovered from it yet. i'm still... reeling in a way. I'm currently tucked away in a little corner at work waiting to go home again so i can hide in my room. "
the feeling of guilt when you're okay,79,hrz9ex,5,"i commented somewhere about this, but decided to make a post to see if more ppl relate.
my trauma had a huge impact on me and my life, in obviously a very negative way, i shift from writing a suicide note, being triggered easily, crying, being angry bc my assaulter is praised and loved to being actually okay, not triggered when see reminders, not feeling sadness or anger when i remember my assaulter, and then i feel guilty, like do i have this illness or not?
do people relate? i mean I've been pretty distracted these days, but i dont get easily triggered although i'm sure that will change in a few days/weeks
anyone's mood shift like this suddenly? do u still feel valid?"
CPTSD vs PTSD (venting),79,hjc4an,39,"I just recently started seeing a new therapist, and after talking about my childhood trauma in addition to my more recent trauma, she said that we should look at CPTSD rather than just PTSD.

I don’t know what it is, but CPTSD seems so uncomfortable to me. I did some reading on it, and watched a few videos to help me understand it more, and I definitely think it fits, but I just get so emotional thinking about being diagnosed.

It has been 2 years since my PTSD diagnosis and, at the time, I felt relieved because it made me feel like I wasn’t crazy. That other people feel like this, too.

I don’t know why it is so hard for me to be comfortable with CPTSD rather than PTSD. I think it has to do with acknowledging how traumatic my childhood really was, but I’m not sure."
i just found out after almost exactly two years that i may be able to press charges (tw: r*pe),78,hj6o95,10,"i was raped when i was 17 and reported it to the police two weeks after it happened. when i was telling the officer what happened, she kept telling me that i wasn’t making sense and things weren’t adding up, even though i clearly explained what had happened to me, every last detail. when i left, the officer told me that someone would contact me to let me know what’s going on with the case. i reported it in early july, left for college mid august, never heard a thing. i dropped out of college after a few months because of unrelated health issues and came back home to live with my parents. it’s been two whole years and my dad didn’t tell me until tonight that the police had been trying to contact me but couldn’t for some reason, he told me that a friend of his who’s a cop called him to let him know that even though he couldn’t tell him everything, there was an investigation and i could potentially press charges. i asked him why he didn’t tell me earlier, he said that when it had happened i told him i “just wanted to forget”. i went two years thinking that they thought i was crazy or lying or something and just didn’t look into it but now i can potentially press charges? i’m feeling so many emotions about this and i don’t know what to do next. i want to press charges, but i’m scared that he will be found not guilty and the whole process will leave me even more traumatized than before. any advice is welcome."
Karma is bullshit,79,fqr9wz,27,"Dont know how to flair but TW!!

Rape, Physical Abuse, Extreme violence



Karma

Not the real one from the Hindu faith

The popular western conception

The just world fallacy

You get what you deserve.

Bad people get what they deserve

What goes around comes around

You know what that implies?

Anything bad that happens to you, you somehow deserve.
Please think about your friends with mental health issues.

Your family and friends that have suffered in life
Is that karma?

Did they get what they deserved?

It hurts me every time someone says that.

I know others have had it worse. I don't want to be the trauma gold medalist.

But I have suffered a lot in this world.

If your beliefs of ""karma"" are real, that means I'm terrible. That means I've committed so much evil. 

When my dad died at 6 was that my fault?

When my mother's husband tried to rape me at 13 was that my fault?

Was it my fault when he tried the second time 6 months later?

When he held me and my family at gunpoint at 14 was that my fault?

When I was 16 and he cut open my uncle's face and tried to break in with a crowbar,then I almost killed him defending my mom, was that my fault?

When I would beg and plead with my mother to leave was it my fault when her stare would go cold she'd call me crazy and ""dramatic"" I'd go to my room and cry quietly, was that my fault?

When she left 3 years into my engineering, I was hungry and broke, I dropped out.
Was that my fault too? 

When you insist on karma. You also insist on me deserving everything that's happened. 

As an adult I made a lot of mistakes. I know what was my fault.

My childhood was not my fault."
I had a victory with my PTSD.,76,emob23,9,"The biggest thing I've been struggling with recently is seeing the evidence of my progress.  Yes, its been 2 years of general progress, but I'm still struggling with relationships and trust.  About the only thing I thought I had figured out is that a combination of meds, exercise, and routine help me get a super healthy and regular 7-8 hours of sleep a night.  

I certainly didn't want it to, but I had a stressful situation forced on me, and I think there were 4 clear areas where things went way better than I expected them to, and I think that those things are clear evidence of both progress and good things.  I'm doing some self-care by telling people about my successes because I spent so long being forced to be private about my good things.  

**To start**: I got stuck in an elevator, by myself.  I had the emergency phone, so I was able to call and get people dispatched to help me, but otherwise for about an hour I had nothing to do but just be stuck.  From that point on, I think I had 4 clear victories over the things I could control that I don't know I'd have had before I stared my recovery.  This is something I can look to as progress, and I had to tell someone.  

**Victory 1**: I did not lose my shit when the elevator stopped and none of the buttons worked.  I've been working on mindfullness by doing yoga (it also makes me tired before bed).  I was able to sit down on the floor and just breathe.  My mind was able to draw a clear line from ""there is literally nothing you can do to fix this"" to ""the best thing you can do is remain calm"".  I couldn't do that for years because of how my abuser would intentionally escalate stress to keep me off-balance.  

**Victory 2**: The situation was resolved as quickly as possible by getting a repair guy on the site and resetting the elevator. In interacting with the emergency line operator and repair guy, I was able to stay calm and communicate, which allowed them to respond quicker/more effectively.  

**Victory 3**: When I got out, I was able to realize that I needed to go lose my shit for a while.  It was 1PM at work, so doing it there would be awkward.  Instead of trying to justify taking care of myself to people like my abuser used to make me, I just sent an email that said ""was stuck in elevator.  Going home.  Will finish day later"".  I went home, exhausted myself to burn off the adrenaline, took an hour nap, and then finished my day (easy to work remote).  I responded to a stress, got myself to a safe place, and then was able to do healthy things to get back to ok.  

**Victory 4**: Both my union and management's response was simply ""hey, do you need anything?.""  The next day I was able to say to both ""the time I got to cool down was what I needed, I don't need anything else"".   Being able to put it down and not carry it with me for weeks afterwards has been a victory.  

I still have more work to do, but I think I can approach it with more confidence.  Thanks for letting me share my victories with you."
Unwanted Vaginal Sensations (TW sexual abuse),76,cmhxmr,41,"Does anyone here whose PTSD stems in part from sexual abuse have unwanted genital arousal issues? I have experienced chronic sexual trauma and have had these symptoms for a long time—sensations of [pressure, pain, irritation, clitoral tingling, throbbing, vaginal congestion, vaginal contractions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_genital_arousal_disorder). It’s extremely unpleasant, and every once in awhile gets unbearable, especially when I am trying to sleep. I just squirm. I’m wondering if there is anyone out there who can relate and what you did for relief."
Do you ever feel like you’re an extra in everyone’s else’s life movies?,78,bsaw8o,12," 
Like as soon as the director yells cut, you stop existing to the people around you. They go home to their families and friends, and you end up being and feeling so alone. There’s other movies still playing around you, the director hasn’t yelled cut, but you’re not an extra in their movie, just the runner who gets everything for everyone.
Then when you get home, to the place you should find the most comfort, is where you feel more alone then ever.  I’ve spent the better part of 25 years feeling this way. I won’t allow myself to feel connected because, when the director yells cut, I’m no longer a part of the movie. 
All these years I thought I was protecting myself from hurt by not allowing myself to land a major roll, but each night  I’m reminded that I’m not even listed in the credits.  Keeping people at a distance to protect yourself, never truly letting any vulnerabilities show. Showing the world this face of strength, when inside I feel empty and forgotten. I once was one of the lead rolls in a pretty amazing movie, one that ended in tragedy. The 25 years since then, have been feeling cast aside by many and only thought of because every once in a while I try again to be a lead roll, or a rerun of a past episode is talked, only to find out you’re still just the lowly extra or gopher.  Sure I’ve probably past up on rolls, let them slip away, but mostly I feel like the extra in a movie that is easily cut from the final film. I’m not trying to make people feel guilty, most all of this is my own doing, by not allowing myself to try harder for the lead, for fear that I will be rejected, or if I land the roll, replaced because I wasn’t the right fit.  Everyone shoot for the moon, find your lead and hold on tight! Don’t let fear of loss, failure or hurt stop you from it."
I am of value.,81,ahpl1o,11,"My value is not something I have to earn.

The answer to ever question here is therapy,77,adrwby,55,"Not pointing out anyone is particular. I was diagnosed with ptsd 3 years ago and the answer to ever question on this sub is : therapy. 

I have X symptom, what do i do? You keep going to therapy. 

How do I make it easier on my partner? Go to therapy. 

My partner has ptsd, what can I do to make it better? Tell them to go to therapy. Then go to therapy yourself. 

I have several conditions but ptsd is unique. There's no youtube channel you can watch or book you can read. You have to go to therapy. You have too. 

If you don't go to therapy, GO TO THERAPY. if you don't have insurance, GET INSURANCE. I moved to a different state to get insurance for therapy. Getting insurance and going to therapy is literally the most important thing. 

You have to go to therapy. You have too. You have to go every week. Maybe twice a week. You will go for years. You have to go to therapy. Go to therapy. "
People shaming you for not being where “you should be” at your age,81,aczzqq,14,"People Shaming you for not being where “you should be” at your age

Ughhhhh, someone recently shamed me telling me, as a 27 year old I should be having fun and dating instead of still grieving over my abuse from childhood.

Yes, I am 27 and single. But I’ve also accomplished getting my masters degree recently and am in process of moving out and getting a new job. I did date in college but was attracting and attracted to toxic dynamics due to my childhood trauma/abuse patterns. So ever since I was 22, I decided to work on myself in therapy before seriously dating again. I do plan to start dating again, maybe in summer. Also, I recently (1.5 years ago) came to the realization of all my childhood abuse as well as abuse when my dad sexualized me while In college.. so of course I am grieving and working through my issues.. because that abuse still affects me today.

Ughhh, yes I want to be in a relationship and engaged like some of my peers. But that has not been my path so far, I have to work on myself. And I should not feel ashamed for where I am because I am so much better than how I used to be thanks to therapy and healing. 

Ugh, it makes me so mad when people shame others for not being where they should be at their age. There is usually a reason why people may be “behind” according to society’s standards and judging is not ok! 

Anyone else experienced this?"
PTSD makes me feel bad for my partner...,77,lxr1ds,8,"Last night I had a trigger after watching something and it messed me up more than I thought it would. Normally, I have a decent grip on my moments but later it came back to bite me.

My partner, bless his heart, did everything he could as I had a panic attack, cried, and dissociated and I felt so bad. I hate making him worry, but I am glad he supports me.

But with my episode I just felt guilty and anxious. I felt so broken. I hate my parents for being horrible and breaking me this way. 

Yes, I know that I need to mother myself and treat myself with care in these moments. It just sucks. 

I just wish I could be normal.

Suffering from PTSD after a huge explosion,77,jn7yel,25,"Several month ago my city was traumatized due to a huge explosion. It was about a tenth of the intensity of the Hiroshima nuclear bomb but far bigger than any blast from a conventional weapon. It was the largest non-nuclear blasts in history and I experienced it.
Ever since the moment of the explosion I have had trouble sleeping, cannot tolerate loud noises whatsoever. Last night there was thunderstorm that woke me up thinking it happened again, I lived it all over again and stayed wide awake counting the seconds between each thunderstom and preparing myslef for the next one.
I was anxious and everytime I think about the explosion I have trouble breathing!

"I mourn the loss of my mum and my sister often. They're not dead, I never had real ones, only had abusers. Yet I'm pained by their pain, and plagued by the feeling that they may have been less abusive if xyz didn't happen.",76,i6afvt,9,
Anyone else having nocturnal panic attacks?,74,g5wlvl,39,"Hi I’m a 22F diagnosed with PTSD along with panic disorder, depression, anxiety, and recently insomnia. I have nocturnal panic attacks which cause me to jolt awake in the night gasping for breath and having extreme panic. I’ve always had sleeping problems caused by night terrors and sleep paralysis, but these I’ve only been having the past year. At night I stay up until 3 in the morning, trying to build up the courage to sleep. I can’t deal with the sheer terror I feel when this happens. My doctor tried prescribing me trazodone, but the sedate feeling only made the panic worse.

The panic while sleeping is most likely cause by my sister being murdered in her bed while sleeping, and I’ve been working on exercises with my therapist. Anyone else experience this and find something that helps? TIA"
It’s too difficult,74,fmqv3i,22,"I am finding life too difficult. I wish anyone understood how many hours every day I lose to flashbacks and suicidal thoughts. I really am running out of energy.

Oral Health,79,e9hhq7,18,"Does anyone else have a hard time keeping up with their oral health?

Sometimes I think my therapist failed psych: Trigger Warning of some kinds of traumas listed in footnote,75,dkc7jt,77,"SOmetimes she says things that just seem so naive, like she doesn't seem to understand PTSD symptoms or Dissociation and think I can just push thorough them\* and it seems like she hears the words but doesn't understand that the traumas have all built up and... I don't know. I hit a shut down after decades of cumulative trauma  


I'm in real need of some sort of empathetic contact and I don't know how to get it. She thinks I can push through it and I've always been super extra tough before I don't understand why I can't now.  


I try to do many things including reading about it and she just says things that are so off the cuff insensitive and I think it's because she doesn't know what I mean. I also took Psych in college and am interested in what my experiences might mean- badly worded, but- For example I was reading about how PTSD is more of a mind injury than a mental illness but it does have some physical structural changes for example there is a reduction in the amygdala and hippocampus structures in the brain and I told he I'd learned that and she says ""well maybe we can focus on making your amygdala bigger!"" Like maybe she doesn't know what those words mean? It seems like a really flippant and insensitive and unhelpful response. These are starting to build up and I don't feel supported but I don't have anyone else to turn to and don't want to start over.  


I can't handle this anymore I wish I would die in my sleep

  


  
\* (I've had to push through massive traumas my whole life- things like severe injuries that caused permanent chronic pain and facial disfiguration and having to call the cops to break into my fiance's home to check for his dead body and I was right he had died, and some more common ones like assault causing GBH, robbery and domestic violence, cops never doing anything about the assaults so I never feel safe, abusive origin family  and more)"
Putting others first (Emotional/Abusive PTSD),75,ckfiy6,9,"(I'm going to put a trigger warning here just in case.)


I will not go into detail, as it's not the main focus, but I was physically and emotionally abused by my father.  During that time, I had to learn that I could never make him mad and so I grew up either trying to avoid him or doing what made him happy. I couldn't be emotional either, especially when he was being abusive, because that would make him feel bad and would make the situation worse. I didn't really feel like I could be myself till he was kicked out of the house for a violent episode. 

I have a problem with wanting to please everyone and being ""The best friend"" and ""chameleon"". That I try really hard have people to like me and get upset when I'm rejected, mainly due to how I feel like I'm not good enough and I need to be punished or else I get paranoid. Sometimes because I choose try and gain the respect of people who don't care because it's convenient or they make me feel good about myself. I didn't realize this until I started to go to therapy months ago and let go of some toxic people because I soon got to the point where my inability to make them happy lead me into days long suicidal depression. 

My life has slowly getting better as I've move on from the stress of pleasing people. I no longer have weekly panic attacks due to drama or guilt because ""I'm being a terrible friend for crying in front of everyone and that makes them uncomfortable"". I still get them with my dad. For the most part, I don't think of him often, and what I do I try to recognize it, and then let it go.

 I think my silver lining is that, after realizing that I still have things to do on this Earth, I'm going back to college to get my Masters along with eating an exercising properly. I'm happy to report that I just got accepted into University and I've lost 72 pounds since October.

I was hoping to get some perspective as to how it build up your self-esteem after abuse. Also, I would like to not be so much of a people pleaser, as I don't want to feel obligated to put others before myself because of my insecurities. So advice on that would be helpful.

Edit: Wow, my first Silver! Thank you Kind Stranger! I just wanted to let you know, especially if you have PTSD, that you are not broken or unloved. You are not defined by the truama. You are strong and loved by your friends and family. 

I wish you the best of luck with your health."
I don't think I'll ever escape the war in iraq,79,cgai13,41,"Background before I get into it.... June 6, 2011 we were in Iraq when we got his by an IRAM (improvised rocket assisted mortar) attack, where they shot water heaters at us filled with 200lb of HME (homemade explosives). I went to the VA for help after a suicide attempt in February 2019. I checked myself into the loony bin about 18 hours after the suicide attempt and started (also finished) treatment.

It's been several months since and I started having bad dreams the last 2 weeks or so. I just woke up, not sure if it was a noise, the cat doing something, a dream, idk... I thought I was back in Iraq with a friend of mine who was in the shower when we got attacked and ended up decapitated. He died running naked to the bunker and ended up the result of a direct hit on the bunker. Was found with his head detached laying a few feet from his body still blinking and looking around with an extreme look of fear on his face.

In this dream, we started getting attacked and I told him to run for the bunker, then I ran the other way for a further bunker and I got knocked over and knocked out from percussion by the blast of when he got hit. That's when I woke up and I propped up out of bed, ran into the wall, stumbled and ran into the closet full bore and went face first into the wall in there. I fell over again and when I got back up I started coming to and noticed I was covered in blood, all over me, the clothes in the closet and all over the carpet."
How will I ever feel safe? Catcalling/harassment on the city streets for girls?,76,c9iby6,42,"I walk outside my house to the corner store. It's the morning. On my way back, a druggie said HEY BEAUTIFUL and eating me alive with his eyes. I didnt even acknowledge his presence. He stopped, and yelled back at me, you cant even say hi you white bitch. 

I'm walking to the subway and a group of younger city kids pass me, they start saying stuff to me and when they pass me, I still hear them. I say ""stfu"" as I pass them, fed up with the fucking day. They stop and threaten to fight me. 

I'm walking to get my dinner and on my way home a homeless man is screaming MISS MISS following me, I sprinted away. 

There is a building of projects across from me. Everytime I walk out there are these druggies lingering right across from me. I'm paranoid they know where I live. 

I'm going for a run and walking through the block to get to the river. I hear a guy say hi and whistling from a car parked on the street, but I didnt see which one it was coming from. 

I was walking to the river another day and a homeless drugged up man started saying hi and walking towards me and when I didnt respond and walked away he screamed IM GONNA GET YOU til I was out of distance. 

I go on the subway.. WITH my boyfriend for the first time in a while. A bunch of city kids get on and start doing a very very loud, screaming, violent type performance. I was triggered and they were stomping back and forth down the train cart. It was so long til the next stop. They kept coming over to us and across from me was the only other white girl on the cart. He puts his fist out for her to pound it. She didnt at first but he didnt move, so she did. Then he comes over to me and puts his fuckin fist out. My bf put his hand in front of me and pounded him for me. He walked away. He did this to the only two white girls on the train, even when I was with my bf. 

I was on a train alone and a bunch of city kids got on and were hanging from the subway handles and started talking shit about white girls and dumb bitches. 

I was walking to my apartment and heard a guysaying, blondie, blondieee behind me. 

I was walking on the river and a city guy passed me and said PUT A SMILE ON. Then I gave him a death stare and he called me a bitch. 

I've been raped by one of these city, drug dealer type guys. I live in this city alone. In my hometown these types of bad people would stalk me and pick on me for some reason. I'm a walking target. I dont feel safe leaving my house to go to the corner store. I'm scared to go on the subway to go ANYWHERE now. I dont have money to uber everywhere. It's so hard cause this could be real danger. It's so triggering and idk what to do. There is no one I know in this city or state. My bf is 2.5 hours away and very busy working full time. I am no contact and estranged from all family members and friends. I have a new therapist but even getting to her office is a fucking long trigger. 

AND WHAT PISSES ME OFF IS THAT.......if you dont respond to these people.. they WILL retaliate. And how fucked up is that? How fucked up is it to go on a subway and have a stranger shove their hand in your face for a ""pound."" And what if she didnt do it? She had no choice but to touch a fucking strangers hand that was invading her personal space, minding her own business on the train. They get mad when they are rejected because they look like idiots, when they are trying to be cool and have game when they do it. Are they trying to scare me on purpose? Are they this stupid? I shouldnt have to deal with this:-( I need a body guard. 

So I think.. I moved here bc I can walk places and the water and views. I used to love it. But I used to live in a nicer, expensive area that I cant afford. Even in those places there is crime.. I lived at my bf's before in the mountains and it was fucking hell. I didnt have a car and there were no stores within 30 min drive and no fun or anything. So I guess I need to settle for something in the middle. What sucks is that I am all alone.. I have no money or support... idk where I'll be at the end of the month.... my bf was supposed to get us a place but he bailed on me.. now I'm on my own. I feel bad getting mad at him for not visiting me, and not seeing him, and needing him just for me to leave my house and stuff.. I dont wanna put it on him but I literally have no one else. It's so hard. But then... I have nothing to loose."

Anyone suffer from multiple traumas.. anyone of which can trigger ptsd,79,adh09r,31,"Hi. So I've suffered trauma in multiple ways. From childhood sexual abuse. Things I saw in my time in the military. A previous relationship and the breakdown of the relationship and the fight to see my children including false accusations. Followed by a failed suicide attempt. My friend drowning before I could get to him. Getting jumped in my own backyard by 6 unknown thugs who attacked me from behind and almost killed me

I.struggle to sleep 6 hours on a good day. Most days I'm lucky to get 4 or 5 hours sleep. Even with meds for sleeping.


What are some of your coping strategies?
I really need some help.

DAE feel dread and anxiety when going to bed?,75,acdzdy,45,Every night when I lay down to go to bed I get this strong sense of dread and fear. My chest gets tight and breathing labored. I dread going to bed as it is knowing the nightmares will permeate my sleep. Does anyone else feel this way?
Mourning the childhood that was robbed from me,78,a870qu,7,"I can’t sleep tonight, all I can do is cry. But maybe that’s okay."
"I'm tired of people using PTSD & triggers as a political insult in this stupid political atmosphere, both SJWs & antifeminists(RANT)",77,5p0pr5,30,"I don't care if some kid on tumblr is obsessed with trigger warnings, I don't care if people asking for content warnings makes you angry. I don't want to hear your fake sympathy, I don't want you to use my disorder as a political prop for your trivial nonsense. 


You morons have no idea what its like. I literally scream in my sleep & wake up in fight or flight mode. I dream about my trauma involuntarily & its like I'm reliving it. I can't watch certain scenes in movies or hear phrases or else I'll feel like i can't breathe. I don't leave my home for weeks because of paranoid fear of my abuser finding me & hurting me. Sometimes I wake up yelling & crying from a bad dream & my best friend has to hold me tightly until the panic subsides. One moment I'm feeling okay but as soon as something triggers a bad memory, I become that scared kid again.

SJWs demand trigger warnings because they mean well but end up infantilizing people like me. Antifeminists pretend to be outraged on behalf of people with PTSD and use my disorder to bash their political opponents. They never ask us how we feel, they never try to find out our real thoughts. The truth is, personally, I don't care. I'm more worried about finding ways to sleep peacefully & avoiding triggers than this nonsense. 

I'm only irritated by your petty bullshit & dragging this disorder of ours into it because you all feel like the authority over how it should be handled. If you don't have the disorder, you have no clue how to help us. Unless you're a therapist or doctor, fuck off. Stop dragging people like me into your bullshit."
I don’t remember my childhood :(,77,m338hu,19,"trigger warning: violence
hello! recently I’ve been very sad on how I don’t remember my childhood. so, I’m kinda still in my childhood, I’m only 15! but, I’ve dealt with generalized anxiety disorder and ocd since I was 7, and trauma since I was 11. my dad is sometimes very violent, and he  does bad things (especially towards my mom). I don’t want to go into details but just know, it isn’t good. throughout my early years (8-12) it was only violence and arguing. I have nightmares and anger/emotional outbursts throughout the day that are hard to deal with (all related to my parents). my therapist says I have “complex trauma” and I cannot remember ages 8-11 at all. its very sad. i feel like I didn’t even have a childhood! I only remember the fights and stuff, but everything else is a blur. is this related to trauma or is it something else? I have struggles with dissociating in grade 5 and 6 so I don’t know if that’s related. how can I get my good memories back? what has worked for any of you guys? please help! I am very sad and I feel like my childhood was wasted :("
I was recently diagnosed with PTSD,76,lsk0e8,41,"Hi there, I was recently diagnosed with ptsd that has been caused by my childhood. My parents are alcoholics, and honestly I never even thought that I had it. I'm still wrapping my brain around it and trying to process it because I had always just chalked it up to just *having a shitty life*. But now I'm starting to understand my triggers, some atleast.
I had just started therapy and im coming to terms that most of my issues are from my mother because I'm basically her emotional punching bag. I have yet to even tell her, I mean, how do you properly tell someone ""hey, because of you I have ptsd"". Like I don't hate her, but she has (and some other people) have definitely messed me up emotionally. She's done some things that I will never forgive her for, if I'm being honest. I'm still angry at all of the things she has put he through, and she will never see what she has done. She's become this very selfish.. victim playing person and it's impossible to (most days) have a conversation with her.
I'm still trying to process this and I hope therapy helps me understand but just coming to terms with this is so.. insane and kinda hurts more than when I just thought I had depression and anxiety. The more I realize the more angry I get, it's frustrating as hell at this point."
I don’t want to do today,75,lgcb4h,5,"I want to be left alone but I also want my life to be different. So I have to do things for my life to be different. But every couple of weeks my life is different because of the memories I get back and the ways I see how I’ve behaved, understood the world, see more time pass and more of the consequences of trauma glaringly obvious. 

I don’t want to do today but I’m not sure if that’s okay. What if it means tmw won’t be different?"
"I can't remember what happened to me. It's almost like I have reactions of nowhere, I can't explain why my triggers are my triggers.",76,knw2a1,20,"All I(19F) know is that something happened to me. I can’t tell exactly what it is, and when I try to remember I feel anxious and end up losing myself. I get cold, I don’t know where I am, my tummy starts to tell me something is not okay, I get confused and I can't process my surroundings. I understand basically nothing. I lose control. 

The only person who saw me when I started to feel bad like that was my T, because unfortunately it happened in front of her once. It was really bad, and I couldn't enter her room for a while. It took me a year to be capable to even say (Actually, I had to draw comics) there was a problem in that day. She didn't force me to talk about it. 

I remember a psychiatrist talking to me about PTSD, but I was 16 and didn't wanna be there. I'm always thinking about how I am a fraud because I can't remember some aspects of what happened and what was done to me. Even though my T told me I’m not faking my reactions, I still doubt that. She told me I just didn't see ready to get into that subject.  

I started to feel triggered recently, and I feel ready and comfortable to talk to my therapist about what happened in that day I ended messed up in front of her. The thing is: I never talked to no one about anything like this. I feel a bit embarrassed because of what happened. One of my biggest fears is feel sick and throw up in front of her. How can something I can't talk or remember do that to my body? Wish I could control. I can't remember, I just feel spaced out. DAE also can't remember something traumatic that happened? Can I be helped?

i think i was raped?,74,jh72re,26,"hello! i just need to get this off my chest as ive never told anyone besides my boyfriend. 

two years ago i was 18 and i met someone on tinder. we talked for a few days, and i agreed to meet up with him, we discussed oral sex so that’s what i was expecting. he told me he didn’t want to have sex. 

i show up to the address he sent me to find it’s an abandoned beach, i didn’t think much of it and just got out of my car and met him on the beach. he encouraged me heavily to smoke his weed, i had only smoked a bit before and i didn’t wanna seem lame or anything so i agreed and smoked a lot. 

he honestly didn’t talk to me much, we mostly just sat in silence for a while i smoked, then all of a sudden he comes up behind me and starts grabbing my chest and ripping my shirt off. i was really caught off guard but i had only had literally just lost my virginity to someone else a month prior so i thought maybe that was normal. 

i was really high at this point so i was kinda just scared and paralyzed as he pulled my pants down and guided me over to a picnic table and sat down, he pulled his pants down and pushed me to my knees. he held my head down as i performed oral sex on him, which honestly wasn’t much of a blowjob it was more of him fucking me in the mouth while i was still in shock. 

after a few minutes of that he picked me up and told me to bend over on the table because he was going to ‘finger me’. i bent over and at first he did finger me a little bit i think, but without warning started fucking me from behind. my memory of the night is really fuzzy as ive mostly blocked it out but im pretty sure i didn’t make a sound the entire time and just laid there until he finished, i was paralyzed. 

this happened a while ago but ive been thinking about it a lot lately. every time i think of that night my throat gets tight and i immediately try to block it out with other thoughts, if i think about it too long I’ll cry. i also have had nightmares many times about the night. i don’t know if that’s ptsd or what but it feels like it might be. i feel like the situation isn’t deserving of being classified as rape because im the one who made the decision to go there alone at night to meet a stranger and im the one who decided to smoke that much and im the one who bent over for him. but at the same time i didn’t consent to actual sex. it’s a really shitty situation but id really appreciate any input :)"
Disassociation and emotional numbness HELP!!,77,j7eoro,38,Has anyone learned any good techniques that have been successful in helping get out of the emotionaly numb or disassociated states? Coping mechanisms? Anything? Thank you in advance ♥
Self-Sabotaging,78,gm41cf,29,"Anyone else experience this? I often subconsciously sabotage the opportunitys I get & it has ruined my life. It got so bad, that I literally wouldn't do my schoolwork throughout  my entire highschool career, because I wanted to fail. Thankfully, I somehow got pushed through, but now as an adult, I'm stuck on welfare because my sabotaging ways have never stopped."
This how I think of my ptsd journey and it helps me and I hope it can help anyone else.,72,fcenym,10,I think of my ptsd journey as a videogame. So far its the toughest I've ever played. I was completely lost. Then I met my guide in the game which is my therapist. They help me navigate this new game. I learn new abilities and skills which are my coping mechanisms. With each new coping mechanism I gain a new piece of armor that helps protect me more. I have my family and close friends as teammates which are the people who help me get through my toughest moments. They help me deal with triggers which I consider bosses. The PTSD is like my sanctuary where I feel safe and welcomed. I appreciate all of you. The community has been so nice to me and very helpful. I hope that someone can see this and it helps. I will eventually beat this game.
Seems like everyone wants to have PTSD these days...,78,dzf9lo,41,"Am I the only one that gets frustrated when people say they have PTSD over things that they don’t have PTSD over? (I.e a coworker joked that she had PTSD over another coworker having brought something smelly for lunch). It just feels so invalidating. Like sure, you can’t eat chicken at work anymore because of your “PTSD” over Sally’s lunch, but I can’t go to the store most days without having a massive panic attack. If my husband touches me a certain way unintentionally I shut down and he can’t bring me back for hours. I have visual and auditory hallucinations during highly stressful things because my brain is processing so much at once, but no your hatred of chicken is the same thing."
Being accused of faking PTSD symptoms,76,dr0tn9,27,Has anyone else experienced this? It’s so hurtful to ask for help and people don’t just to refuse to help but they think you don’t really need it. Or they think they know better than you do how to help you.

Overcoming Dissociation,78,aryx55,31,"This is probably more of a rant, but do you guys ever feel like you’ve completely destroyed your life because you can’t handle stress? Almost every time  anything stressful happens, especially important things like problems dealing with my SO or my daughter, I freeze, dissociate, and ultimately end up making things worse. I’m slowly working on overcoming this, but any of you have good skills or insight that can help out? It’s almost harder now knowing I have PTSD and can feel the dissociation but don’t know how to help myself out of it. "
"Anyone else ever experience moments where everything goes out of focus, and you kinda... freeze, for a minute or more?",76,9rediz,8,"I've been having this weird thing happen for maybe a few years and none of the people I know have any idea what I'm talking about when I describe it, I have a fair few religious (Pagan and associated) people around me and the best they could come up with was ""some kind of meditative trance"", so I was wondering if anyone in here knows what it might be, if it's even a thing...  


So it's like, I'll be sat doing something, playing a game or talking to someone or watching a video, and suddenly everything kinda goes out of focus. I know I should be concentrating on the conversation or the game or whatever, but it's like I've drifted away somewhere for a few beats until I kinda force myself back into... well, myself, I guess. I don't think theres anything that makes it happen, and I definitely don't force it to, it's just like... suddenly I drift away? I don't know, it's so weird. Like I'll just freeze, say I'm in the middle of fighting some enemies on a video game my hands will literally freeze on the keyboard and mouse and everything kinda blurs and I'm self aware, I'll be thinking like ""okay come on get back to the game you need to keep playing why have you stopped you idiot"" but it takes a minute before I can shake it off and get back to actually moving and doing the thing I was doing... Is it anything? Why does it happen? Does anyone else get this? I just want to know what the heck is going on with that like idk... yeah. Sorry if this isn't allowed here, I really don't know where else to go for stuff like this"
I’m embarrassed when people ask what my PTSD dog is for,78,9hvhev,28,"I’m a young girl who has clearly never been in the military and my PTSD is child abuse related. My service dog was a rescue from a shelter and we hired a dog trainer to get him up to certification. He has been extremely helpful especially when I’m out alone and I flash, but when people who are not my close friends ask what he’s for I cringe and say it’s for epilepsy. (Which I know is horrible) I feel like it would be one thing if I was in the military but I wasn’t and it shows. I think one of the big reasons I have a problem was at a rooms to go with a friend and the sales rep was being very nice and following all the rules ie (is that a service dog and what task does he perform) he also never touched him and was being very respectful until later on we were all talking and another sales rep came up and commented on my dog and then the original sales rep said yeah, it’s for PMS. And me being a little confused corrected him (which was not easy to do) and he said “I know I was just making a joke” Idk, I feel like I’m pretty good about making jokes to lighten the mood and I enjoy dark humor but this one really caught me off guard. I can’t just keep lying about what he is for, especially if I actually use him and it’s obvious that’s not what going on, or worse someone thinks I’m having a seizure. Idk what to do."
When the traumas never stop and you never get a respite,75,mgq1w8,22,"What to do when your lifestory is too heavy to unpack? I would love to know if some of you can relate as I feel very alone in this right now.

I lived through all of the big T and little T traumas listed in the DSM-5. Even my birth was traumatic. From day one, I experienced death, violence, self harm of all kind, easting disorder, insecurity, no emotional support, sexual assault. Live threatening illness, chronic pain, sleep disorders, extreme loneliness. Loss of career. Homelesness. Mental and physical disability. Literal torture at the hands of people I trusted. Undiagnosed ADHD didn't help my self esteem.

I knew pretty early one that I needed to work on myself if I didn't want the trauma to bit me in the ass later in life. But with life going its merry way and traumas never stopping, it would always come a time when I needed to push things under the rug so i could focus on life itself. For exemple, I had to stop EMDR because it made my panic attacks and chronic pain so much worst that I couldn't work anymore and I needed the money (to get therapy...).

Every time a chronic trauma stopped, a new one would start. I am 32 years old and I can count on my hands the amount of months they wasn't a big trauma happening in my life. There was always a new thing to heal from while I hadn't fully processed the last one. It is becoming increasingly hard to talk to my therapist about one specific topic and hoping we will see the end of it.

Can you guys relate? I cannot be the only one. Did you find a solution? How do you cope? How do you keep some sort of joy in life?

I was in and out of therapy from my whole life. I took every med under the sun. I do my best, I listen to my doctors. I stay healthy as much as possible, exercice, never did drugs or gor drunk or anything like that. I try to build a support system, a better one that the one imposed to me during my childhood. 

I hope one day, it will be enough."
Shame after episode?,73,m73v5b,9,"Does anyone else ever feel tremendous shame after a dissociation episode? I rarely have the perfect storm of being triggered, going fight instead of flight, and dissociating in the same event and so I’m a little shook. 

Last night I had a rat in my shitty studio apartment, which isn’t the end of the world or directly triggering in of itself, but I dealt with them for two years and that was very stressful and this was the first one since... anyway, I didn’t sleep well because of that, then this morning the construction site outside started with this concrete saw at 7:00am that shook my windows it was so loud, then they added a jackhammer. 

My service dog was upset my the noise and started barking and then she starting alerting me I was having a panic attack and all the noises just snapped me. I just disappeared. 

Turns out I called and screamed at the wrong construction site, armed myself with a self defense tool and went out and screamed at the construction workers until one told me he understood 100% where I was coming from but that he couldn’t do anything about it he was just trying to earn money for his family and I snapped back to conscious of my actions. 

Of course I apologized but I feel terrible every single time this happens, which thankfully isn’t very often anymore, but I just feel so ashamed at not being in control of my self. 

I guess I just wanted to rant and figured you guys would understand. Thanks."
"I had held it well thus far, but the pandemic is making me have PTSD flashbacks and I'm worried now... Advice?",77,jfcoeu,25,"Title sums it up.

I live with one elderly person in a high-contamination zone, so any suggestion of ""go outside, go to parties, go to bars, etc etc etc"" is impossible and that's non-negotiable.

&#x200B;

Lately, I've felt restless, anxious. I keep flashing back to the dreaded day where something really bad happened to me, and it causes me to briefly lose composure: my whole body tenses up, I worry that my family might worry about me so I lock myself up in my room or rush to the shower to conceal my anxiety as well as try to relax through the cold water splashing.

But this is palliative, and doesn't really bring me any peace of mind.

PTSD from healthcare system/ health professionals,73,is8s0e,63,"Hello all,

I am wondering if anyone has experience with/ any suggestions/ resources /articles research for people with complex PTSD from the healthcare system.

* The little information i CAN find is regarding PROVIDERS (not patients) experiencing PTSD from being in healthcare.
* What VERY little I can find re PTSD for patients is from what id call ""bad"" but ""normal"" in the system. Meaning Health professionals did nothing incorrect, but experience is traumatizing. Patients in ICU/burn trauma developing PTSD, near death, challenging recoveries and treatments etc....

**What Im looking for is information re patients who have PTSD secondary to mistreat/abuse/crime committed by health professionals/ health systems.**

I think this adds to the complexity when a patient is traumatized in a health system that they then have to access for treatment for the PTSD/CPTSD.

Im wondering if the reason why there is so little medical research re this specific area is that the same health system responsible for the harm is who would be producing the research.

In my case specifically, I continue to suffer abuse/mistreatment in the health system/by health professionals, but must interact with many health professionals for medical care simultaneously.

Any/all help/suggestions are very appreciated.

Thank you."
Does anyone else find the examples used in this post really frustrating?,73,hcevp8,46,"I came across [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouShouldKnow/comments/hc0tb4/ysk_that_ptsd_is_not_exclusive_to_people_who_have/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) earlier on the YouShouldKnow subreddit and it's been bothering me all day and I just want see other opinions on this.
On one hand, I don't ever want to gatekeep PTSD or invalidate anyone elses trauma, but on the other hand... I don't think PTSD is even remotely comparable to falling off your bike as a kid or getting cheated on?

I don't know. The whole thing is rubbing me the wrong way and I feel like it's already hard enough to get people to take me seriously since there for sure is a real stigma about PTSD being for vets. And now seeing it compared to such banal things just makes me feel like it'll be even harder to get people to take my condition as seriously as it should be. 

Any opinions on this? I just want to know what other folks with PTSD think about this..

Edit: aaaand I just looked back over there and the post seems to have been removed"
I dissociate a lot and I have no idea why,75,hb2pce,15,"Is dissociation supposed to happen randomly, or is it actually being triggered by something I can't identify? It feels terrible, I can't explain it. It's like everything around me feels like an illusion, or like I'm daydreaming, and I suddenly stop feeling like I'm alive, and it can last for hours and it's so annoying and creepy.
I'm sorry, I'm relatively new to this diagnosis. I don't think I even understand myself."
I'm 21+ and I just found out I was molested for years when I was a kid,75,h0sbdu,19,"Life has been such a fucking rollercoaster and now I get thrown with this shit, which kinda makes everything make sense.

I thought I had a normal childhood and that everyone went through the same thing. I was beaten more than I was hugged. Every dining table I was reminded how worthless I am and that I wouldn't amount to anything since I was such a fuck up. 

Physical abuse? Check. Emotional abuse? Yep. 

After spending over a year in therapy after a drug problem to cope with my anxiety attacks so that I could go to class, I finally tore down all the walls that my child psyche built to protect me to reveal the final boss.

That my immediate family member molested me for years and the rest of my family never knew about it.

Sexual abuse? Fantastic, why not throw that in there too!

I've always been so fascinated with psychology, child development, and repression growing up, which completely makes sense now because I was applying it all the time. 

I'm kind of glad that my 5+-year-old self managed to stash it away so well. Growing up without many friends for \~8 years since I was such a violent kid (makes sense why), I had to learn how to behave and act from movies. It just sucked that I had to do it all alone. 

In High School, I somehow ended up being on multiple varsity sports teams, a leader of the student committee, founded my own club, and promoted healthy lifestyles in the community.  I was also blacking out every weekend since 9th grade and would have constant panic attacks alone in my room.

Post-grad I enlisted into the army and became a Lieutenant, an officer rank that I always wanted. Trained a combat unit and managed to guide some people to a better way. After my service term was up, I started attending one of the top #25 universities in America.

In that time, I joined every ""exclusive"" organization there was, bouncing around from group to group. I think I was just trying to find a way to feel like I wasn't alone. I worked with my friends on startups and projects. I've rarely been single since I would switch girlfriends every 2 months due to my intimacy issues (some also just cuz they were abusive and psycho). It got to the point that I can't even remember who I did what with.

People think that I'm some cool dude that has his shit together. But with everything that I've done looking good on paper, I feel like such a fraud. Truth is, I have always felt like the scared 5-year old paralyzed and suffocated in bed by the smell of alcohol and cigarettes. 

When I unrepressed that memory, everything fell apart and shit got worse (it was already pretty bad). I'm still trying my best to keep fighting because I owe it to the ""kid me"" that struggled so hard by himself. To quit now would be disrespecting all that effort ""little me"" put in.

I've been trying to open up about it but it's so hard being sincere with other people when I am so used to not counting on other people. I will probably feel ashamed about posting this but I'll get over it since it's anonymous. 

I'm sick and tired of feeling numb when I'm supposed to feel love. Tired of flinching and panicking when someone strokes my arm the wrong way. Tired of feeling like he was right, that I would never amount to anything and that's all I'd ever be good for.

Thank you for reading if you did, if you didn't I don't blame you."

Discovered that my kids age is a possible trigger?,74,elsf46,22,"I was abused/neglected from birth until 3, when my grandmother adopted me and removed me from my abusive home.

>For LTS, trauma can include an HIV diagnosis at a time when that represented a ""death-sentence;"" a foreshortened sense of survival or even having a future; multiple losses of friends and family members (sometimes entire circles of friends); years of life-threatening illnesses and clinging to survival waiting for the next drug to be released; and rejection by families and friends due to the stigma of HIV/AIDS.

Do weighed blankets actually help with sleep?,71,e7nxz8,39,I have severe ptsd.  Anyone find success while using weighted blankets for help with sleep/falling asleep?
Did anyone else’s ptsd trigger lucid dreams?,74,cpad3h,25,"So, before my ex best friend assaulted me, I’ve only had one lucid dream when I was 12. But now almost every single night I am very aware that I am dreaming. Has anyone else experienced this? I figured it’s my brain not trusting itself so I have to control my dreams, but it’s an odd thing I’ve never seen brought up."
Validation is a weird feeling.,77,c6pz31,6,"After decades of ""its just anxiety and depression"", ""you have a good life"", ""every teenager feels like this"", ""you're just hormonal"", and my personal favorite... ""it's not like you ever saw combat...""

I finally was told, yes, my trauma is real. Yes, my reaction is perfectly normal considering the circumstances. He didn't give me some BS guarantee that I'll be normal or offer me essential oils. This dude actually cares about helping me rewire my brain and relearn how to deal with triggers and the like. He did guarantee that I'll feel worse before I'll feel better and this process is going to be work.

I've been lurking here for a bit now, and am just so grateful to see that I'm not alone. To know that there is a community of people that understand... Y'all are a lifeline I didn't know I needed."
shoutout to anyone who struggled with new year fireworks,76,acaaeu,14,"Obviously, veterans are vulnerable to the fireworks, and I really wish more people would realize that. I literally live in a military town and the fireworks are nonstop. But personally, my neighbor shot himself this month and it really got to me. The fireworks have made me think about it a lot these past few days, and I've felt awful for his wife. Worse than the fireworks are the obnoxious amount of celebratory gunshots. Every time I hear one nearby, I think, ""hm, I wonder if that's what it sounded like when he did it. Why didn't I hear it?"" So, to the vets and anyone with trauma similar to mine, sorry about the fireworks and I hope you're doing okay. "
Surviving Christmas with PTSD,78,a8usqa,34,"Does anyone else find it hard to spend time around the family - which you kind of have to do at Christmas? I have mostly learnt to cope with my ptsd through treatment and a lot of self care but I still find myself struggling at Christmas more than normal. Little bit of background - my family doesn’t really believe i could have had ptsd because in their eyes that’s reserved for veterans and refugees. I think they partly struggle to acknowledge my trauma because if they did, it would mean that they could have done more. I’ve learnt to cope with that mostly - after all, we can still enjoy spending time together as long as we stay clear of these topics. But around Christmas I really find myself stuck with difficult emotions, occasional nightmares and reminders that are probably worsened by me not being able to speak to them. Then there is also that pressure of having to be ok at Christmas. I also feel that really I’m stronger for having survived all of this and that this is part of my story but I feel like I can’t share this part of me because they’d see it as a weakness or attention seeking thing.

I’ve found that the best thing to do is try to take them in small doses and make excuses to get a break by taking the dog out. Confession - i have also lied that i have to return to work 3 days earlier than I do (planning to spend those back at my own place with Netflix, chocolate and pizza). What have people noticed helps them?"
"As a sub, could we consider using less-detailed post titles to reduce triggers?",76,a692rw,27,"Hi everyone. Lurker and spotty with comments, first-time poster. 

I would like to ask the opinions of those who use this sub and have PTSD. I know that we post trigger-warnings in titles, flairs, and before posts, but I personally believe that there is still one more step we can take as a sub to reduce people being exposed to trauma they are not emotionally able to bear at the moment. It involves the titles of posts.

I would like to suggest that we keep post titles regarding specific trauma slightly more vague. I am not trying to censor anyone and I am not trying to push my own agenda onto anyone else. I think it's fine to use terms like ""sexual assault,"" ""child abuse,"" etc. But titles that lay out a specific traumatic event seem a little too much, at least to me. 

Yesterday there was a post that was particularly disturbing (at least to me). I didn't even read the post because the title alone sent me into a meltdown. I am not judging that person - I feel horrible for them and what they experienced. And I also know the person has not been officially diagnosed with PTSD so they are probably unaware of how sharing details of trauma to those who are vulnerable and not prepared can still strongly affect people. 

I find a lot of comfort and support in reading posts that I can choose to engage with based on the title. I purposely avoid NSFW or certain TW posts. But that title yesterday... there was nothing to prepare me for that. Again, assigning no blame. Just asking if others agree.

What does everyone think? If you disagree, I understand. Just want to see if any of my feelings on this matter are felt by anyone else. 

Take care of yourselves, and I wish you all inner peace on our journeys to wellness."
My last trauma therapy session is tomorrow,74,a1jqsp,21,"I am a gay trans man, and I was stalked, violently disowned, humiliated, and threatened by my abusive family in July because of my sexuality and gender. I escaped back to my chosen hometown and immediately looked for sliding scale trauma therapy through a well-known LGBT+ center in my city. They have these amazing grants for LGBT+ folks who experience violent trauma where it pays for 12 free counseling sessions with a certified trauma therapist, and after the 12 weeks, they reassess your needs and determine if you need more free sessions or if you can be referred to another regular therapist who has sliding scale payment plans. 

This program legit saved my life. I was so messed up that I couldn’t stay awake for more than 4 or 5 hours a day, I wasn’t eating or showering, and I think the first month was just one long anxiety/panic attack marathon. My therapist has taught me so much about how to think about myself and the world and what happened, and even though it will be extremely difficult, I feel like I can start my life over and actually *live* it.

I am nervous and scared about ending my sessions with her because it’s become sort of a crutch, and maybe having that regular schedule has been another great thing to rely on, but I think it will be ok overall.

It has been four months now. It feels like it has been longer than that. It feels like it’s been years and years. I don’t really remember what their faces look like anymore. A lot of the memories from that night are gone or buried. My memory loss that I was experiencing is starting to dissipate (I can remember conversations and numbers and information now). I finally got a job and have been handling the stress of that rather well. I’m even making new friends there! I’ve started to try out standup comedy, which has been a healthy coping technique.

I still cry sometimes. I still feel hollow and sad sometimes. But I don’t think that will ever go away, and maybe it shouldn’t. Someday I’ll forgive them and finally forget them altogether. 

I have lost so much this year. I lost my grandmother and my whole biological family. I lost a sense of security. I lost most of my ability to trust. I lost 25 and a half years to abuse and bigotry and internalized hatred.

But I have gained so much, too. I have been on hormones for almost nine months and now my voice sounds like I’ve always wanted it to sound, I am growing the beard I’ve always wanted, people see me the way I see myself. My new name sounds like music. My sexuality finally makes sense. My friends are made of the most precious gold. I love my city and my pets and myself. And even though I lost 25 years to abuse, now I have maybe another 50 years of freedom, self-confidence, and adventure ahead of me.  My ptsd still follows me wherever I go, but now I know how to navigate through it."
Calling anyone in Northern Va,73,9z9e0f,6,"If anyone needs a place to go for Thanksgiving dinner, you are welcome to stop by my house. Hope you dont mind 3 little red head boys, 2 large bunnies and 3 cats. No one should be alone on Thanksgiving. Just send me a message.    "
Wish me luck,74,9xfbjk,11,"Tonight I go to an open mic tonight and it’s likely the guy who sexually assaulted me will be there.  I wanted to go anyway because it’s my favorite open mic place and I don’t want him to have any bearing on what I do and don’t do.

Please send me good vibes! And don’t worry, I have a support system in place."
Do you guys 'hold on' all the time too?,75,99nqzh,42,"I find myself trying to hold myself together since my trauma. Im not always aware I do it until I unclench my jaw for instance, and its a bit sore from clenching.

I feel like Im always tense. Im constantly tightening up. I actually have a free appt with a masseusse from benefits, but Im a bit too nervous to go."
Anyone else feel angry constantly?,78,8wkq5j,12,"I'm 24, diagnosed with PTSD and I came to the realization that I'm just... So angry at people. I feel like my response to people who are a threat to me in any way (from mild jerks at work to my abusive parents to legitimate threats to my physical being), I feel like most of the time the only course of action that will work is either physical violence, or flinging the sharpest insults I can muster. 

Now, bear in mind that I have never assaulted anyone, but I often find myself contemplating the predatory nature of abusers and people who make their way through life stepping on the vulnerable and I just... I think Im stuck in this thinking error that violence is the only language people will understand? And even that is incredibly odd because when I actually do have a confrontation, I most commonly just freeze up and can't respond, period?

Does anyone else struggle with feeling like they have to jump straight into hostility when challenged, but they also struggle with that cold freeze?"
Update: I don't freak out in the shower anymore. (Here's how I fixed it!),76,75k3cs,15,"So about a week ago I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ptsd/comments/73ttl1/i_hate_not_being_able_to_shower_alone_dont_act/) ranting about my boyfriend saying he'd sit with me while I showered and than not showing up. It was poorly written and made me sound co-dependent and like I never showered. I showered, I just did it quick and went way too long without shaving and doing hair treatments. So I'll give you the TL;DR: Father molested me while mom was in the shower. My room borders the bathroom. My brain forever associated the sound of that shower with being molested. We still live in the same house and *had* the same shower. (Dad is gone. I'm safe. PTSD just won't let me grasp that concept.) 

Anyways, thanks to everyone in this sub and some [plumbing advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/comments/74vzn4/old_shower_head_stuck_on_pipe/) from that subreddit I changed the shower head! I picked out a ""fancy"" ($25 on Amazon lol) one with a detachable handle. 

I also, as suggested on this sub, got a shower curtain that I could see out of and a waterproof speaker so I could listen to music. 

Guys. 

This. 

Is. 

Amazing. 

Thank you!! 

I'm still a little uneasy but I didn't have a panic attack! I'll take it! "
Mourning the person I was before PTSD,77,6b4ihs,53,"I miss my old self. I miss who I was before PTSD destroyed my sense of self, my confidence and my self-esteem.

I know it's maladaptive to constantly ruminate and wish I could go back to being that person but I can't help it. I've tried. 

I've tried getting back into old hobbies only to find I don't have the motivation. I've tried reinventing myself only to find I don't know what I want to do.

Does anyone else experience this? Wishing so hard that you could just reverse time or somehow be the person you used to be?"
Easily triggered after discovering PTSD?,74,l2qsig,18,"For a long time ive been surfing through information about ADHD, Bipolar, etc. and there was a ton i connected with but it didnt really sum up everything. Until I read PTSD, it was something I was avoiding for so long. “My trauma wasnt that serious, leave it in the past, etc” - but there are parts in my memory i cant remember and are too painful to even attempt to talk about a lot of the time. 

After I discovered this reddit, i realized I connected A LOT. So much so, i shake reading some of these posts... i feel my heart racing uncomfortably whenever i think about anything slightly related to these topics. I want to bring this up to a doctor or the councelor but Im scared of being diminished or invalidated. Any tips when talking about the trauma is very painful? I have been looking for a diagnosis to explain everything i have been feeling, but i often get ignored. It took me years to get someone to take my allergies seriously and i almost ended up in the emergency because of that, it becomes really discouraging"
